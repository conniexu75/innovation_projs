We compared the airway microbiota at three levels in adult patients with asthma, the related condition of COPD, and controls. We also studied bronchial lavage from asthmatic children and controls.We identified 5,054 16S rRNA bacterial sequences from 43 subjects, detecting >70% of species present. The bronchial tree was not sterile, and contained a mean of 2,000 bacterial genomes per cm(2) surface sampled. Pathogenic Proteobacteria, particularly Haemophilus spp., were much more frequent in bronchi of adult asthmatics or patients with COPD than controls. We found similar highly significant increases in Proteobacteria in asthmatic children. Conversely, Bacteroidetes, particularly Prevotella spp., were more frequent in controls than adult or child asthmatics or COPD patients.The results show the bronchial tree to contain a characteristic microbiota, and suggest that this microbiota is disturbed in asthmatic airways."
https://openalex.org/W2171261585,"Background Exosomes, derived from endocytic membrane vesicles are thought to participate in cell-cell communication and protein and RNA delivery. They are ubiquitous in most body fluids (breast milk, saliva, blood, urine, malignant ascites, amniotic, bronchoalveolar lavage, and synovial fluids). In particular, exosomes secreted in human saliva contain proteins and nucleic acids that could be exploited for diagnostic purposes. To investigate this potential use, we isolated exosomes from human saliva and characterized their structural and transcriptome contents. Methodology Exosomes were purified by differential ultracentrifugation and identified by immunoelectron microscopy (EM), flow cytometry, and Western blot with CD63 and Alix antibodies. We then described the morphology, shape, size distribution, and density using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Microarray analysis revealed that 509 mRNA core transcripts are relatively stable and present in the exosomes. Exosomal mRNA stability was determined by detergent lysis with RNase A treatment. In vitro, fluorescently labeled saliva exosomes could communicate with human keratinocytes, transferring their genetic information to human oral keratinocytes to alter gene expression at a new location. Conclusion Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that exosomes shuttle RNA between cells and that the RNAs present in the exosomes may be a possible resource for disease diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2007974392,"Background Behavioral stress is recognized as a main risk factor for neuropsychiatric diseases. Converging evidence suggested that acute stress is associated with increase of excitatory transmission in certain forebrain areas. Aim of this work was to investigate the mechanism whereby acute stress increases glutamate release, and if therapeutic drugs prevent the effect of stress on glutamate release. Methodology/Findings Rats were chronically treated with vehicle or drugs employed for therapy of mood/anxiety disorders (fluoxetine, desipramine, venlafaxine, agomelatine) and then subjected to unpredictable footshock stress. Acute stress induced marked increase in depolarization-evoked release of glutamate from synaptosomes of prefrontal/frontal cortex in superfusion, and the chronic drug treatments prevented the increase of glutamate release. Stress induced rapid increase in the circulating levels of corticosterone in all rats (both vehicle- and drug-treated), and glutamate release increase was blocked by previous administration of selective antagonist of glucocorticoid receptor (RU 486). On the molecular level, stress induced accumulation of presynaptic SNARE complexes in synaptic membranes (both in vehicle- and drug-treated rats). Patch-clamp recordings of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex revealed that stress increased glutamatergic transmission through both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, and that antidepressants may normalize it by reducing release probability. Conclusions/Significance Acute footshock stress up-regulated depolarization-evoked release of glutamate from synaptosomes of prefrontal/frontal cortex. Stress-induced increase of glutamate release was dependent on stimulation of glucocorticoid receptor by corticosterone. Because all drugs employed did not block either elevation of corticosterone or accumulation of SNARE complexes, the dampening action of the drugs on glutamate release must be downstream of these processes. This novel effect of antidepressants on the response to stress, shown here for the first time, could be related to the therapeutic action of these drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2109798971,"Background The gastrointestinal tract microbiota (GTM) of mammals is a complex microbial consortium, the composition and activities of which influences mucosal development, immunity, nutrition and drug metabolism. It remains unclear whether the composition of the dominant GTM is conserved within animals of the same strain and whether stable GTMs are selected for by host-specific factors or dictated by environmental variables. Methodology/Principal Findings The GTM composition of six highly inbred, genetically distinct strains of mouse (C3H, C57, GFEC, CD1, CBA nu/nu and SCID) was profiled using eubacterial –specific PCR-DGGE and quantitative PCR of feces. Animals exhibited strain-specific fecal eubacterial profiles that were highly stable (c. >95% concordance over 26 months for C57). Analyses of mice that had been relocated before and after maturity indicated marked, reproducible changes in fecal consortia and that occurred only in young animals. Implantation of a female BDF1 mouse with genetically distinct (C57 and Agoutie) embryos produced highly similar GTM profiles (c. 95% concordance) between mother and offspring, regardless of offspring strain, which was also reflected in urinary metabolite profiles. Marked institution-specific GTM profiles were apparent in C3H mice raised in two different research institutions. Conclusion/Significance Strain-specific data were suggestive of genetic determination of the composition and activities of intestinal symbiotic consortia. However, relocation studies and uterine implantation demonstrated the dominance of environmental influences on the GTM. This was manifested in large variations between isogenic adult mice reared in different research institutions."
https://openalex.org/W2109623513,"Antimicrobial peptides play an important role in host defense against pathogens. Recently, phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) from Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) were shown to interact with lipid membranes, form complexes, and exert antimicrobial activity. Based on the abundance and innocuity of the cutaneous resident S. epidermidis, we hypothesized that their PSMs contribute to host defense. Here we show that S. epidermidis δ-toxin (PSMγ) is normally present in the epidermis and sparsely in the dermis of human skin using immunohistochemistry. Synthetic δ-toxin interacted with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and colocalized with cathelicidin while also inducing NET formation in human neutrophils. In antimicrobial assays against Group A Streptococcus (GAS), δ-toxin cooperated with CRAMP, hBD2, and hBD3. In whole blood, addition of δ-toxin exerted a bacteriostatic effect on GAS, and in NETs, δ-toxin increased their killing capacity against this pathogen. Coimmunoprecipitation and tryptophan spectroscopy demonstrated direct binding of δ-toxin to host antimicrobial peptides LL-37, CRAMP, hBD2, and hBD3. Finally, in a mouse wound model, GAS survival was reduced (along with Mip-2 cytokine levels) when the wounds were pretreated with δ-toxin. Thus, these data suggest that S. epidermidis–derived δ-toxin cooperates with the host-derived antimicrobial peptides in the innate immune system to reduce survival of an important human bacterial pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1981183620,"Stress is a complex human experience and having both rewarding and aversive motivational properties. The adverse effects of stress are well documented, yet many of underlying mechanisms remain unclear and controversial. Here we report that the anxiogenic properties of stress are encoded by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin acting in the basolateral amygdala. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that the anxiogenic-like effects of Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF) were triggered by CRF1-R activation of the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system. Central CRF administration significantly reduced the percent open-arm time in the elevated plus maze (EPM). The reduction in open-arm time was blocked by pretreatment with the KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (norBNI), and was not evident in mice lacking the endogenous KOR ligand dynorphin. The CRF1-R agonist stressin 1 also significantly reduced open-arm time in the EPM, and this decrease was blocked by norBNI. In contrast, the selective CRF2-R agonist urocortin III did not affect open arm time, and mice lacking CRF2-R still showed an increase in anxiety-like behavior in response to CRF injection. However, CRF2-R knockout animals did not develop CRF conditioned place aversion, suggesting that CRF1-R activation may mediate anxiety and CRF2-R may encode aversion. Using a phosphoselective antibody (KORp) to identify sites of dynorphin action, we found that CRF increased KORp-immunoreactivity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of wildtype, but not in mice pretreated with the selective CRF1-R antagonist, antalarmin. Consistent with the concept that acute stress or CRF injection-induced anxiety was mediated by dynorphin release in the BLA, local injection of norBNI blocked the stress or CRF-induced increase in anxiety-like behavior; whereas norBNI injection in a nearby thalamic nucleus did not. The intersection of stress-induced CRF and the dynorphin/KOR system in the BLA was surprising, and these results suggest that CRF and dynorphin/KOR systems may coordinate stress-induced anxiety behaviors and aversive behaviors via different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2059709509,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) represent an optimal tool for studies and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. We recently established a v-myc immortalized human NSC (IhNSC) line, which retains stem properties comparable to parental cells. Oxygen concentration is one of the most crucial environmental conditions for cell proliferation and differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In the central nervous system, physiological concentrations of oxygen range from 0.55 to 8% oxygen. In particular, in the in the subventricular zone niche area, it's estimated to be 2.5 to 3%.We investigated in vitro the effects of 1, 2.5, 5, and 20% oxygen concentrations on IhNSCs both during proliferation and differentiation. The highest proliferation rate, evaluated through neurosphere formation assay, was obtained at 2.5 and 5% oxygen, while 1% oxygen was most noxious for cell survival. The differentiation assays showed that the percentages of beta-tubIII+ or MAP2+ neuronal cells and of GalC+ oligodendrocytes were significantly higher at 2.5% compared with 1, 5, or 20% oxygen at 17 days in vitro. Mild hypoxia (2.5 to 5% oxygen) promoted differentiation into neuro-oligodendroglial progenitors as revealed by the higher percentage of MAP2+/Ki67+ and GalC+/Ki67+ residual proliferating progenitors, and enhanced the yield of GABAergic and slightly of glutamatergic neurons compared to 1% and 20% oxygen where a significant percentage of GFAP+/nestin+ cells were still present at 17 days of differentiation.These findings raise the possibility that reduced oxygen levels occurring in neuronal disorders like cerebral ischemia transiently lead to NSC remaining in a state of quiescence. Conversely, mild hypoxia favors NSC proliferation and neuronal and oligodendroglial differentiation, thus providing an important advance and a useful tool for NSC-mediated therapy of ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1991512318,"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors contain at least one allosteric site that is topographically distinct from the acetylcholine, orthosteric binding site. Although studies have investigated the basis of allosteric modulation at these receptors, less is known about putative allosteric ligands that activate the receptor in their own right. We generated M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mutations in either the orthosteric site in transmembrane helices 3 and 6 (TM3 and -6) or part of an allosteric site involving the top of TM2, the second extracellular (E2) loop, and the top of TM7 and investigated their effects on the binding and function of the novel selective (putative allosteric) agonists (AC-42 (4-n-butyl-1-(4-(2-methylphenyl)-4-oxo-1-butyl)piperidine HCl), 77-LH-28-1 (1-(3-(4-butyl-1-piperidinyl)propyl)-3,3-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone), and N-desmethylclozapine) as well as the bitopic orthosteric/allosteric ligand, McN-A-343 (4-(m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium). Four classes of agonists were identified, depending on their response to the mutations, suggesting multiple, distinct modes of agonist-receptor interaction. Interestingly, with the exception of 77-LH-28-1, allosteric site mutations had no effect on the affinity of any of the agonists tested, but some mutations in the E2 loop influenced the efficacy of both orthosteric and novel selective agonists, highlighting a role for this region of the receptor in modulating activation status. Two point mutations (Y1043.33A (Ballesteros and Weinstein numbers in superscript) in the orthosteric and Y177A in the allosteric site) unmasked ligand-selective and signaling pathway-selective effects, providing evidence for the existence of pathway-specific receptor conformations.

These receptors are also potential therapeutic targets for a diverse range of pathologies, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, bladder dysfunction, and irritable bowel syndrome (1.Eglen R.M. Choppin A. Watson N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 409-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2.Wess J. Eglen R.M. Gautam D. Nat. Rev. Drug Discover. 2007; 6: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the development of highly efficacious mAChR therapeutic agents with acceptable side effect profiles has remained largely elusive. This is most likely due to the fact that all current mAChR-based therapeutics target the ACh-binding (orthosteric site), which is predominantly made up of highly conserved residues within the top third of the transmembrane (TM) domains (3.Blüml K.

One way to overcome this lack of selectivity at the mAChRs is to target allosteric sites, which are topographically distinct and generally consist of regions that show greater sequence divergence among receptor subtypes relative to residues comprising the orthosteric pocket (10.Ellis J.

Some of the earliest examples of mAChR allosteric modulators are exemplified by a series of neuromuscular blockers and bis-onium compounds, which either inhibit or enhance orthosteric ligand affinity, depending on the combination of ligands present and the receptor subtype (20.Lüllmann H.

Tränkle C. Sadée W. Mohr K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), these prototypical mAChR modulators are often inactive in the absence of orthosteric ligand and mechanistically described by a simple allosteric ternary complex model (26.Lazareno S.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 962-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).More recently, it has become evident that there is a second class of allosteric ligand, collectively referred to as “allosteric agonists,” that are able to engender receptor activation in their own right (30.Langmead C.J. Christopoulos A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 475-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 31.Gregory K.J. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A. Curr. Neuropharmacol. 2007; 5: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); many such agonists are emerging from drug discovery programs, suggesting that their prevalence is likely to increase in the coming years. However, the term “allosteric agonist” has been broadly used to encompass a number of different possible receptor activation mechanisms. For example, a “pure” allosteric agonist would be a ligand that mediates both receptor activation and modulation of the orthosteric site via interaction with a topographically distinct allosteric binding site; the compound LY2033298, acting at the M4 mAChR, is one such ligand (32.Nawaratne V. Leach K. Suratman N. Loiacono R.E. Felder C.C. Armbruster B.N. Roth B.L. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A. Mol.

(2010) Neuropsychopharmacology, in pressGoogle Scholar). Another variation is if the ligand can recognize both orthosteric and allosteric sites to engender agonism via the former site and modulation via the latter (34.Valant C. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A. Mol. Interv. 2009; 9: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interaction between the two sites with such ligands can conceivably occur concomitantly, as recently demonstrated for the bitopic orthosteric/allosteric ligand McN-A-343 (35.Valant C.

Chem. 2008; 283: 29312-29321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and novel hybrid oxotremorine-bis(ammonio)alkane compounds (36.Antony J. Kellershohn K. Mohr-Andrä M. Kebig A. Prilla S. Muth M. Heller E. Disingrini T. Dallanoce C. Bertoni S. Schrobang J. Tränkle C. Kostenis E. Christopoulos A. Höltje H.D. Barocelli E. De Amici M. Holzgrabe U. Mohr K. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), or via interchange between two distinct binding modes (orthosteric versus allosteric), as may be the case for small molecule modulators of the ghrelin receptor (37.Holst B. Frimurer T.M. Mokrosinski J. Halkjaer T. Cullberg K.B. Underwood C.R. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 44-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Given these diverse modes of allosteric agonist-receptor interaction, the structure-function relationships that underlie them and/or their functional consequences are likely to vary compared with those of classic orthosteric agonists. Of particular interest is whether or not allosteric agonists have a higher propensity than orthosteric agonists to engender functional selectivity (i.e. to promote unique conformational states of the receptor that activate specific subsets of the total complement of pathways available to that receptor in a given cell type) (38.Urban J.D. Clarke W.P. von Zastrow M. Nichols D.E. Kobilka B. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Roth B.L. Christopoulos A. Sexton P.M. Miller K.J. Spedding M. Mailman R.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar).Recent drug discovery efforts have identified a number of novel mAChR agonists with high functional selectivity that may be due to an allosteric component to their actions. Examples of such novel selective agonists include AC-42, 77-LH-28-1, NDMC, and 1-(1′-2-methylbenzyl)-1,4′-bipiperidin-4-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-2(3H)-one (19.May L.T. Avlani V.A. Langmead C.J.

In all instances, these compounds display the highest functional efficacy at the M1 mAChR subtype, but they are able to bind to all mAChR subtypes with similar affinities.

Furthermore, these studies have examined regions of the receptor predominantly associated with the orthosteric binding pocket. Thus, the aim of the current study was to introduce selected mutations into either the orthosteric site or the prototypical allosteric binding site on the M2 mAChR (Fig. 1) and determine the consequences of these mutations on the binding and signaling properties of a number of novel selective agonists in comparison with the effects of the mutations on orthosteric ligands. By applying an operational model of agonism to the analysis of the data (45.Black J.W. Leff P. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 220: 141-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), we have also been able to differentiate mutational effects on ligand affinity from effects on ligand signaling efficacy and have identified mutations in both orthosteric and allosteric pockets that selectively affect coupling to the ERK1/2 pathway. Collectively, we have identified modes of interaction that are probably shared by more than one mAChR subtype as well as differences that may contribute to the observed functional selectivity of these novel agonists.DISCUSSIONThis is the first study to simultaneously probe the effects of key mutations in the conserved orthosteric site and extracellular allosteric binding site on the binding and signaling of both orthosteric and novel selective (putative allosteric) agonists at the M2 mAChR. We have identified four broad classes of agonist, which indicates multiple modes of agonist-receptor engagement. Moreover, we have identified two amino acid residues likely to contribute to ERK1/2-specific functional selectivity: Y1043.33A in the orthosteric site, which selectively abolished signaling to the ERK1/2 pathway while retaining the ability to activate G proteins and mediate intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and Y177A in the allosteric site, which selectively enhanced signaling of the bitopic ligand, McN-A-343 to the ERK1/2 pathway.Distinct Patterns of Agonist Response to Orthosteric Site MutationsWith one recent exception (19.May L.T.

Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), detailed structure-function studies of novel selective mAChR agonists have centered on the M1 mAChR and predominantly focused on residues within the orthosteric pocket (39.Spalding T.A. Trotter C. Skjaerbaek N. Messier T.L. Currier E.A. Burstein E.S. Li D. Hacksell U. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 40.Spalding T.A. Ma J.N.

Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 75: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mutational data in our current study now reveal four agonist classes at the M2 mAChR with respect to their patterns of response to mutation, the first of which is exemplified by prototypical orthosteric agonists, such as ACh, arecoline, CCh, and pilocarpine, and responds predictably with a reduction in affinity and/or signaling efficacy upon mutation of key orthosteric site residues, particularly Ala substitution of Tyr-1043.33 and Tyr-4036.51. The second ligand class is exemplified by AC-42 and 77-LH-28-1, which demonstrated a dramatic increase in binding affinity and signaling efficacy at the W993.28A mutant M2 mAChR and also gained efficacy for activating G proteins at the Y1043.33A and Y4036.51A mutants. NDMC and McN-A-343 probably represent a third and fourth class, respectively, with the former agent selectively displaying a sensitivity to alanine substitution of Leu-1003.29 and a gain in efficacy at Y4036.51A, whereas the latter ligand shows essentially unaltered affinity at all mutant receptors (with the exception of the key D1033.32A substitution, where neither binding nor function was quantifiable).Our results at the M2 mAChR are in general agreement with recent findings made for some of the novel selective agonists at the M1 mAChR (40.Spalding T.A. Ma J.N. Ott T.R. Friberg M. Bajpai A. Bradley S.R. Davis R.E. Brann M.R. Burstein E.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 44.Lebon G. Langmead C.J. Tehan B.G. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 75: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which is not surprising given that the studies all focused on orthosteric site residues conserved across subtypes. However, our study has also identified differences in ligand behavior at certain equivalent mutations between subtypes. For instance, mutation of Y2.61A at the M1 mAChR did not affect 77-LH-28-1 affinity (44.Lebon G. Langmead C.J. Tehan B.G. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 75: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas we noted a significant enhancement in affinity at the M2 mAChR for the same agonist. Furthermore, mutation of W3.28A had a significant inhibitory effect on the affinity of NDMC for the M1 mAChR (44.Lebon G. Langmead C.J. Tehan B.G. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 75: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but no effect at the M2 mAChR in our study. These differences are likely to reflect the different interactions the compounds make with the receptors and may contribute in part to the functional selectivity that has been reported for the agonists for the M1 relative to the M2 mAChR (39.Spalding T.A. Trotter C. Skjaerbaek N. Messier T.L. Currier E.A. Burstein E.S. Li D. Hacksell U. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 65.Langmead C.J.

Indeed, our molecular modeling (Fig. 10) suggests a different binding pose for 77-LH-28-1 at the M2 mAChR compared with that presented by Lebon et al. (44.Lebon G. Langmead C.J. Tehan B.G. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 75: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for the M1 mAChR.Novel Selective Agonists Are Unlikely to be Interacting Predominantly with the Prototypical M2 mAChR Allosteric SiteMutation of residues within the allosteric site previously shown to decrease the affinity of prototypical allosteric modulators, such as W84, C7/3-phth, and gallamine (11.Leppik R.A.

Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), had no effect on the affinity of any of the agonists examined in the current study, with the intriguing exception of 77-LH-28-1, which showed an increased affinity when the charged Glu-172/Asp-173/Gly-174/Glu-175 (EDGE) sequence in the E2 loop was mutated to Gln/Asn/Gly/Gln. This finding was also noteworthy given that the structurally related AC-42 did not display a change in affinity when tested at the same mutation. The implications of these findings are 2-fold. First, it is likely that there are no substantial direct interactions between any of the novel selective agonists and the prototypical allosteric site residues mutated in the current study; the selective effect on 77-LH-28-1 of neutralizing the charged E2 loop EDGE sequence probably reflects a complex indirect conformational effect that cannot be modeled due to the current lack of high resolution data on the extracellular loop regions of the mAChRs. Second, despite high structural similarity, the differences noted for 77-LH-28-1 and AC-42 suggest that the presence or absence of an aliphatic ring region can have a profound effect on the engagement of this class of agonist with the receptor.Allosteric, Orthosteric, or Bitopic Agonism?Throughout this study, we have described AC-42, 77-LH-28-1, and NDMC as novel selective agonists and/or “putative” allosteric agonists. The former category is descriptive, whereas the latter indicates the current uncertainty whether these ligands exert their agonism purely via an allosteric site or whether they activate the receptor predominantly via orthosteric site residues while also being able to recognize an allosteric site with a different affinity. To date, the evidence that these agents can interact allosterically with the mAChRs is based largely on their ability to allosterically retard the dissociation rate of the orthosteric antagonist, [3H]N-methylscopolamine, from M1 or M2 mAChRs (19.May L.T.

A limitation of radioligand dissociation rate studies is that they monitor interactions on a receptor that has been pre-equilibrated with orthosteric ligand; these experiments can reveal that a ligand may adopt an allosteric binding mode if the orthosteric site is already occupied, but they cannot be used alone to conclude that an agonist binds allosterically to activate the unoccupied receptor. With respect to the interpretation of mutagenesis studies, a differential sensitivity to specific mutations can certainly be indicative of a different mode of binding, as also described herein, but may not necessarily be proof of interaction with an entirely topographically distinct region from the orthosteric site.As outlined above, it is unlikely that the novel selective agonists are interacting solely with key residues of the prototypical extracellular allosteric site on the M2 mAChR. However, an alternative possibility is that the ligands may be bitopic, in that they recognize epitopes within both the orthosteric site and part of the allosteric site. We have recently proposed this as the mechanism of action for McN-A-343 at the M2 mAChR (35.Valant C. Gregory K.J. Hall N.E. Scammells P.J. Lew M.J. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A. J. Biol.

The molecular models shown in Fig. 10 for 77-LH-28-1 and NDMC indicate that these agonists can sit higher up in the binding cavity of the M2 mAChR than prototypical orthosteric agonists, thus having the potential to interact with either the orthosteric or an allosteric site.New Insights into mAChR Functional SelectivityIn contrast to their effects on binding affinity, allosteric site mutations in the E2 loop and the top of TM7 differentially affected the efficacy of orthosteric agonists as well as that of the novel selective agonists, implicating these regions of the receptor in the adoption of active states. Interestingly, we have found that the single point mutation of Y177A in the E2 loop generated a pathway-selective (ERK1/2) efficacy increase for McN-A-343. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence of the"

MASP-1 and MASP-3 (MASP1 isoforms 1 and 2, respectively) are splice variants of the MASP1 gene, whereas MASP-2 and sMAP are splice variants of the MASP2 gene. We have identified a novel serum protein of 45 kDa that is associated with MBL and the ficolins. This protein is named MBL/ficolin-associated protein 1 (MAP-1 corresponding to MASP1 isoform 3). The transcript generating MAP-1 (MASP1_v3) contains exons 1–8 and a novel exon encoding an in-frame stop codon. The corresponding protein lacks the serine protease domains but contains most of the common heavy chain of MASP-1 and MASP-3. Additionally MAP-1 contains 17 unique C-terminal amino acids. By use of quantitative PCR and MAP-1-specific immunohistochemistry, we found that MAP-1 is highly expressed in myocardial and skeletal muscle tissues as well as in liver hepatocytes with a different expression profile than that observed for MASP-1 and MASP-3. MAP-1 co-precipitated from human serum with MBL, ficolin-2, and ficolin-3, and recombinant MAP-1 was able to inhibit complement C4 deposition via both the ficolin-3 and MBL pathway. In conclusion we have identified a novel 45-kDa serum protein derived from the MASP1 gene, which is highly expressed in striated muscle tissues.

Activation of the complement system is accomplished via three different initiation pathways: the alternative pathway, the classical pathway, and the lectin pathway (1.Walport M.J. N. Engl. J.

MBL and the ficolins bind structures on different classes of microorganisms and are involved in sequestration and removal of dying host cells (2.Endo Y. Matsushita M. Fujita T.

Present consensus places MASP-2 as the main initiator of the lectin complement pathway by cleaving C4 and C2 to form the C4b2a complex leading to further downstream complement activation (5.Thiel S.

Nature. 1997; 386: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Although the functions of the other MASPs are poorly understood, MASP-1 appears to play a role as an amplifier of complement activation (6.Chen C.B. Wallis R. J. Biol.

MASP-1 and MASP-2 were originally named after their association with MBL (5.Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B. Poulsen K. Willis A.C. Eggleton P. Hansen S. Holmskov U.

Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Subsequently, MASP-3 and sMAP (also named Map19) were identified as alternative splicing variants of the MASP1 and MASP2 genes, respectively. However, the names of the MASPs are confusing because they do not correspond to the actual gene name. According to the nomenclature suggested by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO), the proteins should have been named MASP1 isoform 1 (MASP-1), MASP1 isoform 2 (MASP-3), MASP2 isoform 1 (MASP-2), and MASP2 isoform 2 (sMAP or Map19). These names relate to the splice variants MASP1_v1, MASP1_v2, MASP2_v1, and MASP2_v2, respectively. However, the terms MASP-1, MASP-2, MASP-3, and sMAP are commonly used in the literature. The MASP1 gene is located on chromosome 3q27-q28. MASP-1 (MASP1 isoform 1) and MASP-3 (MASP1 isoform 2) contain an identical heavy chain except for 15 C-terminal residues. The heavy chain is comprised of two C1r/C1s, urchin-EGF, bone morphogenetic protein (CUB) domains separated by an EGF domain and followed by two complement control protein domains (CCPs). The light chain contains the serine protease domain, which is different for MASP-1 and MASP-3 (11.Takahashi M. Mori S. Shigeta S. Fujita T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 598: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). MASP-1 is primarily expressed in the liver, whereas a more broad tissue expression pattern is observed for MASP-3 (12.Seyfarth J. Garred P. Madsen H.O. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 962-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The MASP2 gene is located on chromosome 1p36-p36.2. MASP-2 (MASP2 isoform 1) has a similar modular structure as MASP-1 and MASP-3 containing a heavy chain of two CUB domains, an EGF domain, and two CCP domains. The light chain is a MASP-2 unique serine protease domain, whereas sMAP (MASP2 isoform 2) is a truncated form lacking the serine protease domain and a major part of the heavy chain. Expression of the two MASP2 isoforms is predominantly localized to the liver. In this report we describe the identification of a novel differential spliced variant (MASP1_v3) of the MASP1 gene that is found as a serum protein with a molecular mass of 45 kDa. This protein lacks the second CCP domain and the entire serine protease domain but contains 17 unique C-terminal amino acid residues. The protein is found in association with MBL and ficolins and down-regulates activation of complement via the lectin pathway. We propose to use the term MBL/ficolin-associated protein 1 (MAP-1) in addition to MASP1 isoform 3. This will indicate that the protein is not a serine protease, is derived from the MASP1 gene, and will not be mistaken for MASP-3. The National Centre for Biotechnology Information Entrez data bases were searched for alternative transcript sequences of MASP1. Three splice variants were identified with the accession numbers NM001879, NM139125, and NM001031849 corresponding to MASP1_v1, MASP1_v2, and MASP1_v3, respectively. The sequences were aligned using BioEdit Software (v7.0.9.0). Commercially available normalized human tissue cDNA panels (Clontech) were investigated for MASP1_v1, MASP1_v2, and MASP1_v3 expression by real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis on a Stratagene Mx2005 platform. TaqMan probes were labeled with 5′-FAM reporter dye and 3′-TAMRA quencher dye (DNA Technology, Risskov, Denmark). The reactions were performed with 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, 0.4 μm each primer, and 0.25 μm TaqMan probe. The cycling parameters were 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. All of the samples were measured in duplicate in three individual experiments on different plates using 0.7 ng of cDNA in a total volume of 10 μl. The amplifications were normalized to BCR, GAPDH, and β-actin. The data were corrected for differences in amplification efficiencies. The relative gene expression was calculated with reference to MASP1_v3 expression in heart (100 × 2 ^ (ΔCt(MASP1_v3heart) − ΔCt(x)), where x is any of the other tissues). Sequencing of the exon 9 of the MASP1 gene spanning from positions +44,083 to +44,431 relative to the translation ATG start site (National Centre for Biotechnology Information accession number NC_000003) was performed on genomic DNA templates from 100 healthy Caucasian individuals. The fragment was amplified by using a single primer set (Table 1), where the forward primers contained a 5′-T7 sequence (5′-ttatacgactcacta-3′). PCR was performed in 20-μl volumes containing 2 ng of liver cDNA (Clontech), 0.25 μm each primer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.4, and 0.4 units of Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and run at the following cycling parameters: 2 min at 94 °C; 15 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 64 °C, 60 s at 72 °C; 15 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 58 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C; and 5 min at 72 °C. The products were sequenced in the forward direction using the ABI BigDye cycle sequencing terminator kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol using 5′-biotinylated T7 sequence primers. The sequence reactions were purified on a PyroMark Vacuum Prep Work station (Biotage) using streptavidin beads (GenoVision) and analyzed on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides utilized for PCR amplificationcDNAForwardProbeReverseOligonucleotide (5′ → 3′) used for PCR amplification of human cDNAMASP1_v1GCACCCAGAGCCACAGTGGCCTTCCAGTGTGTGGGCMASP1_v2GCACCCAGAGCCACAGTGGCCTTCCAGAGTGTGGTCAMASP1_v3GCACCCAGAGCCACAGTGCGATCTGGAGAGCGAACTCOligonucleotides (5′ → 3′) used for qPCR analysis of human cDNAMASP1_v1CAAGATGCTCAACAATAACACAGGTTATATACCTGTTCTGCCCAAGGAGTCTGGATGAGCTGCCCATTCAGGTGTGACMASP1_v2CAAGATGCTCAACAATAACACAGGTTATATACCTGTTCTGCCCAAGGAGTCTGGATGAGGAAGAGGCCAGGCTCAGCMASP1_v3AGGCTACAAAGTGCTGAAGGATTCTGAAGGATGGGACGTGGAGTAACCACTCTGTCACTTGCTCTGACBCRCCTTCGACGTCAATAACAAGGATTCCATCTCGCTCATCATCACCGACACCTGCGATGGCGTTCACβ-ActinaTaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, ACTB_Hs_00242273_A1).GAPDHbTaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, GAPDH_Hs_99999905_A1).Oligonucleotides (5′ → 3′) used for sequencing of human genomic DNAMASP1_v3CTGTTCTTCACACTGGCTGCTGCTGAGATCATGTTGTTCa TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, ACTB_Hs_00242273_A1).b TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, GAPDH_Hs_99999905_A1).

BALB/c×NMRI mice and rabbits were immunized subcutaneously three times with 25 μg of a MAP-1-specific peptide (CKKNEIDLESELKSEQVTE) coupled to diphtheria toxoid adsorbed to Al(OH)3 and mixed in 1:1 ratio with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The peptide contains the 17 C-terminal amino acids and two additional natural N-terminal residues, lysine and cysteine (the latter was used for coupling). The coupling was conducted using (N-e-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide ester coupling reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The fusion and selection of the antibodies was done essentially as described previously (15.Skjoedt M.O. Palarasah Y. Rasmussen K. Vitved L. Salomonsen J. Kliem A. Hansen S. Koch C. Skjodt K. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2010; 34: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Selected monoclonal antibodies were purified from culture supernatant by protein A affinity chromatography using the Äkta fast protein liquid chromatography system according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 20C4 was used for immunoprecipitation, immunoaffinity purification, and immunoblotting. mAb 12B11 was used for the immunohistochemistry analysis. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to MAP-1 were affinity-purified using a column coupled with human serum albumin to which the 17-residue MAP-1-specific peptide had been conjugated. ELISA was used to validate the specificity of the MAP-1 antibodies. The rMASP-1, rMASP-3, and rMAP-1 was immobilized to Maxisorp ELISA plates (Nunc) in 2-fold serial dilutions starting at 5 μg/ml. After washing/blocking in PBS, 0.05% Tween, an mAb to MAP-1 (mAb 20C4) or an antibody that reacts with the common heavy chain of MASP-1 and -3 (mAb 8B3) was applied at 5 μg/ml. Secondary detection was performed with HRP rabbit anti-mouse IgG (PO260; Dako) diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Electrophoresis was performed on 10% or 4–12% (w/v) Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels with discontinuous buffers using the NuPAGE® system (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Immunoblotting was performed using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF-HyBond; GE Healthcare), 2 μg/ml of primary mAbs, and secondary visualization by HRP-conjugated streptavidin (P0397; Dako) diluted 1:1500 or HRP rabbit anti-mouse IgG (PO260; Dako) diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were developed with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma-Aldrich) (0.04% in acetone) and 0.015% H2O2 in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5. Immunoprecipitation of MAP-1 from serum was performed with the MAP-1-specific mAb 20C4 or mAb 8B3 (a monoclonal antibody reacting against the common heavy chain of MASP-1 and MASP-3) as a positive control. Additionally an IgG mAb antibody (IgG1κ) with no known specificity was applied as a negative control. A total of 10 μg of mAb 20C4, 8B3, or IgG1κ was allowed to bind to sheep anti-mouse IgG Dynabeads (M-280, catalog number 112.02D; Dynal/Invitrogen). After a washing step the beads were applied to a pool of normal human serum (diluted 1:1 in Tris-buffered saline) and incubated end over end for 1 h at 4 °C. After the final washing steps and magnetic separation the beads were boiled in SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting probed with biotinylated antibodies to MAP-1, MBL, or ficolin-3. The same precipitation procedure as described above was performed with mAbs to MBL (Hyb 131-11; Bioporto), ficolin-2 (FCN219) (16.Hummelshoj T. Thielens N.M. Madsen H.O. Arlaud G.J. Sim R.B. Garred P. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and ficolin-3 (FCN334) (17.Munthe-Fog L. Hummelsh⊘j T. Ma Y.J. Hansen B.E. Koch C. Madsen H.O. Skj⊘dt K. Garred P. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 2660-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To compensate for differences in serum concentrations of MBL and ficolin-2 and -3, we precipitated from 1 ml, 300 μl, and 100 μl of serum, respectively. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and probed with a biotinylated antibody to MAP-1. CHO cells expressing rMAP-1 were grown in culture flasks in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were harvested at 80–90% confluence and fixed for 24 h in 4% formaldehyde-PBS and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Six different human liver tissues and samples from two different myocardial tissues, two skeletal muscle tissues, and two samples obtained from human aorta were also fixed and paraffin-embedded as described above. Sections of 5-μm slices were obtained with a Leitz Wetzlar microtome and placed on glass slides and stored at 4 °C until assayed. Pretreatments and analysis were performed as described previously (18.Madsen J. Kliem A. Tornoe I. Skjodt K. Koch C. Holmskov U. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5866-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against MAP-1 were the mAb 12B11 or the affinity-purified polyclonal antibody MAP-1, both diluted to 5 μg/ml. Isotype antibody controls were applied to the tissues at the same concentration. Secondary antibody was EnVisionTM antibody (HRP anti-mouse or HRP anti-rabbit; Dako). Analysis of the staining patterns was conducted under a Leica DMLB2 microscope. The influence of MAP-1 on the MBL and ficolin-3-mediated complement factor C4 deposition was assessed essentially as described previously (19.Garred P. Larsen F. Seyfarth J. Fujita R. Madsen H.O. Genes Immun. 2006; 7: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 20.Munthe-Fog L. Hummelsh⊘j T. Honoré C. Madsen H.O. Permin H. Garred P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 2637-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, mannan (MBL ligand) (Sigma-Aldrich M7504) or acetylated bovine serum albumin (AcBSA) (ficolin-3 ligand) was immobilized to Maxisorp ELISA plates (Nunc) at 10 μg/ml. After washing, rMBL or rficolin-3 (0.4 μg/ml) was added and incubated for 1.5 h. The rMAP-1 or rMASP-2 was applied for 1 h in 2-fold serial dilutions in the first dimension followed by incubation for 45 min at 37 °C with serial dilutions of serum deficient of MBL (21.Garred P. Larsen F. Madsen H.O. Koch C. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) or ficolin-3 (20.Munthe-Fog L. Hummelsh⊘j T. Honoré C. Madsen H.O. Permin H. Garred P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 2637-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in the second dimension. The C4 deposition was measured using a polyclonal antibody to C4c (Q0369, Dako). In addition we assessed the displacement of MASP-2 with MAP-1 using a pure system. The rMASP-2 was preincubated for 45 min at 20 °C in serial dilutions in the first dimension on an rMBL/mannan matrix as described above followed by incubation with dilutions of rMAP-1 in the second dimension for 45 min at 20 °C. Purified C4 (Quidel) was added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Detection was conducted as described above. We searched the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Entrez data base for alternative transcript sequences of MASP1 and identified a novel mRNA sequence (MASP1_v3). The corresponding protein “MASP-1 isoform 3” was named MAP-1 for MBL/ficolin-associated protein 1. Alignment analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the different MASP1 transcript variants (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2) demonstrated that MASP1_v3 only shares exons 1–8 with the other two splice variants of MASP1. These exons encode most of the common heavy chain. However, because of an extra exon (exon 9) containing a stop codon, this molecule does not have a serine protease domain (Fig. 2). The corresponding MAP-1 protein sequence encodes 380 amino acids, whereas MASP-1 and MASP-3 contains 699 and 728 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1). By alignment analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences, we found that MAP-1 lacks the second CCP domain and the entire serine protease domain but contains 17 unique C-terminal amino acid residues (Fig. 1). We calculated the theoretical molecular mass based on the deduced amino acid sequence to be 43.6 kDa with predicted signal peptide and 41.4 kDa without predicted signal peptide.FIGURE 1Alignment of the isoforms of MASP1. The deduced amino acid sequences of MASP-1 (MASP1 isoform 1), MASP-3 (MASP1 isoform 2), and MAP-1 (MASP1 isoform 3) were aligned using the BioEdit Software. The dots represent identical amino acids. MASP-1 and MASP-3 contain different C-terminal serine protease domains, whereas MAP-1 does not contain a serine protease domain. Instead the protein contains 17 unique amino acids at the C-terminal end.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of MASP1_v1, MASP1_v2, and MASP1_v3 transcripts in tissues were investigated by end point PCR analysis on cDNA panels from Clontech (data not shown). High mRNA levels of all three transcript variants were detected in the liver. Furthermore, MASP1_v3 was strongly expressed in heart tissue, and a lower mRNA level of MASP1_v3 was detected in skeletal muscle, brain, colon, prostate, and small intestine. No detectable mRNA levels were detected in bone marrow, cecum, duodenum, esophagus, jejunum, kidney, lung, lymph, ovary, pancreas, placenta, spleen, stomach, testis, thymus, or tonsil. Based on the initial end point PCR analysis, tissues with MASP1_ v1, MASP1_v2, or MASP1_v3 expression were selected for further investigations using a new independent cDNA library. For quantification we used real time qPCR analysis. Confirming the previous observations, high levels of MASP1_v1 and MASP1_v2 mRNA mainly were found in liver tissue (Fig. 3), but a minor extra-hepatic expression of MASP1_v2 was also detected in all the investigated tissues, corresponding to ∼1–5% of that observed in the liver (data not shown). The mRNA concentration of MASP1_v3 was higher in liver tissue compared with MASP1_v1 and MASP1_v2 (Fig. 3). However, of particular interest was the finding that the MASP1_v3 mRNA level was expressed approximately two times higher in skeletal muscle and approximately four times higher in the heart tissue compared with the relative mRNA concentration in the liver. To investigate a possible genetic variation of the specific exon of the MASP1_v3 transcript, we sequenced the MASP1_exon 9 in 100 healthy Caucasian individuals. No genetic variations were observed in this exon (data not shown). We used ELISA, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry to validate the specificities of the antibodies used. Fig. 4A (left side) shows the reaction pattern of anti-MAP-1 mAb 20C4 to rMASP-1, rMASP-3, and rMAP-1 immobilized to an ELISA plate in serial dilutions. No cross-reactivity to rMASP-1 or rMASP-3 was observed. An antibody to the common heavy chain of MASP-1 and MASP-3 was used as a positive control (Fig. 4A, right side). Additionally no cross-reactivity of mAb 20C4 to rMASP-1 and rMASP-3 was observed in SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). CHO cells expressing either rMASP-3 or rMAP-1 were fixed in formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and used to screen for specificity in immunohistochemistry. The anti-MAP-1 antibody showed a positive staining of the MAP-1-positive cells, and no cross-reactivity to the MASP-3 cells was evident (Fig. 4C). The anti-MASP-1/3 mAb 8B3 served as a control for the immunohistochemical staining of the MASP-3 positive cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm the qPCR analysis and to identify specific cells and tissue areas positive for MAP-1. We analyzed samples from different individuals (two myocardial samples, two skeletal muscle samples, six liver samples, and two aortic samples). Strong staining with the anti-MAP-1 monoclonal antibody was observed in myocardium/cardiac muscle fibers, skeletal muscle fibers, and liver hepatocytes, but no staining was seen in aortic tissue (Fig. 5, left panels). This staining pattern was further validated using polyclonal anti-MAP-1 antibodies (data not shown). Difference in the inter-individual staining intensity of the tissues was observed (data not shown). No staining was evident when the tissues were analyzed with isotype control antibodies (Fig. 5, right panels). To investigate a possible association between MAP-1 and MBL and ficolin-3, we precipitated serum complexes using both an antibody to MAP-1 (mAb 20C4) and an antibody against the common heavy chain of MASP-1 and MASP-3 (mAb 8B3). An IgG1κ isotype antibody served as a negative control. The precipitates were subsequently analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was detected with biotinylated antibodies to MAP-1, MBL, and ficolin-3, respectively. We observed pronounced ficolin-3 co-precipitation bands, but weaker bands were also seen with MBL (Fig. 6A). The samples were not probed with antibodies against ficolin-2 because they were not applicable for reduced immunoblotting. We then reversed the immunoprecipitation using mAbs against MBL, ficolin-2, and ficolin-3 to precipitate serum complexes from 1 ml, 300 μl, and 100 μl of serum, respectively. The different serum volumes were chosen to adjust for differences in the serum concentration of MBL (2 μg/ml), ficolin-2 (5 μg/ml), and ficolin-3 (20 μg/ml), respectively. The samples were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting probed with a biotinylated antibody to MAP-1. Distinct MAP-1 bands were observed in the precipitates from ficolin-2 and ficolin-3, and a slightly weaker band was apparent in the MBL precipitate (Fig. 6B, left side). Immunoprecipitated serum MAP-1 and rMAP-1 served as a positive control (Fig. 6B, right side). No MAP-1 band was evident when the IgG1κ isotype antibody was used as precipitation mAb. The rMBL (13.Larsen F. Madsen H.O. Sim R.B. Koch C. Garred P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21302-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and rficolin-3 (14.Hummelshoj T. Fog L.M. Madsen H.O. Sim R.B. Garred P. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 1623-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were used to reconstitute the complement activity in serum deficient in MBL (21.Garred P. Larsen F. Madsen H.O. Koch C. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) or ficolin-3 (20.Munthe-Fog L. Hummelsh⊘j T. Honoré C. Madsen H.O. Permin H. Garred P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 2637-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), respectively. Mannan and AcBSA served as ligands for MBL and ficolin-3. Both rMBL and rficolin-3 were able to initiate C4 deposition in the MBL- and ficolin-3-deficient sera, respectively (Fig. 7, A and D). Preincubation of rMBL or rficolin-3 with serial dilutions of rMASP-2 resulted in a strong dose-dependent enhancement of the C4 deposition via both the MBL and ficolin-3 activation pathways (Fig. 7, B and E), whereas preincubation of rMBL or rficolin-3 with rMAP-1 resulted in a pronounced dose-dependent inhibition of the C4 deposition via both pathways (Fig. 7, C and F). In addition we addressed a possible displacement of MASP-2 with MAP-1 using a system of pure components comprising only of rMBL, rMASP-2, rMAP-1, and purified C4. The rMASP-2 was preincubated with mannan-rMBL complexes in serial dilutions. Thereafter, rMAP-1 was added in varying concentrations followed by the addition of purified C4. The application of rMAP-1 to the system clearly reduced the levels of C4 deposition (Fig. 8). We discovered an unidentified protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa when ficolins or MBL were precipitated from human serum and subsequently subjected to immunoblotting probed with antibodies against the common heavy chain of the MASP-1 and MASP-3 (MASP1 isoforms 1 and 2, respectively) (data not shown). This prompted us to search the data bases for alternative transcript sequences of the MASP1 gene. A novel MASP1-derived transcript was found containing exons 1–8 that encodes most of the common heavy chain shared with MASP1_v1 and MASP1_v2. This transcript did not contain exons 10–18 encoding the second CCP domain and both serine protease domains of MASP1 and MASP3 (Fig. 2). However, the transcript contained an until now unidentified exon (exon 9) encoding 17 unique C-terminal amino acid residues and an in-frame a stop codon. The transcript was named MASP1_v3, and the corresponding protein was MAP-1 (MASP1 isoform 3). Performing end point PCR analysis on cDNA libraries, we found that the MASP1_v3 transcript was expressed in different tissues including liver, brain, colon, prostate, heart, and skeletal muscles. This was different from the expression of MASP1_v1 and MASP1_v2, which were mainly expressed in the liver. Based on the initial results, tissues with a positive signal of MASP1_v1, MASP1_v2, or MASP1_v3 transcripts were selected for further quantitative expression analysis on a new cDNA library. mRNA levels of MASP1_v1 and MASP1_v2 were mainly found in liver tissue. Nevertheless, minor extra-hepatic expression of MASP1_v2 was also detected in all of the investigated tissues, corresponding to approximately to 1–5% of that observed in the liver. The MASP1_v3 mRNA level was higher in liver tissue compared with MASP1_v1 and MASP1_v2. Surprisingly the highest concentration of MASP1_v3 mRNA was found in heart tissue followed by skeletal muscle tissue, indicating that striated muscle tissue is a major source of MASP1_v3. We have previously observed some differences in the expression pattern between MASP1_v1 and MASP1_v2, suggesting that a differential genetic regulation of these two splicing forms may exist (12.Seyfarth J. Garred P. Madsen H.O. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 962-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing is widely accepted as an important mechanism for generating genetic diversity and regulation of gene expression (22.House A.E. Lynch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1217-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Alternative promoter usage has also been correlated with downstream alternative splicing events, differential expression levels, and different tissue specificity even in the absence of protein isoforms (23.Landry J.R. Mager D.L. Wilhelm B.T. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Alternative pre- mRNA splicing and the differential inclusion or exclusion of portions of a nascent transcript into the final protein-coding mRNA is widely recognized to be a ubiquitous mechanism for controlling protein expression (22.House A.E. Lynch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1217-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Differences in the activities and/or specificities of splicing factors and regulators of transcription thus may well explain the different mRNA levels and tissue distribution of MASP1_v3 compared with the MASP1_v1 and MASP1_v2 variants. MASP1_v3 transcription could also be initiated by a separate MASP1_v3 promoter in analogy with what has been observed for the MBL2 gene encoding the MBL protein sequence, which is initiated by alternative promoters (12.Seyfarth J. Garred P. Madsen H.O. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 962-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24.Naito H. Ikeda A. Hasegawa K. Oka S. Uemura K. Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, none of these theories are mutually exclusive. Future studies will hopefully reveal the molecular origin behind the different expression pattern of the different MASP1 transcripts. To characterize MAP-1, we generated both monoclonal and mono-specific polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptide comprising the 17 unique C-terminal amino acids of MAP-1. When using MAP-1 specific antibodies in a panel of paraffin-embedded tissues of myocardial, skeletal muscle, liver, and aortic tissue, we could clearly demonstrate that MAP-1 is ubiquitously present in myocardial myocyte fibrils, whereas a more restricted patchy staining pattern was observed in skeletal muscle fibrils. The latter could indicate that MAP-1 is induced by muscle contractions. By contrast no MAP-1 staining could be observed in aortic tissue, indicating that this isoform is expressed in striated muscle tissue and not in smooth muscle tissue, which are indeed fundamentally different in terms of structure, function, excitation-contraction coupling, and mechanisms of contraction. We have shown that MAP-1 is present in serum as a 45-kDa protein in complex with MBL, ficolin-2, and ficolin-3 based on different immunoprecipitation experiments, which were visualized by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. These experiments clearly demonstrate that MAP-1 is a novel serum protein associated with the lectin pathway initiator molecules. Recently, crystal structures of the interaction between MASP-1 and MASP-3 with MBL and the ficolins revealed that the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains are responsible for the binding of MASP-1 and MASP-3 to MBL and ficolins (25.Teillet F. Gaboriaud C. Lacroix M. Martin L. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25715-25724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore it is reasonable to assume that these domains are also responsible for the interactions between MAP-1 and MBL or ficolins. Furthermore, the main initiator of the lectin complement pathway, MASP-2, has similar CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains that also interact with MBL and ficolins (26.Thielens N.M. Cseh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27.Girija U.V. Dodds A.W. Roscher S. Reid K.B. Wallis R. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The serine protease domain of MASP-2 is responsible for the cleavage of C4 and C2, leading to further downstream complement activation (5.Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B. Poulsen K. Willis A.C. Eggleton P. Hansen S. Holmskov U. Reid K.B. Jensenius J.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that MAP-1 could have a potentially regulatory role in the lectin complement pathway. When complexes of rMAP1 with rMBL and rficolin-3 were incubated with MBL- or ficolin-3-deficient serum, respectively, it was clear that rMAP-1 exerts a strong dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the complement C4 deposition, whereas recombinant rMASP-2 augmented this deposition. To further investigate whether rMAP-1 could displace rMASP-2, we used a serum-free system employing recombinant MBL, MASP-2, MAP-1, and purified C4. The rMAP-1 was able to almost completely inhibit the C4 deposition despite the fact that it was added in sequence after MASP-2, thus indicating that it could displace rMASP-2 from rMBL. This is in agreement with results demonstrating that the same amino acid residues in MBL are essential not only for MASP-1 and MASP-3 binding but also MASP-2 binding (28.Teillet F. Lacroix M. Thiel S. Weilguny D. Agger T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5710-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together these results indicate that MAP-1 functions as a potent systemic regulator of the complement system in vivo together with C1 inhibitor and C4-binding protein. The presence of MAP-1 in striated muscle tissues may also indicate that MAP-1 could function as a local inhibitor of complement activation. Because of the tissue expression pattern, we cannot exclude the possibility that MAP-1 may have other functions outside the complement system yet to be clarified. In conclusion we describe the identification of a novel differential spliced gene product of the MASP1 gene named MAP-1 (or MASP1 isoform 3), which is found as a serum protein with a molecular mass of 45 kDa. MAP-1 lacks the second CCP domain and the entire serine protease domain but contains 17 unique C-terminal amino acid residues. MAP-1 is found in association with MBL and ficolins and is highly expressed in myocardial and skeletal muscle tissues and also in liver hepatocytes. MAP-1 inhibited complement deposition by MBL and ficolin-3 and appears to be a novel regulator of complement activation via the lectin pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2085730525,"Migratory birds are known to play a role as long-distance vectors for many microorganisms. To investigate whether this is true of rickettsial agents as well, we characterized tick infestation and gathered ticks from 13,260 migratory passerine birds in Sweden. A total of 1127 Ixodes spp. ticks were removed from these birds and the extracted DNA from 957 of them was available for analyses. The DNA was assayed for detection of Rickettsia spp. using real-time PCR, followed by DNA sequencing for species identification. Rickettsia spp. organisms were detected in 108 (11.3%) of the ticks. Rickettsia helvetica, a spotted fever rickettsia associated with human infections, was predominant among the PCR-positive samples. In 9 (0.8%) of the ticks, the partial sequences of 17kDa and ompB genes showed the greatest similarity to Rickettsia monacensis, an etiologic agent of Mediterranean spotted fever-like illness, previously described in southern Europe as well as to the Rickettsia sp.IrITA3 strain. For 15 (1.4%) of the ticks, the 17kDa, ompB, gltA and ompA genes showed the greatest similarity to Rickettsia sp. strain Davousti, Rickettsia japonica and Rickettsia heilongjiangensis, all closely phylogenetically related, the former previously found in Amblyomma tholloni ticks in Africa and previously not detected in Ixodes spp. ticks. The infestation prevalence of ticks infected with rickettsial organisms was four times higher among ground foraging birds than among other bird species, but the two groups were equally competent in transmitting Rickettsia species. The birds did not seem to serve as reservoir hosts for Rickettsia spp., but in one case it seems likely that the bird was rickettsiemic and that the ticks had acquired the bacteria from the blood of the bird. In conclusion, migratory passerine birds host epidemiologically important vector ticks and Rickettsia species and contribute to the geographic distribution of spotted fever rickettsial agents and their diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2002550126,"The molecular mechanisms governing breast tumor cellular self-renewal contribute to breast cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. The ErbB2 oncogene is overexpressed in approximately 30% of human breast cancers. c-Jun, the first cellular proto-oncogene, is overexpressed in human breast cancer. However, the role of endogenous c-Jun in mammary tumor progression is unknown. Herein, transgenic mice expressing the mammary gland-targeted ErbB2 oncogene were crossed with c-jun(f/f) transgenic mice to determine the role of endogenous c-Jun in mammary tumor invasion and stem cell function. The excision of c-jun by Cre recombinase reduced cellular migration, invasion, and mammosphere formation of ErbB2-induced mammary tumors. Proteomic analysis identified a subset of secreted proteins (stem cell factor (SCF) and CCL5) induced by ErbB2 expression that were dependent upon endogenous c-Jun expression. SCF and CCL5 were identified as transcriptionally induced by c-Jun. CCL5 rescued the c-Jun-deficient breast tumor cellular invasion phenotype. SCF rescued the c-Jun-deficient mammosphere production. Endogenous c-Jun thus contributes to ErbB2-induced mammary tumor cell invasion and self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2001020370,"Ulva prolifera, a common green seaweed, is one of the causative species of green tides that occurred frequently along the shores of Qingdao in 2008 and had detrimental effects on the preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games sailing competition, since more than 30 percent of the area of the games was invaded. In view of the rapid accumulation of the vast biomass of floating U. prolifera in green tides, we investigated the formation of sporangia in disks of different diameters excised from U. prolifera, changes of the photosynthetic properties of cells during sporangia formation, and development of spores. The results suggested that disks less than 1.00 mm in diameter were optimal for the formation of sporangia, but there was a small amount of spore release in these. The highest percentage of area of spore release occurred in disks that were 2.50 mm in diameter. In contrast, sporangia were formed only at the cut edges of larger disks (3.00 mm, 3.50 mm, and 4.00 mm in diameter). Additionally, the majority of spores liberated from the disks appeared vigorous and developed successfully into new individuals. These results implied that fragments of the appropriate size from the U. prolifera thalli broken by a variety of factors via producing spores gave rise to the rapid proliferation of the seaweed under field conditions, which may be one of the most important factors to the rapid accumulation of the vast biomass of U. prolifera in the green tide that occurred in Qingdao, 2008."
https://openalex.org/W1981636483,"The defense against oxidative stress is a critical feature that prevents cellular and DNA damage. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) catalyze the glucuronidation of xenobiotics, mutagens, and reactive metabolites and thus act as indirect antioxidants. Aim of this study was to elucidate the regulation of UGTs expressed in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract by xenobiotics and the main mediator of antioxidant defense, Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2). Xenobiotic (XRE) and antioxidant (ARE) response elements were detected in the promoters of UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10. Reporter gene experiments demonstrated XRE-mediated induction by dioxin in addition to tert-butylhydroquinone (ARE)-mediated induction of UGT1A8 and UGT1A10, which are expressed in extrahepatic tissue in humans in vivo. The responsible XRE and ARE motifs were identified by mutagenesis. Small interfering RNA knockdown, electrophoretic mobility shifts, and supershifts identified a functional interaction of Nrf2 and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Induction of UGT1A8 and UGT1A10 requires Nrf2 and AhR. It proceeds by utilizing XRE- as well as ARE-binding motifs. In summary, we demonstrate the coordinated AhR- and Nrf2-dependent transcriptional regulation of human UGT1As.

Cellular protection by glucuronidation is thus inducible by xenobiotics via AhR and by oxidative metabolites via Nrf2 linking glucuronidation to cellular protection and defense against oxidative stress. Molecular oxygen is essential for the survival of almost all eukaryotes. Under normal physiological conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesAhRaryl hydrocarbon receptortBHQtert-butylhydroquinoneTCDD2,3,7,8-tetrachlordibenzo-p-dioxinUGTUDP-glucuronosyltransferaseAREantioxidant response elementXRExenobiotic response elementEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay. including hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, peroxynitrite, and hydroxyl radicals, are generated as metabolic by-products. However, increased levels of ROS can lead to oxidative stress and cell injury. During evolution, mammalian cells have developed a variety of inducible genetic programs to adapt to the presence of ROS. As a first cellular reaction in response to oxidative/electrophilic stress, an array of defense genes is activated (1.Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long 2nd, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr.

Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), which, in most instances, leads to the neutralization of oxidative stress, its effects, and finally to survival. In the absence of appropriate defense mechanisms, the accumulation of ROS and electrophiles can lead to membrane and DNA damage, mutagenicity, degeneration of tissues, premature aging, apoptotic cell death, cellular transformation, and cancer (3.Ward J.F.

Cellular antioxidant defense employs a number of proteins (e.g. enzymes) and small molecules (e.g. vitamins C and E), to restrict ROS at levels, which are not critical for the organism. Enzymes with antioxidant capabilities capable of inactivating ROS and preventing ROS-initiated reactions include superoxide dismutases, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and belong to the group of “direct” antioxidants (6.Auten R.L.

In contrast, phase 2 detoxifying (conjugating) enzymes are classified as “indirect” antioxidants based upon their role in maintaining redox balance and thiol homeostasis. They contribute to biosynthesis and the recycling of thiols or facilitate the excretion of oxidized, reactive secondary metabolites (quinines, epoxides, aldehydes, and peroxides) through reduction/conjugation reactions during the process of xenobiotic detoxification (9.Holtzclaw W.D. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2004; 44: 335-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Phase 2 enzymes with antioxidant capability include glutathione S-transferase isozymes and NADP(H):quinine oxidoreductase (NQO1), γ-glutamyl cysteine synthethase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). UGTs facilitate the elimination of a broad array of endogenous and exogenous substances by glucuronidation. Cytochromes P450 generate ROS as a result of oxidative metabolism. The resulting reactive metabolites are among the major substrates for conjugation with glucuronic acid, which is catalyzed by UGTs. Glucuronidation leads to biologically inactive glucuronides in most instances. The human UGT1A enzyme family encoded on chromosome 2 comprises nine members (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A5, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10) (10.Strassburg C.P. Kalthoff S. Ehmer U. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2008; 45: 485-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The proximal 1 kb of the UGT1A8–10 promoters are highly similar, displaying >75% of sequence identity (11.Gregory P.A. Lewinsky R.H. Gardner-Stephen D.A. Mackenzie P.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The UGT1A10 gene product detoxifies many xenobiotic substrates and drugs as well as 7-hydroxy-benzo[a]pyrene, known as a precursor of ROS. UGT1A10 is expressed exclusively in the extrahepatic gastrointestinal tract (12.Breimer L.H. Mol. Carcinog. 1990; 3: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 13.Venkatraman M. Konga D.

It is also highly expressed in kidneys and catalyzes the glucuronidation of estragole, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine and compounds such as phenylbutazone (16.Iyer L.V. Ho M.N.

Biophys. 2008; 478: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways responsible for sensing oxidative stress and activating the appropriate defense genes are still not completely understood in eukaryotes. The transcription factor Nrf2 appears to represent a key regulator in oxidative stress that is activated by ROS (1.Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long 2nd, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2.Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is a member of the Cap'n'Collar family of bZIP proteins and recognizes the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter of its target genes (19.Yu X. Kensler T. Mutat Res. 2005; 591: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Under normal basal conditions, Nrf2 is bound to its inhibitor, the cytoskeleton-associated protein Keap1, which represses Nrf2 by facilitating its proteasomal degradation (20.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by antioxidants such as tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), Nrf2 is released from Keap1 and translocates into the nucleus, followed by heterodimerization with other transcription factors, such as Jun and small Maf (21.Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 22.Marini M.G. Chan K. Casula L. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. J. Biol.

Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Recent data provide evidence for a cross-talk between the Nrf2 pathway and the pathway leading to the induction of XRE-driven genes and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that, prior to ligand binding, is stabilized in the cytoplasm by direct interaction with HSP90 (heat shock protein 90), XAP2 (X-associated protein 2), and HSP90 co-chaperone p23 (24.Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2002; 141: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding (e.g. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlordibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), phytochemicals, and sterols) the AhR ligand complex translocates into the nucleus and dimerizes with the Arnt (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) (25.Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 251-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The AhR/Arnt dimer binds to XRE DNA-binding motifs located in the promoter of many drug-metabolizing enzymes. A number of studies have investigated the cross-talk between Nrf2 and AhR. Mutagenesis of ARE-binding elements in the promoter of human UGT1A6 was shown to lead to a reduced response to tBHQ, and, surprisingly, to the simultaneous loss of TCDD inducibility (26.Münzel P.A. Schmohl S. Buckler F. Jaehrling J. Raschko F.T. Köhle C. Bock K.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Convincing data were presented in a study that examined the dependence of TCDD inducibility of different drug-processing genes on the Nrf2 presence in livers of wild type and Nrf2-null mice. Yeager et al. (27.Yeager R.L. Reisman S.A. Aleksunes L.M. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. Sci. 2009; 111: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) showed in mice that TCDD induction of Ugt1a5, Ugt1a6, and Ugt1a9 was dependent on Nrf2, whereas TCDD induction of Ugt1a1 was not. There are several possibilities to explain this dependence. Miao et al. (28.Miao W. Hu L. Scrivens P.J. Batist G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20340-20348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) demonstrated that nrf2 gene transcription is directly modulated by AhR through XRE-elements in the nrf2 gene promoter. A second possible mechanism is a direct interaction between AhR and Nrf2 proteins, but evidence that the two transcription factors can physically interact has not been presented to date. A third possibility is an interaction between Nrf2- and AhR-associated proteins or an interaction between AhR- and Nrf2-associated proteins. As the major site of first entry for xenobiotics, the gastrointestinal tract, and subsequently the liver are continuously exposed to a broad array of compounds with ROS capability. Mucosal metabolism can lead to metabolites with increased toxicity and increases the susceptibility of the gastrointestinal tract and the liver for oxidative metabolites, chemical toxicity, and potentially carcinogenesis. Both organ systems harbor molecular defense mechanisms to detoxify reactive intermediates and minimize oxidative stress. Because UGTs are expressed directly in the intestinal mucosa as well as in the liver, we hypothesized that they are regulated by antioxidant signaling pathways. In this study, the human UGT1A8/UGT1A10 (extrahepatic expression in humans in vivo) and UGT1A9 (hepatic expression in humans in vivo) were studied, and their regulation by Nrf2 and/or AhR was identified and characterized. In all experiments, human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (KYSE70) cells were used. They were previously established from the poorly differentiated invasive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma resected from middle intrathoracic esophagus of a 77-year-old Japanese man prior to treatment. KYSE70 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Esophageal epithelium derived KYSE70 cells were used because the esophageal mucosa exclusively expresses UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10 (10.Strassburg C.P. Kalthoff S. Ehmer U. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2008; 45: 485-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the regulation of which was the aim of the experimental characterization of this study. The cells were maintained at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. KYSE70 cells were treated with test compounds (5 nm TCDD, 100 μmtBHQ, or vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide) for 24 h, and total RNA was prepared with TRIzol (Invitrogen). 5 μg of RNA were used for the generation of cDNA in an oligo(dT)-primed Superscript III reverse transcriptase reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The influence of TCDD and tBHQ on UGT1A10-, AhR-, and Nrf2-mRNA-levels was shown by co-amplification of the gene of interest and β-actin. Amplification of UGT1A10 from cDNA was performed with an initial denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, primer annealing for 30 s at 59 °C, and an extension reaction for 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension reaction of 7 min at 72 °C. Amplification of Nrf2 and AhR was carried out using the same protocol except for the annealing temperature (58 °C) and the number of cycles (AhR, 31 cycles; Nrf2, 25 cycles). β-Actin primers were added after 10 (UGT1A10 and AhR) or 5 (Nrf2) cycles. All primers are listed in supplemental Table 3. A 500-bp (UGT1A8 and UGT1A10) and a 530-bp (UGT1A9) DNA fragment of each UGT1A 5′-upstream sequence were amplified by PCR from a healthy blood donor (all primers are shown in supplemental Table 4). The PCR fragments were cut by XhoI and NheI and ligated into pGL3 vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Mutagenesis of putative AhR- and Nrf2-binding sites was performed by primer extension using primers specified in supplemental Table 5. All inserts were sequenced in full using the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit 1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and the ABI 310 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). KYSE70 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with UGT1A8-, UGT1A9-, and UGT1A10 constructs (800 ng/well) in addition to the pRL-TK plasmid using Lipofectin Transfection reagent (Invitrogen) to perform a Dual-Luciferase assay (Dual-Reporter Assay; Promega, Mannheim, Germany). For transfection of siRNA (100 nm) Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used. Transfection of the reporter gene constructs using Lipofectin followed 6 h later. On the next day, cells were treated with 5 nm TCDD or 100 μmtBHQ for 48h if not stated otherwise. All experiments were performed in triplicate in at least 3–10 independent experiments. Results were analyzed using Microsoft Excel software and are shown as luciferase activity relative to empty pGL3 vector or as fold induction where indicated. Error bars represent S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for comparisons between groups. Significance was determined across all performed experiments. Differences were considered significant when p values were <0.05. 200 pmol of siRNA (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) against Nrf2 (AAGAGUAUGAGCUGGAAAAACTT), AhR (AAGCGGCAUAGAGACCGACUUTT), or nonsilencing control (UAAUGUAUUGGAACGCAUATT) were transfected within 2 ml of OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) into KYSE70 cells seeded into 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Consequently, final concentration of siRNA was 100 nm. Knockdown efficiency was determined by semiquantitative Western blot analysis (see below). 20 μg of total cell lysates from KYSE70 cells treated with either 5 nm TCDD or 100 μmtBHQ were boiled for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE prior to electrotransfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Blocking was performed in 10% dry milk (90% phosphate-buffered saline-Tris). Incubation with primary antibodies (anti-AhR and anti Nrf2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was carried out in 10% dry milk. After incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), protein was visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce) on x-ray film. Staining with β-actin antibody (sc-69879) was used as loading control. Nonradioactive EMSA was performed using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). Nuclear extracts were prepared from 5 nm TCDD-treated (for all experiments with XRE-probes) or 100 μmtBHQ-treated (for all experiments with ARE-probes) (48 h) KYSE70 cells as described elsewhere (14.Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8719-8726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). 1 μg of nuclear extracts was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with biotinylated oligonucleotides containing the binding sites listed in Table 1. For the determination of binding specificity, 200-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide were incubated with nuclear extracts for 15 min prior to the addition of biotinylated oligonucleotides. The samples were electrophoretically separated (120 V, 1–2.5 h) in a 6% polyacrylamide gel and blotted (300 milliamperes, 45 min) on a Biodyne B (0.45 μm) nylon membrane (Pall Corp., Pensacola, FL). Chemiluminescence was visualized using x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences) exposed for 1–10 min. EMSA supershift assays were performed by a 30-min incubation on ice with 2 μg of anti-AhR antibody (sc-8088X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 2 μg of anti-Nrf2 antibody (sc-722X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) prior to addition of labeled oligonucleotides.TABLE 1Sequence of used oligonucleotides in EMSAsPrimerPositionSequenceARE consensusAGA ATG CTG AGT CAC GGT G (forward), CAC CGT GAC TCA GCA TTC T (reverse)XRE consensusGGG GAT CGC GTG ACA ACC C (forward), GGG TTG TCA CGC GAT CCC C (reverse)PPARγaPPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. consensusCAAAACTAGGTCAAAGGTCA (forward), TGACCTTTGACCTAGTTTTG (reverse)1A10 XRE-101bp −114 to −85GAA AGG ATA AAT ACA CGC CCT CTA TTG GGG (forward), CCC CAA TAG AGG GCG TGT ATT TAT CCT TTC (reverse)1A10 ARE-149bp −159 to −130TAT GAG TAA ATC ATT GGC AGT GAG TGT GAT (forward), ATC ACA CTC ACT GCC AAT GAT TTA CTC ATA (reverse)1A10 XRE-136bp −144 to −120GGC AGT GAG TGT GAT TTT TTT TTT T (forward), AAA AAA AAA AAT CAC ACT CAC TGC C (reverse)a PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. Open table in a new tab A semiquantitative PCR was performed for UGT1A10 mRNA in relation to actin mRNA. KYSE70 cells treated with TCDD or tBHQ for different lengths of time showed an UGT1A10 mRNA induction by TCDD after 3 h and a maximum after 48 h (Fig. 1A). tBHQ induced UGT1A10 mRNA after 24 h of incubation, which is also the point of strongest induction. Luciferase reporter gene assays similarly showed a time-dependent induction of a UGT1A10 500-bp construct by TCDD and tBHQ (Fig. 1B). The strongest TCDD and tBHQ inducibility was detectable after 48 h. Induction was 6.4-fold with TCDD and 2.5-fold with tBHQ. These data indicate a previously undescribed time-dependent induction of human UGT1A10 mRNA and of the UGT1A10 5′-upstream region, most likely by the transcription factors AhR and Nrf2, which was further clarified. To identify the responsible DNA binding motifs 5′-upstream DNA sequence was analyzed. Four potential XRE-binding sites and one ARE-binding site were identified in the human UGT1A10 5′-upstream region within the first 500 bp of the UGT1A10 promoter that were highly similar to XRE and ARE consensus sequences (Table 2). All potential binding sites were mutagenized individually to examine their specific effects on TCDD and tBHQ inducibility. If the transcription factors AhR or Nrf2 bind specifically to the examined binding elements, mutagenesis would be expected to lead to the prevention of transcription factor binding and therefore result in abolished TCDD or tBHQ induction. Mutagenesis of the XRE-176 and XRE-256 site did not affect UGT1A10 induction by AhR or Nrf2 (Fig. 2A). By mutagenesis of XRE-binding elements, a reduction of TCDD induction was expected. Interestingly, the mutagenesis of only the XRE-101 or the XRE-136 motif led to a significant reduction of both TCDD- and tBHQ-mediated induction. Similarly, the mutagenesis of the ARE-149 motif resulted in a simultaneous decrease of TCDD- and tBHQ-mediated UGT1A10 induction. In summary, these data indicate interdependency between the AhR- and Nrf2-mediated induction of UGT1A10.TABLE 2UGT1A8, UGT1A9 and UGT1A10 5′-upstream regions with the different XRE- and ARE-binding sitesAccession no.XRE-256XRE-176ARE-143/149XRE-136XRE-101Consensus sequenceGCGTGGCGTGGCNNNGTCAGCGTGGCGTG CACGC (reverse complement)UGT1A8AF462268.1GCACTTCATGA…A…TCATTGGCA…GGTGTGCACGCUGT1A9NM_021027.2GCATGTCATAT…G…TCATTGTCA…CCTGATCACGCUGT1A10NM_019075.2GCGTGTCGTGA…A…TCATTGGCA…GGTGTGCACGCUGT1A10 ARE-149 mut-like 1A9 Gly → ThrGCGTGTCGTGA…A…TCATTGTCA…GGTGTGCACGCUGT1A10 ARE-149 mut-like 1A9 “all”GCGTGTCGTGT…G…TCATTGTCA…CGTGTGCACGCUGT1A9 ARE-143 mut-like 1A10 Thr → GlyGCATGTCATAT…G…TCATTGGCA…CCTGATCACGCUGT1A9 ARE-143 mut-like 1A10 “all”GCATGTCATAA…A…TCATTGGCA…GCTGATCACGC Open table in a new tab The experiments were expanded to include the highly homologous UGT1A8 and UGT1A9 genes. Despite a promoter sequence homology of >75%, UGT1A9 is mainly expressed in liver and kidneys, whereas UGT1A8 and UGT1A10 are exclusively expressed in the extrahepatic gastrointestinal tract in humans in vivo (14.Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8719-8726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 15.Mojarrabi B. Mackenzie P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity assays showed a similar TCDD (6.4-fold) and tBHQ (2.7-fold) inducibility for UGT1A8 in comparison to UGT1A10 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, liver expressed UGT1A9 was only induced 4.3-fold by TCDD, and no tBHQ-mediated induction was detectable. The corresponding XRE-101 and ARE-149 binding elements were mutagenized in both the UGT1A8 and UGT1A9 5′-upstream regions. Mutagenesis of the XRE-101 and ARE-149 sites in the UGT1A8 promoter led to a significant reduction of TCDD and tBHQ inducibility similar to that seen for UGT1A10 (Fig. 2C). When the corresponding XRE-101 element in the UGT1A9 promoter was mutated, TCDD inducibility decreased significantly (Fig. 2D). However, mutagenesis of the corresponding ARE-143 site did not affect TCDD inducibility, as shown for UGT1A8 and UGT1A10. We conclude that there is coordination between TCDD (AhR)- and tBHQ (Nrf2)-mediated induction of the UGT1A8 and UGT1A10 genes, which is absent for the TCDD inducibility of UGT1A9. The XRE-101 and ARE-149 sites of UGT1A10 are identical to those of UGT1A8 (Table 2). In contrast, the ARE-143 DNA motif of UGT1A9 differs from those found in UGT1A8 and UGT1A10 with respect to a single base pair, which is located directly in the binding element, and within three base pairs, which are located within the adjoining sequence. When Gly at position −143 of UGT1A10 was mutated into Thr corresponding to the UGT1A9 ARE motif (Table 2), both TCDD and tBHQ inducibility were abolished comparable with complete mutation of ARE-149 in luciferase assays (Fig. 3A). The UGT1A10 construct “ARE-149 mut-like 1A9 “all”” contains all four base pair changes corresponding to the UGT1A9 sequence including those of the surrounding sequence. In luciferase assay, this construct caused no further reduction in inducibility in comparison to the single mutagenesis of Gly → Thr at position −143. Interestingly, conversion of Thr at position −137 in ARE-143 of UGT1A9 led to a 1.8-fold inducibility and mutation of the additional 3 bp to a 2.1-fold tBHQ (Nrf2) inducibility, which was not observed for the wild type UGT1A9 promoter (Fig. 3B). In summary, these data suggest that the difference of one base pair in the ARE DNA binding motifs of UGT1A10 and UGT1A9 are associated with the ability of tBHQ (ARE/Nrf2) inducibility or its absence. This analysis identifies the molecular determinant of differential regulation of these two genes. The analysis was expanded to provide evidence for a direct involvement of AhR and Nrf2 by siRNA knockdown. The efficiency of specific AhR and Nrf2 siRNA was tested by Western blot at different time points. Using 100 nm AhR/Nrf2 siRNA, AhR and Nrf2 protein amounts were strongly reduced after 24 and 48 h of incubation with either TCDD or tBHQ compared with control siRNA (Fig. 4A). In luciferase assays, the AhR knockdown resulted in a complete loss of both TCDD and tBHQ inducibility of UGT1A10 (Fig. 4B). Similarly, Nrf2 knockdown caused a loss of tBHQ (Nrf2) and TCDD (AhR)-mediated induction. Similar to UGT1A10, the single use of either AhR or Nrf2 siRNA led to a simultaneous reduction of TCDD and tBHQ inducibility of UGT1A8 (Fig. 4C). However, Nrf2 siRNA was not able to affect TCDD inducibility of UGT1A9, although AhR siRNA reduced TCDD induction, which is in agreement with the previous induction studies (Fig. 4D). The UGT1A9 construct “ARE-143 mut like 1A10 ”all“ containing all four base pair changes corresponding to the ARE of UGT1A10 (and a restoration of tBHQ inducibility, Fig. 3B) showed, as expected, a simultaneous decrease in AhR- as well as Nrf2-mediated induction using only AhR siRNA. In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown resulted in an abolishment of tBHQ inducibility but did not affect the induction by TCDD. Therefore, we conclude that both transcription factors, AhR and Nrf2, are required for either TCDD- and tBHQ-mediated induction. These data suggest that AhR and Nrf2 interact to perform a coordinate regulation of UGT1A8 and UGT1A10. In contrast, TCDD inducibility of UGT1A9 appears not to be dependent on the presence of Nrf2. Even if the ARE of UGT1A9 is mutated to correspond to the ARE of UGT1A10, Nrf2 inducibility depends on AhR, and Nrf2 does not appear to be essential for AhR-mediated induction. TCDD is a ligand of AhR and is responsible for the separation of AhR from its inhibitor in the cytoplasm. tBHQ is a creator of oxidative stress and treatment results in separation of Nrf2 from its inhibitor Keap1 and migration in the nucleus. It has been reported that AhR-mediated induction of Nrf2 was associated with an XRE-binding element in the nrf2 promoter (28.Miao W. Hu L. Scrivens P.J. Batist G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20340-20348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In this case, TCDD treatment would not only lead to a specific activation of AhR but also to mRNA induction of Nrf2. To test the specificity of TCDD- and tBHQ-mediated AhR and Nrf2 induction, a Western blot was performed for both transcription factors (Fig. 5A). Our data indicate that under the experimental conditions used in this study, TCDD only activated AhR and not Nrf2, and tBHQ mediated only a specific induction of Nrf2. To confirm these data, mRNA levels of AhR and Nrf2 were examined (Fig. 5B). Neither TCDD nor tBHQ induced AhR or Nrf2 on the mRNA level, therefore, there is no evidence for the up-regulation of gene expression of Nrf2 by TCDD in th"

Previous studies have shown that mitochondrial toxins and specifically inhibitors of complex I activity enhance αS pathogenesis. Here we show that αS overexpression specifically inhibits complex I activity in dopaminergic cells and in A53T αS transgenic mouse brains. Importantly, our results indicate that the inhibitory effect on complex I activity is not associated with αS-related pathology. Specifically, complex I activity measured in purified mitochondria from A53T αS transgenic mouse brains was not affected by mouse age; Parkinson disease-like symptoms; levels of αS soluble oligomers; levels of insoluble, lipid-associated αS; or αS intraneuronal depositions in vivo. Likewise, no correlation was found between complex I activity and polyunsaturated fatty acid-induced αS depositions in Lewy body-like inclusions in cultured dopaminergic cells. We further show that the effect of αS on complex I activity is not due to altered mitochondrial protein levels or affected complex I assembly. Based on the results herein, we suggest that αS expression negatively regulates complex I activity as part of its normal, physiological role. α-Synuclein (αS) is a protein involved in the cytopathology and genetics of Parkinson disease and is thought to affect mitochondrial complex I activity.

Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1272-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial import of αS is energy-dependent and seems to require an outer membrane protein import channel. Once in the mitochondria, αS predominantly associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it can apparently interact with and inhibit complex I activity, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species production (21.Devi L.

This effect is enhanced by the pathogenic A53T αS mutation (21.Devi L. Raghavendran V. Prabhu B.M. Avadhani N.G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9089-9100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Importantly, accumulation of αS was also observed in isolated mitochondria from post-mortem PD patients (21.Devi L. Raghavendran V. Prabhu B.M. Avadhani N.G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. J. Biol.

Specifically, we searched for an association between mitochondrial complex I dysfunction and αS-related pathology, represented by either αS-soluble oligomers, αS-insoluble aggregates, PD-like symptoms, or mouse age. We report that αS overexpression in cultured dopaminergic cells or A53T αS tg mouse brains inhibits complex I activity, yet no correlation between αS-related pathology and mitochondrial complex I dysfunction was found. We therefore conclude that αS inhibits complex I activity as part of its normal, physiological function.DISCUSSIONIn this study we aimed at assessing whether αS pathology, i.e. accumulation of soluble oligomers, insoluble aggregates, or inclusion formation, is directly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We report that either human wt αS overexpression in cultured dopaminergic cells or transgenic overexpression of A53T αS in mouse brains inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity. Our results suggest that the inhibitory effect of αS overexpression on complex I activity is not associated with levels of αS-related pathology in cultured dopaminergic cells nor in mouse brains. Specifically, enhanced αS oligomerization and inclusion formation, induced by 18:3 PUFA treatment, did not significantly affect complex I activity in cultured αS-overexpressing MN9D dopaminergic cells. Further, no correlation between complex I activity and either age of αS tg mice, levels of αS oligomers, or levels of insoluble αS was found. Based on the results presented herein, we conclude that αS expression and not its pathology associates with inhibited mitochondrial complex I activity.Recent studies have reported that αS expression induces oxidative stress and impairs complex I activity, as part of its deleterious effects attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction in PD pathogenesis (21.Devi L.

Transgenic overexpression of A53T αS was shown to inhibit complex IV in mouse brains (18.Martin L.J. Pan Y. Price A.C. Sterling W. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Price D.L. Lee M.K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Attempts to correlate αS toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction have recently been made using in vivo and in vitro models. Specifically, it was shown that aggregated, but not nonaggregated, αS associates with isolated rat brain mitochondria and induces calcium-dependent opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and cytochrome c release (22.Parihar M.S. Parihar A. Fujita M. Hashimoto M. Ghafourifar P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1272-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In this regard, it was suggested that aggregated αS forms amyloid pores capable of puncturing cell membranes leading to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (38.Maries E. Dass B. Collier T.J. Kordower J.H. Steece-Collier K. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 39.Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

However, other studies have suggested that αS expression may have a constitutive role in maintaining or regulating mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Specifically, using αS siRNA transfections there was a low but significant decrease in NADH-cytochrome c reductase levels, representing complex I–III activity (21.Devi L. Raghavendran V. Prabhu B.M. Avadhani N.G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9089-9100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), and lower NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity was detected in αS null mouse brains (41.Ellis C.E. Murphy E.J. Mitchell D.C. Golovko M.Y. Scaglia F. Barceló-Coblijn G.C. Nussbaum R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10190-10201Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In line with the functional link between αS expression and mitochondrial activities, αS null mice are resistant to the mitochondrial toxins MPTP, malonate, and 3-nitropropionic acid (42.Dauer W. Kholodilov N. Vila M. Trillat A.C. Goodchild R. Larsen K.E. Staal R. Tieu K. Schmitz Y. Yuan C.A. Rocha M. Jackson-Lewis V. Hersch S. Sulzer D. Przedborski S. Burke R. Hen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this regard, the results presented herein, describing the absence of any correlation between αS pathology and mitochondrial complex I activity, suggest that the inhibitory effect of αS expression on complex I activity results from a regulatory, physiological, effect of αS rather than a pathogenic effect.Complex I inhibitors and therefore mitochondrial dysfunction enhance αS pathology in mouse models. Specifically, chronic MPTP treatment was shown to enhance the formation of endogenous αS- and ubiquitin-positive inclusions in wt mouse brains (44.Fornai F. Schlüter O.M. Lenzi P. Gesi M. Ruffoli R. Ferrucci M. Lazzeri G. Busceti C.L. Pontarelli F. Battaglia G. Pellegrini A. Nicoletti F. Ruggieri S. Paparelli A. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurol. 2004; 186: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Similarly, rotenone, a classical inhibitor of complex I, was shown to induce the formation of αS-positive inclusions (46.Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Testa C.M. Seo B.B. Richardson J.R. Kim J.H.

Neuronal αS pathology and mitochondrial degeneration were enhanced in A53T but not wt αS tg mice chronically treated with the combination of two pesticides, paraquat and maneb. Importantly, the combination of the two pesticides was needed to detect the deleterious effects (49.Norris E.H. Uryu K. Leight S. Giasson B.I. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 658-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly, paraquat alone was reported to induce αS expression levels and the formation of intraneuronal inclusions in A53T αS tg mice; however, it did not induce nigral degeneration (50.Manning-Bog A.B. McCormack A.L. Purisai M.G. Bolin L.M. Di Monte D.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3095-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies consistently suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may enhance αS pathology leading to PD and therefore suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs prior to αS pathology and Lewy body formation. Interestingly, it was suggested that the enhanced αS pathogenesis by complex I inhibitors may be protective (50.Manning-Bog A.B. McCormack A.L. Purisai M.G. Bolin L.M. Di Monte D.A. J.

However, the precise mechanism activating cell death is unknown. A key event in αS-related toxicity is its tendency toward misfolding and aggregation, resulting in its deposition in neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, the Lewy bodies (recently reviewed in Ref. 52.Gupta A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ann. Neurol. 2008; 64: S3-S15PubMed Google Scholar). Various cellular mechanisms were shown to mediate αS toxicity, including inhibition of the proteasome and the cellular quality control, disruption of axonal transport, synaptic transmission, and mitochondrial dysfunction and enhancement of oxidative stress (reviewed in Ref. 11.Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Neuron. 2006; 52: 33-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Mitochondria play a central role in the regulation of apoptotic cell death, and indeed there is considerable evidence suggesting that apoptosis might account for cell death in PD (53.Hirsch E.C.

Specifically, αS expression inhibits endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking, resulting in cytotoxicity that was prevented by Rab1 expression (56.Cooper A.A. Gitler A.D. Cashikar A. Haynes C.M. Hill K.J. Bhullar B. Liu K. Xu K. Strathearn K.E. Liu F. Cao S. Caldwell K.A. Caldwell G.A. Marsischky G. Kolodner R.D. Labaer J. Rochet J.C. Bonini N.M. Lindquist S. Science. 2006; 313: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). It was further shown that αS expression affected vesicle docking or fusion to the Golgi apparatus after an efficient budding from the endoplasmic reticulum (57.Gitler A.D. Bevis B.J. Shorter J. Strathearn K.E. Hamamichi S. Su L.J. Caldwell K.A. Caldwell G.A. Rochet J.C. McCaffery J.M. Barlowe C. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, αS overexpression inhibited evoked catecholamine release and increased the “docked” vesicle pool (58.Larsen K.E. Schmitz Y. Troyer M.D. Mosharov E. Dietrich P. Quazi A.Z. Savalle M. Nemani V. Chaudhry F.A. Edwards R.H. Stefanis L. Sulzer D. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11915-11922Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested an indirect role for αS in promoting the assembly of the SNARE complex (59.Chandra S.

SNAREs catalyze the fusion of vesicles with their target membranes to enable the release of cargo from the vesicle (reviewed in Refs. 61.Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and 62.Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). Collectively, growing evidence implicates αS in membrane trafficking, including endocytosis and exocytosis. We have recently shown that αS specifically affects synaptic vesicle recycling by activating clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Based on our findings we suggested that αS affects synaptic function and strength (63.Ben Gedalya T. Loeb V. Israeli E. Altschuler Y. Selkoe D.J. Sharon R. Traffic. 2009; 10: 218-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Importantly, we found a correlation between the αS activity and levels of αS soluble oligomers. Specifically, the more αS oligomers, the more endocytic activity (63.Ben Gedalya T. Loeb V. Israeli E. Altschuler Y. Selkoe D.J. Sharon R. Traffic. 2009; 10: 218-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Membrane trafficking is also implicated in mitochondrial dynamics, involving fusion and fission events. PD toxins, such as 6-hydroxydopamine, rotenone, and the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion induce mitochondrial fission and cell death (64.Barsoum M.J. Yuan H. Gerencser A.A. Liot G. Kushnareva Y.

Med. 2008; 44: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The role of mitochondrial dynamics in PD was recently emphasized by the finding that PD-related genes PINK-1 and parkin regulate mitochondrial fission/fusion events (67.Vila M. Ramonet D. Perier C. J. Neurochem. 2008; 107: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to find out whether αS oligomers or αS cytotoxicity is involved in mitochondrial dynamics.The ongoing debate concerning the identification of the toxic αS forms, whether it is the soluble αS oligomers, insoluble aggregates, or Lewy bodies, relies on analogies and evidence from other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Huntington diseases (recently reviewed in Ref. 68.Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Haass C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A major difficulty in identifying the toxic αS form is the absence of clear definite information regarding the normal function of αS or the initial deleterious mechanism(s) activated in PD by αS. Additionally, aging and αS pathology were recently shown to amplify αS expression and toxicity (36.Chu Y. Kordower J.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 25: 134-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), adding an additional aspect of αS complexity. The results presented herein provide a negative clue as to the pathogenic effects of αS by denying a deleterious role for αS toxic forms in complex I activity.

Among these pathways, p38 MAPK signaling was found to be involved in stress-induced melanogenesis and to be activated by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and ultraviolet irradiation. Previous studies have shown that α-MSH-stimulated melanogenesis can be inhibited by blocking p38 MAPK activity with SB203580, a pyridinyl imidazole compound. Consistent with this, we observed that pyridinyl imidazoles (SB203580 and SB202190) inhibited both basal and α-MSH-induced melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells. However, SB202474, which has no ability to inhibit p38 MAPK activity and is usually used as a negative control compound in p38 MAPK studies, also suppressed melanin synthesis induction. Furthermore, the independence of the p38 kinase pathway from the repression of melanogenesis by pyridinyl imidazole compounds was also confirmed by small interfering RNA experiments. Interfering with p38 MAPK expression surprisingly stimulated melanogenesis and tyrosinase family protein expression. Although the molecular mechanism(s) by which p38 promotes the degradation of melanogenic enzymes remain to be determined, the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was demonstrated by co-treatment with the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 and the relative decrease in the ubiquitination of tyrosinase in cells transfected with p38-specific small interfering RNA.

Thus far, one of the most important signaling pathways found to induce melanogenesis is the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Cyclic AMP, through the activation of PKA and cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 transcription factors, up-regulates the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf), the master regulator of melanogenesis that controls the production of the melanogenic enzymes (tyrosinase, TRP-1, and DCT) (20.Aksan I.

The role of Mitf in determining the extent of melanocyte pigmentation has also been shown by studies utilizing a variety of depigmenting agents that have demonstrated preceding reductions in Mitf expression (18.Jiménez-Cervantes C.

However, the effective contribution of p38 MAPK in melanogenesis is not completely understood. Corre et al. (35.Corre S. Primot A. Sviderskaya E. Bennett D.C. Vaulont S. Goding C.R. Galibert M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51226-51233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the p38-activated USF-1 transcription factor is responsible for UV-induced expression of two genes upstream in the pigmentation cascade: pro-opionmelanocortin and melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), which encode a precursor of α-MSH and its receptor, respectively. Because it has been reported that α-MSH regulates MC1R expression and function in mouse melanoma cells (37.Rouzaud F. Annereau J.P. Valencia J.C. Costin G.E. Hearing V.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2154-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it is possible that the activation of p38 may also contribute to the melanogenic rate under conditions of hormonal stimulation by increasing receptor density after its activation and internalization. Even if these data strengthen the idea that p38 MAPK is implicated in the regulation of important steps in melanocyte differentiation, the involvement of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in α-MSH-induced melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells is, at the moment, exclusively demonstrated using a small cell-permeant inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (SB203580) (38.Singh S.K. Sarkar C. Mallick S. Saha B. Bera R. Bhadra R. Pigment Cell Res. 2005; 18: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 39.Kim D.S. Park S.H. Kwon S.B. Na J.I. Huh C.H. Park K.C. Arch. Pharm. Res. 2007; 30: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which is a member of the pyridinyl imidazole class of compounds. On the other hand, several studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway leads to stimulation of melanogenesis. Treatment of B16 melanoma cells with MEK inhibitors blocks ERK activation and increases steady-state mRNA levels of mRNAs and the corresponding protein expression levels of the melanogenic antigens melan-A/Mart-1, gp100, and tyrosinase (40.Kono M. Dunn I.S. Durda P.J. Butera D. Rose L.B. Haggerty T.J. Benson E.M. Kurnick J.T. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 stimulates tyrosinase activity and potentiates the effect of cAMP on melanogenesis (2.Englaro W. Bertolotto C. Buscà R. Brunet A. Pagès G. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9966-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover, ERK activation by sphingosine-1-phosphate, ceramide, or sphingosylphorylcholine is responsible for reducing melanogenesis by down-regulating Mitf (39.Kim D.S. Park S.H. Kwon S.B. Na J.I.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1699-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), indicating that activation of the ERK pathway can lead to attenuation of melanogenesis. Altogether, these studies suggest that there are not conclusive data regarding the MAPK contribution to melanogenesis. In this study, we present evidence that down-regulation of p38 expression leads to an increase in the levels of differentiation-associated markers such as melanin synthesis and the expression of tyrosinase and related proteins. Our experiments demonstrate that the mechanism involved in p38-mediated regulation of melanogenesis is the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, where melanogenic enzymes are degraded. B16-F0 murine melanoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4 mml-glutamine + 7% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For the induction studies, the cells were plated, and 24 h later, the medium was removed, and the cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics with or without pharmacological treatment in the absence of phenol red. Normal human melanocytes (NHM) isolated from several independent Caucasians foreskins were maintained in M-254 medium with human melanocyte growth supplements (Cascade Biologics, Inc.) and used for passages 2–6. NHM were treated with compounds for 5 days before analysis because melanogenesis is a much longer process in these cells than in B16 melanoma cells. SB202190 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole), SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole), actinomycin D, cycloheximide, α-MSH, dimethyl sulfoxide, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), and MG132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. SB202474 (4-ethyl-2-(p-methoxyphenyl)-5-(4′-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole) was from Calbiochem. Extracellular melanin release was measured as previously described (16.Bellei B. Flori E. Izzo E. Maresca V. Picardo M. Cell Signal. 2008; 20: 1750-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, B16-F0 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104/cm2 and incubated overnight, prior to α-MSH and pharmacological administration. The plates were then incubated for additional 72 h, after which 200 μl of the medium were removed, and the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm using a plate reader. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer or with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were analyzed for protein concentration, and the pellets were solubilized in 200 μl of 1 m NaOH. Following an incubation period of 2 h at 60 °C, the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm using a plate reader. Standard curves using synthetic melanin (0–250 μg/ml) were prepared in duplicate for each experiment. Melanin production was calculated by normalizing the total melanin values with protein content (μg of melanin/mg of protein) and reported as a percentage of control. For this purpose protein content was determined using Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad) that has been demonstrated as the best procedure in the presence of synthetic and natural melanin (45.Borovansky J. Lipsova A. Kozakova M. Borovansky J. Pigment Cell Res. 2008; 21: 298-299Google Scholar). p38 siRNA (m2) duplex (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), SignalSilencing® pool p38 MAP kinase siRNA (Cell Signaling) and siRNA-Mitf SiGENOME SMARTpool (Dhamacon) were used to interfere with p38 and Mitf expression, respectively. For dose-dependent experiments, the siRNA transfection protocol suggested by the manufacturer was optimized as follows: 5.0 × 104 cells were plated on 12-well dishes and left to grow overnight. The following day, the cells were transfected with 10, 30, or 60 pmol of siRNA dimers (p38) and 1, 3, or 6 μl of transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) mixed in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). An equivalent amount of nonspecific siRNA was used as a negative control. Twenty-four hours following transfection, α-MSH was added to some samples in agreement with the experimental design. For all of the following experiments in which the B16 cells were incubated with multiple treatments after transfection, the cells were transfected with Amaxa Nucleofector System to ensure identical siRNA efficiency among the plates, because in this case the cells were transfected altogether in a single cuvette and plated immediately after nucleofection. For this purpose, we transferred 200 pmol of p38-specific siRNA into 1.6 × 106 cells using the Amaxa nucleofector cell line kit R (Program P-031). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that this optimized protocol produces transfection efficiency similar to the maximum obtained by lipofection (60 pmol/5.0 × 105). For double interfering experiments, 200 pmol of p38 siRNA dimers were mixed with a dose of 200 pmol of Mitf siRNA to transfect 1.6 × 106 cells. To obtain the same interfering efficiency in all samples, 200 pmol of nonspecific duplex were added in single transfected cells. The interference efficiencies were evaluated by Western blot and/or quantitative PCR in all experiments. Tyrosinase enzyme activity was estimated by measuring the rate of l-DOPA oxidation as previously described (16.Bellei B. Flori E. Izzo E. Maresca V. Picardo M. Cell Signal. 2008; 20: 1750-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the cells were treated with p38-specific siRNA or control siRNA for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum ± α-MSH. At the end point, the cells were solubilized with phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1% Triton X-100. The cells were then disrupted by freezing and thawing, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. After protein quantification and adjustment of protein concentrations with lysis buffer, 80 μl of each lysate (each containing the same amount of protein) were aliquoted into the wells of a 96-well plate, and 20 μl of 5 mml-DOPA were then added to each well. The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 475 nm following a 20-min incubation period at 37 °C. The measurement was repeated five times. Whole cell extracts were prepared with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) containing Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad) that has been demonstrated as the best procedure in pigment cells. Aliquots of cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then treated with the appropriate antibodies. Anti-Mitf, anti-p38, anti-Ub(P4D1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and anti-P-p38 (Cell Signaling) were used at 1:500; anti-tyrosinase, anti-TRP-1, and anti-TRP-2/DCT antibodies were used at 1:3,000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); and anti-β-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 1:15,000. Horseradish peroxide-conjugated goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, and bovine anti-goat immunoglobulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used at 1:5,000, 1:10,000, and 1:3,000, respectively. Antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Western blot assays were representative of at least three experiments. The protein levels were quantified by measuring the optical densities of specific bands using a GS-800 calibrated image densitometer (Bio-Rad). Cell extracts (400 μg of total protein in 500 μl of lysis buffer) were incubated with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) under continuous mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (2,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C), the supernatants were used as precleared cell extracts. The precleared cell extracts were incubated with 1.6 μg of the anti-tyrosinase antibody. After overnight continuous mixing at 4 °C, 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose were added for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were precipitated by brief centrifugation, and the pellets were washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer. Finally, the absorbed proteins were eluted with 30 μl of Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min. Each supernatant was separated on 10% Tris-glycine SDS gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Ub(P4D1) was used to detect ubiquitinated tyrosinase precipitated with anti-tyrosinase antibody. The level of ubiquitinated tyrosinase was quantified by measuring the optical densities of specific bands as reported in the protocol for Western blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA in the presence of 0.5 μg/reaction of oligo(dT)15 primer using the Improm IITM reverse transcription system (Promega). First strand cDNA (1 μl) was amplified using a iQ5 light cycler (Bio-Rad). Aliquots (1 μl) of the reverse transcription products were amplified in a reaction mixture (15 μl) containing Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master mix and 25 pmol of forward and reverse primers. Bio-Rad optical system software was used to determine the mRNA levels. Data analysis was done by normalization to β-actin mRNA levels. PCRs were done in triplicate. Forward and reverse primers were as follows: p38, AATGGAGTCCTGAGCACCTG-3′ and 5′-GACAGACGAACAGACAGACAC-3′; Mitf, 5′-GTATGAACACGCACTCTCGAG-3′ and 5′-CAGGAGTTGCTGATGGTAAG-3′; tyrosinase, 5′-GGCCAGCTTTCAGGCAGAGGT-3′ and 5′-TGGTGCTTCATGGGCAAAATC-3′; TRP-1, 5′-AAGCAGACATCCAACAACACTAG-3′ and 5′-GCAAGAGTTCAGAACACAGGTC-3′; DCT, 5′-GCAAGAGATACACGGAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTAAGGCATCATCATCATCACTAC-3′; and β-actin, 5′-GACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGATTACT-3′ and 5′-TGATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGT-3′. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t tests. The minimal level of significance was p ≤ 0.05 (*) or p ≤ 0.01 (**). In in vitro culture, melanin synthesized intracellularly is secreted into the extracellular culture fluid and represents at the specific times of incubation used in this study a considerable amount of total melanin produced (13.Smalley K Eisen T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16.Bellei B. Flori E. Izzo E. Maresca V. Picardo M.

For this reason, the melanin released into the medium of each well was determined spectrophotometrically in addition to intracellular melanin quantification (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Previous studies have shown that α-MSH-stimulated melanogenesis can be inhibited by blocking p38 MAPK activity with SB203580, a pyrimidinyl imidazole compound (13.Smalley K Eisen T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15.Ahn J.H. Jin S.H. Kang H.Y. Arch. Dermatol.

In this study, stimulation of B16 cells with α-MSH (1 μm) caused a 5.6-fold increase in total melanin production (Fig. 1A). In accordance with the literature, co-treatment with SB203580 (1–20 μm) caused a significant reduction in α-MSH-induced melanogenesis (p < 0.05). Similarly, the pyrimidinyl imidazole SB202190 decreased melanogenesis at the same concentrations. However, co-treatment with the structural analog SB202474, which has no effect on p38 MAPK activity and is commonly included as a negative control when SB203580 or its analog SB202190 are used to investigate the involvement of p38 MAPK (49.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), caused a similar inhibition of α-MSH-stimulated pigmentation (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). Similar results were also obtained using the cAMP elevating agent forskolin (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, the effect of each compound on the basal level of melanogenesis in B16 cells was tested (Fig. 1A). In this case the cells were treated with compounds for 96 h before analysis because spontaneous melanogenesis is a much longer process. The results demonstrated that all pyridinyl imidazole compounds caused a dose-dependent reduction of basal melanogenesis also in unstimulated B16 cells. Accordingly, with the concept that pyridinylimidazoles may block the biological activity of p38 kinase by binding to the ATP pockets of active and inactive forms of the enzyme with equal affinity without affecting its rate of activation (50.Young P.R.

In the wild-type silkworm, which has both genes, Yellow blood (Y) and Yellow cocoon (C), lutein is transferred selectively from the hemolymph lipoprotein to the silk gland cells where it is accumulated into the cocoon. The Y gene encodes an intracellular carotenoid-binding protein (CBP) containing a lipid-binding domain known as the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer domain.

In C mutant larvae, Cameo2 expression was strongly repressed in the silk gland in a specific manner, resulting in colorless silk glands and white cocoons. The developmental profile of Cameo2 expression, CBP expression, and lutein pigmentation in the silk gland of the yellow cocoon strain were correlated.

https://openalex.org/W2056842941,"Background We hypothesized that genetic modification of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) transgene, a morphogen during embryonic development and embryonic and adult stem cell growth, improved their survival and angiogenic potential in the ischemic heart via iNOS/netrin/PKC pathway. Methods/Principal Findings MSCs from young Fisher-344 rat bone marrow were purified and transfected with pCMV Shh plasmid (ShhMSCs). Immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and Western blotting showed higher expression of Shh in ShhMSCs which also led to increased expression of angiogenic and pro-survival growth factors in ShhMSCs. Significantly improved migration and tube formation was seen in ShhMSCs as compared to empty vector transfected MSCs (EmpMSCs). Significant upregulation of netrin-1 and iNOS was observed in ShhMSCs in PI3K independent but PKC dependent manner. For in vivo studies, acute myocardial infarction model was developed in Fisher-344 rats. The animals were grouped to receive 70 µl basal DMEM without cells (group-1) or containing 1×106 EmpMSCs (group-2) and ShhMSCs (group-3). Group-4 received recombinant netrin-1 protein injection into the infarcted heart. FISH and sry-quantification revealed improved survival of ShhMSCs post engraftment. Histological studies combined with fluorescent microspheres showed increased density of functionally competent blood vessels in group-3 and group-4. Echocardiography showed significantly preserved heart function indices post engraftment with ShhMSCs in group-3 animals. Conclusions/Significance Reprogramming of stem cells with Shh maximizes their survival and angiogenic potential in the heart via iNOS/netrin-1/PKC signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1989266322,"Non-muscle cells express multiple myosin-II motor proteins myosin IIA, myosin IIB and myosin IIC transcribed from different loci in the human genome. Due to a significant homology in their sequences, these ubiquitously expressed myosin II motor proteins are believed to have overlapping cellular functions, but the mechanistic details are not elucidated. The present study uncovered a mechanism that coordinates the distinctly localized myosin IIA and myosin IIB with unexpected opposite mechanical roles in maneuvering lamellipodia extension, a critical step in the initiation of cell invasion, spreading, and migration. Myosin IIB motor protein by localizing at the front drives lamellipodia extension during cell spreading. On the other hand, myosin IIA localizes next to myosin IIB and attenuates or retracts lamellipodia extension. Myosin IIA and IIB increase cell adhesion by regulating focal contacts formation in the spreading margins and central part of the spreading cell, respectively. Spreading cells expressing both myosin IIA and myosin IIB motor proteins display an organized actin network consisting of retrograde filaments, arcs and central filaments attached to focal contacts. This organized actin network especially arcs and focal contacts formation in the spreading margins were lost in myosin IIÂ cells. Surprisingly, myosin IIB̂ cells displayed long parallel actin filaments connected to focal contacts in the spreading margins. Thus, with different roles in the regulation of the actin network and focal contacts formation, both myosin IIA and IIB determine the fate of lamellipodia extension during cell spreading."
https://openalex.org/W1982771974,"Background Double positive (DP) CD4CD8 Tαβ cells have been reported in normal individuals as well as in different pathological conditions including inflammatory diseases, viral infections and cancer, but their function remains to be elucidated. We recently reported the increased frequency of DP Tαβ cells in human breast pleural effusions. This manuscript addresses the question of the existence and above all the role of this non-conventional DP sub-population among tumor associated lymphocytes in melanomas. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed the intratumoral cell infiltrate in solid metastasis (n = 6) and tumor invaded lymph nodes (n = 26) samples from melanomas patients by multiparametric cytometry. Here we documented for the first time significant increased frequency of DP T cells in about 60% of melanoma tumors compared to blood samples. Interestingly, a high proportion of these cells produced TNF-α in response to autologous melanoma cell lines. Besides, they are characterized by a unique cytokine profile corresponding to higher secretion of IL-13, IL-4 and IL-5 than simple positive T cells. In deep analysis, we derived a representative tumor-reactive DP T cell clone from a melanoma patient's invaded lymph node. This clone was restricted by HLA-A*2402 and recognized both autologous and allogeneic tumor cells of various origins as well as normal cells, suggesting that the target antigen was a ubiquitous self antigen. However, this DP T cell clone failed to kill HLA-A*2402 EBV-transformed B cells, probably due to the constitutive expression of immunoproteasome by these cells. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, we can postulate that, according to their broad tumor reactivity and to their original cytokine profile, the tumor associated DP T cells could participate in immune responses to tumors in vivo. Therefore, the presence of these cells and their role will be crucial to address in cancer patients, especially in the context of immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W1965208100,"Neuroblastoma is the most frequent extracranial solid tumor in children. Here, we report that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (PS-341, Velcade) activated the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins PMAIP1/Noxa and BBC3/Puma and induced accumulation of anti-apoptotic MCL1 as well as repression of anti-apoptotic BCL2L1/Bcl-xL. Retroviral expression of Bcl-xL, but not of MCL1, prevented apoptosis by bortezomib. Gene knockdown of Noxa by shRNA technology significantly reduced apoptosis, whereas Puma knockdown did not affect cell death kinetics. Immunoprecipitation revealed that endogenous Noxa associated with both, Bcl-xL and MCL1, suggesting that in neuronal cells Noxa can neutralize Bcl-xL, explaining the pronounced protective effect of Bcl-xL. Tetracycline-regulated Noxa expression did not trigger cell death per se but sensitized to bortezomib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. This implies that the induction of Noxa is necessary but not sufficient for bortezomib-induced apoptosis. We conclude that MCL1 steady-state expression levels do not affect sensitivity to proteasome-inhibitor treatment in neuronal tumor cells, and that both the repression of Bcl-xL and the activation of Noxa are necessary for bortezomib-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1993892088,"Background A frequent manifestation of asthma, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), occurs in 30–50% of asthmatics and is characterized by increased release of inflammatory eicosanoids. The objective of this study was to identify genes differentially expressed in EIB and to understand the function of these genes in the biology of asthma. Methodology/Principal Findings Genome-wide expression profiling of airway leukocytes and epithelial cells obtained by induced sputum was conducted in two groups of subjects with asthma with and without EIB (n = 7 per group), at baseline and following exercise challenge. Based on the results of the gene expression study, additional comparisons were made with a normal control group (n = 10). Localization studies were conducted on epithelial brushings and biopsies from an additional group of asthmatics with EIB (n = 3). Genes related to epithelial repair and mast cell infiltration including β-tryptase and carboxypeptidase A3 were upregulated by exercise challenge in the asthma group with EIB. A gene novel to asthma pathogenesis, transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), was the most differentially expressed at baseline between the groups. In vivo studies confirmed the increased expression of TGM2 in airway cells and airway lining fluid, and demonstrate that TGM2 is avidly expressed in the asthmatic airway epithelium. In vitro studies using recombinant human enzymes reveal that TGM2 augments the enzymatic activity of secreted phospholipase A2 (PLA2) group X (sPLA2-X), an enzyme recently implicated in asthma pathogenesis. Conclusions/Significance This study found that TGM2, a mediator that is novel to asthma pathogenesis, is overexpressed in asthmatic airways and functions to increase sPLA2-X enzymatic activity. Since PLA2 serves as the first rate-limiting step leading to eicosanoid formation, these results suggest that TGM2 may be a key initiator of the airway inflammatory cascade in asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2083503378,"We report the first crystal structure of a 1:2 hormone.receptor complex that involves prolactin (PRL) as the ligand, at 3.8-A resolution. Stable ternary complexes were obtained by generating affinity-matured PRL variants harboring an N-terminal tail from ovine placental lactogen, a closely related PRL receptor (PRLR) ligand. This structure allows one to draw up an exhaustive inventory of the residues involved at the PRL.PRLR site 2 interface, consistent with all previously reported site-directed mutagenesis data. We propose, with this description, an interaction model involving three structural components of PRL site 2 (""three-pin plug""): the conserved glycine 129 of helix alpha3, the hydrogen bond network involving surrounding residues (glycine cavity), and the N terminus. The model provides a molecular basis for the properties of the different PRL analogs designed to date, including PRLR antagonists. Finally, comparison of our 1:2 PRL.PRLR(2) structure with those of free PRL and its 1:1 complex indicates that the structure of PRL undergoes significant changes when binding the first, but not the second receptor. This suggests that the second PRLR moiety adapts to the 1:1 complex rather than the opposite. In conclusion, this structure will be a useful guiding tool for further investigations of the molecular mechanisms involved in PRLR dimerization and activation, as well as for the optimization of PRLR antagonists, an emerging class of compounds with high therapeutic potential against breast and prostate cancer."

The present work focused on the structural characterization of a new heparan sulfate (HS)-like polymer isolated from the mollusk Nodipecten nodosus (Linnaeus, 1758) and on its anticoagulant and antithrombotic properties. Total glycans were extracted from the mollusk and fractionated by ethanol precipitation. The main component (>90%) was identified as HS-like glycosaminoglycan, representing ∼4.6 mg g−1 of dry tissue. The mollusk HS resists degradation with heparinase I but is cleaved by nitrous acid. Analysis of the mollusk glycan by one-dimensional 1H, two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy, and heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance revealed characteristic signals of glucuronic acid and glucosamine residues. Signals corresponding to anomeric protons of nonsulfated, 3- or 2-sulfated glucuronic acid as well as N-sulfated and/or 6-sulfated glucosamine were also observed. The mollusk HS has an anticoagulant activity of 36 IU mg−1, 5-fold lower than porcine heparin (180 IU mg−1), as measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time assay. It also inhibits factor Xa (IC50 = 0.835 μg ml−1) and thrombin (IC50 = 9.3 μg ml−1) in the presence of antithrombin. In vivo assays demonstrated that at the dose of 1 mg kg−1, the mollusk HS inhibited thrombus growth in photochemically injured arteries. No bleeding effect, factor XIIa-mediated kallikrein activity, or toxic effect on fibroblast cells was induced by the invertebrate HS at the antithrombotic dose.

https://openalex.org/W2018137536,"The hydroxylated benzene metabolite hydroquinone (HQ) is mainly generated from benzene, an important industrial chemical, and is also a common dietary component. Although numerous reports have addressed the tumorigenesis-inducing effects of HQ, few papers have explored its molecular regulatory mechanism in immunological responses. In this study we characterized Akt (protein kinase B)-targeted regulation by HQ and its derivatives, in suppressing inflammatory responses using cellular, molecular, biochemical, and immunopharmacological approaches. HQ down-regulated inflammatory responses such as NO production, surface levels of pattern recognition receptors, and cytokine gene expression with IC(50) values that ranged from 5 to 10 microm. HQ inhibition was mediated by blocking NF-kappaB activation via suppression of its translocation pathway, which is composed of Akt, I kappaB alpha kinase beta, and I kappaB alpha. Of the targets in this pathway, HQ directly targeted and bound to the sulfhydryl group of Cys-310 of Akt and sequentially interrupted the phosphorylation of both Thr-308 and Ser-473 by mediation of beta-mercaptoethanol, according to the liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis of the interaction of HQ with an Akt-derived peptide. Therefore, our data suggest that Akt and its target site Cys-310 can be considered as a prime molecular target of HQ-mediated immunosuppression and for novel anti-Akt-targeted immunosuppressive drugs."

Here, we examined the role of Shoc2 in the spatio-temporal regulation of Ras by using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor, together with computational modeling. In epidermal growth factor-stimulated HeLa cells, RNA-mediated Shoc2 knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK with half-maximal inhibition, but not the activation of Ras. For the live monitoring of Ras binding to Raf, we utilized a FRET biosensor wherein Ras and the Ras-binding domain of Raf were connected tandemly and sandwiched with acceptor and donor fluorescent proteins for the FRET measurement. With this biosensor, we found that Shoc2 was required for the rapid interaction of Ras with Raf upon epidermal growth factor stimulation. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the kinetics, we developed two computational models that might account for the action of Shoc2 in the Ras-ERK signaling. One of these models, the Shoc2 accelerator model, provided a reasonable explanation of the experimental observations. In this Shoc2 accelerator model, Shoc2 accelerated both the association and dissociation of Ras-Raf interaction. We propose that Shoc2 regulates the spatio-temporal patterns of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway primarily by accelerating the Ras-Raf interaction.

https://openalex.org/W1974857683,"Background The vacuolar H+-ATPase, or V-ATPase, is a highly-conserved multi-subunit enzyme that transports protons across membranes at the expense of ATP. The resulting proton gradient serves many essential functions, among them energizing transport of small molecules such as neurotransmitters, and acidifying organelles such as endosomes. The enzyme is not present in the plasma membrane from which a phagosome is formed, but is rapidly delivered by fusion with endosomes that already bear the V-ATPase in their membranes. Similarly, the enzyme is thought to be retrieved from phagosome membranes prior to exocytosis of indigestible material, although that process has not been directly visualized. Methodology To monitor trafficking of the V-ATPase in the phagocytic pathway of Dictyostelium discoideum, we fed the cells yeast, large particles that maintain their shape during trafficking. To track pH changes, we conjugated the yeast with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Cells were labeled with VatM-GFP, a fluorescently-tagged transmembrane subunit of the V-ATPase, in parallel with stage-specific endosomal markers or in combination with mRFP-tagged cytoskeletal proteins. Principal Findings We find that the V-ATPase is commonly retrieved from the phagosome membrane by vesiculation shortly before exocytosis. However, if the cells are kept in confined spaces, a bulky phagosome may be exocytosed prematurely. In this event, a large V-ATPase-rich vacuole coated with actin typically separates from the acidic phagosome shortly before exocytosis. This vacuole is propelled by an actin tail and soon acquires the properties of an early endosome, revealing an unexpected mechanism for rapid recycling of the V-ATPase. Any V-ATPase that reaches the plasma membrane is also promptly retrieved. Conclusions/Signficance Thus, live cell microscopy has revealed both a usual route and alternative means of recycling the V-ATPase in the endocytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2087744855,"Protein stability under changing conditions is of vital importance for the cell and under the control of a fine-tuned network of molecular chaperones. Aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases are directly associated with enhanced protein instability. Employing C. elegans expressing GFP-tagged luciferase as a reporter for evaluation of protein stability we show that the chaperoning strategy of body wall muscle cells and neurons is significantly different and that both are differently affected by aging. Muscle cells of young worms are largely resistant to heat stress, which is directly mediated by the stress response controlled through Heat Shock Transcription Factor 1. During recovery following heat stress the ability to refold misfolded proteins is missing. Young neurons are highly susceptible to chronic heat stress, but show a high potency to refold or disaggregate proteins during subsequent recovery. The particular proteome instability in neurons results from a delayed induction of the heat shock response. In aged neurons protein stability is increased during heat stress, whereas muscle cells show enhanced protein instability due to a deteriorated heat shock response. An efficient refolding activity is absent in both aged tissues. These results provide molecular insights into the differential protein stabilization capacity in different tissues and during aging."
https://openalex.org/W2052025694,"Background Nerve terminal invasion by an axonal spike activates voltage-gated channels, triggering calcium entry, vesicle fusion, and release of neurotransmitter. Ion channels activated at the terminal shape the presynaptic spike and so regulate the magnitude and duration of calcium entry. Consequently characterization of the functional properties of ion channels at nerve terminals is crucial to understand the regulation of transmitter release. Direct recordings from small neocortical nerve terminals have revealed that external [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]o) indirectly regulates a non-selective cation channel (NSCC) in neocortical nerve terminals via an unknown [Ca2+]o sensor. Here, we identify the first component in a presynaptic calcium signaling pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings By combining genetic and pharmacological approaches with direct patch-clamp recordings from small acutely isolated neocortical nerve terminals we identify the extracellular calcium sensor. Our results show that the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a previously identified G-protein coupled receptor that is the mainstay in serum calcium homeostasis, is the extracellular calcium sensor in these acutely dissociated nerve terminals. The NSCC currents from reduced function mutant CaSR mice were less sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]o than wild-type. Calindol, an allosteric CaSR agonist, reduced NSCC currents in direct terminal recordings in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. In contrast, glutamate and GABA did not affect the NSCC currents. Conclusions/Significance Our experiments identify CaSR as the first component in the [Ca2+]o sensor-NSCC signaling pathway in neocortical terminals. Decreases in [Ca2+]o will depress synaptic transmission because of the exquisite sensitivity of transmitter release to [Ca2+]o following its entry via voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. CaSR may detects such falls in [Ca2+]o and increase action potential duration by increasing NSCC activity, thereby attenuating the impact of decreases in [Ca2+]o on release probability. CaSR is positioned to detect the dynamic changes of [Ca2+]o and provide presynaptic feedback that will alter brain excitability."

However, the molecular mechanisms by which the IFI16 protein contributes to cellular senescence-associated cell growth arrest remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that increased levels of IFI16 protein in normal HDFs and in HeLa cells negatively regulate the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene. Methodology/Principal Findings We optimized conditions for real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assays to detect relatively low levels of hTERT mRNA, protein, and telomerase activity that are found in HDFs. Using the optimized conditions, we report that treatment of HDFs with inhibitors of cell cycle progression, such as aphidicolin or CGK1026, which resulted in reduced steady-state levels of IFI16 mRNA and protein, was associated with increases in hTERT mRNA and protein levels and telomerase activity. In contrast, knockdown of IFI16 expression in cells increased the expression of c-Myc, a positive regulator of hTERT expression. Additionally, over-expression of IFI16 protein in cells inhibited the c-Myc-mediated stimulation of the activity of hTERT-luc-reporter and reduced the steady-state levels of c-Myc and hTERT. Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrated that increased levels of IFI16 protein in HDFs down-regulate the expression of hTERT gene. Our observations will serve basis to understand how increased cellular levels of the IFI16 protein may contribute to certain aging-dependent diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2143087925,"Trypanosoma brucei does not respond transcriptionally to several endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions, including tunicamycin or dithiothreitol, indicating the absence of a conventional unfolded protein response. This suggests divergent mechanisms for quality control (QC) of ER protein folding and export may be present in trypanosomes. As the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) represents approximately 90% of trypanosome plasma membrane protein, it is possible that VSG has evolved to fold efficiently to minimize ER folding burden.We demonstrate the presence of a QC system by pharmacological inhibition of the trypanosome 26S proteasome. This indicates active proteasome-mediated VSG turnover as approximately 2.5 fold more VSG is recovered from cell lysates following MG132 inhibition. An in silico scan of the trypanosome genome identified 28 open reading frames likely to encode polypeptides participating in ER nascent chain maturation. By RNA interference we monitored the importance of these gene products to proliferation, VSG abundance and cell morphology. 68% of the cohort were required for normal proliferation, and depletion of most of these factors resulted in increased VSG abundance, suggesting involvement in ERQC and degradation.The retention of genes for, and the involvement of many gene products in, VSG folding indicates a substantial complexity within the pathways required to perform this role. Counterintuitively, for a super-abundant antigen VSG is apparently made in excess. The biosynthetic excess VSG appears to be turned over efficiently by the proteasome, implying that considerable VSG is rejected by the trypanosome ERQC mechanism. Accordingly, the VSG polypeptide is not well optimized for folding, as only approximately 30% attains the native state. Finally as much of the core ERQC system is functionally conserved in trypanosomes, the pathway has an ancient evolutionary origin, and was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor."

Brain imaging studies suggest a defect in brain-gut communication in IBS with a greater activation of central arousal circuits including the amygdala. Previously, we found that stereotaxic implantation of corticosterone (CORT) onto the amygdala in rats induced anxiety and colonic hypersensitivity. In the present study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify specific brain sites activated in a rat model characterized by anxiety and colonic hypersensitivity.Anesthetized male rats received micropellets (30 microg each) of either CORT or cholesterol (CHOL), to serve as a control, implanted stereotaxically on the dorsal margin of each amygdala. Seven days later, rats were anesthetized and placed in the fMRI magnet (7T). A series of isobaric colorectal balloon distensions (CRD - 90s 'off', 30s 'on', 8 replicates) at two pressures (40 and 60 mmHg) were performed in a standard block-design. Cross correlation statistical analysis was used to determine significant differences between distended and non-distended states in CORT and CHOL-treated animals. Analysis of the imaging data demonstrated greater overall brain activation in response to CRD in rats with CORT implants compared to CHOL controls. Additionally, CORT implants produced significant positive bilateral increases in MRI signal in response to CRD in specific nuclei known as integration sites important in anxiety and pain perception.These data indicate that chronic exposure of the amygdala to elevated levels of CORT enhances overall brain activation in response to CRD, and identified other specific brain regions activated in response to mechanical distension of the colon. These results demonstrate the feasibility of performing fMRI imaging in a rodent model that supports clinical observations in IBS patients with enhanced amygdala activation and symptomatology of abdominal pain and anxiety."

The biological actions of aldosterone are mediated through mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).

Oncol. Hematol. 1994; 17: 93-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the latter case, c-Fos accumulation is controlled at the level of transcription, mRNA turnover, and protein stability (8.Jariel-Encontre, I., Piechaczyk, M.

Moreover, c-Fos intracellular localization (see below) and transcriptional activity are tightly regulated (8.Jariel-Encontre, I., Piechaczyk, M. (2008) Targeted Protein Database [22540], 10.2970/tpdb.2009.0218Google Scholar). In particular, transcriptional activity can be enhanced via phosphorylation of various serines and threonines that may also participate in protein stabilization. The kinases include the MAPK p38, ERK1/2, and ERK5 (12.Bossis G. Ferrara P. Acquaviva C. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Mol.

In contrast, c-Fos can be transcriptionally repressed by sumoylation at a specific lysine (28.Bossis G. Malnou C.E. Farras R. Andermarcher E. Hipskind R. Rodriguez M. Schmidt D. Muller S.

Malnou C.E. Farras R. Andermarcher E. Hipskind R. Rodriguez M. Schmidt D. Muller S. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6964-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Usually, c-Fos accumulates predominantly, if not exclusively, within the nucleus. However, it can also localize within the cytoplasm under certain conditions (17.Higashi N. Kunimoto H. Kaneko S.

Cytoplasmic c-Fos can even associate with the endoplasmic reticulum to activate phospholipid metabolism in a transcription activity-independent manner (32.Bussolino D.F. Guido M.E. Gil G.A.

Carillo S. Blanchard J.M. Jeanteur P. Piechaczyk M. The c-fos and c-jun Families of Transcription Factors. CRC Press Inc., 1994: 87-95Google Scholar), the p38 MAPK (25.Tanos T. Marinissen M.J.

Entry into the nucleus is controlled by at least two nuclear localization signals: a conventional basic nuclear localization signal (35.Arnold M. Nath A. Wohlwend D. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 31046-31059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) mechanisms involving different nuclear export signals are responsible for c-Fos nuclear exit. Interestingly, this involves primarily monomeric c-Fos and is inhibited upon heterodimerization with the Jun proteins (36.Malnou C.E. Salem T. Brockly F. Wodrich H. Piechaczyk M. Jariel-Encontre I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31046-31059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This indicated that dimerization is important, not only for the formation of active AP-1 transcription complexes but also to keep them in the nucleus where they play their transcriptional part. c-Fos nuclear retention, however, varies according to its Jun partner. It is much stronger with c-Jun than with JunB or JunD. This correlates with the strength of interaction of the various c-Fos·Jun dimers (38.Mason J.M. Schmitz M.A. Müller K.M. Arndt K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8989-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here, as a first step to understand why c-Fos nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling is differentially affected by the Juns, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) together with genetic and biochemical approaches to study the intranuclear mobility of different Fos·Jun dimers. Cloning and mutagenesis were performed using standard PCR-based methods. All of the constructs were entirely sequenced. Plasmids and related information are available on request. pcDNA3-based expression plasmids for wild type and mutant rat c-Fos and mouse JunB-FLAG and c-Jun-FLAG were previously described (16.Ferrara P. Andermarcher E. Bossis G. Acquaviva C. Brockly F. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1461-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36.Malnou C.E. Salem T. Brockly F. Wodrich H. Piechaczyk M. Jariel-Encontre I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31046-31059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). EGFP chimeras were obtained by insertion of either rat c-Fos or human Fra1 coding sequences into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). Conditions for culturing and transfecting human HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique were previously described (36.Malnou C.E. Salem T. Brockly F. Wodrich H. Piechaczyk M. Jariel-Encontre I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31046-31059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 3 μg of plasmid/106 cells was routinely used, and the transfection time was limited to 16 h to avoid protein overexpression. To set up the conditions of FRAP experiments on cells expressing levels of EGFP-c-Fos or EGFP similar to that of endogenous c-Fos, we compared the expression level of transfected EGFP-c-Fos with that of endogenous c-Fos expressed upon 1 h of serum stimulation. To this aim, HeLa cells were either transfected for 16 h with the EGFP- or EGFP-c-Fos-encoding vector or stimulated with 20% serum for 1 h. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100. They were then successively incubated with the H125 rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), detecting equally c-Fos and EGFP-c-Fos and an Alexa 647-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probe). The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342, and coverslips were mounted in Permafluor. Cells expressing EGFP-c-Fos and emitting a fluorescence signal in the far red channel similar to that of cells expressing endogenous c-Fos were selected to set up the signal intensity range in the green channel. This allowed us to select under the microscope cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-c-Fos at a level comparable with that of endogenous c-Fos in the green channel. The far red fluorescence (Alexa 647) was monitored using a 560-nm long wavelength path filter, whereas EGFP fluorescence was monitored using a 505–550-nm wavelength band pass filter. Twelve-bit image acquisition was performed using a LSM510 meta microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a plan Apochromat 40× water immersion lens (1.2 numeric aperture) and with a confocal plane of 5 μm. FRAP analyses were performed at 37 °C using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta microscope equipped with a heating chamber and a plan Apochromat 40× water immersion lens (1.2 numeric aperture). To monitor EGFP fluorescence, the cells were excited with an argon laser at a wavelength of 488 nm, and emission was collected using a 505–550-nm wavelength band pass filter. The experiment was divided in three sequences: (i) a prebleaching period, during which 15 images were acquired to define the initial level of fluorescence; (ii) photobleaching, which was carried out on a 2-μm radius circular area of the targeted nucleus using the 488-nm wavelength laser at maximal power with 100 iterations of 256 μs/pixel; and (iii) a postbleaching period, during which fluorescence recovery was monitored every 150 ms for 30 s. Fluorescence recovery was then extracted on recorded images from the bleach area and corrected for experimental fluctuations during acquisition. Correction was carried out by dividing the value of the fluorescence in the bleach area by that of another region in the nucleus far away from the bleached volume. Finally, fluorescence intensities in the bleach area were normalized against the prebleach level of fluorescence intensity. Data fitting was performed using the Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm to determine both the mean half-time of fluorescence recovery (<t½>) and the mobile fraction of the protein (Fmob) using the model in Equation 1, l(t)=l0(A1exp⁡(−tτ1)+A2exp⁡(−tT2))+l30s(A↑(1−exp⁡(−tτ⌉))+A2(1−exp⁡(−rτ2)))$(Eq.1)(Eq. 1) where I0 is the fluorescence intensity at t = 0 (immediately after bleaching) and I∞ is the fluorescence intensity at 30 s (end of recording) and with <t½> = A1τ1 + A2τ2 and with Equation 2. Fmob30=l30s−l01−l0(Eq. 2) The choice of this model was conditioned to a c2 statistical test showing the best fit for all of the data as compared with a monoexponential or a two-dimensional diffusion under a Gaussian illumination model. This model was used without any a priori knowledge of either the geometry of the bleaching or the process of fluorescence recovery. It was therefore used as a model to compare mean half-times of fluorescence recovery. Finally, I0 was determined by bleaching under the same experimental conditions as those described above for c-Fos-EGFP-expressing cells after their fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. I0 was set to 0.4. Cell fractionation procedures are those described in reference (39.Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Approximately 107 cells were scrapped in PBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7) on ice, harvested by low speed centrifugation, resuspended in 200 μl of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)/10 ml of buffer) and let on ice for 8 min. The cells were lysed in the presence of 0.15% Triton X-100 on ice for 4 min and subjected to centrifugation (3500 rpm for 5 min). The supernatant (S) contained both the cytoplasmic and the soluble nuclear fractions. The nuclei were then washed once in 0.15% Triton X-100-containing buffer A and recentrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min. After resuspension in 200 μl of Buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml of buffer), the nuclei suspension was left on ice for 30 min for membrane disruption and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant corresponded to the wash fraction (W). The pellet (P) was subjected to a round of washing in buffer B and centrifugation and finally resuspended in Laemmli electrophoresis loading buffer. The various fractions were then submitted to immunoblotting analyses as previously described (36.Malnou C.E. Salem T. Brockly F. Wodrich H. Piechaczyk M. Jariel-Encontre I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31046-31059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described in Ref. 28.Bossis G. Malnou C.E. Farras R. Andermarcher E. Hipskind R. Rodriguez M. Schmidt D. Muller S. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6964-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar. 107 cells were lysed in 600 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml of buffer). To immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged proteins, 200 μl of lysates were incubated for 3 h in the presence of 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel from Sigma. After centrifugation of cell extract-containing suspensions, the supernatants were collected, whereas the pellets were subjected to five cycles of washing in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and centrifugation. For immunoblotting analyses, total extracts, supernatants, and immunoprecipitated fractions were electrophoresed through 12% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunodetections were carried out with appropriate dilutions of the various following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-c-Fos H125 (sc-7202), rabbit anti-c-Jun H79 (sc-1694), and goat anti-JunB (sc-46G) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. We also used rabbit antisera directed to topoisomerase I (kind gift from Dr J. Soret). The anti-Phax mouse monoclonal and the anti-lamin rabbit polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Drs. D. Lener, and H. Wodrich, respectively. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies were either from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-2313 anti-rabbit and sc-2033 anti-goat horseradish peroxidase conjugates) or from Sigma (A-9044 anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate). Chemoluminescence was detected with the Chemoluminescence reagent Plus kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences using Biomax XAR Kodak films. For analysis of endogenous c-Fos, HeLa cells were grown for 4 days without any change of culture medium and stimulated for 1 h by the addition of 20% fresh serum. For analysis of exogenous c-Fos, HeLa cells were transfected with a vector for EGFP-c-Fos alone or in combination with vectors for either c-Jun or JunB in a 1:2 ratio. Our fractionation procedure combined the methods described in Refs. 40.Burch P.M. Yuan Z. Loonen A. Heintz N.H. Mol.

For immunoblotting analyses, 4 × 106 cells/sample were rinsed with PBS and then scraped from plates in ice-cold CSK buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA). After centrifugation, the pellets were rinsed once with 1 ml of CSK buffer and recentrifuged, and cell lysis was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 0 °C (107 cells/ml) in CSK buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A/ml, 25 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 400 units/ml RNasin. Half of each sample was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer to constitute the total cell extract (T). The nuclei of the other half were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (S1), which contained solubilized cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, were collected. The nuclei were washed once with 200 μl of the above ice-cold lysis buffer and pelleted by centrifugation. Centrifugation supernatants corresponded to the wash fractions (W). The nuclei were then treated with microccocal nuclease (MNase; Roche Applied Science) to remove chromatin- and DNA-bound proteins. To this aim, they were resuspended (107 nuclei/ml) in ice-cold CSK containing 0.5% Triton X-100, protein, and RNase inhibitors as above, 10 mm CaCl2 and 200 units/ml of MNase. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, they were centrifuged, and supernatants (S2) were collected. After resuspension in CSK buffer containing 2 m NaCl and protease and RNase inhibitors as above, they were let for 5 min at 0 °C to remove the remaining DNA and histones. Pellets (P) containing nuclear matrix and associated proteins were collected by centrifugation. Supernatants (S3) contained nuclear proteins soluble in 2 m NaCl. Fluorescence microscope analyses of cells were conducted in parallel. To this aim, the coverslips were placed in culture dishes before cell seeding and processed separately at the time of biochemical cell/nucleus fractionation following the same steps as those described above. After rinsing in the presence of PBS, the cells were subsequently fixed in the presence of 4% paraformaldehyde (i) before lysis, (ii) after Triton X-100 cell lysis, (iii) after MNase treatment, and (iv) after 2 m NaCl treatment. When necessary (non-Triton X-100 lysed cells), an additional permeabilization treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature was added before microscopic analysis. EGFP-c-Fos was followed up using direct fluorescence, whe"
https://openalex.org/W2104890910,"Erythropoiesis is a highly regulated and well-characterized developmental process responsible for providing the oxygen transport system of the body. However, few of the mechanisms involved in this process have been elucidated. Checkpoint Kinase 1 (Chk1) is best known for its role in the cell cycle and DNA damage pathways, and it has been shown to play a part in several pathways which when disrupted can lead to anemia.Here, we show that haploinsufficiency of Chk1 results in 30% of mice developing anemia within the first year of life. The anemic Chk1+/- mice exhibit distorted spleen and bone marrow architecture, and abnormal erythroid progenitors. Furthermore, Chk1+/- erythroid progenitors exhibit an increase in spontaneous DNA damage foci and improper contractile actin ring formation resulting in aberrant enucleation during erythropoiesis. A decrease in Chk1 RNA has also been observed in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts, further supporting a role for Chk1 in clinical anemia.Clinical trials of Chk1 inhibitors are currently underway to treat cancer, and thus it will be important to track the effects of these drugs on red blood cell development over an extended period. Our results support a role for Chk1 in maintaining the balance between erythroid progenitors and enucleated erythroid cells during differentiation. We show disruptions in Chk1 levels can lead to anemia."
https://openalex.org/W2050453056,"Transfer RNA (Gm18) methyltransferase (TrmH) catalyzes methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to a conserved G18 in tRNA. We investigated the recognition mechanism of Thermus thermophilus TrmH for its guanosine target. Thirteen yeast tRNA(Phe) mutant transcripts were prepared in which the modification site and/or other nucleotides in the D-loop were substituted by dG, inosine, or other nucleotides. We then conducted methyl transfer kinetic studies, gel shift assays, and inhibition experiments using these tRNA variants. Sites of methylation were confirmed with RNA sequencing or primer extension. Although the G18G19 sequence is not essential for methylation by TrmH, disruption of G18G19 severely reduces the efficiency of methyl transfer. There is strict recognition of guanosine by TrmH, in that methylation occurs at the adjacent G19 when the G18 is replaced by dG or adenosine. The fact that TrmH methylates guanosine in D-loops from 4 to 12 nucleotides in length suggests that selection of the position of guanosine within the D-loop is relatively flexible. Our studies also demonstrate that the oxygen 6 atom of the guanine base is a positive determinant for TrmH recognition. The recognition process of TrmH for substrate is inducible and product-inhibited, in that tRNAs containing Gm18 are excluded by TrmH. In contrast, substitution of G18 with dG18 results in the formation of a more stable TrmH-tRNA complex. To address the mechanism, we performed the stopped-flow pre-steady state kinetic analysis. The result clearly showed that the binding of TrmH to tRNA is composed of at least three steps, the first bi-molecular binding and the subsequent two uni-molecular induced-fit processes."
https://openalex.org/W2069515723,"Pili have been shown to contribute to the virulence of different Gram-positive pathogenic species. Among other critical steps of bacterial pathogenesis, these structures participate in adherence to host cells, colonization and systemic virulence. Recently, the presence of at least four discrete gene clusters encoding putative pili has been revealed in the major swine pathogen and emerging zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis. However, pili production by this species has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we investigated the functionality of one of these pili clusters, known as the srtF pilus cluster, by the construction of mutant strains for each of the four genes of the cluster as well as by the generation of antibodies against the putative pilin subunits. Results revealed that the S. suis serotype 2 strain P1/7, as well as several other highly virulent invasive S. suis serotype 2 isolates express pili from this cluster. However, in most cases tested, and as a result of nonsense mutations at the 5' end of the gene encoding the minor pilin subunit (a putative adhesin), pili were formed by the major pilin subunit only. We then evaluated the role these pili play in S. suis virulence. Abolishment of the expression of srtF cluster-encoded pili did not result in impaired interactions of S. suis with porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, non-piliated mutants were as virulent as the wild type strain when evaluated in a murine model of S. suis sepsis. Our results show that srtF cluster-encoded, S. suis pili are atypical compared to other Gram-positive pili. In addition, since the highly virulent strains under investigation are unlikely to produce other pili, our results suggest that pili might be dispensable for critical steps of the S. suis pathogenesis of infection."
https://openalex.org/W1998786263,"The sequence specificity of the recombination activating gene (RAG) complex during V(D)J recombination has been well studied. RAGs can also act as structure-specific nuclease; however, little is known about the mechanism of its action. Here, we show that in addition to DNA structure, sequence dictates the pattern and efficiency of RAG cleavage on altered DNA structures. Cytosine nucleotides are preferentially nicked by RAGs when present at single-stranded regions of heteroduplex DNA. Although unpaired thymine nucleotides are also nicked, the efficiency is many fold weaker. Induction of single- or double-strand breaks by RAGs depends on the position of cytosines and whether it is present on one or both of the strands. Interestingly, RAGs are unable to induce breaks when adenine or guanine nucleotides are present at single-strand regions. The nucleotide present immediately next to the bubble sequence could also affect RAG cleavage. Hence, we propose “C(d)C(S)C(S)” (d, double-stranded; s, single-stranded) as a consensus sequence for RAG-induced breaks at single-/double-strand DNA transitions. Such a consensus sequence motif is useful for explaining RAG cleavage on other types of DNA structures described in the literature.

RAGs are normally expressed in B-cells and T-cells (1.Schatz D.G. Baltimore D. Cell. 2004; 116: S103-S106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During V(D)J recombination, the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) subexons are rearranged. Specific sequences present at the ends of the subexon, called recombination signal sequences (RSS) are recognized by RAGs. Each RSS consists of a conserved heptamer and nonamer, separated by a nonconserved spacer, the length of which designates RSS as a 12-signal or 23-signal. Normally during V(D)J recombination, a 12-signal pairs with a 23-signal with the help of proteins like HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1). The nick induced by RAGs during V(D)J recombination is consistently 5′ of the heptamers (2.Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol.

In the recent past, studies have shown that cryptic RSS sites present elsewhere in the genome can also act as off-target sites for RAG misrecognition, leading to chromosomal translocations in lymphoid cancers such as leukemia (21.Raghavan S.C.

In addition to its sequence-specific endonuclease activities, recent studies have shown that the RAG complex can act as a structure-specific nuclease (22.Raghavan S.C. Lieber M.R.

We previously showed that a non-B DNA structure formed at the BCL2 major breakpoint region (MBR) on chromosome 18 involved in t(14;18) translocation in follicular lymphoma can be cleaved by RAGs (25.Raghavan S.C.

Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Further, it was also shown that in addition to the BCL2 MBR structure, other non-B DNA structures, such as heteroduplex DNA and heterologous loops are also targets for the RAG complex (30.Raghavan S.C. Gu J. Swanson P.C. Lieber M.R. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31.Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5904-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The RAG complex can also cleave 3′ overhangs, flap DNA, and gap structures (32.Santagata S. Besmer E. Villa A. Bozzi F. Allingham J.S. Sobacchi C. Haniford D.B. Vezzoni P. Nussenzweig M.C. Pan Z.Q. Cortes P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 935-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All of these studies were done at physiological concentrations of divalent cation, Mg2+. Two independent groups have also shown that RAGs are able to cleave hairpin structures in Mn2+-containing buffer, and this was observed to a much lesser extent in Mg2+ (33.Besmer E. Mansilla-Soto J.

Schatz D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4159-4166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study, we found that the most common translocations in early human B cells occur at CpG sites. We proposed that deamination of methylated cytosines at CpG can lead to small unpaired bubble-like regions in the genome, which RAGs can cleave to generate breaks (35.Tsai A.G. Lu H. Raghavan S.C. Muschen M. Hsieh C.L. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2008; 135: 1130-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The above studies, therefore, suggest that changes in the normal B-DNA structure could make the region vulnerable to RAGs when present in lymphoid tissues. This could explain why lymphoid cells possess elevated levels of chromosomal translocation and other rearrangements compared with non-lymphoid tissues. Such elevated levels of pathological chromosomal rearrangement leads to the altered expression of critical genes resulting in human lymphoid malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma (28.Raghavan S.C. Lieber M.R. Front Biosci. 2007; 12: 4402-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36.Nambiar M. Kari V. Raghavan S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because such structural changes in the DNA could lead to elevated levels of single- and double-strand breaks, those could also account for the increased genomic instability. Our previous studies have shown that when acting as a structure-specific nuclease, RAGs recognize and bind to the single-stranded region of heteroduplex DNA, and the efficiency of the cleavage depends on the length of the single-stranded region (28.Raghavan S.C. Lieber M.R. Front Biosci. 2007; 12: 4402-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30.Raghavan S.C. Gu J. Swanson P.C. Lieber M.R. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31.Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5904-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, there are many important questions unanswered. What dictates the specificity of RAG cleavage when it acts as a structure-specific nuclease? Because, mostly such cleavage on altered DNA structures is pathologic, it is important to know the mechanism which determines whether a given region may be cleaved by RAGs or not. This will also help to understand the mechanism of genomic instability in lymphoid cells. We previously reported the occurrence of strand bias, when RAGs cleave on non-B DNA structures (30.Raghavan S.C. Gu J. Swanson P.C. Lieber M.R. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because double-strand break formation needs two independent nicks in close proximity on the DNA, it was not understood how such nicks can lead to DSBs during chromosomal rearrangements. It has been shown that during sequence-specific cleavage of RSS by RAGs, the coding sequence influences the nicking (37.Cuomo C.A. Mundy C.L. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 38.Ramsden D.A. McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Gellert M.

Thus, the role of neighboring sequences, when RAGs act as a structure-specific nuclease, deserves examination. In the present study we have attempted to understand the mechanism by which RAGs cleave altered DNA structures. Here we report that RAG cleavage on heteroduplex DNA is sequence-dependent. RAGs can cleave heteroduplex DNA only when pyrimidines are present at the single-stranded region. Cytosines are preferred, and when present on both strands, RAG cleavage leads to a double-strand break. We further show that the sequence dependence is also applicable to all other structural alterations studied. Chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma, Amresco, and SRL. DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Fermentas (Glen Burnie, MD). Radioisotope-labeled nucleotides were purchased from BRIT (Hyderabad, India). Culture media were from Sera Laboratory International Limited (West Sussex, RH17 5PB UK), and fetal bovine serum and PenStrep were from Invitrogen. Oligomers were from Sigma. The sequences of oligomers are shown in supplemental Table S1. The oligomers were purified using 8–15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The complementary oligomers were annealed in 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA by boiling for 10 min, followed by slow cooling. Hairpin loop-forming oligomers were incubated without salt in boiling water and were immediately kept on ice for 30 min before use. The 5′ end labeling of the oligomeric DNA was done using T4 polynucleotide kinase in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate,1 mm DTT, and [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 1 h. The labeled substrates were purified using Qiagen quick nucleotide removal kit and stored at −80 °C until used. Both core RAG1 (cRAG1) and core RAG2 (cRAG2) are cloned in vector pEBG in the BamHI/NotI site, and they are expressed as N-terminal GST fusion proteins under transcriptional control of elongation factor 1α promoter as described earlier (31.Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5904-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39.Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8094-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for mouse cRAG1 (amino acids 384–1008) and mouse cRAG2 (amino acids 1–383) were transiently transfected into 293T cells (human embryonic kidney epithelial cells expressing simian virus 40 large tumor (T) antigen) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and proteins were purified as described earlier (31.Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5904-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39.Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8094-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purity was tested on SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S1A). MBP cRAGs (RAG1, amino acids 384–1040; RAG2, amino acids 1–383) and full-length RAGs (FLRAG1, 1–1040 amino acids; FLRAG2, 1–527 amino acids) were purified using a mild method as described (40.Raval P. Kriatchko A.N. Kumar S. Swanson P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2060-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 14 plates of 293T cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmids each for MBP cRAG1/cRAG2 or cRAG1/FLRAG2 by the calcium phosphate method. For MBP FLRAG1/cRAG2 purification, 20 μg of FLRAG1 and 10 μg of cRAG2 plasmids were used. After 48 h of transfection, cells were harvested, and proteins were purified using amylose resin column (New England Biolabs). Eluted fractions of MBP-RAG proteins were checked by CBB staining (supplemental Fig. S1B). The activity was checked by site-specific nicking on standard RSS. However, because of poor solubility, our efforts to purify FLRAG1 and FLRAG2 complex were unsuccessful. Copurified MBP cRAG1 and cRAG2 were fractionated on a Biogel P-100 (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm DTT. Fractions (100 μl) were collected and tested for the presence of cRAG1 and cRAG2 proteins by silver staining (supplemental Fig. S2A). The activity of the fractions was checked by RAG cleavage assay on standard 12-RSS and 6-nt bubble substrates with the (C/C)6 sequence. Appropriate oligomeric substrates were incubated with RAG proteins for 1 h at 37 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, (pH 7.0), 30 mm KCl, 30 mm potassium glutamate, and 5 mm MgCl2 as described earlier (30.Raghavan S.C. Gu J. Swanson P.C. Lieber M.R. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31.Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5904-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the control, RAG reaction buffer alone was used. Reactions were terminated by adding the loading dye containing formamide, and products were resolved on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and signal was detected using a Fuji PhosphorImager FLA9000 (Fuji, Japan). Incubation times used for time-course experiments are indicated in the respective figure legends. When RAG cleavage reactions were performed to study DNA double-strand breaks, native dye with glycerol was added to the sample following the cleavage reaction, were loaded onto a 15% native polyacrylamide gel, and signals were detected as described above. Each experiment described in the present study was done a minimum of two independent times (independent reaction incubations) with complete agreement. For quantification of RAG cleavage, MultiGauge software (v3.0) was used. We first selected a rectangular area covering the substrate DNA band in the lane containing no RAG and quantified the intensity. Then we placed the same size rectangle on all the cleaved bands resulting from RAG activity and quantified. An equal area from elsewhere in the gel where there was no specific band was used as background and was subtracted. We considered the no-RAG control substrate as 100% and compared with the cleavage product intensities. For example, we got “x” as the substrate band intensity and “y” as the intensity of cleavage products of equal area after background subtraction; the % of cleavage was calculated as (y/x)100. The [γ-32P]ATP-labeled bubble substrates were incubated with RAGs in a buffer containing 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 30 mm KCl, 30 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm MnCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2. In the no-RAG control reactions, buffer alone was used. A 45-bp double-stranded oligomer (0.1 μm) was used as nonspecific DNA. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The products were resolved on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel, and signals were detected using a PhosphorImager. The substrate DNA containing different types of bubble sequences was incubated with P1 nuclease as described earlier (41.Naik A.K. Raghavan S.C. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In each experiment, a 5′ end-labeled substrate DNA was tested for P1 nuclease sensitivity by incubating with increasing concentrations (0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 units) of P1 nuclease in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction products were then resolved on a 12–15% denaturing PAGE and analyzed. Previously we have shown that the non-B DNA structure is a target for RAG cleavage under physiological conditions (22.Raghavan S.C. Lieber M.R. Bioessays. 2006; 28: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This was shown in the context of a non-B DNA structure formed at BCL2 MBR (29.Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C.L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we found that a symmetrical bubble or heterologous loop present on an oligomeric DNA could also be cleaved by RAGs (31.Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5904-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). During these studies, we noted a clear strand bias in the RAG cleavage efficiency between the top and bottom strands of bubble structures (30.Raghavan S.C. Gu J. Swanson P.C. Lieber M.R. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which was inexplicable. To understand the mechanistic aspects of the strand bias during RAG cleavage on heteroduplex DNA, we synthesized oligomers with different bubble sequences. Preliminary results showed that the efficiency of RAG cleavage on heteroduplex DNA is dependent on the sequence composition of the bubble (data not shown). Based on this, we tested which would be the most favored nucleotide for optimal RAG cleavage of non-B DNA structures. To address this question, we generated oligomeric DNA substrates containing bubble sequences with (A/A)6, (C/C)6, (T/T)6, or (G/G)6 (Fig. 1A). In all cases, the length of the double-stranded arms was 15-bp each. Oligomeric DNA, with either top or bottom strands radiolabeled, was incubated with RAGs at 37 °C for 1 h, and the products were resolved on a 15% PAGE gel. Results showed efficient RAG cleavage on both top and bottom strands when the heteroduplex DNA with cytosine bubbles were used (Fig. 1, B, lanes 5–8 and C). Distinct RAG cleavage was also seen when thymine bubbles were used (Fig. 1B, lanes 9–12), though the efficiency of the cleavage was many fold lower (Fig. 1C). To our surprise, we could not detect any RAG cleavage on heteroduplex DNA, when adenines and guanines were present as bubble sequences (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4, 13–16, and C). Consistent with this, we found that RAG binding also occurs preferentially to cytosine or thymine bubble-containing substrates (supplemental Fig. S3). Further, we confirmed the presence of 6-nt bubbles in all four heteroduplex DNA substrates by P1 nuclease cleavage assay (data not shown). Hence, our results show that the presence of altered DNA structures alone is not sufficient for RAG cleavage, and cytosines are the favored nucleotides for its cleavage on heteroduplex DNA. Comparable results were also seen when the length of the double-stranded arms was increased to 25 from 15 bp while maintaining bubble sequences as (A/A)6, (C/C)6, (T/T)6, or (G/G)6 (supplemental Fig. S4, A–C). These results suggest that irrespective of the length of the flanking region, RAGs can nick heteroduplex DNA structures, when appropriate sequences are present. Because we noticed that efficient RAG cleavage on heteroduplex DNA structures was seen only when stretches of cytosines were present, we wondered what would be the status of RAG cleavage when the same sequences are present on a duplex DNA. Results showed that RAGs do not cleave cytosines when present on a duplex DNA (C/G)6, even if they are present in stretches (data not shown). Therefore, the observed cytosine specificity of RAGs is restricted to heteroduplex DNA. DNA double-strand breaks are prerequisites for formation of chromosomal translocations and other chromosomal rearrangements. Hence, we wondered whether the RAG-induced nicks in the top and bottom strands could contribute to formation of DSBs. To test this, the heteroduplex DNA substrates (Fig. 1A) were incubated with RAGs, and cleavage products were resolved on a native polyacrylamide gel. Results showed that in the case of bubbles with cytosines, RAG cleavage led to the formation of double-strand breaks (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4) suggesting that both strands of the same molecule were cleaved. However, we could not find RAG cleavage on any other substrates including bubbles with thymines (Fig. 1D). Further the identity of the band due to DSB was studied using specific markers as indicated (Fig. 1D, lanes 9–14). Results showed that the DSB observed was due to independent cuts at two different single/double-strand transitions positioned diagonally (Fig. 1D, lanes 4 and 10). Hence, it is evident that that when cytosines are present at the single-stranded region on both top and bottom strands of heteroduplex DNA it can lead to DSBs. Further, we found that RAG cleavage on cytosine bubble could induce DSBs, irrespective of the length of the side arms (supplemental Fig. S4D). However, in none of the other substrates DSBs could be induced (supplemental Fig. S4D). Therefore, our study shows that pyrimidines, particularly cytosines are the most favored nucleotides for DSB formation. Because the above experiments were performed using GST-tagged cRAGs, we were interested in testing whether the observed sequence specificity of RAGs holds true when MBP-tagged cRAGs or FLRAGs were used (supplemental Fig. S1B). This is particularly important based on the report that GST may induce dimerization of the target protein and can have an effect on its properties. To test this, MBP core RAGs were incubated with bubble substrates with (A/A)6, (C/C)6, (T/T)6, or (G/G)6 single-stranded regions (Fig. 1A). Results showed that like GST cRAGs, the cleavage efficiency of MBP cRAGs was also many fold higher when cytosines were present at the bubble region (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). Besides, fractionation of MBP cRAGs on a size exclusion chromatography column indicated that the nuclease activity exhibited by RAGs indeed comigrated with RAG proteins (supplemental Fig. S2). The cleavage at the thymine-containing bubble was many fold weaker (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). Bubbles with adenine or guanine did not show any cleavage even with MBP cRAGs. Comparable results were obtained when full-length RAGs (FLRAG1/cRAG2 or cRAG1/FLRAG2) were used (Fig. 2, B and C). However, in both combinations of full-length RAGs, the overall efficiency of RAG cleavage was weaker. This suggests that the cytosine preference when RAGs act as a structure-specific nuclease is an inherent property of RAGs and that tags did not affect the cleavage property. The above experiments were performed using an incubation time of 1 h. Therefore, we wondered whether increasing the RAG reaction time could change the sequence specificity. Besides, the kinetics of RAG cleavage when it acts as a structure-specific nuclease has never been studied. Time course experiments were performed on different heteroduplex DNA substrates containing (A/A)6, (C/C)6, (T/T)6, or (G/G)6 single-stranded regions (Fig. 1A). Results showed that the observed sequence preference on RAG cleavage remained unaltered irrespective of time of incubation (Fig. 3, A and B). The cytosine-containing bubble was getting preferentially cleaved while thymine cleavage remained weak (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–12; B, lanes 1–5). Adenine and guanine bubble cleavage was undetectable even with prolonged incubation time (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–6; B, lanes 7–11). Interestingly, we noted an increase in the cleavage efficiency of cytosine with an increase in the incubation time (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–12). This was true even in the case of thymine (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–5). However, as shown previously, RAG cleavage efficiency on RSS remained the same after 60 min (Fig. 3C). Our studies thus far showed that bubbles with six cytosines are efficiently cleaved by RAGs, compared with thymines, adenines, or guanines. However, it may be possible that all cytosines may not be important for RAG cleavage. To investigate the minimum number of cytosines required for RAG cleavage, we synthesized new oligomeric bubble substrates with decreasing numbers of cytosines at the bubble region by replacing them with guanines (Fig. 4A, I–VII). The bubble region in the antiparallel strand was TTTTTT in all cases. RAG cleavage studies showed that there was no significant difference in the efficiency of RAG cleavage when the number of cytosines was between 3 and 6 (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–8). In these cases, we could see two cleaved products, one at the 15-nt position at the junction of the single-strand/double-strand transition (Fig. 4B). The second product, which was weaker in intensity, was due to a cleavage at the first cytosine of the bubble. When the number of cytosines was reduced to 2, the efficiency of RAG cleavage at the junction remained the same; however, the cleavage at the first internal cytosine disappeared (Fig. 4B, lanes 9 and 10). Interestingly, when the number of cytosines was reduced to 1, cleavage efficiency reduced dramatically (Fig. 4B, lanes 11 and 12). When all cytosines were replaced with guanines, RAG cleavage was almost undetectable (Fig. 4B, lanes 13 and 14). P1 nuclease analysis confirmed the presence of a 6-nt bubble region in all the substrates (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B). Thus, our results showed that only two cytosines are critical for RAG cleava"
https://openalex.org/W2012523344,"We previously found that a directional movement of the raft component GD3 towards mitochondria, by its association with microtubules, was mandatory to late apoptogenic events triggered by CD95/Fas. Since CLIPR-59, CLIP-170-related protein, has recently been identified as a microtubule binding protein associated with lipid rafts, we analyzed the role of GD3-CLIPR-59 association in lymphoblastoid T cell apoptosis triggered by CD95/Fas. To test whether CLIPR-59 could play a role at the raft-microtubule junction, we performed a series of experiments by using immunoelectron microscopy, static or flow cytometry and biochemical analyses. We first assessed the presence of CLIPR-59 molecule in lymphoblastoid T cells (CEM). Then, we demonstrated that GD3-microtubule interaction occurs via CLIPR-59 and takes place at early time points after CD95/Fas ligation, preceding the association GD3-tubulin. GD3-CLIPR-59 association was demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. The key role of CLIPR-59 in this dynamic process was clarified by the observation that silencing CLIPR-59 by siRNA affected the kinetics of GD3-tubulin association, spreading of GD3 towards mitochondria and apoptosis execution. We find that CLIPR-59 may act as a typical chaperone, allowing a prompt interaction between tubulin and the raft component GD3 during cell apoptosis triggered by CD95/Fas. On the basis of the suggested role of lipid rafts in conveying pro-apoptotic signals these results disclose new perspectives in the understanding of the mechanisms by which raft-mediated pro-apoptotic signals can directionally reach their target, i.e. the mitochondria, and trigger apoptosis execution."
https://openalex.org/W2052971315,"This report describes the identification and bioinformatics analysis of HLA-DR4-restricted HIV-1 Gag epitope peptides, and the application of dendritic cell mediated immunization of DNA plasmid constructs. BALB/c (H-2d) and HLA-DR4 (DRA1*0101, DRB1*0401) transgenic mice were immunized with immature dendritic cells transfected by a recombinant DNA plasmid encoding the lysosome-associated membrane protein-1/HIV-1 Gag (pLAMP/gag) chimera antigen. Three immunization protocols were compared: 1) primary subcutaneous immunization with 1x10(5) immature dendritic cells transfected by electroporation with the pLAMP/gag DNA plasmid, and a second subcutaneous immunization with the naked pLAMP/gag DNA plasmid; 2) primary immunization as above, and a second subcutaneous immunization with a pool of overlapping peptides spanning the HIV-1 Gag sequence; and 3) immunization twice by subcutaneous injection of the pLAMP/gag DNA plasmid. Primary immunization with pLAMP/gag-transfected dendritic cells elicited the greatest number of peptide specific T-cell responses, as measured by ex vivo IFN-gamma ELISpot assay, both in BALB/c and HLA-DR4 transgenic mice. The pLAMP/gag-transfected dendritic cells prime and naked DNA boost immunization protocol also resulted in an increased apparent avidity of peptide in the ELISpot assay. Strikingly, 20 of 25 peptide-specific T-cell responses in the HLA-DR4 transgenic mice contained sequences that corresponded, entirely or partially to 18 of the 19 human HLA-DR4 epitopes listed in the HIV molecular immunology database. Selection of the most conserved epitope peptides as vaccine targets was facilitated by analysis of their representation and variability in all reported sequences. These data provide a model system that demonstrates a) the superiority of immunization with dendritic cells transfected with LAMP/gag plasmid DNA, as compared to naked DNA, b) the value of HLA transgenic mice as a model system for the identification and evaluation of epitope-based vaccine strategies, and c) the application of variability analysis across reported sequences in public databases for selection of historically conserved HIV epitopes as vaccine targets."
https://openalex.org/W2114389758,"Biological signal transduction commonly involves cooperative interactions in the binding of ligands to their receptors. In many cases, ligand concentrations in vivo are close to the value of the dissociation constant of their receptors, resulting in the phenomenon of ligand depletion. Using examples based on rotational bias of bacterial flagellar motors and calcium binding to mammalian calmodulin, we show that ligand depletion diminishes cooperativity and broadens the dynamic range of sensitivity to the signaling ligand. As a result, the same signal transducer responds to different ranges of signal with various degrees of cooperativity according to its effective cellular concentration. Hence, results from in vitro dose-response analyses cannot be applied directly to understand signaling in vivo. Moreover, the receptor concentration is revealed to be a key element in controlling signal transduction and we propose that its modulation constitutes a new way of controlling sensitivity to signals. In addition, through an analysis of the allosteric enzyme aspartate transcarbamylase, we demonstrate that the classical Hill coefficient is not appropriate for characterizing the change in conformational state upon ligand binding to an oligomeric protein (equivalent to a dose-response curve), because it ignores the cooperativity of the conformational change for the corresponding equivalent monomers, which are generally characterized by a Hill coefficient . Therefore, we propose a new index of cooperativity based on the comparison of the properties of oligomers and their equivalent monomers."
https://openalex.org/W2014472416,"Background Migration of T cells, including regulatory T (Treg) cells, into the secondary lymph organs is critically controlled by chemokines and adhesion molecules. However, the mechanisms by which Treg cells regulate organ-specific autoimmunity via these molecules remain unclear. Although we previously reported autoimmune exocrinopathy resembling Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in the lacrimal and salivary glands from C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7)-deficient mice, it is still unclear whether CCR7 signaling might specifically affect the dynamics and functions of Treg cells in vivo. We therefore investigated the cellular mechanism for suppressive function of Treg cells via CCR7 in autoimmunity using mouse models and human samples. Methods and Findings Patrolling Treg cells were detected in the exocrine organs such as lacrimal and salivary glands from normal mice that tend to be targets for autoimmunity while the Treg cells were almost undetectable in the exocrine glands of CCR7−/− mice. In addition, we found the significantly increased retention of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells in the lymph nodes of CCR7−/− mice with aging. Although Treg cell egress requires sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), chemotactic function to S1P of CCR7−/− Treg cells was impaired compared with that of WT Treg cells. Moreover, the in vivo suppression activity was remarkably diminished in CCR7−/− Treg cells in the model where Treg cells were co-transferred with CCR7−/− CD25-CD4+ T cells into Rag2−/− mice. Finally, confocal analysis showed that CCR7+Treg cells were detectable in normal salivary glands while the number of CCR7+Treg cells was extremely decreased in the tissues from patients with Sjögren's syndrome. Conclusions These results indicate that CCR7 essentially governs the patrolling functions of Treg cells by controlling the traffic to the exocrine organs for protecting autoimmunity. Characterization of this cellular mechanism could have clinical implications by supporting development of new diagnosis or treatments for the organ-specific autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren's syndrome and clarifying how the local immune system regulates autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2069869101,"Background Novel strategies are needed for the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to the HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120. Experimental evidence suggests that combinations of antibodies that are broadly neutralizing in vitro may protect against challenge with HIV in nonhuman primates, and a small number of these antibodies have been selected by repertoire sampling of B cells and by the fractionation of antiserum from some patients with prolonged disease. Yet no additional strategies for identifying conserved epitopes, eliciting antibodies to these epitopes, and determining whether these epitopes are accessible to antibodies have been successful to date. The defining of additional conserved, accessible epitopes against which one can elicit antibodies will increase the probability that some may be the targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Methodology/Principal Findings We postulate that additional cryptic epitopes of gp120 are present, against which neutralizing antibodies might be elicited even though these antibodies are not elicited by gp120, and that many of these epitopes may be accessible to antibodies should they be formed. We demonstrate a strategy for eliciting antibodies in mice against selected cryptic, conformationally dependent conserved epitopes of gp120 by immunizing with multiple identical copies of covalently linked peptides (MCPs). This has been achieved with MCPs representing 3 different domains of gp120. We show that some cryptic epitopes on gp120 are accessible to the elicited antibodies, and some epitopes in the CD4 binding region are not accessible. The antibodies bind to gp120 with relatively high affinity, and bind to oligomeric gp120 on the surface of infected cells. Conclusions/Significance Immunization with MCPs comprised of selected peptides of HIV gp120 is able to elicit antibodies against conserved, conformationally dependent epitopes of gp120 that are not immunogenic when presented as gp120. Some of these cryptic epitopes are accessible to the elicited antibodies."

However, many aspects of water proton relaxation in complex biological media, such as protein solutions and tissue are not well understood, perhaps due to the limited empirical data.Water proton T(1), T(2), and T(1rho) of protein solutions and tissue were measured systematically under multiple conditions. Crosslinking or aggregation of protein decreased T(2) and T(1rho), but did not change high-field T(1). T(1rho) dispersion profiles were similar for crosslinked protein solutions, myocardial tissue, and cartilage, and exhibited power law behavior with T(1rho)(0) values that closely approximated T(2). The T(1rho) dispersion of mobile protein solutions was flat above 5 kHz, but showed a steep curve below 5 kHz that was sensitive to changes in pH. The T(1rho) dispersion of crosslinked BSA and cartilage in DMSO solvent closely resembled that of water solvent above 5 kHz but showed decreased dispersion below 5 kHz.Proton exchange is a minor pathway for tissue T(1) and T(1rho) relaxation above 5 kHz. Potential models for relaxation are discussed, however the same molecular mechanism appears to be responsible across 5 decades of frequencies from T(1rho) to T(1)."
https://openalex.org/W2115640926,"Background Despite the profound variation among marine consumers in tolerance for allelochemically-rich foods, few studies have examined the biochemical adaptations underlying diet choice. Here we examine the role of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in the detoxification of dietary allelochemicals in the digestive gland of the predatory gastropod Cyphoma gibbosum, a generalist consumer of gorgonian corals. Controlled laboratory feeding experiments were used to investigate the influence of gorgonian diet on Cyphoma GST activity and isoform expression. Gorgonian extracts and semi-purified fractions were also screened to identify inhibitors and possible substrates of Cyphoma GSTs. In addition, we investigated the inhibitory properties of prostaglandins (PGs) structurally similar to antipredatory PGs found in high concentrations in the Caribbean gorgonian Plexaura homomalla. Principal Findings Cyphoma GST subunit composition was invariant and activity was constitutively high regardless of gorgonian diet. Bioassay-guided fractionation of gorgonian extracts revealed that moderately hydrophobic fractions from all eight gorgonian species examined contained putative GST substrates/inhibitors. LC-MS and NMR spectral analysis of the most inhibitory fraction from P. homomalla subsequently identified prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) as the dominant component. A similar screening of commercially available prostaglandins in series A, E, and F revealed that those prostaglandins most abundant in gorgonian tissues (e.g., PGA2) were also the most potent inhibitors. In vivo estimates of PGA2 concentration in digestive gland tissues calculated from snail grazing rates revealed that Cyphoma GSTs would be saturated with respect to PGA2 and operating at or near physiological capacity. Significance The high, constitutive activity of Cyphoma GSTs is likely necessitated by the ubiquitous presence of GST substrates and/or inhibitors in this consumer's gorgonian diet. This generalist's GSTs may operate as ‘all-purpose’ detoxification enzymes, capable of conjugating or sequestering a broad range of lipophilic gorgonian compounds, thereby allowing this predator to exploit a range of chemically-defended prey, resulting in a competitive dietary advantage for this species."
https://openalex.org/W2119883800,"Vesicular neurotransmitter transporters must localize to synaptic vesicles (SVs) to allow regulated neurotransmitter release at the synapse. However, the signals required to localize vesicular proteins to SVs in vivo remain unclear. To address this question we have tested the effects of mutating proposed trafficking domains in Drosophila orthologs of the vesicular monoamine and glutamate transporters, DVMAT-A and DVGLUT. We show that a tyrosine-based motif (YXXY) is important both for DVMAT-A internalization from the cell surface in vitro, and localization to SVs in vivo. In contrast, DVGLUT deletion mutants that lack a putative C-terminal trafficking domain show more modest defects in both internalization in vitro and trafficking to SVs in vivo. Our data show for the first time that mutation of a specific trafficking motif can disrupt localization to SVs in vivo and suggest possible differences in the sorting of VMATs versus VGLUTs to SVs at the synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2067370140,"Tripartite motif (TRIM) protein TRIM5alpha has been shown to restrict human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 infection in Old World monkey cells at the early post-entry step by poorly understood mechanisms. Currently, the physiological function of TRIM5alpha is not known. In this study, we showed that transiently overexpressed TRIM5alpha causes a morphological change in HEK293T cells. A proteomics analysis of the protein complexes that were pulled down with hemagglutinin-tagged TRIM5alpha suggested that the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) may serve as a TRIM5alpha-binding partner. The interaction between Hsp70 and TRIM5alpha was confirmed by co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Co-expression of Hsp70 reversed the TRIM5alpha-induced morphological change in HEK293T cells. Another heat shock protein Hsc70 also bound to TRIM5alpha, but unlike Hsp70, Hsc70 was not able to reverse the TRIM5alpha-induced morphological change, suggesting that Hsp70 specifically reverses the morphological change caused by TRIM5alpha. Studies using a series of TRIM5alpha deletion mutants demonstrate that, although the PRYSPRY domain is critical for binding to Hsp70, the entire TRIM5alpha structure is necessary to induce the morphological change of cells. When the ATPase domain of Hsp70 was mutated, the mutated Hsp70 could not counteract the morphological change induced by TRIM5alpha, indicating that the catalytic activity of Hsp70 protein is important for this function. Co-expression of Hsp70 elevated the levels of TRIM5alpha in the detergent-soluble fraction with a concomitant decrease in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Together these results suggest that Hsp70 plays critical roles in the cellular management against the TRIM5alpha-induced cellular insults."
https://openalex.org/W2105751439,"Penicillium marneffei is a dimorphic, pathogenic fungus in Southeast Asia that mostly afflicts immunocompromised individuals. As the only dimorphic member of the genus, it goes through a phase transition from a mold to yeast form, which is believed to be a requisite for its pathogenicity. Mp1p, a cell wall antigenic mannoprotein existing widely in yeast, hyphae, and conidia of the fungus, plays a vital role in host immune response during infection. To understand the function of Mp1p, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of its ligand binding domain 2 (LBD2) to 1.3 A. The structure reveals a dimer between the two molecules. The dimer interface forms a ligand binding cavity, in which electron density was observed for a palmitic acid molecule interacting with LBD2 indirectly through hydrogen bonding networks via two structural water molecules. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments measured the ligand binding affinity (K(d)) of Mp1p at the micromolar level. Mutations of ligand-binding residues, namely S313A and S332A, resulted in a 9-fold suppression of ligand binding affinity. Analytical ultracentrifugation assays demonstrated that both LBD2 and Mp1p are mostly monomeric in vitro, no matter with or without ligand, and our dimeric crystal structure of LBD2 might be the result of crystal packing. Based on the conformation of the ligand-binding pocket in the dimer structure, a model for the closed, monomeric form of LBD2 is proposed. Further structural analysis indicated the biological importance of fatty acid binding of Mp1p for the survival and pathogenicity of the conditional pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2017259138,"Rhodopsins are photoreceptor proteins that have diverged from ligand-binding G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Unlike other GPCRs, rhodopsins contain an intrinsic antagonist, 11-cis-retinal, which is converted to the agonist all-trans-retinal upon absorption of a photon. Through evolution, vertebrate rhodopsins have lost the ability of direct binding to the agonist, but some invertebrate and vertebrate non-visual rhodopsins have retained this ability. Here, we investigated the difference in the agonist-binding state between these rhodopsins to further our understanding of the structural and functional diversity of rhodopsins. Mutational analyses of agonist-binding rhodopsin showed that replacement of Ala-269, one of the residues constituting the antagonist-binding site, with bulky amino acids resulted in a large spectral shift in its active state and a great reduction in G protein activity, whereas these were rescued by subsequent replacement of Phe-208 with smaller amino acids. Although similar replacements in vertebrate rhodopsin did not cause a spectral shift in the active state, a similar reduction in and recovery of G protein activity was observed. Therefore, the agonist is located close to Ala-269 in the agonist-binding rhodopsin, but not in vertebrate rhodopsins, and Ala-269 with Phe-208 acts as a pivot for the formation of the G protein-activating state in both rhodopsins. The positions corresponding to Ala-269 and Phe-208 in other GPCRs have been reported to form part of an agonist-binding site. Therefore, an agonist-binding rhodopsin has the molecular architecture of the agonist-binding site similar to that of a general GPCR, whereas vertebrate rhodopsins changed the architecture, resulting in loss of agonist binding during molecular evolution.

It contains the antagonist (inverse agonist) 11-cis-retinal covalently attached to its protein moiety, opsin. The agonist of rhodopsin is all-trans-retinal, but curiously, vertebrate rhodopsins have no ability to bind this agonist directly (1.Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Instead, the agonist all-trans-retinal is produced by photoisomerization of the antagonist 11-cis-retinal in the rhodopsin molecule upon photon absorption. Loss of the ability to directly bind exogenous agonist is probably the result of molecular evolution of vertebrate rhodopsin, which would have favored the decrease in background “noise” in the dark state (2.Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6303-6308Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have found that, in contrast to vertebrate rhodopsins, a non-vertebrate rhodopsin, amphioxus rhodopsin (3.Koyanagi M. Terakita A. Kubokawa K. Shichida Y.

In addition, the G protein-activating efficiencies of these rhodopsins were several dozen times lower than those of a vertebrate rhodopsin and similar to those of other Gi/Go-coupled GPCRs, although detailed quantitative comparison of the efficiencies between rhodopsins and other receptors was difficult (5.Terakita A.

GPCRs stabilize their active and inactive states upon binding to agonist and antagonist (inverse agonist), respectively. Because the structures differ between the active and inactive states, it is reasonable to assume that some of the amino acid residues located close to the agonist are relatively far from the antagonist. Therefore, we hypothesized that identifying the amino acid residues that interact with the agonist but not with the antagonist would provide insight into the structural changes in the activation mechanism of GPCRs. In rhodopsins, the retinal agonist and antagonist in the active and resting (inactive) states exhibit unique and different absorption spectra due to their interactions with nearby amino acids residues (6.Shichida Y. Imai H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1299-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This property makes it possible to identify amino acid residues located near the agonist and/or antagonist in rhodopsins by site-directed mutagenesis combined with spectroscopic measurements. In this study, using parapinopsin as an agonist-binding rhodopsin, we tried to identify amino acid residues whose mutations cause spectral changes in only the agonist-binding state. We examined whether or not these mutations affect G protein-activating efficiencies and whether the same phenomena are observed in vertebrate rhodopsins. We also investigated amphioxus rhodopsin (2.Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6303-6308Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3.Koyanagi M. Terakita A. Kubokawa K. Shichida Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) as an invertebrate agonist-binding rhodopsin. Our findings clearly show that mutations of Ala-269 in helix VI cause spectral changes in the agonist-binding state. In addition, this residue forms a specific pair with Phe-208 in helix V and constitutes a pivot for the helical rearrangement in rhodopsin activation. Sequence analysis indicated that these amino acids correspond to the residues that interact with the agonists in other GPCRs. Although they are also essential for the helical rearrangement followed by G protein activation in bovine rhodopsin, introduction of the bulky amino acid into position 269 causes no spectral changes in the active state of bovine rhodopsin. We will discuss the significance of the amino acid pair in the formation of the active state and its displacement from the agonist-binding site in the course of molecular evolution. Parapinopsin and amphioxus rhodopsin tagged with the Rho 1D4 epitope and bovine rhodopsin were expressed in HEK293S cells as described (2.Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The extract was incubated overnight with Rho 1D4 antibody-agarose. After washing with buffer B (0.02% DM in buffer A), rhodopsins were eluted with buffer B containing the C-terminal octadecapeptide of bovine rhodopsin. For Gi activation assay of parapinopsin, the pigments were extracted with 0.2% DM in buffer A from pigment-containing membranes. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu MPS-2000 (for membrane samples) or UV-2400 (for purified samples) spectrophotometer. Parapinopsin, amphioxus rhodopsin, and bovine rhodopsin were irradiated with light from a 1-kilowatt tungsten-halogen lamp (Rikagaku Seiki), which had been passed through a UTVAF-50S-36V glass filter (Sigma Koki), a 501-nm interference filter (Optical Coatings Japan), and a Y-52 glass cutoff filter (Toshiba), respectively. The spectra of parapinopsin and amphioxus rhodopsin mutants were recorded at pH 6.5 and 0 °C. The spectra of the dark and active states of bovine rhodopsin were recorded using purified samples in the presence of DM at pH 6.5 and 20 °C. To measure the spectral shifts in metarhodopsin I (meta-I) of bovine rhodopsin, the spectra were recorded using membrane preparations at pH 8.9 and 0 °C. A radionucleotide filter binding assay, which measures GDP/GTPγS exchange by G protein (Gt (transducin) or Gi), was carried out at 0 °C (for parapinopsin) or 20 °C (for bovine rhodopsin) as described (2.Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6303-6308Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5.Terakita A. Koyanagi M. Tsukamoto H. Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The assay mixture consisted of 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), 140 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm [35S]GTPγS, and 2 μm (Gt assay) or 4 μm (Gi assay) GDP. For the assay, crude extract of parapinopsin (final concentration of 10 nm) or purified bovine rhodopsin (final concentration of 2 nm) was used. The final concentration of DM was kept at 0.01%. The samples were irradiated or kept in the dark and then mixed immediately with Gi or Gt solution (final concentration of 600 nm). At selected times, an aliquot (20 μl) was removed and mixed with 200 μl of stop solution (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 μm GTPγS, and 4 μm GDP). The mixture was filtered immediately through a nitrocellulose membrane filter. The membrane filter was washed three times with 200 μl of wash solution (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 25 mm MgCl2) and air-dried. The amount of bound [35S]GTPγS was quantitated with a liquid scintillation counter. For comparison of G protein activation rates, incubation times were 1 and 2 min for bovine rhodopsin and parapinopsin, respectively. In the case of parapinopsin mutants A269E, A269Q, F208G/A269L, and F208S/A269L (see FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), the pigment concentration was 5 nm, and the incubation time was 4 min due to low expression levels. The difference in the activities before and after irradiation was normalized to that of the wild type (WT) under the same conditions. It should be noted that the G protein-activating abilities of amphioxus rhodopsin mutants could not be measured because the active states of the mutants were unstable under the conditions containing detergent DM. Structural analyses of rhodopsin intermediates by x-ray crystallography (7.Nakamichi H. Okada T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12729-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), NMR spectroscopy (8.Patel A.B. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10048-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and photoaffinity labeling (9.Borhan B. Souto M.L. Imai H. Shichida Y. Nakanishi K. Science. 2000; 288: 2209-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) strongly suggested that the β-ionone ring of the chromophore changes its position during the activation pathway of rhodopsin. Thus, we focused on the amino acid residues situated near the β-ionone ring regions of antagonist and agonist. There are 10 amino acid residues whose side chains are located within 4.5 Å of the β-ionone ring of the antagonist 11-cis-retinal in the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (10.Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). These residues are shown in Fig. 1A. Eight of the 10 residues (except positions 118 and 268) also have side chains located within 4.5 Å of the β-ionone ring in the crystal structure of an invertebrate squid rhodopsin (11.Murakami M. Kouyama T. Nature. 2008; 453: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To explore the effect of changing the steric volume around this region, we constructed a series of parapinopsin mutants in which one of the amino acid residues at corresponding positions was replaced with another amino acid to change the volume and/or polarity, expecting that some of the mutations could induce spectral changes in only the agonist-binding states. We also prepared a similar mutant series of another agonist-binding rhodopsin, amphioxus rhodopsin. The WT parapinopsin exhibits absorption maxima at 363 and 493 nm in the dark resting state and the active state, respectively (5.Terakita A. Koyanagi M. Tsukamoto H. Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The difference spectrum calculated by subtracting the spectrum of the resting state from that of the active state shows positive and negative peaks that reflect the peaks of active and resting states, respectively (Fig. 1B). Among the 20 constructed mutants of parapinopsin, 16 mutants formed pigments when incubated with 11-cis-retinal. Thus, we measured spectral shifts in these mutants by irradiation with UV light, and the spectral data are summarized in supplemental Table S1. We also obtained spectral data for 20 amphioxus rhodopsin mutants by irradiation with 501-nm light (summarized in supplemental Table S1). It should be noted that the 20 constructed mutants of amphioxus rhodopsin all formed pigments. Among the parapinopsin mutants, the A269L mutant showed an active-state spectrum considerably different from that of WT, whereas its resting-state spectrum was identical to that of WT (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the A269S mutant exhibited little change in the resting- and active-state spectra (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that introduction of a bulky (but not polar) amino acid residue at position 269 induces a specific interaction with the agonist all-trans-retinal. Similar changes in the spectroscopic properties were also observed in the Ala-269 mutants of amphioxus rhodopsin (supplemental Fig. S1). The A269L mutant of amphioxus rhodopsin exhibited an active-state spectrum largely perturbed from that of the original pigment, suggesting that introduction of the bulky group at this position caused a severe steric interaction with the chromophore. It is unclear why the A269L mutation caused a more prominent effect on the absorption spectrum of amphioxus rhodopsin compared with parapinopsin. Interestingly, the A269L mutant of parapinopsin exhibited almost no G protein activity, but the A269S mutant exhibited G protein activity similar to that of WT (Fig. 1C), indicating that introduction of the bulky amino acid at this position caused a great reduction in G protein activity. To further investigate the mode of this interaction, we prepared a series of parapinopsin mutants in which Ala-269 was replaced with one of 19 amino acids, including leucine and serine. Replacements of Ala-269 with amino acids larger than 200 Å3 caused a large blue shift in the absorption spectra of the active states, whereas those with amino acids smaller than 130 Å3 did not alter the spectra significantly (Fig. 2A). Except for the replacements with glutamine, asparagine, and methionine, replacements with amino acids having volumes between 130 and 200 Å3 tended to the blue shift as the volume of the amino acid became large (Fig. 2A). 6It is unclear how the replacements with glutamine, asparagine, and methionine caused a red shift in the active states of parapinopsin. In general, an opsin shift is the reflection of the electronic state of the chromophore, which would be affected by the electrostatic environment around the chromophore. Because the residues that induce the red shift from the WT have side chains containing atoms with electron-withdrawing properties, the presence of these residues would cause some effect on the electronic state of the chromophore, resulting in the red shift in the absorption maximum. Interestingly, replacement of Ala-269 with bulky amino acids, which caused a more than ∼500 cm−1 blue shift in the active-state spectra, also caused a severe reduction in G protein-activating efficiencies (Fig. 2B). Thus, introduction of bulky amino acid residue at position 269 tends to cause both a spectral shift in the active state and a severe reduction in G protein-activating ability. Deletion of the methyl group by replacement of alanine with glycine at this position caused no change in the absorption spectrum and G protein-activating efficiency (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, replacement with serine or cysteine, whose volume is similar to that of alanine, did not change the spectrum and G protein-activating efficiency (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, we propose that the above results can be accounted for as follows. As a result of replacement of Ala-269 with a bulky amino acid, a steric interaction between a newly introduced bulky amino acid and the residue that originally interacted with Ala-269 occurs, thereby resulting in a specific interaction of the bulky amino acid with the agonist, which causes an inadequate protein structure for G protein activation. This explanation is supported by the fact that spectral shifts caused by some mutations of amino acid residues proximal to Ala-269, such as Y268F and W265F, caused small but significant spectral shifts in the active states of parapinopsin and amphioxus rhodopsin (supplemental Table S1). These results support our idea that the agonist all-trans-retinal is located near Ala-269 and the proximal residues. We next set out to identify residue(s) that originally interacted with Ala-269 in the inactive “dark” state of the agonist-binding receptor parapinopsin. To obtain insight into the residue(s) that interacts with Ala-269 in parapinopsin, we searched for the amino acid residues located within 4.5 Å of Ala-269 in the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (10.Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) and found that, in addition to the residues located near Ala-269 in helix VI, two residues, Phe-208 and Phe-212, present in helix V fit this criterion (Fig. 3, A and B). We also searched for the amino acid residues in the crystal structure of squid rhodopsin (11.Murakami M. Kouyama T. Nature. 2008; 453: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and found that Phe-205, the corresponding residue of Phe-208 in bovine rhodopsin, also fits the criterion. Because both Phe-208 and Phe-212 are residues with bulky side chains, we expected that steric interaction should occur between one of these residues and a bulky amino acid introduced at position 269 instead of alanine and that this interaction might cause perturbation of the helical arrangements of helices V and VI that are essential for the formation of the G protein-activating state (12.Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 13.Altenbach C. Kusnetzow A.K. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 14.Kobilka B.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 794-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the effect of replacing Ala-269 with a bulky amino acid would be compensated by replacing either of these phenylalanine residues with a smaller amino acid. Because mutant F212A showed a severe reduction in expression levels, we focused our studies instead on mutant F212C/A296L. Replacement of Phe-208 with alanine in the A269L, A269F, and A269W mutants returned the absorption spectra and G protein-activating efficiencies back to those of WT (Fig. 3, C–E). A similar recovery of the absorption spectra was also observed in amphioxus rhodopsin (supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast, replacement of Phe-212 with cysteine did not cause such a recovery of the phenotype of the A269L mutant to that of WT (Fig. 3, C and E). These results strongly suggest that Ala-269 is located near Phe-208 in the active state and that replacement of Ala-269 with a bulky amino acid causes a steric interaction with Phe-208, resulting in inhibition of the formation of structure suitable for G protein activation. It should be noted that all of these replacements caused little spectral changes in the dark resting state (Fig. 3, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S3). We then tried to establish whether the recovery of the active-state characteristics by the second F208A mutation was due to the decreasing volume of the amino acid residue at position 208. Our results show that introducing a small amino acid (Gly or Ser), but not a bulky amino acid (Val, Leu, or Trp), at position 208 recovered the spectral property of the active state of the A269L mutant and its G protein-activating efficiency (Fig. 4, A and B). These results further support the idea that the absence of steric interaction in the region near these residues is required for active-state formation. We next examined whether or not similar mutational effects could be observed in bovine rhodopsin. Replacement of Ala-269 with leucine caused a great shift in equilibrium between meta-I and meta-II in favor of meta-I. However, the absorption spectra of meta-I and meta-II did not change significantly upon this replacement, i.e. meta-I showed only an ∼4-nm blue shift, and meta-II did not show the shift at all (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S4B). Subsequent replacement of Phe-208 with alanine in the A269L mutant caused a slight shift in equilibrium in favor of meta-II, but the spectra of meta-I and meta-II did not change (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. S4B). Replacement of Phe-212 with alanine also caused a shift in equilibrium similar to that caused by replacement of Phe-208 (Fig. 5F and supplemental Fig. S4B). It should be noted that the single replacement of Phe-208 or Phe-212 did not change the equilibrium and spectra of meta-I and meta-II (Fig. 5, C and E, and supplemental Fig. S4A). In contrast to the little change in the absorption spectra, the G protein-activating efficiencies were considerably perturbed by the replacements, i.e. the A269L mutant of bovine rhodopsin showed G protein-activating efficiency that was ∼40% of WT (Fig. 5G). The subsequent F208A mutation recovered the efficiency to ∼80% of WT (Fig. 5G). On the other hand, the F212A mutation caused no change in the G protein-activating efficiency of the A269L mutant (Fig. 5G). These results indicate that adequate interaction between the amino acid pair at positions 208 and 269 is also important for G protein activation by bovine rhodopsin. It should be noted that the recovery of G protein-activating efficiency by the subsequent F208A mutation was not due to the recovery of the equilibrium between meta-I and meta-II because the F212A mutation of the A269L mutant also recovered the equilibrium but did not recover the G protein-activating efficiency (Fig. 5, F and G). The above results clearly show that the introduction of the Ala-269 mutation into bovine rhodopsin caused no spectral change in the active state, whereas the same mutation in parapinopsin caused large spectral changes. However, G protein-activating efficiencies were disturbed by the mutations in both bovine rhodopsin and parapinopsin. In the basis of these results, we propose that, in the active state of bovine rhodopsin, the β-ionone ring of the chromophore is present in a position where it does not interact with the bulky amino acid introduced at position 269, whereas in the active state of parapinopsin, the β-ionone ring is in close proximity to position 269 so as to interact with the bulky amino acid introduced at this position. Separation of the β-ionone ring of the chromophore from position 269 in bovine rhodopsin upon absorption of a photon is consistent with the results of x-ray crystallography of lumirhodopsin (7.Nakamichi H. Okada T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12729-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and NMR studies on metarhodopsin II (15.Ahuja S. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hornak V. Hirshfeld A. Ziliox M. Syrett N. Reeves P.J. Khorana H.G. Sheves M. Smith S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10190-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The difference in movement of the β-ionone ring of the chromophore from the pivot constituted by the specific pair of amino acids at positions 269 and 208 would cause a different amplitude of helical movement between parapinopsin and bovine rhodopsin (16.Tsukamoto H. Farrens D.L. Koyanagi M. Terakita A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20676-20683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The differences in the conformational changes in chromophore and protein would be relevant to functional differences in G protein-activating efficiency and direct binding of the agonist all-trans-retinal. In this study, we found that a “push-pull” relationship between amino acid residues at positions 269 and 208 (with the existence of a bulky amino acid at either of the positions) is important for the formation of the G protein-activating state. Thus, it is of interest to determine whether or not a similar relationship is conserved in various rhodopsins. Most rhodopsins possess bulky and small amino acids at positions 208 and 269, respectively (supplemental Fig. S5). On the other hand, the relationship is reversed in some Gq-coupled invertebrate rhodopsins, where small and bulky amino acid residues are present at positions 208 and 269, respectively (supplemental Fig. S5). Some rhodopsins, such as Xenopus melanopsin, Drosophila RH6, and Anopheles GPRop8, contain small amino acids at both positions (supplemental Fig. S5). We confirmed by use of parapinopsin that replacement of the bulky phenylalanine at position 208 with the small alanine caused no change in the spectrum and G protein-activating efficiency (Fig. 3, C and E). Therefore, we conclude that the important restriction is that bulky amino acids must not exist at both positions. According to the crystal structures of bovine rhodopsin and its partial active state (opsin with a C-terminal peptide of the transducin α-subunit), the Cα–Cα distance between Ala-269 and Phe-208 changes ∼1.5 Å upon conversion to the partial active state (10.Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 17.Li J. Edwards P.C. Burghammer M. Villa C. Schertler G.F. J. Mol.

Nature. 2008; 455: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytoplasmic region of helix VI would move away from the original position by ∼7 Å (10.Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 17.Li J. Edwards P.C. Burghammer M. Villa C. Schertler G.F. J. Mol.

Nature. 2008; 455: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Outward displacement of the cytoplasmic region of helix VI was also suggested from site-directed spin labeling studies (12.Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 13.Altenbach C. Kusnetzow A.K. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These facts, coupled with our new results, enable us to speculate that the amino acid pair at positions 269 and 208 would work as a pivot to induce the outward shift in the cytoplasmic region of helix VI (Fig. 6), whereas its extracellular region does not move significantly (18.Scheerer P. Park J.H. Hildebrand P.W. Kim Y.J. Krauss N. Choe H.W. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. Nature. 2008; 455: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 19.Struthers M. Yu H. Kono M. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues that are located at the corresponding positions in rhodopsin also have important roles in other GPCRs. The β-adrenergic receptor contains important and highly conserved serine and phenylalanine residues at positions 208 and 269, respectively (Ser-204 and Phe-290 in the β-adrenergic receptor numbering system, respectively). Both residues were reported to interact directly with agonist, such as isoproterenol, and the interactions have been reported to lead to formation of the G protein-activating state (20.Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Dixon R.A. Sigal I.S. Strader C.D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 487-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also reported that, in the 5-HT2A (serotonin) receptor, the agonist 5-hydroxytryptamine interacts with amino acid residues at positions 208 and 269 (22.Roth B.L. Shoham M. Choudhary M.S. Khan N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23.Johnson M.P. Wainscott D.B. Lucaites V.L. Baez M. Nelson D.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 49: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that, in not only the agonist-binding rhodopsins but also various ligand-binding GPCRs, the amino acid residues at positions 208 and 269 are situated near the agonists and act as a pivot for the helical arrangements. The crystal structures of several GPCRs other than rhodopsin have recently been determined, but all the structures so far contain antagonists (inverse agonists) (24.Hanson M.A. Stevens R.C. Structure. 2009; 17: 8-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, further biochemical analyses in combination with structural determinations of the agonist-binding states will be necessary for the confirmation of the functional role of the specific pair found in this study. In conclusion, our results provide novel insights into the amino acid residues responsible for regulation of rhodopsin activity. In addition, we speculate that the agonist-binding site of vertebrate rhodopsin changes its position from the pivot at positions 208 and 269. We previously proposed based on studies on the displacement of the counterion that vertebrate visual rhodopsins diverged from the agonist-binding rhodopsins (2.Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6303-6308Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5.Terakita A. Koyanagi M. Tsukamoto H. Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Further analyses of the molecular mechanisms of the pivot will clarify the emergence of vertebrate visual rhodopsins in the course of molecular evolution of rhodopsins.

https://openalex.org/W1966683889,"Inactivation of thrombin (T) by the serpins heparin cofactor II (HCII) and antithrombin (AT) is accelerated by a heparin template between the serpin and thrombin exosite II. Unlike AT, HCII also uses an allosteric interaction of its NH(2)-terminal segment with exosite I. Sucrose octasulfate (SOS) accelerated thrombin inactivation by HCII but not AT by 2000-fold. SOS bound to two sites on thrombin, with dissociation constants (K(D)) of 10 +/- 4 microm and 400 +/- 300 microm that were not kinetically resolvable, as evidenced by single hyperbolic SOS concentration dependences of the inactivation rate (k(obs)). SOS bound HCII with K(D) 1.45 +/- 0.30 mm, and this binding was tightened in the T.SOS.HCII complex, characterized by K(complex) of approximately 0.20 microm. Inactivation data were incompatible with a model solely depending on HCII.SOS but fit an equilibrium linkage model employing T.SOS binding in the pathway to higher order complex formation. Hirudin-(54-65)(SO(3)(-)) caused a hyperbolic decrease of the inactivation rates, suggesting partial competitive binding of hirudin-(54-65)(SO(3)(-)) and HCII to exosite I. Meizothrombin(des-fragment 1), binding SOS with K(D) = 1600 +/- 300 microm, and thrombin were inactivated at comparable rates, and an exosite II aptamer had no effect on the inactivation, suggesting limited exosite II involvement. SOS accelerated inactivation of meizothrombin 1000-fold, reflecting the contribution of direct exosite I interaction with HCII. Thrombin generation in plasma was suppressed by SOS, both in HCII-dependent and -independent processes. The ex vivo HCII-dependent process may utilize the proposed model and suggests a potential for oversulfated disaccharides in controlling HCII-regulated thrombin generation."
