https://openalex.org/W2809286029,"Severe droughts have caused widespread tree mortality across many forest biomes with profound effects on the function of ecosystems and carbon balance. Climate change is expected to intensify regional-scale droughts, focusing attention on the physiological basis of drought-induced tree mortality. Recent work has shown that catastrophic failure of the plant hydraulic system is a principal mechanism involved in extensive crown death and tree mortality during drought, but the multi-dimensional response of trees to desiccation is complex. Here we focus on the current understanding of tree hydraulic performance under drought, the identification of physiological thresholds that precipitate mortality and the mechanisms of recovery after drought. Building on this, we discuss the potential application of hydraulic thresholds to process-based models that predict mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2809913775,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by beta-amyloid accumulation, phosphorylated tau formation, hyperactivation of glial cells, and neuronal loss. The mechanisms of AD pathogenesis, however, remain poorly understood, partially due to the lack of relevant models that can comprehensively recapitulate multistage intercellular interactions in human AD brains. Here we present a new three-dimensional (3D) human AD triculture model using neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in a 3D microfluidic platform. Our model provided key representative AD features: beta-amyloid aggregation, phosphorylated tau accumulation, and neuroinflammatory activity. In particular, the model mirrored microglial recruitment, neurotoxic activities such as axonal cleavage, and NO release damaging AD neurons and astrocytes. Our model will serve to facilitate the development of more precise human brain models for basic mechanistic studies in neural-glial interactions and drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2811270075,"Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is highly regulated by environmental influences, and functionally implicated in behavioural responses to stress and antidepressants1-4. However, how adult-born neurons regulate dentate gyrus information processing to protect from stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour is unknown. Here we show in mice that neurogenesis confers resilience to chronic stress by inhibiting the activity of mature granule cells in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG), a subregion that is implicated in mood regulation. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of adult-born neurons in the vDG promotes susceptibility to social defeat stress, whereas increasing neurogenesis confers resilience to chronic stress. By using in vivo calcium imaging to record neuronal activity from large cell populations in the vDG, we show that increased neurogenesis results in a decrease in the activity of stress-responsive cells that are active preferentially during attacks or while mice explore anxiogenic environments. These effects on dentate gyrus activity are necessary and sufficient for stress resilience, as direct silencing of the vDG confers resilience whereas excitation promotes susceptibility. Our results suggest that the activity of the vDG may be a key factor in determining individual levels of vulnerability to stress and related psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2810911197,"Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is principally mediated by the neurotransmitter GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) and its synaptic target, the type A GABA receptor (GABAA receptor). Dysfunction of this receptor results in neurological disorders and mental illnesses including epilepsy, anxiety and insomnia. The GABAA receptor is also a prolific target for therapeutic, illicit and recreational drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, anaesthetics and ethanol. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human α1β2γ2 GABAA receptor, the predominant isoform in the adult brain, in complex with GABA and the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil, the first-line clinical treatment for benzodiazepine overdose. The receptor architecture reveals unique heteromeric interactions for this important class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor. This work provides a template for understanding receptor modulation by GABA and benzodiazepines, and will assist rational approaches to therapeutic targeting of this receptor for neurological disorders and mental illness."

https://openalex.org/W2809669836,"Saturn's moon Enceladus harbours a global water ocean 1 , which lies under an ice crust and above a rocky core 2 . Through warm cracks in the crust 3 a cryo-volcanic plume ejects ice grains and vapour into space4-7 that contain materials originating from the ocean8,9. Hydrothermal activity is suspected to occur deep inside the porous core10-12, powered by tidal dissipation 13 . So far, only simple organic compounds with molecular masses mostly below 50 atomic mass units have been observed in plume material6,14,15. Here we report observations of emitted ice grains containing concentrated and complex macromolecular organic material with molecular masses above 200 atomic mass units. The data constrain the macromolecular structure of organics detected in the ice grains and suggest the presence of a thin organic-rich film on top of the oceanic water table, where organic nucleation cores generated by the bursting of bubbles allow the probing of Enceladus' organic inventory in enhanced concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2811252608,"Patients with prostate cancer frequently show resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy, a condition known as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Acquiring a better understanding of the mechanisms that control the development of CRPC remains an unmet clinical need. The well-established dependency of cancer cells on the tumour microenvironment indicates that the microenvironment might control the emergence of CRPC. Here we identify IL-23 produced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as a driver of CRPC in mice and patients with CRPC. Mechanistically, IL-23 secreted by MDSCs can activate the androgen receptor pathway in prostate tumour cells, promoting cell survival and proliferation in androgen-deprived conditions. Intra-tumour MDSC infiltration and IL-23 concentration are increased in blood and tumour samples from patients with CRPC. Antibody-mediated inactivation of IL-23 restored sensitivity to androgen-deprivation therapy in mice. Taken together, these results reveal that MDSCs promote CRPC by acting in a non-cell autonomous manner. Treatments that block IL-23 can oppose MDSC-mediated resistance to castration in prostate cancer and synergize with standard therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2810563185,"Epithelial surfaces form critical barriers to the outside world and are continuously renewed by adult stem cells1. Whereas dynamics of epithelial stem cells during homeostasis are increasingly well understood, how stem cells are redirected from a tissue-maintenance program to initiate repair after injury remains unclear. Here we examined infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus, a co-evolved pathosymbiont of mice, to assess the epithelial response to disruption of the mucosal barrier. H. polygyrus disrupts tissue integrity by penetrating the duodenal mucosa, where it develops while surrounded by a multicellular granulomatous infiltrate2. Crypts overlying larvae-associated granulomas did not express intestinal stem cell markers, including Lgr53, in spite of continued epithelial proliferation. Granuloma-associated Lgr5− crypt epithelium activated an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-dependent transcriptional program, highlighted by Sca-1 expression, and IFN-γ-producing immune cells were found in granulomas. A similar epithelial response accompanied systemic activation of immune cells, intestinal irradiation, or ablation of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells. When cultured in vitro, granuloma-associated crypt cells formed spheroids similar to those formed by fetal epithelium, and a sub-population of H. polygyrus-induced cells activated a fetal-like transcriptional program, demonstrating that adult intestinal tissues can repurpose aspects of fetal development. Therefore, re-initiation of the developmental program represents a fundamental mechanism by which the intestinal crypt can remodel itself to sustain function after injury. Larvae of the parasitic helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus induce granuloma formation and a fetal-like developmental program in granuloma-associated crypts of infected adult mice."

https://openalex.org/W2809946987,"A localized transcriptome at the synapse facilitates synapse-, stimulus- and transcript-specific local protein synthesis in response to neuronal activity. While enzyme-mediated mRNA modifications are known to regulate cellular mRNA turnover, the role of these modifications in regulating synaptic RNA has not been studied. We established low-input m6A-sequencing of synaptosomal RNA to determine the chemically modified local transcriptome in healthy adult mouse forebrains and identified 4,469 selectively enriched m6A sites in 2,921 genes as the synaptic m6A epitranscriptome (SME). The SME is functionally enriched in synthesis and modulation of tripartite synapses and in pathways implicated in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Interrupting m6A-mediated regulation via knockdown of readers in hippocampal neurons altered expression of SME member Apc, resulting in synaptic dysfunction including immature spine morphology and dampened excitatory synaptic transmission concomitant with decreased clusters of postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and decreased surface expression of AMPA receptor subunit GluA1. Our findings indicate that chemical modifications of synaptic mRNAs critically contribute to synaptic function."

https://openalex.org/W2810523701,"The conserved and essential DEAD-box RNA helicase Ded1p from yeast and its mammalian orthologue DDX3 are critical for the initiation of translation1. Mutations in DDX3 are linked to tumorigenesis2-4 and intellectual disability5, and the enzyme is targeted by a range of viruses6. How Ded1p and its orthologues engage RNAs during the initiation of translation is unknown. Here we show, by integrating transcriptome-wide analyses of translation, RNA structure and Ded1p-RNA binding, that the effects of Ded1p on the initiation of translation are connected to near-cognate initiation codons in 5' untranslated regions. Ded1p associates with the translation pre-initiation complex at the mRNA entry channel and repressing the activity of Ded1p leads to the accumulation of RNA structure in 5' untranslated regions, the initiation of translation from near-cognate start codons immediately upstream of these structures and decreased protein synthesis from the corresponding main open reading frames. The data reveal a program for the regulation of translation that links Ded1p, the activation of near-cognate start codons and mRNA structure. This program has a role in meiosis, in which a marked decrease in the levels of Ded1p is accompanied by the activation of the alternative translation initiation sites that are seen when the activity of Ded1p is repressed. Our observations indicate that Ded1p affects translation initiation by controlling the use of near-cognate initiation codons that are proximal to mRNA structure in 5' untranslated regions."
https://openalex.org/W2811276814,"Prolonged exposure to microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide can induce a form of innate immune memory that blunts subsequent responses to unrelated pathogens, known as lipopolysaccharide tolerance. Sepsis is a dysregulated systemic immune response to disseminated infection that has a high mortality rate. In some patients, sepsis results in a period of immunosuppression (known as 'immunoparalysis')1 characterized by reduced inflammatory cytokine output2, increased secondary infection3 and an increased risk of organ failure and mortality4. Lipopolysaccharide tolerance recapitulates several key features of sepsis-associated immunosuppression5. Although various epigenetic changes have previously been observed in tolerized macrophages6-8, the molecular basis of tolerance, immunoparalysis and other forms of innate immune memory has remained unclear. Here we perform a screen for tolerance-associated microRNAs and identify miR-221 and miR-222 as regulators of the functional reprogramming of macrophages during lipopolysaccharide tolerization. Prolonged stimulation with lipopolysaccharide in mice leads to increased expression of miR-221 and mir-222, both of which regulate brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1, also known as Smarca4). This increased expression causes the transcriptional silencing of a subset of inflammatory genes that depend on chromatin remodelling mediated by SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose non-fermentable) and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription), which in turn promotes tolerance. In patients with sepsis, increased expression of miR-221 and miR-222 correlates with immunoparalysis and increased organ damage. Our results show that specific microRNAs can regulate macrophage tolerization and may serve as biomarkers of immunoparalysis and poor prognosis in patients with sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2809219956,"The formation of a primordial crust is a critical step in the evolution of terrestrial planets but the timing of this process is poorly understood. The mineral zircon is a powerful tool for constraining crust formation because it can be accurately dated with the uranium-to-lead (U–Pb) isotopic decay system and is resistant to subsequent alteration. Moreover, given the high concentration of hafnium in zircon, the lutetium-to-hafnium (176Lu–176Hf) isotopic decay system can be used to determine the nature and formation timescale of its source reservoir1–3. Ancient igneous zircons with crystallization ages of around 4,430 million years (Myr) have been reported in Martian meteorites that are believed to represent regolith breccias from the southern highlands of Mars4,5. These zircons are present in evolved lithologies interpreted to reflect re-melted primary Martian crust 4 , thereby potentially providing insight into early crustal evolution on Mars. Here, we report concomitant high-precision U–Pb ages and Hf-isotope compositions of ancient zircons from the NWA 7034 Martian regolith breccia. Seven zircons with mostly concordant U–Pb ages define 207Pb/206Pb dates ranging from 4,476.3 ± 0.9 Myr ago to 4,429.7 ± 1.0 Myr ago, including the oldest directly dated material from Mars. All zircons record unradiogenic initial Hf-isotope compositions inherited from an enriched, andesitic-like crust extracted from a primitive mantle no later than 4,547 Myr ago. Thus, a primordial crust existed on Mars by this time and survived for around 100 Myr before it was reworked, possibly by impacts4,5, to produce magmas from which the zircons crystallized. Given that formation of a stable primordial crust is the end product of planetary differentiation, our data require that the accretion, core formation and magma ocean crystallization on Mars were completed less than 20 Myr after the formation of the Solar System. These timescales support models that suggest extremely rapid magma ocean crystallization leading to a gravitationally unstable stratified mantle, which subsequently overturns, resulting in decompression melting of rising cumulates and production of a primordial basaltic to andesitic crust6,7. Isotopic compositions of ancient zircons from the NWA 7034 Martian meteorite suggest that Mars must have formed its primordial crust extremely swiftly, less than 20 million years after the formation of the Solar System."
https://openalex.org/W2811303733,Functional neuroanatomy of Pavlovian fear has identified neuronal circuits and synapses associating conditioned stimuli with aversive events. Hebbian plasticity within these networks requires additional reinforcement to store particularly salient experiences into long-term memory. Here we have identified a circuit that reciprocally connects the ventral periaqueductal gray and dorsal raphe region with the central amygdala and that gates fear learning. We found that ventral periaqueductal gray and dorsal raphe dopaminergic (vPdRD) neurons encode a positive prediction error in response to unpredicted shocks and may reshape intra-amygdala connectivity via a dopamine-dependent form of long-term potentiation. Negative feedback from the central amygdala to vPdRD neurons might limit reinforcement to events that have not been predicted. These findings add a new module to the midbrain dopaminergic circuit architecture underlying associative reinforcement learning and identify vPdRD neurons as a critical component of Pavlovian fear conditioning. We propose that dysregulation of vPdRD neuronal activity may contribute to fear-related psychiatric disorders.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of sepsis and outcomes of outborn neonates with sepsis, and to characterize the pathogen profile and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of common isolates in them.In this prospective observational cohort study (2011-2015), a dedicated research team enrolled all neonates admitted to an outborn level-3 neonatal unit and followed them until discharge/death. Sepsis work-up including blood culture(s) was performed upon suspicion of sepsis. All the isolates were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Gram-negative pathogens resistant to any three of the five antibiotic classes (extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin-tazobactam) were labeled multi-drug resistant.Of the total of 2588 neonates enrolled, culture positive sepsis and total sepsis-i.e. culture positive and/or culture negative sepsis-was diagnosed in 13.1% (95% CI 11.8% to 14.5%) and 54.7% (95% CI 52.8% to 56.6%), respectively. The case fatality rates were 23.4% and 11.0% in culture-positive and total sepsis, respectively. Sepsis accounted for two-thirds of total neonatal deaths (153/235, 63.0%). Bacterial isolates caused about three-fourths (296/401; 73.8%) of the infections. The two common pathogens-Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 50, 12.5%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 46, 11.5%)-showed high degree of multi-drug resistance (78.0% and 91.3%, respectively) and carbapenem resistance (84.0% and 91.3%, respectively). About a quarter of infections were caused by Candida spp. (n = 91; 22.7%); almost three-fourths (73.7%) of these infections occurred in neonates born at or after 32 weeks' gestation and about two-thirds (62.1%) in those weighing 1500 g or more at birth.In this large outborn cohort, we report high burden of sepsis, high prevalence of systemic fungal infections, and alarming rates of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens."

The E3 ligase TNF receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) acts as a key regulator bridging innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and antigen receptors to the canonical NF-κB pathway. Structural analysis and point mutations have unraveled the essential role of TRAF6 binding to the E2-conjugating enzyme ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N (Ubc13 or UBE2N) to generate Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains for inflammatory and immune signal propagation. Genetic mutations disrupting TRAF6–Ubc13 binding have been shown to reduce TRAF6 activity and, consequently, NF-κB activation. However, to date, no small-molecule modulator is available to inhibit the TRAF6–Ubc13 interaction and thereby counteract NF-κB signaling and associated diseases. Here, using a high-throughput small-molecule screening approach, we discovered an inhibitor of the TRAF6–Ubc13 interaction that reduces TRAF6–Ubc13 activity both in vitro and in cells. We found that this compound, C25-140, impedes NF-κB activation in various immune and inflammatory signaling pathways also in primary human and murine cells. Importantly, C25-140 ameliorated inflammation and improved disease outcomes of autoimmune psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis in preclinical in vivo mouse models. Hence, the first-in-class TRAF6–Ubc13 inhibitor C25-140 expands the toolbox for studying the impact of the ubiquitin system on immune signaling and underscores the importance of TRAF6 E3 ligase activity in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Ubiquitination of proteins is a cellular process that either drives protein degradation by the proteasome in order to sustain protein homeostasis or regulates distinct cellular signaling pathways. Three enzymes, namely E1, E2, and E3, are needed to covalently attach ubiquitin to the substrate proteins. E1 is the activating enzyme initially binding the ubiquitin, E2 is the conjugating enzyme thereby determining the linkage type, and the E3 ligase is involved in substrate specificity and transfer of ubiquitin (1Husnjak K. Dikic I. Ubiquitin-binding proteins: decoders of ubiquitin-mediated cellular functions.Annu. Rev.

Whereas, for example, Lys48-linked chains are known to target the substrate protein for proteasomal degradation via the 26S proteasome, Lys63-linked chains are associated with a variety of nonproteolytic functions, such as trafficking, DNA damage response, and NF-κB signaling in innate and adaptive immunity. The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-κB plays a critical role in regulating the expression of a large variety of genes that are involved in several cellular processes, including innate and adaptive immune response, cell growth and survival, and cell development (4Napetschnig J. Wu H. Molecular basis of NF-κB signaling.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2013; 42 (23495970): 443-46810.1146/annurev-biophys-083012-130338Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Several signals, including cytokines, pathogens, injuries, and other stress conditions, induce activation of the NF-κB transcription factors that are tightly regulated via the formation of polyubiquitin chains. Deregulation of NF-κB signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmunity, chronic inflammation, and various cancers (5Bassères D.S. Baldwin A.S. Nuclear factor-κB and inhibitor of κB kinase pathways in oncogenic initiation and progression.Oncogene. 2006; 25 (17072330): 6817-683010.1038/sj.onc.1209942Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 6Toubi E.

Within NF-κB signaling, approved ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitors mainly focus on the inhibition of the 26S proteasome (e.g. bortezomib and carfilzomib), thereby broadly influencing protein homeostasis. In contrast, regulators of the ubiquitination cascade might serve as more specific drug targets. Especially, E3 ligases are final regulators of the ubiquitination reaction, with more than 600 representatives; therefore, drugging E3 ligases might give rise to more specificity compared with the 26S proteasome (7Landré V.

Of note, the TRAF6 ligase activity is strictly determined by its protein–protein interaction with a specific set of E2 enzymes, including Ubc13. Importantly, ubiquitin is directly transferred from ubiquitin-charged Ubc13 (E2) to the substrate, both proteins bound by the E3 ligase TRAF6 (15Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A.

Thus, targeting TRAF6 E3 activity requires the identification of protein–protein interaction inhibitors, which disrupt the TRAF6–Ubc13 interaction, because TRAF6 has no intrinsic catalytic activity (7Landré V.

To date, efforts on targeting TRAF6 activity have focused on disrupting TRAF6–substrate interaction (22Zarzycka B. Seijkens T. Nabuurs S.B. Ritschel T. Grommes J. Soehnlein O.

In this report, we demonstrate the identification of the first TRAF6–Ubc13 protein–protein interaction inhibitor that ameliorates disease outcome of two preclinical murine models of autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. To identify small-molecule inhibitors of the TRAF6–Ubc13 interaction, we established an AlphaScreen® binding assay with robust performance (Fig. S1A) and carried out a high-throughput screening campaign using 25,000 compounds (Fig. S1B). After removing AlphaScreen® frequent hitters using our own developed chemoinformatics filters (23Schorpp K. Rothenaigner I. Salmina E. Reinshagen J. Low T. Brenke J.K. Gopalakrishnan J. Tetko I.V.

Subsequently, we performed a small structure–activity relationship analysis by testing a few commercially available analogs (Fig. S2A). Three analogs showed similar inhibitory effects on TRAF6–Ubc13 interaction when compared with C25 (Fig. S2B). Compound C25-140, however, had the best inhibitory potential on NF-κB activation after IL-1β stimulation (Fig. S2C), which led us to choose this compound for additional investigations. C25-140 (Fig. 1A and Fig. S2A) disrupted the TRAF6–Ubc13 binding in vitro (Fig. S2D) without affecting the interaction of Ubc13 and the deubiquitinase OTUB1 (25Wiener R. Zhang X. Wang T. Wolberger C. The mechanism of OTUB1-mediated inhibition of ubiquitination.Nature. 2012; 483 (22367539): 618-62210.1038/nature10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2D), which competes with TRAF6 for Ubc13 binding (25Wiener R. Zhang X. Wang T. Wolberger C. The mechanism of OTUB1-mediated inhibition of ubiquitination.Nature. 2012; 483 (22367539): 618-62210.1038/nature10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of Ubc13 to Uev1a remained unimpaired upon compound treatment (Fig. S2E). Importantly, treatment of cells with C25-140 dose-dependently impeded TRAF6–Ubc13 interaction in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1B), and NMR studies proved that C25-140 directly binds to TRAF6 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, C25-140 effectively reduced TRAF6-mediated ubiquitin chain formation in vitro (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that C25-140 directly binds to TRAF6, thereby blocking the interaction of TRAF6 with Ubc13, and as a consequence lowers TRAF6 activity. To better understand the selectivity of C25-140 toward other E3 ligases, we analyzed the activity of various E3 ligases upon C25-140 treatment. These studies revealed that only the activity of cIAP1, an E3 ligase generating Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains (26Bertrand M.J. Milutinovic S. Dickson K.M. Ho W.C. Boudreault A. Durkin J. Gillard J.W. Jaquith J.B. Morris S.J. Barker P.A. cIAP1 and cIAP2 facilitate cancer cell survival by functioning as E3 ligases that promote RIP1 ubiquitination.Mol.

Notably, several other E3 ligases (MDM2, TRIM63, ITCH, E6AP, and RNF4) building other types of poly-ubiquitin chains were not influenced by C25-140 (Fig. 2, B–D). In addition to these studies on a set of E3 ligases, we tested whether C25-140 inhibits E1–E2 reactions. To this end, we treated different E1–E2 pairs employing nine different E2 enzymes with compound C25-140. All reactions, including UbcH13–Uev1a, were not affected by C25-140 (Fig. 3), confirming that C25-140 acts on the E3 ligase side.Figure 3.Effect of C25-140 on E1 and E2 enzymes. Various E1–E2 ubiquitination reactions, including UbcH13–Uev1a, were carried out in the absence or presence of C25-140 (30 μm). None of the reactions is affected by the compound.

C25-140 neither substantially influenced cell viability in MEF cells and Jurkat T cells at concentrations up to 50 μm (Fig. S3A) nor influenced cell cycle phases of Jurkat T cells (Fig. S3B). We first tested the inhibitory potential of C25-140 in MEF cells that can be stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα to trigger NF-κB activation. Stimulation of these cells with IL-1β initially induces TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination that is required for signal progression through the IKK complex toward NF-κB activation and expression of NF-κB–dependent target genes (8Xie P. TRAF molecules in cell signaling and in human diseases.J. Mol. Signal. 2013; 8 (23758787): 710.1186/1750-2187-8-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). C25-140 treatment of MEF cells led to a dose-dependent reduction of TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination (Fig. 4A) followed by decreased levels of phosphorylated IκBα (Fig. 4B), which translated into diminished target gene expression (Fig. 4C). These data illustrate that inhibition of TRAF6 activity early during IL-1 receptor signaling hampers the signaling cascade toward NF-κB activation. Additionally, TNFα-induced phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. S4A) as well as NF-κB–induced target gene expression (Fig. S4B) were affected by C25-140 treatment. Taken together, C25-140 efficiently inhibits IL-1β– and TNFα–mediated receptor signaling in the context of cytokine activation. In addition to IL-1β receptor signaling, we tested C25-140 on T-cell activation, as TCR-mediated NF-κB activation relies on TRAF6 activity (27Oeckinghaus A. Wegener E. Welteke V. Ferch U. Arslan S.C. Ruland J. Scheidereit C. Krappmann D. Malt1 ubiquitination triggers NF-κB signaling upon T-cell activation.EMBO J. 2007; 26 (17948050): 4634-464510.1038/sj.emboj.7601897Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 28Sun L. Deng L.

In the human Jurkat T-cell line, T-cell activation by PMA/ionomycin (P/I) stimulation led to TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination that was diminished by C25-140 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). Again, decreased TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination affected downstream signaling, as evident from reduced IκBα phosphorylation and cytokine secretion (Fig. 4, E and F). Moreover, P/I-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was diminished by C25-140 (Fig. S4C). All of these data emphasize that C25-140 also affects TCR-mediated immune response in a human-derived cell line. Next, we used primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three healthy individuals to investigate whether C25-140 is also competing with TRAF6-dependent receptor signaling in primary human cells. In line with our data acquired in cell lines (Fig. 4), C25-140 reduced secretion of NF-κB–driven inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-6, after IL-1β stimulation (Fig. 5A) or IL-1β and TNFα upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 5B), clearly indicating that C25-140 also reduces cytokine and innate immune responses in primary human blood cells. Similar inhibitory effects by C25-140 could be proven in human PBMCs after stimulating the adaptive immune response with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies for TCR signaling (Fig. 5C). Therefore, C25-140 is capable of inhibiting cytokine signaling also in cells of primary human origin. In addition to primary human cells, we verified the inhibitory potential of C25-140 in ex vivo primary murine T cells and observed dose-dependent reduction of IL-2 mRNA and protein levels after CD3/CD28 stimulation (Fig. 5D). Before moving into in vivo mouse studies, we analyzed the compound's suitability for in vivo application. To this end, we performed ADME studies assessing key parameters (Fig. S5A). Here, C25-140 was stable in plasma as well as in microsomes, showed 96.8% plasma protein binding, and exhibited low binding to hERG. Only in terms of cytochrome P450 did the compound show some inhibitory potential on distinct CYPs (Fig. S5A). Next, we tested the PK of C25-140 after intravenous, peroral, and intraperitoneal injection of mice with 10 mg/kg C25-140 each. In general, a rapid initial distribution phase was observed, and C25-140 had good calculated oral bioavailability (Fig. S5, B and C). Altogether, results from ADME and pharmacokinetics measurements underscored that compound C25-140 had appropriate properties to be applied in mouse studies for in vivo efficacy testing. In a first in vivo mouse model, we aimed at investigating the effects of C25-140 on psoriasis, an autoimmune disease. In this model, psoriasis is induced by imiquimod (IMQ), which activates TLR7 signaling (29Gilliet M. Conrad C. Geiges M. Cozzio A. Thürlimann W. Burg G. Nestle F.O. Dummer R. Psoriasis triggered by toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod in the presence of dermal plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors.Arch. Dermatol. 2004; 140 (15611427): 1490-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), a pathway employing TRAF6 for signal progression. IMQ was topically applied to the shaved back as well as the right ear of mice. On the same regions, C25-140 was topically applied twice daily at a final dose of ∼1.5 mg/kg per application. Parameters describing disease outcome were scored every day, and samples for IL-17 cytokine measurement were collected at day 6 (Fig. 6A). C25-140 was able to significantly reduce the “cumulative score” (Fig. 6B), the overall “thickness score” (Fig. 6C), “scaling” (Fig. 6D), and “erythema” (Fig. 6E). Moreover, analysis of IL-17 cytokine expression in the right ear tissue proved its down-regulation as a consequence of C25-140 treatment (Fig. 6F). This first efficacy study demonstrates that C25-140, an inhibitor of TRAF6 activity, is able to ameliorate symptoms of autoimmune psoriasis. As pointed out earlier, it has previously been reported that levels of TRAF6 are elevated in RA patients (16Zhu L.J. Dai L. Zheng D.H. Mo Y.Q. Ou-Yang X. Wei X.N. Shen J. Zhang B.Y. Upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 correlated with synovitis severity in rheumatoid arthritis.Arthritis Res.

Therefore, we investigated whether C25-140 is effective in a preclinical mouse model of autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis. We chose the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model (30Brand D.D. Latham K.A. Rosloniec E.F. Collagen-induced arthritis.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 (17546023): 1269-127510.1038/nprot.2007.173Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) in which TRAF6 is up-regulated during disease progression and RA symptoms are reversed by the application of siRNA-based TRAF6 knockdown (17Wang H. Chen W. Wang L. Li F. Zhang C. Xu L. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 promotes migration of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes.Mol. Med. Rep. 2015; 11 (25522907): 2761-276610.3892/mmr.2014.3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), stressing the biological relevance of this in vivo model for the TRAF6 E3 ligase functions. In our study, RA was induced by injection of collagen at day 0, followed by a collagen boost injection at day 21 to promote the development of arthritic symptoms. At day 28, compound C25-140 was intraperitoneally administered twice daily at three doses (6, 10, and 14 mg/kg) over a period of 14 days. In RA, patients usually receive treatment when symptoms become apparent. Thus, we started dosing C25-140 in the CIA model when mice already had developed symptoms of RA (arthritic index of ∼3), thereby reflecting the diseased patient. Prednisolone served as a positive control. Mice were daily scored for arthritic index and euthanized on day 42 to collect limbs for histopathology (Fig. 7A). Throughout the entire study, the body weight of all mice was monitored and did not show any reduction, indicating that there were no signs of obvious toxicity (Fig. S6). Intriguingly, C25-140 ameliorated the arthritic index to almost baseline levels in this efficacy model at doses of 10 and 14 mg/kg (Fig. 7B). Tissue sections of the limbs (Fig. 7C and Fig. S7) evidently verified that C25-140 dose-dependently improved symptoms of RA including inflammation and structural damage. In addition, all sections were quantified based on parameters of disease appearance, such as summed scores, inflammation, pannus, cartilage damage, and several more (Fig. 7 (D and E) and Fig. S8). These data also underlined the dose-dependent improvement of RA disease outcome. Taken together, we present a successful preclinical proof-of-concept study for C25-140 in an RA efficacy model. In this report, we present a high-throughput screening campaign that successfully discovered a novel PPI inhibitor, namely C25-140, which is capable of reducing TRAF6 E3 ligase activity by interfering with the TRAF6–Ubc13 interaction. Moreover, C25-140 exhibits inhibitory effects on various immune and inflammatory signaling pathways in cell lines as well as primary human and murine cells. Notably, inhibition of these pathways should be beneficial for treating a highly inflamed immune system. In line with this notion, C25-140 ameliorated symptoms of autoimmune diseases in in vivo preclinical efficacy models of psoriasis and RA. Hence, our reverse chemical genetics approach presented in this study underlines the importance of TRAF6 activity for the development and persistence of autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis and RA. TRAF6 belongs to the RING type of E3 ligases, where the RING domain makes a protein–protein interaction with the ubiquitin-charged Ubc13 protein. Here, the ubiquitin is transferred from Ubc13 (E2) t"

https://openalex.org/W2810268000,"Objective African Americans, East Asians, and Hispanics with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) are more likely to develop lupus nephritis (LN) than are SLE patients of European descent. The etiology of this difference is not clear, and this study was undertaken to investigate how genetic variants might explain this effect. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 1244 SLE patients from multiethnic case collections were genotyped for 817,810 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. Continental genetic ancestry was estimated utilizing the program ADMIXTURE. Gene-based testing and pathway analysis was performed within each ethnic group and meta-analyzed across ethnicities. We also performed candidate SNP association tests with SNPs previously established as risk alleles for SLE, LN, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Association testing and logistic regression models were performed with LN as the outcome, adjusted for continental ancestries, sex, disease duration, and age. Results We studied 255 North European, 263 South European, 238 Hispanic, 224 African American and 264 East Asian SLE patients, of whom 606 had LN (48.7%). In genome-wide gene-based and candidate SNP analyses, we found distinct genes, pathways and established risk SNPs associated with LN for each ethnic group. Gene-based analyses showed significant associations between variation in ZNF546 (p = 1.0E-06), TRIM15 (p = 1.0E-06), and TRIMI0 (p = 1.0E-06) and LN among South Europeans, and TTC34 (p = 8.0E-06) was significantly associated with LN among Hispanics. The SNP rs8091180 in NFATC1 was associated with LN (OR 1.43, p = 3.3E-04) in the candidate SNP meta-analysis with the highest OR among African-Americans (OR 2.17, p = 0.0035). Conclusion Distinct genetic factors are associated with the risk of LN in SLE patients of different ethnicities. CKD risk alleles may play a role in the development of LN in addition to SLE-associated risk variants. These findings may further explain the clinical heterogeneity of LN risk and response to therapy observed between different ethnic groups."

https://openalex.org/W2810852005,"Previous research in various species has shown that granulocyte-colony stimulating factor stimulates the production and release of neutrophils from bone marrow. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of polyethylene glycol-bound bovine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (pegbovigrastim; Imrestor, Elanco) on circulating leukocyte counts. Thirty-four Holstein cows were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of either physiologic saline (n = 16) or pegbovigrastim (n = 18), 7 days before expected calving (d -7) and within 24 hours after calving (d 0). Cows were sampled at d -7, d -6, d 0, d +1, d +7, and d +21, relative to calving. Only cows for which the interval from the first injection to calving was ≥ 4 d and ≤ 10 d were included, such that the interval (mean ± SD) from first treatment to calving was 6.7 ± 1.9 d. Treatment effects were assessed with mixed linear regression models. After the first injection, neutrophil counts (×109/ L) in pegbovigrastim-treated cows increased from 4.3 (95% CI 3.8 to 4.8) at d -7 to 18.2 (CI 16.3 to 20.3) at d -6 (P < 0.0001). Their counts then decreased from d -6 to d 0, when the second injection was administered, at a rate of -0.31 ×109 neutrophils/L/day (P < 0.0001). After the second injection, neutrophil counts increased from 16.4 (CI 13.7 to 19.6) at d 0 to 32.8 (CI 25.2 to 42.7) at d +1 (P < 0.0001), after which counts decreased at a rate of -3.73 ×109 neutrophils/L/day until d +7 (P < 0.0001). Counts continued to decrease from d +7 to d +21 at a slower rate of -0.43 ×109 neutrophils/L/day (P < 0.0001), until baseline levels were reached. Conversely, in control cows, neutrophil counts were unchanged from d -7 to d -6 (P = 0.86) after the first injection and then decreased from 6.1 (CI 5.0-7.3) at d 0, to 3.2 (CI 2.4-4.2) at d +1 (P < 0.0001) after the second injection. Neutrophil count was greater (P < 0.001) in pegbovigrastim-treated than in control cows at days -6, 0, +1 and +7. Area under the curve (cells ×109/ L per 28 d) for neutrophil counts in the pegbovigrastim group was 429, versus 99 in the control group (P < 0.0001). The response to each injection of pegbovigrastim was additive and consisted of 95% segmented neutrophils, suggesting that the effect of the treatment was to release mature neutrophils from a substantial pool available in the bone marrow. The sustained increase in circulating neutrophil count around the time of calving may contribute to improved health during the peripartum transition period."
https://openalex.org/W2809833497,"Norwegian Health authorities recommend solid food to be introduced between child age 4–6 months, depending on both the mother´s and infant’s needs. The aim of this paper is to describe timing of complementary feeding in a current sample of Norwegian mother/infant-dyads and explore potential associations between timing of introduction to solid foods and a wide range of maternal and infant characteristics known from previous literature to influence early feeding interactions. The paper is based on data from the Norwegian randomized controlled trial Early Food for Future Health. In 2016, a total of 715 mothers completed a web-based questionnaire at child age 5.5 months. We found that 5% of the infants were introduced to solid food before 4 months of age, while 14% were not introduced to solid food at 5.5 months of age. Introduction of solid food before 4 months of age was associated with the infant not being exclusive breastfed the first month, receiving only formula milk at 3 months, the mother being younger, not married/cohabitant, smoking, less educated and having more economic difficulties. Not being introduced to solid food at 5.5 months was associated with the infant being a girl, being exclusive breastfed the first month, receiving only breastmilk at 3 months, the mother being older, married and having 3 or more children. This study shows that there are still clear socioeconomic differences regarding timing of complementary feeding in Norway. Infants of younger, less educated and smoking mothers are at higher risk of not being fed in compliance with the official infant feeding recommendations. Our findings emphasize the importance of targeting socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers for support on healthy feeding practices focusing on the infant`s needs to prevent early onset of social inequalities in health."
https://openalex.org/W2810285385,"Under fasting conditions, activation of several hepatic genes sets the stage for gluconeogenesis in the liver. cAMP response element–binding protein (CREB), CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2), and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) are essential for this transcriptional induction of gluconeogenic genes. PGC-1α induction is mediated by activation of a CREB/CRTC2 signaling complex, and recent findings have revealed that small heterodimer partner–interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE), a member of the CREB/ATF family of basic region–leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, is an insulin-inducible corepressor that decreases PGC-1α expression and abrogates its stimulatory effect on hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism whereby SMILE suppresses PGC-1α expression is unknown. Here, we investigated SMILE's effects on the CREB/CRTC2 signaling pathway and glucose metabolism. We found that SMILE significantly inhibits CREB/CRTC2-induced PGC-1α expression by interacting with and disrupting the CREB/CRTC2 complex. Consequently, SMILE decreased PGC-1α–induced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Furthermore, SMILE inhibited CREB/CRTC2-induced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) gene expression by directly repressing the expression of these genes and by indirectly inhibiting the expression of PGC-1α via CREB/CRTC2 repression. Indeed, enhanced gluconeogenesis and circulating blood glucose levels in mice injected with an adenovirus construct containing a constitutively active CRTC2 variant (CRTC2–S171A) were significantly reduced by WT SMILE, but not by leucine zipper–mutated SMILE. These results reveal that SMILE represses CREB/CRTC2-induced PGC-1α expression, an insight that may help inform potential therapeutic approaches targeting PGC-1α–mediated regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2809795855,"The Triple Code Model (TCM) of numerical cognition argues for the existence of three representational codes for number: Arabic digits, verbal number words, and analog nonsymbolic magnitude representations, each subserved by functionally dissociated neural substrates. Despite the popularity of the TCM, no study to date has explored all three numerical codes within one fMRI paradigm. We administered three tasks, associated with each of the aforementioned numerical codes, in order to explore the neural correlates of numerosity processing in a sample of adults (N = 46). Independent task–control contrast analyses revealed task-dependent activity in partial support of the model, but also highlight the inherent complexity of a distributed and overlapping fronto-parietal network involved in all numerical codes. The results indicate that the TCM correctly predicts the existence of some functionally dissociated neural substrates, but requires an update that accounts for interactions with attentional processes. Parametric contrasts corresponding to differences in task difficulty revealed specific neural correlates of the distance effect, where closely spaced numbers become more difficult to discriminate than numbers spaced further apart. A conjunction analysis illustrated overlapping neural correlates across all tasks, in line with recent proposals for a fronto-parietal network of number processing. We additionally provide tentative results suggesting the involvement of format-independent numerosity-sensitive retinotopic maps in the early visual stream, extending previous findings of nonsymbolic stimulus selectivity. We discuss the functional roles of the components associated with the model, as well as the purported fronto-parietal network, and offer arguments in favor of revising the TCM."
https://openalex.org/W2809767187,"We hypothesized (1) that gastrointestinal (GI) and renal adverse events (AE) would occur more often in infants first prescribed ibuprofen before rather than after six months of age and (2) that ibuprofen would be associated with more adverse effects than acetaminophen in infants younger than six months.We created two partly overlapping retrospective cohorts of infants aged less than six months when California Medicaid first paid for ibuprofen or acetaminophen between 2004 and 2010. In the first cohort we compared the incidence rate ratio (RR) of GI and renal AE between those infants first prescribed ibuprofen before six months of age with those first prescribed ibuprofen after six months of age. In the second cohort we compared the RR of GI and renal AE between infants younger than six months prescribed ibuprofen (+/-acetaminophen) with those prescribed only acetaminophen.We identified 41,669 prescriptions for ibuprofen and 176,991 prescriptions for acetaminophen in 180,333 eligible infants (median age 2.1 months). We did not observe higher RR of any AE in infants first prescribed ibuprofen before rather than after six months of age. Most infants prescribed ibuprofen were also prescribed acetaminophen. Any GI (adjusted (a)RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.38) and moderate or severe GI AE (aRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.09-1.40) were more common in infants younger than six months who were prescribed ibuprofen versus acetaminophen alone. Severe GI (aRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.27-1.45) and renal AE (aRR 1.84 95% CI 0.66-5.19) were not different between the ibuprofen (+/-acetaminophen) and acetaminophen-only groups.GI and renal AEs were not higher in infants younger than six months who were prescribed ibuprofen compared with those aged six to 12 months. AEs were increased in infants younger than six months who were prescribed ibuprofen compared with infants who were prescribed acetaminophen alone."
https://openalex.org/W2809771237,"The adenoviruses are essential tools for basic research and therapeutic development. Robust methods for the generation of mutant and recombinant viruses are crucial for these diverse applications. Here we describe a simple plasmid-based method that permits highly efficient modification of the adenoviral genome and rapid production of high-titer virus stocks. The 36-kilobase genome of adenovirus serotype 5 was divided into seven tractable blocks that could be individually modified in a single step and reassembled in vitro. Because the system is composed of compact modules, modifications at different loci can be readily recombined. Viral assemblies were delivered to packaging cells by electroporation, a strategy that consistently resulted in the de novo production of 108 infectious units in 3–5 days. In principle, a similar strategy could be applied to any other adenovirus serotype or to other double-strand DNA viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2810224687,"Despite its efficacy, the uptake of HU in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is poor likely due to a combination of system, provider, and patient-related factors. We investigated attitudes of adult patients towards HU by conducting qualitative interviews with 95 adult SCD patients (age 18 to 67 years old, 71 were female). While 53% of all participants reported that they were currently taking HU, patients ranging in age 18–30 years (Group 1) were more likely to report current HU use as compared to those (Group 2) ranging in age 31–67 years (65% vs. 41% P = 0.01). Most Group 1 participants who reported currently taking HU indicated that the decision to start HU was made by a parent, though some made the decision themselves as a young adult. Group 1 participants expressed trust in the efficacy of HU as well as trust that their physician adequately shared risks and benefits for the medication. The Group 2 participants, who were not currently on HU, were skeptical that all the risks and benefits of HU were known, were concerned that the efficacy of HU was not proven, and that they were not receiving complete information about its potential side effects. Of Group 2 participants who reported currently being on HU, 25% were concerned about the side effects and efficacy of HU and reported continuing HU because of a lack of effective alternatives. These data suggest that there are significant differences by age in adult SCD patients’ attitudes towards, utilization and understanding of the risks and benefits of HU."
https://openalex.org/W2810481898,"Background In South Africa, access to second-trimester abortion services, which are generally performed using medical induction with misoprostol alone, is challenging for many women. We aimed to estimate the costs and cost effectiveness of providing three safe second-trimester abortion services (dilation and evacuation (D&E)), medical induction with mifepristone and misoprostol (MI-combined), or medical induction with misoprostol alone (MI-misoprostol)) in Western Cape Province, South Africa to aid policymakers with planning for service provision in South Africa and similar settings. Methods We derived clinical outcomes data for this economic evaluation from two previously conducted clinical studies. In 2013–2014, we collected cost data from three public hospitals where the studies took place. We collected cost data from the health service perspective through micro-costing activities, including discussions with site staff. We used decision tree analysis to estimate average costs per patient interaction (e.g. first visit, procedure visit, etc.), the total average cost per procedure, and cost-effectiveness in terms of the cost per complete abortion. We discounted equipment costs at 3%, and present the results in 2015 US dollars. Results D&E services were the least costly and the most cost-effective at $91.17 per complete abortion. MI-combined was also less costly and more cost-effective (at $298.03 per complete abortion) than MI-misoprostol (at $375.31 per complete abortion), in part due to a shortened inpatient stay. However, an overlap in the plausible cost ranges for the two medical procedures suggests that the two may have equivalent costs in some circumstances. Conclusion D&E was most cost-effective in this analysis. However, due to resistance from health care providers and other barriers, these services are not widely available and scale-up is challenging. Given South Africa’s reliance on medical induction, switching to the combined regimen could result in greater access to second-trimester services due to shorter inpatient stays without increasing costs."
https://openalex.org/W2811022508,"Studies on monolayer cultures and whole-animal models for the prediction of the response of native human tissue are associated with limitations. Therefore, more and more laboratories are tending towards multicellular spheroids grown in vitro as a model of native tissues. In addition, they are increasingly used in a wide range of biofabrication methodologies. These 3D microspheroids are generated through a self-assembly process that is still poorly characterised, called cellular aggregation. Here, a system is proposed for the automated, non-invasive and high throughput monitoring of the morphological changes during cell aggregation. Microwell patterned inserts were used for spheroid formation while an automated microscope with 4x bright-field objective captured the morphological changes during this process. Subsequently, the acquired time-lapse images were automatically segmented and several morphological features such as minor axis length, major axis length, roundness, area, perimeter and circularity were extracted for each spheroid. The method was quantitatively validated with respect to manual segmentation on four sets of ± 60 spheroids. The average sensitivities and precisions of the proposed segmentation method ranged from 96.67–97.84% and 96.77–97.73%, respectively. In addition, the different morphological features were validated, obtaining average relative errors between 0.78–4.50%. On average, a spheroid was processed 73 times faster than a human operator. As opposed to existing algorithms, our methodology was not only able to automatically monitor compact spheroids but also the aggregation process of individual spheroids, and this in an accurate and high-throughput manner. In total, the aggregation behaviour of more than 700 individual spheroids was monitored over a duration of 16 hours with a time interval of 5 minutes, and this could be increased up to 48,000 for the described culture format. In conclusion, the proposed system has the potential to be used for unravelling the mechanisms involved in spheroid formation and monitoring their formation during large-scale manufacturing protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2809758586,"Mandibular distraction is a surgical process that progressively lengthens bone. To improve the distraction procedure and devices, the load of distraction and the mechanical strain of soft tissues during the process must be determined. We tested the assumption that it could be the periosteum primarily opposing distraction. Therefore we assessed the mechanical properties of the human mandibular periosteum and compared the stress-strain data with the torque measured on the activator during a cadaveric mandibular distraction. A 20 mm horizontal mandibular distraction was performed in 7 cadavers using standard distractors. Torque was measured with a torquemeter placed on the activation rods of the devices, providing a load (Lt) for each millimeter of distraction. In parallel, 18 periosteum samples were harvested from 9 cadaver mandibles. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed on the specimens and an estimated load (Lc) was calculated using periosteal stress-strain data and mandibular dimensions. During the distraction process, we observed an increase of the load Lt from 11.6 to 50.6 N. The periosteum exhibited a nonlinear viscoelastic stress-strain relationship, typical of biological tissues composed of collagen and elastin. The median Lc and Lt were not significantly different for the first millimeter of distraction. We demonstrated the periosteum is primarily responsible for opposing the distraction load."
https://openalex.org/W2810472477,"Based on the feature of high-altitude permafrost topography and the diverse microbial ecological communities of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, soil samples from thirteen different collection points around Qinghai lake were collected to screen for extremophilic strains with the ability to degrade phenol, and one bacterial strain recorded as TIBETAN4 that showed effective biodegradation of phenol was isolated and identified. TIBETAN4 was closely related to Kocuria based on its observed morphological, molecular and biochemical characteristics. TIBETAN4 grew well in the LB medium at pH 7–9 and 0–4% NaCl showing alkalophilicity and halophilism. The isolate could also tolerate up to 12.5 mM phenol and could degrade 5 mM phenol within 3 days. It maintained a high phenol degradation rate at pH 7–9 and 0–3% NaCl in MSM with 5 mM phenol added as the sole carbon source. Moreover, TIBETAN4 could maintain efficient phenol degradation activity in MSM supplemented with both phenol and glucose and complex water environments, including co-culture Penicillium strains or selection of non-sterilized natural lake water as a culture. It was found that TIBETAN4 showed enzymatic activity of phenol hydroxylase and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase after induction by phenol and the corresponding genes of the two enzymes were detected in the genome of the isolate, while catechol 2,3-dioxygenase or its gene was not, which means there could be a degradation pathway of phenol through the ortho-pathway. The Q-PCR results showed that the transcripts of both the phenol hydroxylase gene and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase gene were up-regulated under the stimulation of phenol, demonstrating again that the strain degraded phenol via ortho-degradation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2811305091,"Introduction Policy makers increasingly need to prioritise between competing health technologies or patient populations. When aiming to align allocation decisions with societal preferences, knowledge and operationalisation of such preferences is indispensable. This study examines the distribution of three views on healthcare priority setting in the Netherlands, labelled “Equal right to healthcare”, “Limits to healthcare”, and “Effective and efficient healthcare”, and their relationship with preferences in willingness to trade-off (WTT) exercises. Methods A survey including four reimbursement scenarios was conducted in a representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands (n = 261). Respondents were matched to one of the three views based on their agreement with 14 statements on principles for resource allocation. We tested for WTT differences between respondents with different views and applied logit regression models for examining the relationship between preferences and background characteristics, including views. Results Nearly 65% of respondents held the view “Equal right to healthcare”, followed by “Limits to healthcare” (22.5%), and “Effective and efficient healthcare” (7.1%). Most respondents (75.9%) expressed WTT in at least one scenario and preferred gains in quality of life over life expectancy, maximising gains over limiting inequality, treating children over elderly, and those with adversity over those with an unhealthy lifestyle. Various background characteristics, including the views, were associated with respondents’ preferences. Conclusions Most respondents held an egalitarian view on priority setting, yet the majority was willing to prioritise regardless of their view. Societal views and preferences concerning healthcare priority setting are related. However, respondents’ views influence preferences differently in different reimbursement scenarios. As societal views and preferences are heterogeneous and may conflict, aligning allocation decisions with societal preferences remains challenging and any decision may be expected to receive opposition from some group in society."
https://openalex.org/W2811460956,"Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a secreted apolipoprotein with three isoforms, E2, E3, and E4, that binds to lipids and facilitates their transport in the extracellular environment of the brain and the periphery. The E4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and studies of human brain and mouse models have revealed that E4 significantly exacerbates the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ). It has been suggested that this deposition could be attributed to the formation of soluble ApoE isoform–specific ApoE–Aβ complexes. However, previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the directionality and strength of those interactions. In this study, using a series of flow cytometry assays that maintain the physiological integrity of ApoE–Aβ complexes, we systematically assessed the association of Aβ with ApoE2, E3, or E4. We used ApoE secreted from HEK cells or astrocytes overexpressing ApoE fused with a GFP tag. As a source of soluble Aβ peptide, we used synthetic Aβ40 or Aβ42 or physiological Aβ secreted from CHO cell lines overexpressing WT or V717F variant amyloid precursor protein (APP). We observed significant interactions between the different ApoE isoforms and Aβ, with E4 interacting with Aβ more strongly than the E2 and E3 isoforms. We also found subtle differences depending on the Aβ type and the ApoE-producing cell type. In conclusion, these results indicate that the strength of the ApoE–Aβ association depends on the source of Aβ or ApoE."
https://openalex.org/W2810768725,"In MRI, subject motion results in image artifacts. High-resolution 3D scans, like MPRAGE, are particularly susceptible to motion because of long scan times and acquisition of data over multiple-shots. Such motion related artifacts have been shown to cause a bias in cortical measures extracted from segmentation of high-resolution MPRAGE images. Prospective motion correction (PMC) techniques have been developed to help mitigate artifacts due to subject motion. In this work, high-resolution MPRAGE images are acquired during intentional head motion to evaluate the effectiveness of navigator-based PMC techniques to improve both the accuracy and reproducibility of cortical morphometry measures obtained from image segmentation. The contribution of reacquiring segments of k-space affected by motion to the overall performance of PMC is assessed. Additionally, the effect of subject motion on subcortical structure volumes is investigated. In the presence of head motion, navigator-based PMC is shown to improve both the accuracy and reproducibility of cortical and subcortical measures. It is shown that reacquiring segments of k-space data that are corrupted by motion is an essential part of navigator-based PMC performance. Subcortical structure volumes are not affected by motion in the same way as cortical measures; there is not a consistent underestimation."
https://openalex.org/W2810430281,"The effect of plant population density (PPD) and root-induced leaf cytokinin on the compensatory growth of potted corn seedlings during post-drought rewatering was investigated. The study design comprised four treatments: (1) wetness with low PPD, (2) wetness with high PPD, (3) rewatering with low PPD, and (4) rewatering with high PPD. Results showed that drought stress restrained the growth of corns. By contrast, rewatering enhanced the net photosynthetic rate and growth of corns. During the 8 days of rewatering, compensatory growth during post-drought rewatering occurred in corns with high PPD; however, such compensatory growth did not occur in corns with low PPD. Zeatin riboside concentrations in leaves and xylem saps were significantly higher under rewatering treatment than those under wet treatment. High leaf cytokinin concentration accelerated corn growth. The coefficients of variation and Gini-coefficient of wet treatment were significantly higher than those of rewatering treatment under high PPD, demonstrating that intense intraspecific competition occurred in the wet treatment. Extreme intraspecific competition negatively affected net photosynthetic rate. In brief, the interactions between root-induced leaf cytokinin and weak intraspecific competition promoted the compensatory growth under high PPD."
https://openalex.org/W2811161480,"The pleiotropic hormone leptin has a pivotal role in regulating energy balance by inhibiting hunger and increasing energy expenditure. Homozygous mutations found in the leptin gene are associated with extreme obesity, marked hyperphagia, and impaired immune function. Although these mutations have been characterized in vivo, a detailed understanding of how they affect leptin structure and function remains elusive. In the current work, we used NMR, differential scanning calorimetry, molecular dynamics simulations, and bioinformatics calculations to characterize the effects of these mutations on leptin structure and function and binding to its cognate receptor. We found that mutations identified in patients with congenital leptin deficiency not only cause leptin misfolding or aggregation, but also cause changes in the dynamics of leptin residues on the receptor-binding interface. Therefore, we infer that mutation-induced leptin deficiency may arise from several distinct mechanisms including (i) blockade of leptin receptor interface II, (ii) decreased affinity in the second step of leptin's interaction with its receptor, (iii) leptin destabilization, and (iv) unsuccessful threading through the covalent loop, leading to leptin misfolding/aggregation. We propose that this expanded framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying leptin deficiency arising from genetic mutations may be useful in designing therapeutics for leptin-associated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2810318459,"Background The role of intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) during cholecystectomy is debated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility, benefit and risk of performing systematic IOC in patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute gallstone-related disease. Methods Between July 2013 and January 2015, all patients admitted for an acute gallstone-related condition and undergoing same-hospital-stay cholecystectomy were prospectively followed. IOC was systematically attempted and predictors of IOC failure were analyzed. Results Among the 581 enrolled patients, IOC was deliberately not performed in 3 cases. IOC was successful in 509/578 patients (88.1%). The main predictors of IOC failure were age, body mass index, male gender and associated acute cholecystitis. Thirty-two patients with suspected common bile duct stone on IOC underwent 38 unnecessary negative postoperative common bile duct investigations (32/509, 6.3%). There was one IOC-related adverse outcome (mild pancreatitis, 1/578, 0.2%). Conclusions IOC can be successfully and safely performed in the majority of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute gallstone-related disease. Although its positive predictive value is suboptimal and results in a number of unnecessary postoperative common bile duct investigations, IOC accurately rules out common bile duct stones in patients with acute gallstone-related conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2810357903,"Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of breast, colon, and endometrial cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms such as changes in DNA methylation may help to explain these protective effects. We assessed the impact of a one year aerobic exercise intervention on DNA methylation biomarkers believed to play a role in carcinogenesis. The Alberta Physical Activity and Breast Cancer Prevention (ALPHA) Trial was a two-armed randomized controlled trial in 320 healthy, inactive, postmenopausal women with no history of cancer. In an ancillary analysis, frozen blood samples (n = 256) were reassessed for levels of DNA methylation within LINE-1 and Alu repeats as well as within the promoter regions of APC, BRCA1, RASSF1, and hTERT genes. Differences between the exercise and control arm at 12-months, after adjusting for baseline values, were estimated within an intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis using linear regression. No significant differences in DNA methylation between the exercise and control arms were observed. In an exploratory analysis, we found that the prospective change in estimated VO2max was negatively associated with RASSF1 methylation in a dose-response manner (p-trend = 0.04). A year-long aerobic exercise intervention does not affect LINE-1, Alu, APC, BRCA1, RASSF1, or hTERT methylation in healthy, inactive, postmenopausal women. Changes in DNA methylation within these genomic regions may not mediate the association between physical activity and cancer in healthy postmenopausal women. Additional research is needed to validate our findings with RASSF1 methylation.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00522262."
https://openalex.org/W2810496678,"Spatial distribution is an important topic in community ecology and a key to understanding the structure and dynamics of populations and communities. However, the available information related to the spatial patterns of soil mite communities in long-term tillage agroecosystems remains insufficient. In this study, we examined the spatial patterns of soil mite communities to explain the spatial relationships between soil mite communities and soil parameters. Soil fauna were sampled three times (August, September and October 2015) at 121 locations arranged regularly within a 400 m × 400 m monitoring plot. Additionally, we estimated the physical and chemical parameters of the same sampling locations. The distribution patterns of the soil mite community and the edaphic parameters were analyzed using a range of geostatistical tools. Moran’s I coefficient showed that, during each sampling period, the total abundance of the soil mite communities and the abundance of the dominant mite populations were spatially autocorrelated. The soil mite communities demonstrated clear patchy distribution patterns within the study plot. These patterns were sampling period-specific. Cross-semivariograms showed both negative and positive cross-correlations between soil mite communities and environmental factors. Mantel tests showed a significant and positive relationship between soil mite community and soil organic matter and soil pH only in August. This study demonstrated that in the cornfield, the soil mite distribution exhibited strong or moderate spatial dependence, and the mites formed patches with sizes less than one hundred meters. In addition, in this long-term tillage agroecosystem, soil factors had less influence on the observed pattern of soil mite communities. Further experiments that take into account human activity and spatial factors should be performed to study the factors that drive the spatial distribution of soil microarthropods."

https://openalex.org/W2810195961,"Introduction Fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of treatment in hemorrhagic shock. Despite increasing doubts, several guidelines recommend to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg as the most frequent indication of fluid therapy. Our aim was to investigate the effects of a MAP-guided management in a bleeding-resuscitation animal experiment. Materials and methods After anesthesia and instrumentation (tbsl) animals were bled till the initial stroke volume index dropped by 50% (t0). Fluid replacement was performed in 4 equivalent steps (t1-4) with balanced crystalloid solution to reach the baseline values of MAP. Invasive hemodynamic measurements and blood gas analyses were performed after each step. Results Mean arterial pressure dropped from tbsl to t0 (114±11 vs 76.9±16.9 mmHg, p<0.001) and returned to baseline by t4 (101.4±14.4 mmHg). From tbsl-t0 stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index (CI) decreased (SVI: 40±8.6 vs 19.3±3.6 ml/m2, p<0.001; CI: 3.4±0.3 vs 1.9±0.3 l/min/m2, p<0.001), pulse pressure variation (PPV) increased (13.2±4.3 vs 22.1±4.3%, p<0.001). There was a decrease in oxygen delivery (464±45 vs 246±26.9 ml/min, p<0.001), central venous oxygen saturation (82.8±5.4 vs 53.6±12.1%, p<0.001) and increase in lactate levels (1.6±0.4 vs 3.5±1.6 mmol/l, p<0.005). SVI, CI and PPV returned to their initial values by t2. To normalize MAP fluid therapy had to be continued till t4, with the total infused volume of 4.5±0.8 l. Conclusion In the current experiment bleeding led to hemorrhagic shock, while MAP remained higher than 65 mmHg. Furthermore, MAP was unable to indicate the normalization of SVI, CI and PPV that resulted in unnecessary fluid administration. Our data give further evidence that MAP may be an inappropriate parameter to follow during fluid resuscitation."

First, in men, HOMA-IR (β = 0.119, 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.304 to 8.003) constituted the independent factor determining ferritin, but this was not the case for HOMA-B (β = -0.042, 95% CI, -0.100 to 0.011). Second, in postmenopausal women, HOMA-IR (β = 0.087, 95% CI, 0.899 to 5.238) was the independent factor determining ferritin, but this was not the case for HOMA-B (β = -0.043, 95% CI, -0.065 to 0.010).

This effect is coined the “misery-is-not-miserly effect”. The paper that first established this effect is the second most-cited article appearing in Psychological Science in 2004. In light of its impact, the present study sought to assess whether the misery-is-not-miserly effect would replicate (a) in a novel context and (b) even when another way of alleviating a sense of loss (i.e., compensatory consumption) was available. Results revealed that the effect replicated in the novel context and, despite a prediction otherwise, even when individuals had an opportunity to engage in compensatory consumption. Moreover, a meta-analysis of the original effect and that observed in the present study yielded a small-to-medium effect (Cohen’s d = 0.43). As such, the present study lends evidentiary support to the misery-is-not-miserly effect and provides impetus for future research exploring the impact of sadness on consumer decision-making, specifically, and of emotion on decision processes, more generally."

Results of an experimental study (N = 191) showed that exposure-effects of affiliation related words on behavior instrumental in attaining affiliation goals cease when these words were co-activated with negative affect, but this cessation effect was relatively weak and non-significant. Subsequent analyses revealed that the effect was moderated by the affiliation motive: The cessation effect mainly occurred for individuals with a strong affiliation motive. Further, we found no evidence that word priming effects do merely occur via specific-word associations."
