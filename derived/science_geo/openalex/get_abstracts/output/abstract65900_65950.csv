https://openalex.org/W1529465204,"Abstract 3H-Testosterone injected into castrated rats was rapidly reduced to 3H-5α-dihydrotestosterone (3H-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one) in the ventral prostate. 3H-5α-Dihydrotestosterone was then retained by the ventral prostate for at least 6 hours, although virtually all radioactive steroids had disappeared from blood and some other rat tissues that are relatively insensitive to androgens. This selective retention was caused by a firm retention of 5α-dihydrotestosterone by a protein in prostate cell nuclei. The dihydrotestosterone-bound protein extracted from the labeled nuclei by a buffered salt solution migrated in a sucrose gradient centrifugation with a sedimentation constant of 3.0 ± 0.3 s20,w. The cytosol fraction of rat ventral prostate homogenates also contained a specific 5α-dihydrotestosterone-binding protein which has a sedimentation constant of 3.5 ± 0.3 s20,w. The selective retention of 5α-dihydrotestosterone by cell nuclei of ventral prostate could be shown by incubating minced prostate with 3H-testosterone, 3H-dihydrotestosterone, or 3H-Δ4-androstene-3,17-dione in vitro. If prostate cell nuclei were first isolated from castrated rats and then incubated with 3H-testosterone or 3H-5α-dihydrotestosterone, there was no retention of 5α-dihydrotestosterone in a protein-bound form; but upon addition of a cytosol fraction the nuclear fraction reisolated was found to retain 3H-5α-dihydrotestosterone as a complex with a 3 S protein. Available evidence suggests that prostate cell nuclei have specific sites that can retain a specific 5α-dihydrotestosterone-protein complex but not the protein moiety alone. The cytosol 3.5 S protein binds dihydrotestosterone spontaneously at 0°. At 37°, the 5α-dihydrotestosterone-protein complex extracted from prostate cell nuclei gradually releases the bound dihydrotestosterone. On the other hand, incubation of the cytosol protein at temperatures between 15–50° enhanced the 5α-dihydrotestosterone-binding capacity. Heating of the cytosol protein at temperature above 50° for 10 min destroyed such binding ability. Testosterone and cortisol bound to the 3.5 S prostate cytosol protein poorly, whereas binding of progesterone and 17β-estradiol was significant. Cyproterone (1,2α-methylene-6-chloro-Δ4, 6-pregnadien-17α-ol-3,20-dione) 17α-acetate, a potent antiandrogen, suppressed the uptake of radioactive androgens by rat ventral prostate in vivo. This was accompanied by a decrease in the retention of 5α-dihydrotestosterone by prostate cell nuclei. Cyproterone and its 17α-acetate (less than 1 µm) also inhibited the formation of a specific dihydrotestosterone-protein complex in prostate cell nuclei when minced prostate tissue was incubated with radioactive testosterone or 5α-dihydrotestosterone. 17β-Estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, and progesterone, but not cortisol, also suppressed the retention of 5α-dihydrotestosterone by prostatic cell nuclei in vitro, but to a much lesser extent than cyproterone acetate. The antagonistic action of antiandrogens strongly supports the contention that the binding of 5α-dihydrotestosterone by proteins described in this paper is germane to the stimulation of prostate growth and function by androgens."

The dye does not enter the cells from extracellular space. Thus permeability of junctional membranes is qualitatively different from that of nonjunctional membranes. Electron microscopy after fixation in the presence of lanthanum hydroxide indicates that these synapses are ""gap junctions"" and that there is a network of channels continuous with extracellular space between apposed junctional membranes. These channels must be interlaced with intercytoplasmic channels that are not open to extracellular space."

The animal was also taught to hold its breath for periods up to 4 minutes at the surface and then blow in the funnel. Alveolar collapse is probably complete at around 100 meters, and little pulmonary respiratory exchange occurs below that depth. Thoracic collapse was observ visually at 10 to 50 meters and by underwater television to 300 meters."

Antibodies to all three polynucleotides were found in a high percentage of the serums of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Antibodies to native DNA occurred almost exclusively in serums of patients in the active stages of systemic lupus erythematosus, whereas antibodies to single-stranded DNA were observed in the serums of patients with several diseases and of some normal individuals."

https://openalex.org/W1564425571,"Abstract The effect of d-glucosamine on the metabolism of adenine and uridine nucleotides in Sarcoma 180 ascites tumor cells was investigated as part of an effort to determine the biochemical basis for the cytotoxic effects of glucosamine on tumor cells. Incubation of ascites tumor cells with exogenous glucosamine resulted in a 4-fold increase in the pool size of UDP-N-acetylhexosamine. A large fraction of 14C-labeled uridine was accumulated as radioactive UDP-N-acetylhexosamine when the cells were incubated in the presence of d-glucosamine and labeled uridine. At the same time there was a significant reduction in radioactivity associated with UMP, UDP, UTP, and UDP-glucose, as well as a reduction of the UTP pool to half of its normal level. Glucosamine in the absence or in the presence of low (1 mm) concentrations of glucose caused a significant reduction of the intracellular ATP pool. However, no such decrease in the intracellular ATP level was observed in ascites cells exposed to glucosamine in the presence of 10 mm glucose."

https://openalex.org/W1999629110,"Threat vocalizations of male elephant seals Mirounga angustirostris vary among four populations on islands off the coast of California and Baja California, Mexico. Males at San Nicolas Island in Southern California emit sound pulses at more than double the rate of males at Aũo Nuevo Island, 528 kilometers north. Mean pulse rates at San Miguel Island and Isla de Guadalupe (408 and 944 kilometers south of Aũo Nuevo, respectively) are intermediate to these two. Pulse rate is homogeneous within each population and consistent in the same individual. Other properties of the calls which separate populations are pulse duration and embellishment of the initial or terminal pulse in a series. These geographical differences in vocal behavior resemble local dialects in birds and humans."
https://openalex.org/W1503679674,"Abstract The concentration-dependent equilibrium of glucagon in mildly alkaline solution involves the formation of associated forms of higher helicity. The equilibrium may be followed by the change of optical rotation with concentration. In acid solution, the effect is still present but much diminished. The association is accompanied by the generation of a new Cotton effect at 298 mµ, which is attributed to the single tryptophan residue. A further consequence of the association is a shift in the spectrophotometric titration curve of the tyrosine residues. Both at high and at low glucagon concentration, the ionization curves are fitted by two pKa values, which are 9.9 and 10.7 for the disaggregated material and 10.1 and 10.7 for the associated form. From the sequence, it is possible to deduce that it is Tyr-13 which undergoes a pKa shift on association, whereas the remaining tyrosine, Tyr-10, seems to be unaffected. It is suggested that the association should be viewed in terms of two linked equilibria, the associated state acting as a thermodynamic trap for the structured conformation. It is shown that the true association constants must differ from the apparent ones by a factor which may correspond to several kilocalories per mole in free energy. It is suggested that such a mechanism forms a general basis for interrelations between aggregation state and conformation and is relevant to such phenomena as refolding pathways of denatured proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2086896892,"An orthorhombic form of crystalline formylmethionine transter RNA has been obtained which contains one molecule as the asymmetric unit of the unit cell. Three-dimensional x-ray diffraction data have been collected up to a resolution of 12 angstroms, and from this a Patterson function has been calculated. The function contains an elongated ridge of interatomic vectors parallel to the c-axis of the crystal. Analysis of the function suggests that the molecules are elogated and dimerized in an overlapping antiparrael fashion along the c-axis. The dimer has a length near 109 angstroms and a width of 35 angstroms in one direction. The individual molecular length is approximately 80 angstroms with an irregular cross section measuring 25 by 35 angstrms."

https://openalex.org/W1541635024,"Abstract Seeds of the stone pine, Pinus pinea, have been shown to contain 24ξ-Δ5-stigmasten-3β-ol as well as smaller amounts of 24ξ-Δ5-ergosten-3β-ol and trans-Δ5,24(28)-stigmastadien-3β-ol. Germination of the seeds in the presence of 2-14C-mevalonate led to labeling of the steroids in a high yield. Isolation and reincubation of the labeled 24-ethylidene compound, trans-Δ5,24(28)-stigmastadien-3β-ol, produced the labeled 24-ethyl derivative, 24ξ-Δ5-stigmasten-3β-ol. The 24-substituted C1 analogue of the latter, 24ξ-Δ5-ergosten-3β-ol, was obtained labeled when the substrate contained the 24-methylene group (synthetic 28-14C-Δ5,24(28)-ergostadien-3β-ol). From germination in the presence of the 28-14C-Δ5,24(28)-ergostadien-3β-ol the 24-ethylidene derivative, 28-14C-trans-Δ5,24(28)-stigmastadien-3β-ol, was also formed. The results demonstrate that a second transfer of a C1 group to the Δ24(28) bond occurs with the formation of a 24-ethylidene group in the biosynthesis of 24-substituted C2 steroids. They also show that the Δ24(28) bond can undergo reduction to give the saturated C-24(28) bond in both the 24-substituted C1 and 24-substituted C2 cases."

https://openalex.org/W2092472359,Decay of cytosine-5-(3)H incorporated into bacteriophage S13 DNA causes a molectular rearrangement of the cytosine molecutle undergoing the decay. The molecular rearrangement produces a cytosine to thyimine coding change with at efficiency approaching one. Decay of either thymidine-(methyl)-(3)H or cytosine-6-(3)H is less than 1 percent as effective in calusing either cytosine to thymine or thymine to cytosine transitions.
