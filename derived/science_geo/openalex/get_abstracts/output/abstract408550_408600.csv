https://openalex.org/W2068734008,"The mammalian intestine is home to ~100 trillion bacteria that perform important metabolic functions for their hosts. The proximity of vast numbers of bacteria to host intestinal tissues raises the question of how symbiotic host-bacterial relationships are maintained without eliciting potentially harmful immune responses. Here, we show that RegIIIγ, a secreted antibacterial lectin, is essential for maintaining a ~50-micrometer zone that physically separates the microbiota from the small intestinal epithelial surface. Loss of host-bacterial segregation in RegIIIγ(-/-) mice was coupled to increased bacterial colonization of the intestinal epithelial surface and enhanced activation of intestinal adaptive immune responses by the microbiota. Together, our findings reveal that RegIIIγ is a fundamental immune mechanism that promotes host-bacterial mutualism by regulating the spatial relationships between microbiota and host."

https://openalex.org/W2150918587,"It has been suggested that tropical forest and savanna could represent alternative stable states, implying critical transitions at tipping points in response to altered climate or other drivers. So far, evidence for this idea has remained elusive, and integrated climate models assume smooth vegetation responses. We analyzed data on the distribution of tree cover in Africa, Australia, and South America to reveal strong evidence for the existence of three distinct attractors: forest, savanna, and a treeless state. Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation. These results allow the identification of regions where forest or savanna may most easily tip into an alternative state, and they pave the way to a new generation of coupled climate models."

https://openalex.org/W2044735268,"Conical intersections play a crucial role in the chemistry of most polyatomic molecules, ranging from the simplest bimolecular reactions to the photostability of DNA. The real-time study of the associated electronic dynamics poses a major challenge to the latest techniques of ultrafast measurement. We show that high-harmonic spectroscopy reveals oscillations in the electronic character that occur in nitrogen dioxide when a photoexcited wave packet crosses a conical intersection. At longer delays, we observe the onset of statistical dissociation dynamics. The present results demonstrate that high-harmonic spectroscopy could become a powerful tool to highlight electronic dynamics occurring along nonadiabatic chemical reaction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2076345183,"Background The precise mechanism and optimal measure of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness has yet to be elucidated. Preferential inhibition of feedback connectivity from frontal to parietal brain networks is one potential neurophysiologic correlate, but has only been demonstrated in animals or under limited conditions in healthy volunteers. Methods and Findings We recruited eighteen patients presenting for surgery under general anesthesia; electroencephalography of the frontal and parietal regions was acquired during (i) baseline consciousness, (ii) anesthetic induction with propofol or sevoflurane, (iii) general anesthesia, (iv) recovery of consciousness, and (v) post-recovery states. We used two measures of effective connectivity, evolutional map approach and symbolic transfer entropy, to analyze causal interactions of the frontal and parietal regions. The dominant feedback connectivity of the baseline conscious state was inhibited after anesthetic induction and during general anesthesia, resulting in reduced asymmetry of feedback and feedforward connections in the frontoparietal network. Dominant feedback connectivity returned when patients recovered from anesthesia. Both analytic techniques and both classes of anesthetics demonstrated similar results in this heterogeneous population of surgical patients. Conclusions The disruption of dominant feedback connectivity in the frontoparietal network is a common neurophysiologic correlate of general anesthesia across two anesthetic classes and two analytic measures. This study represents a key translational step from the underlying cognitive neuroscience of consciousness to more sophisticated monitoring of anesthetic effects in human surgical patients."

https://openalex.org/W1980865555,"Background It has recently been hypothesized that hyperglutamatergia in the brain is involved in the pathophysiology of autism. However, there is no conclusive evidence of the validity of this hypothesis. As peripheral glutamate/glutamine levels have been reported to be correlated with those of the central nervous system, the authors examined whether the levels of 25 amino acids, including glutamate and glutamine, in the platelet-poor plasma of drug-naïve, male children with high-functioning autism (HFA) would be altered compared with those of normal controls. Methodology/Principal Findings Plasma levels of 25 amino acids in male children (N = 23) with HFA and normally developed healthy male controls (N = 22) were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Multiple testing was allowed for in the analyses. Compared with the normal control group, the HFA group had higher levels of plasma glutamate and lower levels of plasma glutamine. No significant group difference was found in the remaining 23 amino acids. The effect size (Cohen's d) for glutamate and glutamine was large: 1.13 and 1.36, respectively. Using discriminant analysis with logistic regression, the two values of plasma glutamate and glutamine were shown to well-differentiate the HFA group from the control group; the rate of correct classification was 91%. Conclusions/Significance The present study suggests that plasma glutamate and glutamine levels can serve as a diagnostic tool for the early detection of autism, especially normal IQ autism. These findings indicate that glutamatergic abnormalities in the brain may be associated with the pathobiology of autism."
https://openalex.org/W2096001522,"Spermatogenesis is a complex biological process that requires a highly specialized control of gene expression. In the past decade, small non-coding RNAs have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. DICER1, an RNAse III endonuclease, is essential for the biogenesis of several classes of small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs), but is also critical for the degradation of toxic transposable elements. In this study, we investigated to which extent DICER1 is required for germ cell development and the progress of spermatogenesis in mice.We show that the selective ablation of Dicer1 at the early onset of male germ cell development leads to infertility, due to multiple cumulative defects at the meiotic and post-meiotic stages culminating with the absence of functional spermatozoa. Alterations were observed in the first spermatogenic wave and include delayed progression of spermatocytes to prophase I and increased apoptosis, resulting in a reduced number of round spermatids. The transition from round to mature spermatozoa was also severely affected, since the few spermatozoa formed in mutant animals were immobile and misshapen, exhibiting morphological defects of the head and flagellum. We also found evidence that the expression of transposable elements of the SINE family is up-regulated in Dicer1-depleted spermatocytes.Our findings indicate that DICER1 is dispensable for spermatogonial stem cell renewal and mitotic proliferation, but is required for germ cell differentiation through the meiotic and haploid phases of spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1994775292,"The Escherichia coli DNA replication machinery must frequently overcome template lesions under normal growth conditions. Yet, the outcome of a collision between the replisome and a leading-strand template lesion remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a single, site-specific, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer leading-strand template lesion provides only a transient block to fork progression in vitro. The replisome remains stably associated with the fork after collision with the lesion. Leading-strand synthesis is then reinitiated downstream of the damage in a reaction that is dependent on the primase, DnaG, but independent of any of the known replication-restart proteins. These observations reveal that the replisome can tolerate leading-strand template lesions without dissociating by synthesizing the leading strand discontinuously."
https://openalex.org/W2021291883,"Tinnitus, the perception of a sound without an external sound source, can lead to variable amounts of distress.In a group of tinnitus patients with variable amounts of tinnitus related distress, as measured by the Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ), an electroencephalography (EEG) is performed, evaluating the patients' resting state electrical brain activity. This resting state electrical activity is compared with a control group and between patients with low (N = 30) and high distress (N = 25). The groups are homogeneous for tinnitus type, tinnitus duration or tinnitus laterality. A group blind source separation (BSS) analysis is performed using a large normative sample (N = 84), generating seven normative components to which high and low tinnitus patients are compared. A correlation analysis of the obtained normative components' relative power and distress is performed. Furthermore, the functional connectivity as reflected by lagged phase synchronization is analyzed between the brain areas defined by the components. Finally, a group BSS analysis on the Tinnitus group as a whole is performed.Tinnitus can be characterized by at least four BSS components, two of which are posterior cingulate based, one based on the subgenual anterior cingulate and one based on the parahippocampus. Only the subgenual component correlates with distress. When performed on a normative sample, group BSS reveals that distress is characterized by two anterior cingulate based components. Spectral analysis of these components demonstrates that distress in tinnitus is related to alpha and beta changes in a network consisting of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex extending to the pregenual and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex as well as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex, insula, and parahippocampus. This network overlaps partially with brain areas implicated in distress in patients suffering from pain, functional somatic syndromes and posttraumatic stress disorder, and might therefore represent a specific distress network."
https://openalex.org/W2003282289,"Objective Cell-free fetal DNA is a source of fetal genetic material that can be used for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. Usually constituting less than 10% of the total cell free DNA in maternal plasma, the majority is maternal in origin. Optimizing conditions for maximizing yield of cell-free fetal DNA will be crucial for effective implementation of testing. We explore factors influencing yield of fetal DNA from maternal blood samples, including assessment of collection tubes containing cell-stabilizing agents, storage temperature, interval to sample processing and DNA extraction method used. Methods Microfluidic digital PCR was performed to precisely quantify male (fetal) DNA, total DNA and long DNA fragments (indicative of maternal cellular DNA). Real-time qPCR was used to assay for the presence of male SRY signal in samples. Results Total cell-free DNA quantity increased significantly with time in samples stored in K3EDTA tubes, but only minimally in cell stabilizing tubes. This increase was solely due to the presence of additional long fragment DNA, with no change in quantity of fetal or short DNA, resulting in a significant decrease in proportion of cell-free fetal DNA over time. Storage at 4°C did not prevent these changes. Conclusion When samples can be processed within eight hours of blood draw, K3EDTA tubes can be used. Prolonged transfer times in K3EDTA tubes should be avoided as the proportion of fetal DNA present decreases significantly; in these situations the use of cell stabilising tubes is preferable. The DNA extraction kit used may influence success rate of diagnostic tests."
https://openalex.org/W2052160861,"The long lasting debate initiated by Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky in [Formula: see text] is revisited: does a ""hot hand"" phenomenon exist in sports? Hereby we come back to one of the cases analyzed by the original study, but with a much larger data set: all free throws taken during five regular seasons ([Formula: see text]) of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Evidence supporting the existence of the ""hot hand"" phenomenon is provided. However, while statistical traces of this phenomenon are observed in the data, an open question still remains: are these non random patterns a result of ""success breeds success"" and ""failure breeds failure"" mechanisms or simply ""better"" and ""worse"" periods? Although free throws data is not adequate to answer this question in a definite way, we speculate based on it, that the latter is the dominant cause behind the appearance of the ""hot hand"" phenomenon in the data."
https://openalex.org/W2111642044,"Since the early 2000s, aid organizations and developing country governments have invested heavily in AIDS treatment. By 2010, more than five million people began receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) – yet each year, 2.7 million people are becoming newly infected and another two million are dying without ever having received treatment. As the need for treatment grows without commensurate increase in the amount of available resources, it is critical to assess the health and economic gains being realized from increasingly large investments in ART. This study estimates total program costs and compares them with selected economic benefits of ART, for the current cohort of patients whose treatment is cofinanced by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. At end 2011, 3.5 million patients in low and middle income countries will be receiving ART through treatment programs cofinanced by the Global Fund. Using 2009 ART prices and program costs, we estimate that the discounted resource needs required for maintaining this cohort are $14.2 billion for the period 2011–2020. This investment is expected to save 18.5 million life-years and return $12 to $34 billion through increased labor productivity, averted orphan care, and deferred medical treatment for opportunistic infections and end-of-life care. Under alternative assumptions regarding the labor productivity effects of HIV infection, AIDS disease, and ART, the monetary benefits range from 81 percent to 287 percent of program costs over the same period. These results suggest that, in addition to the large health gains generated, the economic benefits of treatment will substantially offset, and likely exceed, program costs within 10 years of investment."
https://openalex.org/W2056411782,"Vector-borne diseases impose enormous health and economic burdens and additional methods to control vector populations are clearly needed. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has been successful against agricultural pests, but is not in large-scale use for suppressing or eliminating mosquito populations. Genetic RIDL technology (Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) is a proposed modification that involves releasing insects that are homozygous for a repressible dominant lethal genetic construct rather than being sterilized by irradiation, and could potentially overcome some technical difficulties with the conventional SIT technology. Using the arboviral disease dengue as an example, we combine vector population dynamics and epidemiological models to explore the effect of a program of RIDL releases on disease transmission. We use these to derive a preliminary estimate of the potential cost-effectiveness of vector control by applying estimates of the costs of SIT. We predict that this genetic control strategy could eliminate dengue rapidly from a human community, and at lower expense (approximately US$ 2∼30 per case averted) than the direct and indirect costs of disease (mean US$ 86–190 per case of dengue). The theoretical framework has wider potential use; by appropriately adapting or replacing each component of the framework (entomological, epidemiological, vector control bio-economics and health economics), it could be applied to other vector-borne diseases or vector control strategies and extended to include other health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2053782598,"GENE-counter is a complete Perl-based computational pipeline for analyzing RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data for differential gene expression. In addition to its use in studying transcriptomes of eukaryotic model organisms, GENE-counter is applicable for prokaryotes and non-model organisms without an available genome reference sequence. For alignments, GENE-counter is configured for CASHX, Bowtie, and BWA, but an end user can use any Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM)-compliant program of preference. To analyze data for differential gene expression, GENE-counter can be run with any one of three statistics packages that are based on variations of the negative binomial distribution. The default method is a new and simple statistical test we developed based on an over-parameterized version of the negative binomial distribution. GENE-counter also includes three different methods for assessing differentially expressed features for enriched gene ontology (GO) terms. Results are transparent and data are systematically stored in a MySQL relational database to facilitate additional analyses as well as quality assessment. We used next generation sequencing to generate a small-scale RNA-Seq dataset derived from the heavily studied defense response of Arabidopsis thaliana and used GENE-counter to process the data. Collectively, the support from analysis of microarrays as well as the observed and substantial overlap in results from each of the three statistics packages demonstrates that GENE-counter is well suited for handling the unique characteristics of small sample sizes and high variability in gene counts."
https://openalex.org/W2077730362,"GB virus C (GBV-C) is prevalent globally and particularly among individuals at risk of parental exposures. Based on genetic diversity, this virus is now classified into six genotypes and many subtypes with distinct geographical distribution. In this study, 120 Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) were recruited from Yunnan province, China. Among them, 43 (35.8%) were positive for GBV-C RNA, 70 (58.3%) and 103 (85.8%) sero-positive for HIV-1 and HCV respectively. This revealed 18.3% of IDUs having GBV-C/HIV/HCV triple infection, which is significantly higher than 7.5% of GBV-C/HIV-1 and 10% of GBV-C/HCV dual infection rates (P<0.05). Based on 5′UTR sequences, the identified 43 viral isolates can be classified into three phylogenetic groups: one (2.3%) and two (4.7%) belonged to genotype 3 and 4, respectively, and the remaining 40 (93%) formed a new group with 97% of bootstrap support. This new GBV-C group was further confirmed by characterizing the E2 region and full-length genome sequences. Analysis of 187 nt 5′UTR sequence showed three previous reported isolates from Southeast Asia were re-classified into this new group. It implies they have the same origin with strains from Yunnan. Although we provisionally assigned this new group as GBV-C genotype 7, a simpler five groups of GBV-C nomenclature is recommended. Genotype 4, 6 and the newly designated genotype 7 could be reclassified as one group, which may represent a single GBV-C genotype. The classification of the other four groups was corresponding to that of previous reported genotype 1, 2, 3 and 5. Furthermore, the diversity of amino acid sequence in the E2 region was analyzed. The inhibitory effect of GBV-C genotype 7 on HIV-1 cell entry could be deduced. Since GBV-C may have a beneficial effect on AIDS disease progression and interact with HCV during co-infection, this finding may raise interests in future studies on this virus that was previously thought to be a “non-pathogenic virus”."
https://openalex.org/W2003857122,"Background The molecular basis and characteristics of familial non-medullary thyroid cancer are poorly understood. In this study, we performed microRNA (miRNA) profiling of familial and sporadic papillary thyroid cancer tumor samples. Methodology/Principal Findings Genome wide miRNA profiling of sporadic and familial papillary thyroid cancer was performed. Differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Ectopic expression of miR-886-3p in thyroid cancer lines was performed to identify pathways targeted by the miRNA, as well as, to determine its effect on tumor cell biology. We found four differentially expressed miRNAs between familial and sporadic papillary thyroid cancer tumor samples. MiR-886-3p and miR-20a were validated to be differentially expressed by 3- and 4-fold, respectively. Pathway analysis of genome-wide expression data on cells overexpressing miR-886-3p and target prediction analysis showed genes involved in DNA replication and focal adhesion pathways were regulated by miR-886-3p. Overexpression of miR-886-3p in thyroid cancer cell lines significantly inhibited cellular proliferation, the number and size of spheroids and cellular migration. Additionally, overexpression of miR-886-3p increased the number of cells in S phase. Conclusions/Significance Our findings for the first time suggest that miR-886-3p plays an important role in thyroid cancer tumor cell biology and regulates genes involved in DNA replication and focal adhesion. Thus, miR-886-3p may play a role in the initiation and or progression of papillary thyroid cancer."

In this study, we reported that AMI paradoxically opened homomeric ASIC3 and heteromeric ASIC3 plus ASIC1b channels at neutral pH and synergistically enhanced channel activation induced by mild acidosis (pH 7.2 to 6.8). The characteristic profile of AMI stimulation of ASIC3 channels was reminiscent of the channel activation by the newly identified nonproton ligand, 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that ASIC3 activation by AMI, but not its inhibitory effect, was dependent on the integrity of the nonproton ligand sensing domain in ASIC3 channels. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship study demonstrated the differential requirement of the 5-amino group in AMI for the stimulation or inhibition effect, strengthening the different interactions within ASIC3 channels that confer the paradoxical actions of AMI. Furthermore, using covalent modification analyses, we provided strong evidence supporting the nonproton ligand sensing domain is required for the stimulation of ASIC3 channels by AMI. Finally, we showed that AMI causes pain-related behaviors in an ASIC3-dependent manner. These data reinforce the idea that ASICs can sense nonproton ligands in addition to protons.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15500-15504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) through exposing extracellular membrane-proximal residues in a similar fashion as that by protons (25Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on the finding that AMI inhibition was voltage-dependent, but stimulation was not, it was suggested that AMI stimulates ASIC2a channels by binding to an extracellular site, whereas it inhibits the channels by interacting at a site within the channel pore. However, the submolecular motifs involved in these regulations have not been studied. In addition, the sustained window current of ASIC3 channels was enhanced by AMI (6Yagi J. Wenk H.N. Naves L.A. McCleskey E.W. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), further arguing for a stimulatory effect of AMI on specific ASIC subtypes. acid-sensing ion channel amiloride 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline 4,4′-dithiodipyridine 4-thiodipyridine 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate degenerin. Recently, synthetic compounds such as 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ) and an endogenous ligand, agmatine, were shown to cause persistent activation of ASIC3 at the neutral pH (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Li W.G. Yu Y. Zhang Z.D. Cao H. Xu T.L. Mol. Pain. 2010; 6: 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Using GMQ as a probe and combining mutagenesis and covalent modification analysis, we identified a novel nonproton ligand sensing domain (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This domain is lined by residues near Glu-423 and Glu-79 of the extracellular palm domain (28Yu Y. Li W.G. Chen Z. Cao H. Yang H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 24996-25006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both GMQ and agmatine are small molecules containing basic groups that are believed to form tight contacts with the carboxyl groups of acidic residues through hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and/or electrostatic interactions, leading to activation of the ASIC3 channel (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Because AMI has an amidino group (Fig. 1A) analogous to the guanidinium group of GMQ, and both contain a heterocyclic ring (29Bagriantsev S.N. Minor Jr., D.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), we reasoned that AMI may activate ASIC channels in a manner similar to GMQ. Here, we show that the stimulatory action of AMI is similar to that of GMQ. Furthermore, using site-directed mutagenesis, electrophysiological recording, and covalent modification, we demonstrate that the nonproton ligand sensing domain is required for stimulation of ASIC function by AMI. All constructs were expressed in CHO cells as described previously (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were maintained in F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection of CHO cells was carried out using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). Electrophysiological measurements were performed 24–48 h after transfection. The ionic composition of the incubation solution was as follows (in mm): 124 NaCl, 24 NaHCO3, 5 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, and 10 glucose, aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2 to a final pH of 7.4. The standard external solution contained (in mm) the following: 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, and 10 glucose, buffered to various pH values with either 10 mm HEPES for pH 6.0–7.4 or 10 mm MES for pH < 6.0. The pipette solution for whole-cell patch recording was as follows (in mm): 120 KCl, 30 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 5 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with Tris base. The osmolarities of all solutions were maintained at 300–325 mOsm (Advanced Instrument, Norwood, MA). Solutions with different composition were applied using a rapid application technique termed the “Y-tube” method throughout the experiments (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This system allows a complete exchange of external solution surrounding a cell within 20 ms. The cDNA of rat ASIC3 was subcloned into the pEGFPC3 vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Each mutant was generated with the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol using high performance liquid chromatography-purified or PAGE-purified oligonucleotide primers (Sigma Genosys). Individual mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis, and the predicted amino acid sequences were determined by computer analysis. The electrophysiological recordings were performed using the conventional whole-cell patch recording configuration under voltage clamp conditions. Patch pipettes were pulled from glass capillaries with an outer diameter of 1.5 mm on a two-stage puller (PP-830, Narishige Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The resistance between the recording electrode filled with pipette solution and the reference electrode was 3–5 megohms. Membrane currents were measured using a patch clamp amplifier (Axon 200B, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and were sampled and analyzed using a Digidata 1440A interface and a computer running the Clampex and Clampfit software (version 10.0.1, Axon Instruments). In most experiments, series resistance was compensated at 70–90%. Unless otherwise noted, the membrane potential was held at −60 mV throughout the experiment under voltage clamp conditions. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C). Animals were acclimatized for 30 min before experiments. A total volume of 10 μl of either saline (0.9% NaCl) or AMI-containing solution (in 0.9% NaCl) was injected intraplantarly using a 30-gauge needle, and paw-licking behavior was quantified for 30 min (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as means ± S.E. Except where noted otherwise, statistical comparisons were made with the Student's t test. *, p < 0.05 or **, p < 0.001 was considered significantly different. Concentration-response relationships for AMI-dependent activation of ASIC3 channels were obtained by measuring currents in response to AMI with graded concentrations. Each AMI concentration was tested on at least three CHO cells, and all results used to generate a concentration-response relationship were from the same group. The data were fit to the Hill Equation 1,I/Imax=1/(1+(EC50/[AMI])n)(Eq. 1) where I is the normalized current (to that induced by pH 5.0) at a given concentration of AMI; Imax is the maximal normalized current; EC50 is the concentration of AMI yielding 50% of the maximal current, and n is the Hill coefficient. The concentration-response relationships for AMI-dependent inhibition of ASIC3 channels were obtained by measuring currents in response to agonists in the presence of AMI with graded concentrations and the data were fit to the Hill Equation 2,(Imax−I)/Imax=1/(1+(IC50/[AMI])n)(Eq. 2) where I is the normalized current (to the current induced by agonists in the absence of AMI) in the presence of a given concentration of AMI; Imax is the maximal normalized current, IC50 is the concentration of AMI yielding 50% of the maximal current, and n is the Hill coefficient. Traditionally, AMI acts as a wide spectrum channel blocker for most ASICs (1Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 578-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

In CHO cells expressing the ASIC3 subunit, AMI inhibits channel activation induced by acid (Fig. 1B) or nonproton activators (supplemental Fig. 1) (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, AMI directly evoked inward currents in a dose-dependent manner. The AMI currents displayed little or no desensitization (Fig. 1A), reminiscent of the sustained activation by GMQ (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The washout of higher concentrations of AMI often results in a rebound current (data not shown, see also Fig. 6, C and D), consistent with the notion that AMI both activates (Fig. 1A) and inhibits (Fig. 1B) ASIC3 channels. We noted that AMI was less effective in activating ASIC3 than GMQ (37.5 ± 3.1% of the GMQ response at 1 mm concentration; n = 4, p < 0.001, AMI versus GMQ). We ascribed the differences in their half-maximal activation concentration (EC50) (0.56 ± 0.02 mm for AMI versus 1.08 ± 0.09 mm for GMQ; n = 7–8, p < 0.001) as well as the extent of activation (16.2 ± 4.7% for AMI versus 84.4 ± 7.4% for GMQ of the pH 5.0-induced peak current; n = 7–8, p < 0.001) partially to the paradoxical effects of AMI (i.e. both stimulatory and inhibitory). Further studies on CHO cells expressing homomeric ASIC3 or various heteromeric ASIC subunit combinations revealed that AMI is a specific agonist for ASIC3 homomers and heteromers (ASIC3 + ASIC1b in particular) (Fig. 1C). This subunit specificity is consistent with the finding that ASIC3 channels are the only ASIC subtype activated by GMQ and agmatine (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Li W.G. Yu Y. Zhang Z.D. Cao H. Xu T.L. Mol. Pain. 2010; 6: 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). AMI-induced activation was also observed in HEK293 and COS-7 cells transfected with ASIC3 (data not shown), indicating that the stimulatory effect of AMI is independent of the host cell type. Collectively, these results suggest that AMI specifically activates ASIC3 channels at neutral pH in a manner similar to GMQ and agmatine. Similar to the modulatory profile of GMQ and agmatine (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Li W.G. Yu Y. Zhang Z.D. Cao H. Xu T.L. Mol. Pain. 2010; 6: 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), submillimolar concentrations of AMI significantly sensitized ASIC3 channels to pH 7.2–6.8 (Fig. 2, A–C). However, at pH 6.5 (Fig. 2D) or below (Fig. 1B), it inhibited the peak response induced by acid. Although lower concentrations (∼μm) of AMI facilitate the activation of ASIC3 channels upon modest pH decreases (Fig. 2, A–C), high AMI concentrations above 1 mm antagonize the currents induced by pH 7.2 to 6.8 (data not shown). Thus, AMI action on ASIC channels depends on pH as well as its own concentration, consistent with previous observations (6Yagi J. Wenk H.N. Naves L.A. McCleskey E.W. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that the nonproton ligand sensing domain (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Li W.G. Yu Y. Zhang Z.D. Cao H. Xu T.L. Mol. Pain. 2010; 6: 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) plays a critical role in mediating agmatine and GMQ effects on ASIC3. Considering the similarities in the chemical structures among AMI (Fig. 1A), GMQ, and agmatine (29Bagriantsev S.N. Minor Jr., D.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and their shared actions on ASIC3 channels, we hypothesized that AMI also activates ASIC3 channels through interacting with the nonproton ligand sensing domain. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the E79A and E423A mutants of ASIC3 in CHO cells. We have shown previously that Glu-79 and Glu-423 are the most critical residues in coordinating GMQ binding to the nonproton ligand sensing domain, and when mutated to Ala, the mutated ASIC3 channels became insensitive to GMQ (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Similarly, AMI at millimolar concentrations failed to activate either ASIC3E79A or ASIC3E423A channels (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table 1). To distinguish the effects of mutations of the nonproton ligand sensing domain on AMI binding affinity from that on the efficacy of AMI as a channel activator, we recorded the responses at two AMI concentrations (1 and 3 mm), both of which induced a near maximum response in WT ASIC3 channels (Fig. 3A). We reasoned that an increase or decrease of the current ratio (IAMI-1 mM/IAMI-3 mM) might indicate a leftward or rightward shift of the AMI dose-response curve, hence a change in potency, but not necessarily a change in the coupling pathway or subsequent channel gating (efficacy). We used current ratio for these two concentrations because the full dose-response curve of AMI action on ASIC3 mutants was not feasible due to its low potency and the potential inhibition at higher concentrations. We found that mutations at Glu-79 or Glu-423 markedly impaired the stimulatory action of AMI with significant decreases in both current amplitudes (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table 1) and current ratios (Fig. 3C). Together, these results favor an essential role of the nonproton ligand sensing domain in mediating the stimulatory actions of AMI on ASIC3 channels. As reported previously (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Cushman K.A. Marsh-Haffner J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the mutants at Glu-79 or Glu-423 exhibited significant steady-state desensitization to protons. To exclude the possibility that the reduced potency of AMI on these mutants resulted from channel desensitization, we pretreated cells with an alkaline pH condition (pH 9.0) to restore the ASIC3 mutants from desensitization, and then we tested the AMI response at neutral pH. Although pretreatment with the alkaline pH (pH 9.0) largely restored pH 5.0-induced channel activation, the AMI-induced current was still reduced in the Glu-79 or Glu-423 mutants (data not shown) as occurred without pretreatment by the alkaline pH, suggesting that the reduced response to AMI was not due to the pH-dependent desensitization associated with the mutations. To test whether the reduced activation by AMI of the Glu-79 and Glu-423 mutants was a result of an increased inhibition associated with these mutations, we investigated the inhibition by AMI of the acid-induced currents in these mutants. As shown in Fig. 4, AMI inhibited the acid-induced currents in WT as well as E79A or E423A mutant channels to a similar extent. Thus, an increase in AMI-mediated inhibition does not account for the reduced activation by AMI in the Glu-79 and Glu-423 mutants. To explain structural bases of AMI underlying the stimulation or inhibition of ASIC3 channels, we electrophysiologically screened commercially available small molecules similar to AMI (Fig. 5A). When the guanidinium group of AMI was removed by replacing a methoxyl group, the resulting compound-induced channel activation (Fig. 5B, red) as well as the inhibition efficacy against the acid-induced channel activation (Fig. 5, C and D, red) was totally abolished. The important role of the guanidinium group of AMI in the activating ASIC3 channel was consistent with the previous structure-activity relationship studies on the GMQ-induced channel activation (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the validation of the essential role of the guanidinium group in AMI-induced channel activation as well as channel blockade made the first step to study the AMI-ASIC3 interaction at the atomic level (28Yu Y. Li W.G. Chen Z. Cao H. Yang H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 24996-25006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By contrast, when the 5-amino group (at the ortho position of the 6-chloro group) was replaced with a N,N-dimethyl, N-methyl-N-isobutyl, or N-ethyl-N-isopropyl group (Fig. 5A), the resulting compounds as exemplified by 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride still exerted a blocking effect (Fig. 5, C and D, blue) but lost the activation efficacy (Fig. 5B, blue), implying the interaction of the 5-amino group of AMI with residues of nonproton ligand sensing domain in the extracellular region but not with that of the pore domain in the transmembrane region. The differential requirement of the 5-amino group in AMI for its paradoxical effects raises a possibility to distinguish the stimulatory or inhibitory effects in the application and development of chemical modulators of ASIC3 channels in the future (see below). To ascertain that AMI activates ASIC3 via interactions with Glu-79 and Glu-423, we substituted these two residues with cysteine with the intention of blocking the interactions by covalent modification. To avoid the activation of ASIC3 channels through single covalent modification at E79C by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we used 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (DTDP) (Fig. 6, A and B), a DTNB analog, as the redox donor. Consistent with the previous observation (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), bath application of DTDP (0.5 mm at pH 7.4) to CHO cells expressing ASIC3E79C resulted in a small inward current that gradually declined to a steady state (Fig. 6, C and D). Like DTNB, DTDP did not induce inward currents in CHO cells expressing the WT ASIC3, and it had no effect on either acid- or AMI-induced currents (data not shown), suggesting that specific covalent modification at the E79C site is responsible for its activation effect on ASIC3E79C. Taking advantage of the steady-state activation by the persistent TDP-E79C interaction, we reasoned that directly linking TDP to Cys-79 via a covalent bond should prevent further ASIC3 channel activation by AMI at the neutral pH, given that the activation of ASIC3 by nonproton ligands (GMQ and agmatine) relies on polar, steric, and electrostatic interactions with the nonproton ligand sensing domain in the channel (26Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we applied AMI at neutral pH before or after DTDP treatment (Fig. 6, C and D). As expected, we found that AMI-dependent ASIC3 channel activation (demonstrated by the sustained current (Fig. 6, C–F) as well as the rebound current after washout of AMI (Fig. 6, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 2, A and B), which might represent a brief period of unopposed stimulation by AMI and a complex interaction between AMI-induced channel activation and inhibition) was largely prevented by the DTDP pretreatment. Furthermore, this attenuation was reversed (Fig. 6, C and E, and supplemental Fig. 2A) or blocked (Fig. 6, D and F, and supplemental Fig. 2B) by the reducing reagent, 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT)."

In the nucleus, CRABP-II directly binds to the nuclear receptor RAR to form a complex through which RA is “channeled” from the binding protein to the receptor. CRABP-II thus facilitates the ligation of RAR and markedly enhances its transcriptional activity. The primary sequence of CRABP-II contains three putative SUMOylation sites, centered at K45, K87, and K102. We show here that RA induces interactions of CRABP-II with the E2 SUMO ligase Ubc9 and triggers SUMOylation of the protein both in vitro and in cultured cells. Mutagenesis analyses demonstrate that K102 is the sole CRABP-II residue to be SUMOylated in response to RA. Mutation of this residue abolishes the ability of CRABP-II to undergo nuclear translocation in response RA and thus impairs CRABP-II-mediated activation of RAR. Additional observations demonstrate that apo-CRABP-II is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and that RA triggers the dissociation of CRABP-II from this location. Furthermore, we show that RA-induced dissociation of CRABP-II from the ER requires SUMOylation of K102. Hence, SUMOylation of K102 in response to RA binding is critical for dissociation of CRABP-II from ER and, consequently, for mobilization of the protein to nucleus and for its cooperation with RAR.

We showed further that the side-chain of the NLS residues are directed toward the protein in apo- (non-liganded) CRABP-II, and that RA binding results in changes in their configuration rendering them accessible to the solution. The NLS formed upon ligation of CRABP-II is then recognized by the nuclear import protein importin α, which mobilizes it to the nucleus (9Sessler R.J. Noy N. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Additional structure/function analyses revealed that the region of CRABP-II, which mediates its interactions with RAR consists of residues Q75, P81, and K102. These spatially aligned residues, located on a protrusion above the entrance to the ligand-binding pocket of the protein, form a surface patch that was found to be necessary and sufficient for mediating the transfer of RA from CRABP-II to RAR and for allowing CRABP-II to enhance receptor transcriptional activity (11Budhu A. Gillilan R. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, examination of the primary sequence of CRABP-II revealed that the protein contains three consensus SUMOylation sequences, centered at K45, K87, and K102, the latter of which also participates in the makeup of the RAR interaction domain of the protein. We thus set out to investigate whether these residues are SUMOylated in cells and to explore the significance of the modification for CRABP-II function. The human genome contains four SUMO proteins: SUMO1–SUMO4. Among these, SUMO1–SUMO3 are ubiquitously expressed whereas SUMO4 is expressed mainly in the kidney, lymph node and spleen (12Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 13Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). SUMOylation, the reaction by which a SUMO protein is conjugated to a lysine residue within the consensus sequence ψKXE, (ψ, hydrophobic residue; X, any residue) in a target protein, is a multistep process. In the first step, the immature SUMO protein is cleaved and activated by sentrin-specific protease (SENP). The mature SUMO is then attached to a heterodimer, comprised of UBA2 and AOS1, which functions as an E1-activating enzyme to transfer SUMO to the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. In the final step, facilitated by E3 ligases, Ubc9 transfers SUMO to the substrate by linking the C-terminal Gly residue of SUMO to the side chain of the target lysine (13Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). A large number of proteins were reported to be modified by SUMOylation and the functional consequences of the modification are extremely diverse. These include effects on the localization and activity, and, in some cases, effects on the stability of the target proteins (12Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 13Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The observations described in this report reveal that binding of RA to CRABP-II induces SUMOylation at residue K102. The data further show that the modification triggers dissociation of CRABP-II from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and thus enables the RA-induced mobilization of the protein to the nucleus. Hence, SUMOylation is critical for the ability of CRABP-II to cooperate with the transcription factor RAR in mediating the transcriptional activities of RA.

MCF-7, HEK 293T and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm N-ethyl-maleimide, protease, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. 30–50 μg protein/lane were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed by immunoblots using indicated antibodies. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene cat. 200521) following the manufacturer's protocol. Transient transfections of MCF7 and HEK293 cells were accomplished using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Ectopic expression in COS-7 cells was carried out using Fugene6 (Roche). Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti Flag M2-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer's protocol. 1 mg of protein of cell lysate was used unless otherwise specified. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads using 3xFlag peptide. In vitro SUMOylation reaction was performed using bacterially purified histidine-tagged CRABP-II and an in vitro SUMOylation kit obtained from Active Motif following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRIzol. 1 μg of mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the high capacity RNA to cDNA kit from Applied Biosystems (Gaithersburg, MD). Taqman chemistry assays on Demand probes for RARβ (Hs00233407_m1) was purchased from Applied Biosystems. 18 S rRNA (4352930–1007027) was used as an internal control. Detection and data analysis were carried out on an ABI StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR system. EGFP-tagged CRABPII in COS-7 cells was imaged using laser-scanning confocal system (Leica). To image live cells, cells were transfected with GFP-CRABP-II in suspension and placed in LabTek glass chambers (Nalge Nunc Iternational). 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with 5% charcoal-treated FBS in DMEM for 2 h and then treated with RA (1 μm). A Leica DMI6000 inverted microscope that was motorized for automated fluorescence filter sets for UV, Blue, Green, Red was used. When working with live cells, the microscope was equipped with an environmental chamber for the control of temperature, CO2 concentration, and humidity. Images were collected with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm. To image cell nuclei in live cells, cells were incubated with Syto 59 (0.5 μm, 10 min) and visualized with excitation at 622 nm and emission at 645 nm. COS-7 cells stably expressing EGFP-tagged proteins were treated with vehicle or RA (1 μm, 30 min). Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h, washed with PBS, blocked with 5% FBS in PBS for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies and then secondary antibodies (1 h each, room temperature). The primary antibodies were: rabbit polyclonal anti-human calnexin, or rabbit anti-human succinate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibody was donkey anti-rabbit IgG, conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Cells were extensively washed with PBS, air dried, and treated with SlowFade preservation reagent from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Confocal microscopy experiments were performed at the Imaging Core Facility of the Genetics department at CWRU. A Leica DMI6000 inverted microscope was used. The red fluorescence images of Alexa Fluor 594-labeled ER and Mitochondrial markers were obtained with excitation at 594 nm, and emission at 620 nm. Consecutive imaging of the same field of cells was performed for visualization of EGFP-CRABPII, with excitation of EGFP at 488 nm, and emission at 530 nm. Overlay of the two separate images (red and green) of the same cells was performed by using the Visualization program (a Volocity software). Yellow pixels were displayed where both red and green fluorescence was detected. Similar procedures were used to localize endogenous CRABP-II in MCF-7 cells. For colocalization with mitochondria, CRABP-II was visualized using rabbit anti mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and mitochondria were visualized using MitoTracker (200 nm). ER was stained using antibodies against calreteculin and goat anti chicken secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 633. Confocal fluorescence microscopy images were quantitatively analyzed with Image J. Measurements of fluorescence intensity per surface unit within and outside nuclei, were used to calculate ratios indicative of distribution of EGFP-CRABP-II between nuclei and cytoplasm. Cells were transfected with plasmid harboring EGFP-CRABP-II, which encodes for neomycin (G418) resistance and allows for selection of transfected cells. 24 h following transfection, Geneticin (500 μg/ml) was added. Cells were selected for 7–14 days. Culture medium was replaced with fresh G418-containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS daily. The survival of EGFP-expressing cells was monitored with an inverted fluorescence microscope. Cells stably expressing the construct were pooled. Examination of the primary sequence of CRABP-II using SUMOplot revealed three putative SUMOylation sites centered at K45, K87, and K102 of the protein (Fig. 1). Of these, K45 and K87 are located in the β sheets of the β-clam structure of the protein. K102 is located in the loop that flanks the entrance to the pocket, opposite the helix-loop-helix region of CRABP-II. To examine whether these residues comprise functional SUMOylation sites, bacterially expressed recombinant histidine-tagged CRABP-II (14Donato L.J. Noy N. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 357: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) was used. The protein was subjected to in vitro SUMOylation using a SUMOylation kit containing SUMO2/3 (Active Motif). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and CRABP-II visualized by immunoblots (Fig. 1b). Subjecting CRABP-II to in vitro SUMOylation resulted in the appearance of additional band at 75 kDa, reflecting the generation of SUMOylated CRABP-II. Interestingly, SUMOylation was enhanced in the presence of RA. To examine whether CRABP-II is SUMOylated in cells, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with a vector encoding Flag-tagged CRABP-II and an expression vector harboring cDNA for Myc-tagged SUMO2. 24 h post-transfection, cells were placed in retinoid-depleted (charcoal-treated) media overnight and then treated with RA (1 μm) for 30 and 60 min. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and CRABP-II immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag M2-agarose beads. Precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and CRABP-II and SUMO2 were visualized by immunoblots (Fig. 1c). Similarly to the response of the purified protein in vitro, a higher molecular weight band, which could be immunostained with antibodies against either CRABP-II or SUMO2/3, was observed (Fig. 1c). To examine association between CRABP-II and the SUMO E2 ligase Ubc9 (15Müller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), Flag-CRABP-II and HA-tagged Ubc9 were ectopically overexpressed in HEK293T cells. 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed, Flag-CRABP-II precipitated, and precipitated proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots revealed that Ubc9 co-precipitated with CRABP-II (Fig. 1d) and that the interaction was enhanced in cells treated with RA (Fig. 1e). Similarly, Ubc9 co-precipitated with endogenous CRABP-II in MCF-7 cells, which express a high level of this protein (Fig. 1f). CRABP-II is predominantly cytosolic in the absence of a cognate ligand but, upon binding of RA, it translocates to the nucleus where it delivers the hormone to RAR, thereby activating the receptor to induce the transcription of RAR responsive genes. To examine whether CRABP-II SUMOylation is involved in the RA-triggered nuclear import of the protein and identify the residue(s) that mediates such an involvement, CRABP-II mutants lacking the putative SUMOylation sites were generated. Residues K45, K87, and K102 were individually replaced by arginines in the context of an expression vector encoding CRABP-II tagged with EGFP. EGFP-CRABP-II or the corresponding mutants were ectopically expressed in COS-7 cells. Cells were cultured in retinoid-depleted medium, treated with RA (1 μm) for 30 and 60 min and confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize the proteins (Fig. 2, a and b). As often observed (e.g. Ref. 3Schug T.T. Berry D.C. Shaw N.S. Travis S.N. Noy N. Cell. 2007; 129: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 16Ayers S.D. Nedrow K.L. Gillilan R.E. Noy N. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6744-6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), overexpression of the EGFP-tagged proteins resulted in leakage into the nucleus even in the absence of ligand and thus the apo-protein was distributed across the cell. Nevertheless, similarly to the behavior of the endogenous protein (9Sessler R.J. Noy N. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), addition of RA induced massive mobilization of EGFP-CRABP-II to the nucleus, which was complete within ∼30 min post ligand treatment (Fig. 2, a and b). Interestingly, 60 min following addition of RA, EGFP-CRABP-II regained its pre-treatment localization. Similarly to the WT protein, the CRABP-II-K45R and CRABP-II-K87R mutants translocated to the nucleus within 30 min of RA treatment and redistributed to the cytosol 30 min later. In contrast, the CRABP-II-K102R mutant did not move to the nucleus in response to RA (Fig. 2, a and b). The effect of the K102R mutation on the ability of CRABP-II to enhance the transcriptional activity of RAR was examined by monitoring the expression of the endogenous RAR target gene RARβ. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for RARα and CRABP-II or its K102R counterpart. Cells were treated with RA (1 μm, 4 h), and the expression level of RARβ mRNA measured by real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). The data (Fig. 2c) show that, while WT-CRABP-II effectively enhanced the transcriptional activity of RAR, CRABP-II-K102R had no effect on receptor activity. It is important to note that it was previously established that mutation of K102 of CRABP-II does not alter the global folding of the protein or its affinity toward RA (11Budhu A. Gillilan R. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hence, K102 is specifically required for mobilization of CRABP-II to the nucleus, suggesting that SUMOylation of this residue is critical for the process. To examine whether SUMOylation is involved in regulating the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of CRABP-II, the effect of expression of the SUMO conjugating enzyme Ubc9 on the nuclear localization of the protein was examined. COS-7 cells were transfected with EGFP-CRABP-II along with an empty vector or an expression vector encoding Ubc9. Cells were treated with RA and proteins visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3, a and b). While CRABP-II moved to the nucleus within 30 min of RA treatment and redistributed to the cytosol 30 min later (Fig. 3, a and c), overexpression of Ubc9 resulted in a longer residency of CRABP-II in the nucleus (Fig. 3, b and c). Ectopic expression of Ubc9 also augmented the ability of CRABP-II to enhance the transcriptional activity of RAR, reflected by induction of the RAR target gene RARβ (Fig. 3d). These observations may be understood to reflect that CRABP-II is deSUMOylated in the nucleus but becomes re-SUMOylated when in the cytosol. Increased expression of Ubc9 will potentiate an additional cycle of CRABP-II through the nucleus and, consequently, lengthen its apparent nuclear residence time and enhance its ability to activate RAR. The importance of the K102 residue for CRABP-II SUMOylation was examined by monitoring the effect of mutating this residue on the ability of CRABP-II to interact with Ubc9. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with an expression plasmid for Flag-CRABP-II or its K102R counterpart and with a vector encoding HA-Ubc9. 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed, and proteins immunoprecipitated using agarose-bead-conjugated anti-Flag antibodies. Precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using HA antibodies. The data (Fig. 4a) show that the K102R mutation impaired the ability of CRABP-II to associate with Ubc9. To examine the effect of the K102R mutation on SUMOylation of CRABP-II, Flag-CRABP-II or its K102R mutant, HA-Ubc9, and Myc-tagged SUMO2 were ectopically co-expressed in HEK293T cells. 24 h post-transfection, cells were cultured in charcoal-treated medium overnight and then treated with RA (1 μm, 60 min). Cells were lysed, and Flag-tagged proteins precipitated. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for CRABP-II. The data (Fig. 4b) show that the K102R mutation abolished the ability of RA to induce SUMOylation of CRABP-II. Hence, of the three putative SUMOylation sites of CRABP-II (Fig. 1a), K102 appears to be the sole site to be SUMOylated in response to RA. RA triggers the nuclear translocation of CRABP-II by stabilizing its interactions with the nuclear import protein importin α (9Sessler R.J. Noy N. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The inability of CRABP-II-K102R to mobilize to the nucleus thus raises the possibility that SUMOylation at this residue is required for the interactions of the protein with importin α. The effect of the mutation on the ability of CRABP-II to bind importin α was thus examined. GST-importin αΔIBB, lacking the importinβ-binding self-inhibitory domain, was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and attached to glutathione beads. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for Flag-CRABP-II or Flag-CRABP-II-K102R and with plasmids encoding HA-Ubc9 and Myc-SUMO2. Cells were treated with RA (1 μm, 60 min) to allow for SUMOylation. Flag-CRABP-II was precipitated from cell lysates, eluted from the agarose beads, and incubated with immobilized GST-importin α in the presence or absence of RA. Bead-associated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti CRABP-II antibodies. The data (Fig. 4c) indicate that, similarly to CRABP-II, the K102R mutant associates with importin α and did so in a RA-sensitive manner. Hence, SUMOylation of CRABP-II-K102 is not necessary for the interactions of the protein with the nuclear import machinery. The K102R mutant is retained in the ER even in the presence of RA. Another possibility for understanding why SUMOylation is required for the nuclear mobilization of CRABP-II is that the apo-protein is associated with a particular extranuclear location, and that RA enables its dissociation from that niche by triggering SUMOylation. We thus set out to determine the subcellular localization of apo-CRABP-II. MCF-7 cells were cultured in charcoal-treated medium to deplete retinoid stores and confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to examine colocalization of endogenous apo-CRABP-II with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker calreticulin or with the mitochondrial-specific dye MitoTracker. The observations (Fig. 5) indicate that apo-CRABP-II displayed marked co-localization with the ER marker. No significant colocalization with the mitochondrial marker was observed. To enable mutagenesis analyses, COS-7 cells, which express a low level of CRABP-II, were used. Cells were transfected with expression constructs for EGFP-tagged CRABP-II or its K102R mutant. As the high expression level of EGFP-CRABP-II obtained by transient expression of the protein masks its exact localization (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), COS-7 cell lines that stably express EGFP-CRABP-II and the corresponding K102R mutant were generated. Cells were stained with antibodies toward the ER marker calnexin or the mitochondrial marker succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The markers and EGFP-CRABP-II were visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The data (Fig. 6) indicate that, similarly to the localization of endogenous CRABP-II in MCF-7 cells, ectopically expressed apo-CRABP-II in COS-7 cells displayed marked co-localization with the ER marker. Upon treatment with RA (1 μm, 30 min), CRABP-II dissociated from the ER and mobilized to nuclei (Fig. 6). Similarly to the WT protein, CRABP-II-K102R co-localized with calnexin, indicating that it is associated with ER. However, unlike WT CRABP-II, the mutant was retained at the ER even in the presence of RA (Fig. 6). These observations thus suggest that RA-induced SUMOylation of CRABP-II at K102 is necessary for triggering the dissociation of the protein from the ER and thus for enabling its RA-induced nuclear translocation. CRABP-II cooperates with the nuclear receptor RAR in mediating the transcriptional activity of their shared ligand, all-trans-RA. Apo-CRABP-II resides in the extranuclear milieu but, following binding of RA. We previously reported that the side chains of the CRABP-II residues that comprise the protein nuclear localization signal, K20, R29, and K30, undergo a conformational change upon ligand binding, enabling recognition by importin α, which mobilizes the protein to the nucleus (9Sessler R.J. Noy N. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, CRABP-II directly delivers RA to RAR thereby markedly enhancing the transcriptional activity of the receptor (3Schug T.T. Berry D.C. Shaw N.S. Travis S.N. Noy N. Cell. 2007; 129: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 4Schug T.T. Berry D.C. Toshkov I.A. Cheng L. Nikitin A.Y. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2002; 22: 5114-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The observations described here reveal that RA controls the nuclear translocation of CRABP-II not only by activating the protein NLS (9Sessler R.J. Noy N. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) but also by triggering SUMOylation at residue K102. The data demonstrate that RA stabilizes association of CRABP-II with the SUMO ligase Ubc9 and triggers SUMOylation of the protein both in vitro and in cultured cells (Fig. 1). The observations further show that RA-induced SUMOylation of CRABP-II specifically targets a single residue, K102 (Fig. 3a). SUMO2 was found to be more efficient than SUMO 1 or SUMO3 in modifying CRABP-II (data not shown). While the molecular weight (M.W.) of SUMO2 is ∼12 kDa, SUMOylated CRABP-II, whose M.W. is ∼15 kDa, migrated on SDS-PAGE gels with an apparent size of ∼75 kDa (Fig. 1). The observations thus suggest that, as often is the case (13Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), CRABP-II is modified by a SUMO polymer. The M.W. increase of ∼60 kDa further suggests that the modification results in attachment of a polymer containing 5 SUMO moieties. Mutation of K102 abolished the ability of CRABP-II to mobilize to the nucleus in response to RA and to enhance the transcriptional activity of RAR (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, a and b). Taken together with the observations that overexpression of Ubc9 prolonged the nuclear residence time of CRABP-II (Fig. 3), these data demonstrate that SUMOylation is critical for the RA-induced nuclear mobilization of CRABP-II as well as for CRABP-II-mediated delivery of RA to RAR. Interestingly, the SUMOylated residue, K102, is also an integral component of the RAR interaction domain of CRABP-II (11Budhu A. Gillilan R. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It should be noted that it has been reported that bacterially expressed CRABP-II efficiently associates with bacterially expressed RAR (6Dong D. Ruuska S.E. Levinthal D.J. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23695-23698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), indicating that post-translational modifications are not necessary for the formation of CRABP-II-RAR complex. These considerations suggest that removal of the SUMO moieties from CRABP-II may be required for enabling the association of the binding protein with RAR. Overall, the observations suggest that, upon RA binding, CRABP-II is SUMOylated in the cytosol and that the modification is reversed in the nucleus, likely prior to interactions of the protein with RAR (Fig. 7). In search for the specific step in the in nuclear mobilization process that requires SUMOylation, the effect of mutating the SUMOylated residue K102 on the interactions of CRABP-II with importin α was examined. The data (Fig. 4c) indicated that the mutation did not impair the ability of CRABP-II to bind importin α or to do so in a RA-dependent manner. An alternative possibility is that SUMOylation is required to allow CRABP-II to dissociate from a subcellular compartment with which it is associated in the absence of RA. Co-localization experiments surprisingly revealed that apo-CRABP-II is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). As CRABP-II is a soluble protein and does not contain an identifiable ER localization signal, its association with the ER is likely mediated by binding to a protein(s) in the cytoplasmic surface of the ER. The identity of such a binding partner and the functional significance of its association with CRABP-II remain to be clarified. Regardless of the nature of the partner, the data demonstrate that its association with CRABP-II is negated upon binding of RA, and that the effect requires RA-induced SUMOylation of residue K102 (Fig. 6b). Hence, RA-controlled SUMOylation of CRABP-II releases CRABP-II from the ER, enabling its association with importin α and consequently, its nuclear mobilization (Fig. 7). Whereas these and previous observations (9Sessler R.J. Noy N. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) delineated the molecular mechanisms that regulate the nuclear import of CRABP-II, the process that drives the export of the protein from the nucleus following delivery of RA to RAR remains poorly understood. The data revealed that RA-induced mobilization of CRABP-II to the nucleus is complete within ∼30 min, and that the protein exits the nucleus ∼30 min later (Figs. 2a and 3a). These observations suggest the existence of a clock that, following a set residence time in the nucleus, affects nuclear export of CRABP-II. The observations that overexpression of Ubc9 delays the protein's nuclear export (Fig. 3b) likely reflects a higher nuclear influx of CRABP-II upon enhancement of SUMOylation by the ligase. These observations support the possibility that the timed export process involves intranuclear reversal of the SUMO modification. It is also worth noting that, while a nuclear export signal (NES) was found to exist in other intracellular lipid-binding proteins, e.g. fatty acid-binding protein 4, CRABP-II lacks the Leu residues that comprise this NES (16Ayers S.D. Nedrow K.L. Gillilan R.E. Noy N. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6744-6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nuclear export of CRABP-II may thus be mediated by another protein.

https://openalex.org/W2013607403,"Non-contact cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CrCLR) is an important cause of lameness in client-owned dogs and typically occurs without obvious injury. There is a high incidence of bilateral rupture at presentation or subsequent contralateral rupture in affected dogs. Although stifle synovitis increases risk of contralateral CrCLR, relatively little is known about risk factors for subsequent contralateral rupture, or whether therapeutic intervention may modify this risk.We conducted a longitudinal study examining survival of the contralateral CrCL in client-owned dogs with unilateral CrCLR in a large baseline control population (n = 380), and a group of dogs that received disease-modifying therapy with arthroscopic lavage, intra-articular hyaluronic acid and oral doxycycline (n = 16), and were followed for one year. Follow-up in treated dogs included analysis of mobility, radiographic evaluation of stifle effusion and arthritis, and quantification of biomarkers of synovial inflammation. We found that median survival of the contralateral CrCL was 947 days. Increasing tibial plateau angle decreased contralateral ligament survival, whereas increasing age at diagnosis increased survival. Contralateral ligament survival was reduced in neutered dogs. Our disease-modifying therapy did not significantly influence contralateral ligament survival. Correlative analysis of clinical and biomarker variables with development of subsequent contralateral rupture revealed few significant results. However, increased expression of T lymphocyte-associated genes in the index unstable stifle at diagnosis was significantly related to development of subsequent non-contact contralateral CrCLR.Subsequent contralateral CrCLR is common in client-owned dogs, with a median ligament survival time of 947 days. In this naturally occurring model of non-contact cruciate ligament rupture, cranial tibial translation is preceded by development of synovial inflammation. However, treatment with arthroscopic lavage, intra-articular hyaluronic acid and oral doxycycline does not significantly influence contralateral CrCL survival."
https://openalex.org/W2051092427,"Isothiocyanates, membrane-permeable electrophiles that form adducts with thiols, have been suggested to have important medical benefits. Here we shed light on isothiocyanate-thiol conjugates and studied their electrophilic potential transferring an isothiocyanate moiety to cellular proteins. When we examined the effect of sulfhydryl molecules on cellular response induced by 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC), an analog of sulforaphane isolated from broccoli, we observed significant induction of heme oxygenase-1 by 6-HITC even in the presence of N-acetyl-l-cysteine or glutathione (GSH). In addition, the authentic 6-HITC-β-mercaptoethanol (6-HITC-ME) conjugate markedly up-regulated the enzyme expression, suggesting the electrophilic potential of thiolated isothiocyanates. To gain a chemical insight into the cellular response induced by thiolated isothiocyanates, we studied the occurrence of transthiocarbamoylation of sulfhydryl molecules by 6-HITC-ME and observed that, upon incubation of 6-HITC-ME with GSH, a single product corresponding to the GSH conjugate of 6-HITC was generated. To test the functional ability of thiolated isothiocyanates to thiocarbamoylate proteins in living cells, we designed a novel probe, combining an isothiocyanate-reactive group and an alkyne functionality, and revealed that the transthiocarbamoylation of proteins occurred in the cells upon exposure to 6-HITC-ME. The target of thiocarbamoylation included heat shock protein 90 β (Hsp90β), a chaperone ATPase of the Hsp90 family implicated in protein maturation and targeting. To identify the sites of the Hsp90β modification, we utilized nano-LC/MALDI-TOF MS/MS and suggested that a thiol group on the peptide containing Cys-521 reacted with 6-HITC, resulting in a covalent adduct in a 6-HITC-treated recombinant Hsp90β in vitro. The site-selective binding to Cys-521 was supported by in silico modeling. Further study on the thiocarbamoylation of Hsp90β suggested that the formation of 6-HITC-Hsp90β conjugate might cause activation of heat shock factor-1, rapidly signaling a potential heat shock response. These data suggest that thiolated isothiocyanates are an active metabolite that could contribute to cellular responses through transthiocarbamoylation of cellular proteins.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the consumption of cruciferous vegetables is associated with a lower incidence of cancers (1Lee H.P. Gourley L. Duffy S.W. Esteve J. Lee J. Day N.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 2Olsen G.W. Mandel J.S. Gibson R.W. Wattenberg L.W. Schuman L.M.

Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). An important group of compounds that have this property are organosulfur compounds, such as the isothiocyanates. The isothiocyanates are compounds that occur as glucosinolates in a variety of cruciferous vegetables, such as the Brassica species. Glucosinolates are found in the cell vacuoles of various plants in the family Cruciferae, such as horseradish, mustard, broccoli, and wasabi. When plant cells are damaged, glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by myrosinase (thioglucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.3.1) to produce isothiocyanates. They are among the most appreciated nutraceutical components of what have become known as “functional foods” and have been suggested to have important medical benefits. They not only inhibit microbes but can also help treat or prevent blood clotting and asthma (4Depree J.A. Howard T.M. Savage G.P. Food Res. Int. 1999; 31: 329-337Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). They are also a class of phytochemicals with a recognized anti-cancer activity. They can act in a chemopreventive capacity via inhibition of carcinogen-activating phase 1 enzymes (5Nakajima M. Yoshida R. Shimada N. Yamazaki H. Yokoi T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1110-1113PubMed Google Scholar) and induction of phase 2 detoxification enzymes (6Zhang Y. Talalay P. Cho C.G. Posner G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 2399-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Isothiocyanates are also active in the postinitiation phase of tumorigenesis and are, therefore, proposed to have a chemotherapeutic potential (7Chiao J.W. Wu H. Ramaswamy G. Conaway C.C. Chung F.L. Wang L. Liu D.L. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Pham N.A. Jacobberger J.W. Schimmer A.D. Cao P. Gronda M. Hedley D.W. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1239-1248PubMed Google Scholar). The isothiocyanate-mediated disruption of cancer progression is achieved by a variety of mechanisms, including modulation of cell growth, inhibition of angiogenesis, suppression of metastasis, and induction of apoptosis. Isothiocyanates can also modulate inflammatory pathways via inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (9Heiss E. Herhaus C. Klimo K. Bartsch H. Gerhäuser C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32008-32015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Among the varieties of isothiocyanates, the ω-methylsulfinylalkyl isothiocyanates, such as 4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate (sulforaphane) and its analog 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC) 2The abbreviations used are: 6-HITC6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanateAl-ITCalkynyl-tagged 6-HITCAl-ITC-AE2-aminoethanol derivative of Al-ITCAl-ITC-MEβ-mercaptoethanol derivative of Al-ITC6-HITC-ME6-HITC-β-mercaptoethanolHO-1heme oxygenase-1HSF-1heat shock factor-1Hspheat shock proteinNACN-acetyl-l-cysteineAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateTAMRAtetramethylrhodamine. present in broccoli and wasabi, respectively, have attracted much attention. 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate alkynyl-tagged 6-HITC 2-aminoethanol derivative of Al-ITC β-mercaptoethanol derivative of Al-ITC 6-HITC-β-mercaptoethanol heme oxygenase-1 heat shock factor-1 heat shock protein N-acetyl-l-cysteine 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate tetramethylrhodamine. It is generally believed that isothiocyanates mediate cellular responses due to the high reactivity of the isothiocyanate moiety (10Wu X. Zhou Q.H. Xu K. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2009; 30: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Nucleophilic attack of isothiocyanates by thiols forms dithiocarbamates. The main pathway for biotransformation of isothiocyanates in mammals is glutathione (GSH) conjugation catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase (11Zhang Y. Kolm R.H. Mannervik B. Talalay P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The resulting dithiocarbamate formation was described as the first step in the metabolic pathway of isothiocyanates. It has been shown that conjugation of benzyl isothiocyanate to GSH results in greatly reduced toxicity, especially at high GSH concentrations (12Bruggeman I.M. Temmink J.H. van Bladeren P.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1986; 83: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for phenylalkyl isothiocyanate-cysteine conjugates (13Zheng G.Q. Kenney P.M. Lam L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the conjugation with thiol leads to the reduction of isothiocyanate toxicity. Meanwhile, it was also speculated that isothiocyanate-thiol conjugates could be regarded as a transport form of isothiocyanates (14Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T. Zhang Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The reaction of isothiocyanates with thiols, unlike other nucleophiles like amine and hydroxyl groups, is reversible (10Wu X. Zhou Q.H. Xu K. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2009; 30: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). From the product dithiocarbamate, the thiol and free isothiocyanate can be regenerated. The addition of a second thiol derivative to a solution of a dithiocarbamate is suggested to result in transfer of the isothiocyanate to the second thiol group. Thus, GSH conjugates of isothiocyanates can act as “transport forms” of the parent compound (15Baillie T.A. Slatter J.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 1991; 24: 264-270Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Baillie T.A. Kassahun K. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Kassahun K. Davis M. Hu P.

The present study was designed to investigate the transthiocarbamoylation of sulfhydryl molecules by thiolated isothiocyanates. Transthiocarbamoylation of cellular proteins in living cells after exposure to a thiolated isothiocyanate was also studied using click chemistry. In addition, based on the identification of a heat shock protein as the major cellular target of transthiocarbamoylation, we studied its functional consequences. 6-HITC was a kind gift of Dr. Y. Morimitsu (Ochanomizu University). 17-AAG was purchased from Wako. The anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp90β goat polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-Hsp90α rabbit polyclonal antibody and recombinant human Hsp90β protein were obtained from Stressgen. The anti-lamin A rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. The anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mouse monoclonal antibody was obtained from Millipore. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG, the HRP-linked anti-mouse IgG, and ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from GE Healthcare. The HRP-linked anti-goat IgG immunoglobulin was purchased from Dako. NeutrAvidin Plus UltraLink Resin was obtained from Thermo. Biotin-N3 was obtained from Invitrogen. TAMRA-N3 was essentially synthesized as described previously for the synthesis of related fluorescent tags (18Speers A.E. Cravatt B.F. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 535-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The detailed experimental procedures for the synthesis of the alkynyl-tagged 6-HITC (Al-ITC) and its derivatives are described in the supplementary material. The β-mercaptoethanol conjugate of 6-HITC (6-HITC-ME) was prepared by adding 6 μmol of β-mercaptoethanol in 180 μl of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8, with 50% ethanol, to 1 μmol of 6-HITC. After overnight incubation, the β-mercaptoethanol conjugate of 6-HITC was purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6-mm inner diameter × 250 mm; Nomura Chemicals), eluted with a linear gradient of water containing 0.1% TFA (solvent A)-acetonitrile (solvent B) (time = 0 min, 10% B; 40 min, 80% B) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 190–650 nm. About 70% conversion of 6-HITC to the β-mercaptoethanol conjugate was obtained. Methanol was removed under N2, after which a stock solution of 6-HITC-ME was stored at −80 °C. A product of 95% purity was obtained as judged with reverse-phase HPLC analysis. Transthiocarbamoylation of sulfhydryl molecules by thiolated isothiocyanates was carried out upon incubation of 1 mm 6-HITC-ME with 1 mm GSH or 1 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 37 °C. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. We used Caco-2 cells, derived from a human colorectal carcinoma, in this study. They are known to resemble normal small intestinal epithelial cells and serve as a useful in vitro model to further ascertain the mechanisms contributing to gut cell function. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mm streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. During the culture, the non-differentiated cells were passaged upon reaching 80% confluence using 0.05% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.5 mm EDTA. Caco-2 cells were treated with the Al-ITC analogues dissolved in acetonitrile or the vehicle control (acetonitrile only) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2), and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Click chemistry was performed with cellular lysates containing 2.0 mg/ml protein with 1 mm CuSO4, 1 mm ascorbic acid, 0.1 mm tris((1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)amine, 3 μm TAMRA-N3, or 20 μm biotin-N3. After incubation in the dark for 1 h at room temperature, the cell lysate proteins were diluted with loading buffer and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, or the avidin pull-down was performed. The lysates prepared from the cells were treated with SDS sample buffer and immediately boiled for 5 min. The protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The gel was fixed in 7% acetic acid, 10% methanol for 30 min and then scanned using a Typhoon 9200 (GE Healthcare). Gel pieces were washed in water containing 0.1 and 50% methanol for 1 h, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and dried in a SpeedVac for 30 min. Samples were proteolyzed with sequence grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer in the presence of 0.01% Protease MAX surfactant (Promega) for 3 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was collected and desalted by ZipTip C18 reverse-phase microcolumns (Millipore). Peptide mass fingerprints were generated with an ABI 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer with version 3.6 software (AB-Sciex). Proteins were identified with the MASCOT (Matrix Science, London) searching algorithms using the NCBInr data base. Human recombinant Hsp90β was incubated with 25 μm 6-HITC for 3 h. The 6-HITC-labeled Hsp90β was digested by sequence grade modified trypsin (Promega) in the presence of 0.01% Protease MAX surfactant (Promega). The recovered peptides were then resolved by reverse-phase nano-LC (DiNa Nano LC system, KYA TECH Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and then directly fractionated onto a MALDI target plate with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid by a spotter (DiNa Map system). MALDI-MS and MS/MS were performed on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer. The MS/MS data were analyzed by MASCOT. MASCOT Distiller was used to obtain the monoisotopic peak list from the raw mass spectrometry files. For the MS/MS database query, the searching parameter was set up as follows. The taxonomy was selected as Homo sapiens; the mass tolerance was ±0.1 Da; the MS/MS tolerance was ±0.3 Da; the missed cleavage sites were allowed up to one; the variable modification was selected as carbamidomethyl (cysteine), oxidation (methionine), deamidation (asparagine, glutamine), and 6-HITC addition (cysteine). The putative three-dimensional structures of Hsp90β were built with the Phyre homology-modeling server (19Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar) using three structures of the Hsp90 homologs as templates: yeast Hsp90 in complex with an ATP analog and the co-chaperone (closed form I, Protein Data Bank entry 2CG9) (20Ali M.M.

Warren J.J. Immormino R.M. Gewirth D.T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 41-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The 6-HITC and cysteine adduct molecule were generated and energy-minimized using the Dundee PRODRG2 Server (23Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4063) Google Scholar). The position and conformation of the 6-HITC-cysteine Michael adduct were adjusted using Coot (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar) and MolFeat (FiatLux Co.) to avoid any steric clash and to correct the direction of the isothiocyanate group of 6-HITC. The homogenates prepared from the cells were treated with the SDS sample buffer and immediately boiled for 5 min. The protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo). The proteins separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol were electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane. To detect the immunoreactive proteins, we used ECL reagents. The total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and spectrophotometrically quantified. The total RNAs were reverse-transcribed into cDNA and used for the RT-PCR analysis (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as the internal standard. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel, and the positive signals were quantified by a densitometry analysis after staining with ethidium bromide. The following primer pairs (Sigma) were used: GAPDH, 5′-AACCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCAGTGAT-3′ (reverse); Hsp70, 5′-ATGGCCAAAGCCGCGGCAGTCGGCATCGACCTGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGCCGTGGGCTCGTTGATGATCCGCAGCACGTTG-3′ (reverse). The Caco-2 cells were transfected with siRNA against HSF-1 (sc-35611) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. as per the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the subconfluent (40–50%) Caco-2 cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine2000TM transfection reagent (Invitrogen); 4 μl of the siRNA stock (10 μm) and 8 μl of Lipofectamine2000TM were each diluted with 200 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After 5 min at room temperature, they were combined and incubated for 20 min. The reaction mixtures were overlaid on the cell culture for 6 h. The medium was then added to an equal volume of culture medium without penicillin and streptomycin, and the next day, the medium was changed to a fresh medium. It was incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator until ready to assay (48 h post-transfection). For the control, we used StealthTM RNAi negative control duplexes (Invitrogen). To prepare the whole cell extracts, cells were lysed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Sigma). The cross-linking of HSF-1 was performed by adding bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Thermo) to the whole cell extract and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The cell extracts were then subjected to Western blot analysis using the rabbit anti-HSF-1 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA), using the Can Get Signal (TOYOBO Biochemicals, Osaka, Japan). For the immunocytochemistry, cells were washed twice in cold PBS and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After the membranes were permeabilized by exposing the fixed cells to PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, the cells were sequentially incubated in PBS solutions containing blocking serum (2% BSA) and immunostained with the anti-HSF-1 polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. After being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated in Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. After labeling with the secondary antibody, the cells were incubated in RNase for 10 min and propidium iodide (160 nm; Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. The images were digitally captured using a laser-scanning confocal microscope and Pascal LSM software (LSM5 Pascal, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The Halo-tagged human Hsp90β vector was obtained from Promega (FHC01815). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine2000TM. Briefly, 8 μg of plasmid DNA and 16 μl of Lipofectamine2000TM were each diluted with 200 μl of Opti-MEM. After 48 h, the Caco-2 cells transiently expressing Halo-tagged Hsp90β were treated with 6-HITC or DMSO for 2 h. The cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was incubated with HaloLink resin (Promega) for 6 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100, the bound materials were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the anti-HSF-1 antibody. UltraLink immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Thermo) was added to the cell lysate, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h to preclear nonspecific binding to NeutrAvidin beads. Next, click chemistry was performed with the supernatant in the dark for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the lysate containing the biotin-N3 conjugation to the Al-ITC-modified proteins was incubated with NeutrAvidin beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and bound proteins were eluted into SDS sample buffer by boiling for 15 min. Biotinylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Hsp90β antibody. Electrophiles, having a chemical feature to react with the sulfhydryl groups by oxido-reduction, alkylation, or disulfide interchange, are inducers of the phase 2 and antioxidant enzymes. Hence, we first examined the effect of sulfhydryl molecules, NAC and GSH, on the 6-HITC-induced HO-1 expression in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The cells were treated with 25 μm 6-HITC in the presence and absence of the sulfhydryl molecules for 24 h, and the HO-1 expression was examined by an immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, HO-1 expression was significantly induced by treatment with 6-HITC alone, whereas no significant induction of HO-1 was observed when cells were treated with NAC or GSH alone. Of interest, the HO-1 expression was also observed when the cells were treated with 6-HITC in the presence of NAC or GSH. The data suggest that the dithiocarbamate derivatives generated upon incubation of 6-HITC with sulfhydryl molecules might have an HO-1-inducing electrophilic potential. To prove this hypothesis, we prepared an authentic 6-HITC-ME upon incubation of 6-HITC with β-mercaptoethanol and treated Caco-2 cells with the conjugate. As expected, 6-HITC-ME markedly up-regulated the HO-1 expression (Fig. 1B). Moreover, based on the fact that the Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1)-Nrf2 system is the major regulatory pathway of these enzyme gene expressions (25Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. O'Connor T. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of 6-HITC-ME on the induction of Nrf2 expression in Caco-2 cells and observed that the conjugate significantly induced Nrf2 expression prior to the expression of HO-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, 6-HITC-ME was speculated to be an electrophile that acts on the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. We speculated that, if the isothiocyanate-thiol conjugates function as an electrophile, they should react with sulfhydryl molecules, such as NAC and GSH, through the retro Michael cleavage followed by binding with the sulfhydryl molecules (transthiocarbamoylation). To gain a chemical insight into the cellular response induced by the thiolated isothiocyanates, we studied the occurrence of the transthiocarbamoylation of GSH by the isothiocyanate derivatives. 6-HITC-ME was incubated with an equal amount of GSH, and the transfer of the 6-HITC moiety to GSH was followed by detection of 6-HITC-GSH on reverse-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2A, when the 6-HITC-ME conjugate was incubated with GSH, a single product that was also formed upon incubation of 6-HITC and GSH was detected, suggesting that the product represents the 6-HITC-GSH conjugate. Selected ion monitoring of the 6-HITC-GSH conjugate ion [M + H]+ with m/z 513 indeed detected the product (Fig. 2B), which was expected to be the GSH conjugate (Fig. 2C). Similar transthiocarbamoylation also occurred when 6-HITC-ME was incubated with NAC (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, the 6-HITC-thiol conjugate is reactive toward thiol exchange in the presence of a suitable sulfhydryl reagent. To test the functional ability of thiolated isothiocyanates to transthiocarbamoylate proteins in living cells, a novel probe was designed, combining an isothiocyanate-reactive group and an alkyne functionality. The presence of the alkyne functionality could then be detected in a later step upon the Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen [3 + 2] cycloaddition (“click chemistry”) reaction (26Rostovtsev V.V. Green L.G. Fokin V.V. Sharpless K.B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 2596-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (9721) Google Scholar) with an azide-functionalized fluorescent group (supplemental Fig. S2). The alkynylated 6-HITC analogues, such as Al-ITC and its 2-aminoethanol derivative (Al-ITC-AE) and β-mercaptoethanol derivative (Al-ITC-ME) (Fig. 3A), were synthesized (supplemental Fig. S3 and supplemental material) and examined for transthiocarbamoylation of cellular proteins in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. After exposure of the cells to these alkynylated 6-HITC analogues, click chemistry was performed with cellular lysates followed by the separation of the lysate proteins on SDS-PAGE. In accordance with the reversible nature of the reactions, a dramatic increase of protein-bound label was observed when the cells were incubated with Al-ITC and Al-ITC-ME, whereas no labeling was observed in the Al-ITC-AE-treated cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that thiolated isothiocyanates, not aminated isothiocyanates, are reversible conjugates that react with sulfhydryl molecules through transthiocarbamoylation. To further analyze the target proteins of transthiocarbamoylation in living cells, fluorescent profiling of the total cell lysates revealed many proteins labeled by Al-ITC or Al-ITC-ME (Fig. 4A). To identify the proteins tagged with the “click” reagents, the bands resolved by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining were excised and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. A survey of the protein hits from the cell lysates labeled with the alkynylated 6-HITC analogues revealed candidate isothiocyanate target proteins. From three independent proteomic experiments, we identified five proteins, including Hsp90β, Hsp60, α-tubulin, β-actin, and GAPDH as the targets (supplemental Table S1). Although Al-ITC-ME was a less efficient alkylation reagent, the majority of the selectively labeled proteins were consistent with those targeted by Al-ITC. Hsp90β, among the identified target proteins, was the most clearly visible for the Al-ITC- and Al-ITC-ME-treated cell preparations. However, the protein was simply identified from gel bands that co-migrated with fluorescence signal. The band may therefore contain both adducted and unadducted proteins. Hence, the binding of the Al-ITC analogues into endogenous Hsp90β was confirmed by a pull-down assay. To this end, the Caco-2 cells were treated with 25 μm Al-ITC or Al-ITC-ME, and then the biotin-N3 conjugation to the Al-ITC-modifie"
https://openalex.org/W2042166980,"Background Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are involved in a plethora of cellular processes in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Signaling specificity is achieved by dynamic processes involving BMP receptor oligomerization and endocytosis. This allows for spatiotemporal control of Smad dependent and non-Smad pathways. In this study, we investigate the spatiotemporal regulation within the BMP-induced Smad transcriptional pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we discriminate between Smad signaling events that are dynamin-dependent (i.e., require an intact endocytic pathway) and dynamin-independent. Inhibition of dynamin-dependent endocytosis in fluorescence microscopy and fractionation studies revealed a delay in Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation after BMP-2 stimulation of C2C12 cells. Using whole genome microarray and qPCR analysis, we identified two classes of BMP-2 induced genes that are differentially affected by inhibition of endocytosis. Thus, BMP-2 induced gene expression of Id1, Id3, Dlx2 and Hey1 is endocytosis-dependent, whereas BMP-2 induced expression of Id2, Dlx3, Zbtb2 and Krt16 is endocytosis-independent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that short term inhibition of endocytosis interferes with osteoblast differentiation as measured by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) production and qPCR analysis of osteoblast marker gene expression. Conclusions/Significance Our study demonstrates that dynamin-dependent endocytosis is crucial for the concise spatial activation of the BMP-2 induced signaling cascade. Inhibition of endocytic processes during BMP-2 stimulation leads to altered Smad1/5/8 signaling kinetics and results in differential target gene expression. We show that interfering with the BMP-2 induced transcriptional network by endocytosis inhibition results in an attenuation of osteoblast differentiation. This implies that selective sensitivity of gene expression to endocytosis provides an additional mechanism for the cell to respond to BMP in a context specific manner. Moreover, we suggest a novel Smad dependent signal cascade induced by BMP-2, which does not require endocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W2139709435,"The predicted global warming may affect freshwater systems at several organizational levels, from organism to ecosystem. Specifically, in temperate regions, the projected increase of winter temperatures may have important effects on the over-winter biology of a range of organisms and especially for fish and other ectothermic animals. However, temperature effects on organisms may be directed strongly by resource availability. Here, we investigated whether over-winter loss of biomass and lipid content of juvenile roach (Rutilus rutilus) was affected by the physiologically relatively small (2-5°C) changes of winter temperatures predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), under both natural and experimental conditions. This was investigated in combination with the effects of food availability. Finally, we explored the potential for a correlation between lake temperature and resource levels for planktivorous fish, i.e., zooplankton biomass, during five consecutive winters in a south Swedish lake. We show that small increases in temperature (+2°C) affected fish biomass loss in both presence and absence of food, but negatively and positively respectively. Temperature alone explained only a minor part of the variation when food availability was not taken into account. In contrast to other studies, lipid analyses of experimental fish suggest that critical somatic condition rather than critical lipid content determined starvation induced mortality. Our results illustrate the importance of considering not only changes in temperature when predicting organism response to climate change but also food-web interactions, such as resource availability and predation. However, as exemplified by our finding that zooplankton over-winter biomass in the lake was not related to over-winter temperature, this may not be a straightforward task."
https://openalex.org/W1965008058,"Background The psychological and neurobiological processes underlying moral judgment have been the focus of extensive recent research. Here we show that serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) genotype predicts responses to moral dilemmas featuring foreseen harm to an innocent. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants in this study judged the acceptability of actions that would unintentionally or intentionally harm an innocent victim in order to save others' lives. An analysis of variance revealed a genotype × scenario interaction, F(2, 63) = 4.52, p = .02. Results showed that, relative to long allele homozygotes (LL), carriers of the short (S) allele showed particular reluctance to endorse utilitarian actions resulting in foreseen harm to an innocent individual. LL genotype participants rated perpetrating unintentional harm as more acceptable (M = 4.98, SEM = 0.20) than did SL genotype participants (M = 4.65, SEM = 0.20) or SS genotype participants (M = 4.29, SEM = 0.30). No group differences in moral judgments were observed in response to scenarios featuring intentional harm. Conclusions/Significance The results indicate that inherited variants in a genetic polymorphism that influences serotonin neurotransmission influence utilitarian moral judgments as well. This finding is interpreted in light of evidence that the S allele is associated with elevated emotional responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2160737242,"Smallpox, caused by variola virus (VARV), is a devastating human disease that affected millions worldwide until the virus was eradicated in the 1970 s. Subsequent cessation of vaccination has resulted in an immunologically naive human population that would be at risk should VARV be used as an agent of bioterrorism. The development of antivirals and improved vaccines to counter this threat would be facilitated by the development of animal models using authentic VARV. Towards this end, cynomolgus macaques were identified as adequate hosts for VARV, developing ordinary or hemorrhagic smallpox in a dose-dependent fashion. To further refine this model, we performed a serial sampling study on macaques exposed to doses of VARV strain Harper calibrated to induce ordinary or hemorrhagic disease. Several key differences were noted between these models. In the ordinary smallpox model, lymphoid and myeloid hyperplasias were consistently found whereas lymphocytolysis and hematopoietic necrosis developed in hemorrhagic smallpox. Viral antigen accumulation, as assessed immunohistochemically, was mild and transient in the ordinary smallpox model. In contrast, in the hemorrhagic model antigen distribution was widespread and included tissues and cells not involved in the ordinary model. Hemorrhagic smallpox developed only in the presence of secondary bacterial infections – an observation also commonly noted in historical reports of human smallpox. Together, our results support the macaque model as an excellent surrogate for human smallpox in terms of disease onset, acute disease course, and gross and histopathological lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2018099889,"Variations in the activities of Cytochrome P450s are one of the major factors responsible for inter-individual differences in drug clearance rates, which may cause serious toxicity or inefficacy of therapeutic drugs. Various mRNA level is one of the key factors for different activity of the major P450 genes. Although both genetic and environmental regulators of P450 gene expression have been widely investigated, few studies have evaluated the functional importance of cis- and trans-regulatory factors and environmental factors in the modulation of inter-individual expression variations of the P450 genes. In this study, we measured the mRNA levels of seven major P450 genes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) in 96 liver biopsy samples from Chinese population. Both trans-acting (mRNA levels and non-synonymous SNPs of putative regulator genes) and cis-acting (gene copy number and functional SNPs) factors were investigated to identify the determinants of the expression variations of these seven P450 genes. We found that expression variations of most P450 genes, regulator genes and housekeeping genes were positively correlated at the mRNA level. After partial correlation analysis using ACTB and GAPDH expression to eliminate the effect of global regulators, a UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) tree was constructed to reveal the effects of specific regulation networks potentially masked by global regulators. Combined with the functional analysis of regulators, our results suggested that expression variation at the mRNA level was mediated by several factors in a gene-specific manner. Cis-acting genetic variants might play key roles in the expression variation of CYP2D6 and CYP3A5, environmental inducers might play key roles in CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 variation and global regulators might play key roles in CYP2C9 variation. In addition, the functions of regulators that play less important roles in controlling expression variation for each P450 gene were determined."
https://openalex.org/W1983035758,"Speech perception often benefits from vision of the speaker's lip movements when they are available. One potential mechanism underlying this reported gain in perception arising from audio-visual integration is on-line prediction. In this study we address whether the preceding speech context in a single modality can improve audiovisual processing and whether this improvement is based on on-line information-transfer across sensory modalities. In the experiments presented here, during each trial, a speech fragment (context) presented in a single sensory modality (voice or lips) was immediately continued by an audiovisual target fragment. Participants made speeded judgments about whether voice and lips were in agreement in the target fragment. The leading single sensory context and the subsequent audiovisual target fragment could be continuous in either one modality only, both (context in one modality continues into both modalities in the target fragment) or neither modalities (i.e., discontinuous). The results showed quicker audiovisual matching responses when context was continuous with the target within either the visual or auditory channel (Experiment 1). Critically, prior visual context also provided an advantage when it was cross-modally continuous (with the auditory channel in the target), but auditory to visual cross-modal continuity resulted in no advantage (Experiment 2). This suggests that visual speech information can provide an on-line benefit for processing the upcoming auditory input through the use of predictive mechanisms. We hypothesize that this benefit is expressed at an early level of speech analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2111253729,"Protein kinase D (PKD) is a novel family of serine/threonine kinases regulated by diacylglycerol, which is involved in multiple cellular processes and various pathological conditions. The limited number of cell-active, selective inhibitors has historically restricted biochemical and pharmacological studies of PKD. We now markedly expand the PKD1 inhibitory chemotype inventory with eleven additional novel small molecule PKD1 inhibitors derived from our high throughput screening campaigns. The in vitro IC50s for these eleven compounds ranged in potency from 0.4 to 6.1 µM with all of the evaluated compounds being competitive with ATP. Three of the inhibitors (CID 1893668, (1Z)-1-(3-ethyl-5-methoxy-1,3-benzothiazol-2-ylidene)propan-2-one; CID 2011756, 5-(3-chlorophenyl)-N-[4-(morpholin-4-ylmethyl)phenyl]furan-2-carboxamide; CID 5389142, (6Z)-6-[4-(3-aminopropylamino)-6-methyl-1H-pyrimidin-2-ylidene]cyclohexa-2,4-dien-1-one) inhibited phorbol ester-induced endogenous PKD1 activation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The specificity of these compounds for PKD1 inhibitory activity was supported by kinase assay counter screens as well as by bioinformatics searches. Moreover, computational analyses of these novel cell-active PKD1 inhibitors indicated that they were structurally distinct from the previously described cell-active PKD1 inhibitors while computational docking of the new cell-active compounds in a highly conserved ATP-binding cleft suggests opportunities for structural modification. In summary, we have discovered novel PKD1 inhibitors with in vitro and cell-based inhibitory activity, thus successfully expanding the structural diversity of small molecule inhibitors available for this important pharmacological target."

Here, we investigated whether our own movements benefit from preferential processing even when the task is unrelated to self-recognition, and does not involve agency judgments. Participants searched for a moving target defined by its known shape among moving distractors, while continuously moving the computer mouse with one hand. They thereby controlled the motion of one item, which was randomly either the target or any of the distractors, while the other items followed pre-recorded motion pathways. Performance was more accurate and less prone to degradation as set size increased when the target was the self-controlled item. An additional experiment confirmed that participant-controlled motion was not physically more salient than motion recorded offline. We found no evidence that self-controlled items captured attention. Taken together, these results suggest that visual events are perceived more accurately when they are the consequences of our actions, even when self-motion is task irrelevant."

Design A cross-sectional study. Methodology/Principal Findings One hundred and eight eyes (54 subjects) of Malay children without diagnosis of ocular abnormality or disease meeting our inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected. The CCT and IOP were measured by specular microscopy and non-contact air-puff tonometry respectively, for analysis and comparison with the values obtained in previous studies. Mean CCT and IOP was found to be 530.87±30.79 µm and 15.65±3.05 mm Hg respectively. CCT was found not to vary with age. A positive relationship was found between CCT and IOP; specifically, with every 100-µm increase in CCT, IOP increased by 3.5 mm Hg. Conclusions/Significance CCT and IOP are strongly related in healthy Malay children aged 8 to 16. The mean CCT of Malay children is lower than that of majority children of other ethnic groups, supporting the existence of CCT variation among different populations and that ethnicity should be a key consideration when applying CCT data to the general pediatric population."

Traffic. 2005; 6: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In mammals, this pathway is responsible for receptor down-regulation and may be exploited by retroviruses, such as HIV, for particle biosynthesis (2Gould S.J. Booth A.M. Hildreth J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10592-10597Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In yeast, 17 soluble and evolutionarily conserved vacuole protein sorting (VPS) Class E proteins have been organized into ESCRTs (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) of ubiquitin-tagged cargo to the vacuole (reviewed in Ref. 1Babst M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Deletion of each of these ESCRT genes results in accumulation of endosomal cargo in a large aberrant structure adjacent to the vacuole called the Class E compartment. The integral membrane protein Vps44/Nhx1 functions as a cation/proton exchanger and has also been included in this class, although its role in MVB formation is unclear. The initial characterization of this pathway relied predominantly on methods of physical network identification, such as the Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system, protein complex isolation, identification, and crystallization efforts, which, for the most part, do not accommodate hydrophobic proteins (1Babst M.

Yeast Nhx1 co-localizes with the syntaxin Pep12 in an endosomal compartment directly abutting the vacuolar membrane in live cells, suggestive of a role for pH and ion gradients in vacuolar biogenesis (12Nass R. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21054-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, NHX1 was found to be allelic to VPS44 and shown to be required for proper processing and localization of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) to the vacuole. In nhx1Δ, as in other VPS Class E mutants, endosomal cargo is retained in a prevacuolar compartment (13Bowers K. Levi B.P. Patel F.I. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4277-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Regulation of endosomal pH by Nhx1 was directly linked to cargo trafficking by experiments showing that manipulation of compartmental pH by weak acids or bases could simulate or ameliorate trafficking defects, respectively. Thus, reversing hyperacidic compartmental pH in nhx1Δ mutants by the addition of a weak base alleviates a subset of nhx1Δ phenotypes, including hygromycin sensitivity, defective FM 4-64 efflux, and abnormal retention of Ste3-GFP in the prevacuolar compartment (8Brett C.L.

Although the accumulated evidence points to an important function in late endosomal/MVB trafficking, the role of Nhx1, if any, in MVB formation and its relation to the ESCRT pathway remain unclear. To address this problem, we first identified late-acting ESCRT mutants that closely resembled nhx1Δ in cation-related growth defects and then performed a detailed analysis of cation homeostasis, cargo trafficking, and intralumenal vesicle (ILV) formation in single and double mutants lacking Nhx1 and late ESCRT components. In an independent approach, we undertook a genome-wide unbiased screen for single gene deletions that phenocopied nhx1Δ to identify a limited subset of proteins implicated in late endosome/MVB-vacuole fusion. Together, these approaches clarify the role of Nhx1 in endosome trafficking and vacuole biogenesis. All Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used were derivatives of BY4741 or BY4742 (ResGen). Double knock-out strains were made by first transforming nhx1Δ BY4741 mutants with the linearized plasmid pAG25 (14Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H.

Select ESCRT mutants (BY4742, MATα, KanR) and nhx1Δ (BY4741, MATa, NatR) were mated, and the resulting diploids underwent sporulation when incubated in agitated liquid sporulation medium (1% sodium acetate and 0.005% zinc acetate) with required supplements (5 mg/liter each uracil, histidine, leucine, lysine, and methionine) for 4 days at 25 °C.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were added to the collection of mutants. Fifty-two 96-well plates representing the collection of mutant strains were thawed, and 5 μl of each culture was used to inoculate 200-μl seed cultures grown in synthetic complete medium at 30 °C. 4 μl of each seed culture was then used to inoculate 96-well plates, each containing 200 μl of APG medium. Growth (A600 nm) was read at 19 and 48 h on a FLUOstar Optima multimode plate reader with FLUOstar Optima Version 1.20 software (BMG Labtech, Durham, NC). Immediately prior to recording, cultures were rapidly resuspended using an electromagnetic microtiter plate shaker (Union Scientific, Randallstown, MD), and all recordings were made at 30 °C. A600 nm values were background-subtracted and normalized to average WT growth (mean calculated from 52 separate cultures spanning all microtiter plates per screen). Strains showing <20% of WT growth (<1% of the collection) under control conditions (APG medium, pH 4.0) were omitted from further analysis. Of the strains that were included, low A600 nm values of the seed cultures did not correlate with growth defects observed under experimental conditions. For each screen, conditional growth values were normalized to A600 nm values obtained under control conditions so that percentage values <100 indicate sensitivity and those >100 indicate tolerance. For data sets showing normal distributions, means ± S.D. were calculated, and strains showing growth greater than or less than 2 S.D. from the mean were considered to have a significant change in growth. Similar statistical analyses were performed on data sets showing bimodal distributions (800 mm NaCl or KCl growth screens at the 19-h measurement), whereby the data sets were divided into poorly growing and robust populations. Mutant strains in the robust population with growth values 2 S.D. greater than the mean were considered significantly tolerant to the condition, and all mutant strains in the poorly growing population were considered significantly sensitive with the exception of those with growth values 2 S.D. greater than the mean. Significant growth sensitivity or tolerance was confirmed (n > 3) for all mutants originally identified by screening experiments. Data were organized, plotted, and analyzed using Microsoft Excel X, Insightful S-PLUS 6.2, and SPSS 12.0 software. The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) Database was used to obtain annotated FunCat (functional categorization) and cellular location of genes identified in the phenocopy and chemical synthetic lethality screens. CPY secretion from yeast cultures was detected as follows. Freshly grown seed cultures were washed with water, resuspended to a starting A600 nm of 0.05 units/ml in synthetic complete medium, and grown at 30 °C for 21 h. Cultures from 2.0 A600 nm units of cells were centrifuged, and supernatants were applied to Millipore Immobilon membranes using a dot-blot apparatus. The membrane was dried overnight, and CPY was detected by immunoblotting using anti-CPY monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Molecular Probes) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). Yeast strains carrying plasmid pKJB11 (gift of Dr. Aaron Mitchell, Carnegie Mellon University) (19Barwell K.J. Boysen J.H. Xu W. Mitchell A.P. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 890-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were grown overnight in selective medium at 30 °C and used to inoculate fresh cultures at A600 nm = 0.25. After two doublings, cells were pelleted, resuspended at A600 nm = 50 in 3× Laemmli buffer, vortexed with glass beads, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, 30 μl of the supernatant was fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. For V5 epitope detection, the membrane was probed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution in PBS/Tween; Invitrogen). Peroxidase activity was visualized using ECL detection reagents (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). GFP and FM 4-64 fluorescence was performed at a magnification of ×100 using a Carl Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with an oil immersion objective (numerical aperture of 1.40). Fluorescence microscopic images were acquired with a Photometrics CoolSNAP FX digital camera and processed using Scanalytics IPLab software and Adobe Photoshop CS2 software. GFP-Bro1 or GFP-carboxypeptidase S (CPS) was introduced by transforming cells with either pGO249 or pMB118, respectively (20Davies B.A. Azmi I.F. Payne J. Shestakova A. Horazdovsky B.F. Babst M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21054-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Strains were grown to logarithmic phase at 30 °C in synthetic medium before observation at room temperature in synthetic medium. Vacuolar membrane staining was performed using 40 μm FM 4-64 for 30 min in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium as described (22Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Denatured immunoprecipitations were performed to detect Ub-CPS as described previously (23Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 24Luhtala N. Odorizzi G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). 0.5 A600 nm units were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-CPS polyclonal antiserum (25Cowles C.R. Snyder W.B. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2769-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) or anti-Ub monoclonal antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The vacuolar protease gene PEP4 was deleted in all strains to reduce the nonspecific cleavage of Ub from CPS after cellular lysis. Yeast cells were high pressure frozen and freeze-substituted as described previously (17Richter C. West M. Odorizzi G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2454-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Nickerson D.P. West M. Odorizzi G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and embedded at −60 °C in Lowicryl HM20 (Polysciences). Plastic blocks were trimmed and cut into 80-nm thin sections with a Leica microtome, placed on rhodium-plated copper slot grids, and imaged on a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope. To map Nhx1 function in the MVB pathway, we initially identified mutants harboring single deletions in each of the 17 other VPS class E genes or three additional genes reported to regulate the MVB pathway (reviewed in Ref. 27Nickerson D.P. Russell M.R. Odorizzi G. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that shared growth phenotypes with nhx1Δ. Logarithmic phase growth of nhx1Δ is sensitive to three conditions: (i) acid pH (8Brett C.L. Tukaye D.N. Mukherjee S. Rao R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1396-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), (ii) high salt (8Brett C.L. Tukaye D.N. Mukherjee S. Rao R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1396-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and (iii) hygromycin B (28Gaxiola R.A. Rao R. Sherman A. Grisafi P. Alper S.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1480-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Eight mutants showed growth sensitivity to acid stress similar to nhx1Δ (Fig. 1, upper panel). However, only half of these mutants also shared sensitivity to high salt (identical results were observed with either KCl or NaCl) (Fig. 1, middle panel) and hygromycin B (lower panel). These four strains harbor deletions in VPS36, VPS20, SNF7, and BRO1, which function together at a late stage of the MVB pathway. It is noteworthy that deleting ESCRT genes that function farther upstream or downstream of these components generally resulted in progressively weaker nhx1Δ-like phenotypes, although differences within ESCRT-II components suggest more complicated and previously unappreciated relationships that warrant further study (supplemental Table S1). Vps36 is a component of ESCRT-II that binds and recruits ESCRT-III for cargo transfer (1Babst M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Vps20 and Snf7 compose a subcomplex of ESCRT-III that has a reported role in the membrane scission event required for ILV formation (29Wollert T. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2010; 464: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Snf7 also recruits Bro1 to ESCRT-III, where it promotes deubiquitylation of cargo by Doa4 to coordinate cargo packaging into budding ILVs (21Odorizzi G. Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1893-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Luhtala N. Odorizzi G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These findings raised the possibility that Nhx1 may function together with the ESCRT-III complex when cargo packaging and ILV budding occur. Alternatively, Nhx1 and the late-acting ESCRT component may have independent functions that affect the same cellular processes that underlie their shared phenotypes. To distinguish between these possibilities, we directly evaluated ESCRT function, including cargo sorting and MVB formation, in the nhx1Δ mutant. Cargo destined for vacuole degradation enters the MVB pathway when monoubiquitylated. Once sent to the endosome, ESCRT-III concentrates and packages the Ub-tagged cargo into ILVs. At the final step, the Ub signal is cleaved by the deubiquitylase Doa4 when ESCRT is disassembled (by Vps4, a AAA-ATPase) immediately prior to ILV scission (27Nickerson D.P. Russell M.R. Odorizzi G. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This maintains a cellular pool of ubiquitin required for proper protein degradation. We showed that nhx1Δ phenocopies ESCRT deletion strains that function after Ub-cargo recruitment and sequestration but upstream of Doa4 recruitment and function (vps36Δ, vps20Δ, snf7Δ, or bro1Δ). These mutations prevent cargo deubiquitylation, causing Ub-cargo to accumulate on limiting membranes (17Richter C. West M. Odorizzi G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2454-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, if Nhx1 has a role in a late stage of MVB formation, we would expect impairment of cargo deubiquitylation in the null strain. As a control for loss of deubiquitylation, we introduced a C571S mutation in Doa4, which blocks Ub transfer and prevents removal of Ub from the cargo CPS (Fig. 2a) (30Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We observed that CPS deubiquitylation persisted in nhx1Δ cells as seen by the absence of Ub staining on the Western blot (Fig. 2a). These results do not exclude the formal possibility that the cargo was deubiquitylated without being incorporated into ILVs. To determine whether CPS is properly processed through the MVB pathway, we examined if deletion of NHX1 affects the cellular location of GFP-CPS (Fig. 2b). CPS requires proper sorting as well as ILV formation to reach the vacuole lumen, where it is processed and performs its cellular function. As reported previously for vps36Δ and snf7Δ (24Luhtala N. Odorizzi G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we observed that sorting of CPS into ILVs was blocked in vps20Δ and bro1Δ, resulting in accumulation at the limiting membrane of the vacuole (Fig. 2b). In contrast, nhx1Δ cells showed CPS localizing to the vacuole lumen, albeit with prominent retention in enlarged endosomal compartments (also detected by FM 4-64 staining) (Fig. 2c). Thus, Nhx1 is not required for CPS sorting or lumenal targeting, which implies that ILV formation can occur. To confirm the existence of ILVs in nhx1Δ cells, we examined the ultrastructure of MVBs by electron microscopy (24Luhtala N. Odorizzi G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Unlike snf7Δ (31Wemmer M. Azmi I. West M. Davies B. Katzmann D. Odorizzi G. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or vps36Δ and vps20Δ, 4G. Odorizzi and M. A. Wemmer, unpublished data. nhx1Δ cells appeared to have intact MVBs containing clearly defined ILVs (Fig. 2d). One distinction is, however, that MVBs in nhx1Δ cells were electron-dense. Given that alkaline vacuoles (vma mutants) appear abnormally clear in electron micrographs, electron-dense MVBs in nhx1Δ are consistent with lumenal hyperacidification reported previously (8Brett C.L. Tukaye D.N. Mukherjee S. Rao R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1396-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 32Ali R. Brett C.L. Mukherjee S. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4498-4506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In summary, these data demonstrate that Nhx1 is not essential for cargo sorting or packaging and ILV formation in the MVB pathway. Another function of the ESCRT pathway is in the Rim101-mediated cell signaling response to alkaline stress required for filamentation in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (33Xu W. Smith Jr., F.J. Subaran R. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5528-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). When activated by upstream signal factors, Rim20 binds to Snf7, in complex with Vps20 and associated with Vps36, as a necessary step in the recruitment of the protease required for Rim101 cleavage and activation (34Davis D.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, raising the external pH induces Rim101 cleavage in wild-type cells, whereas disruption of VPS4, the AAA-ATPase required for ESCRT disassembly, causes constitutive activation of Rim101 signaling due to accumulation of the Vps20-Snf7 complex on the endosomal membrane (35Hayashi M. Fukuzawa T. Sorimachi H. Maeda T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9478-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 3a. Given the disruption in cellular pH homeostasis in nhx1Δ (8Brett C.L. Tukaye D.N. Mukherjee S. Rao R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1396-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 32Ali R. Brett C.L. Mukherjee S. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4498-4506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we asked whether Rim101 signaling is altered in nhx1Δ. However, Nhx1 was not required for Rim101 processing in response to alkaline pH, nor did it alter constitutive activation of Rim101 processing in vps4Δ (Fig. 3a), thus ruling out a role for Nhx1 in ESCRT-mediated Rim signaling. Vps4 is also required for release of Bro1 from endosomal membranes, as seen by altered distribution of Bro1-GFP in vps4Δ. Our results demonstrate that loss of Nhx1 did not alter the distribution of Bro1-GFP, nor did it interfere with Vps4-mediated release of Bro1-GFP from endosomal compartments (Fig. 3b). Taken together, the results show that Nhx1 is not required for late ESCRT function. Having established that ESCRT activity is not directly impacted in nhx1Δ, we wanted to determine whether ESCRT affects Nhx1 function. We performed genetic epistasis experiments by making double mutant strains harboring nhx1Δ and each of the following ESCRT gene deletions: vps36Δ, vps20Δ, snf7Δ, or bro1Δ. We then examined growth and trafficking phenotypes with the expectation that loss of a gene found most downstream in a common pathway would not alter phenotypes conferred by deleting upstream genes. Thus, if NHX1 is epistatic to late ESCRT genes, the phenotypes of the double mutants would be similar to those of nhx1Δ. We first observed that the double mutants grew very poorly in the minimal medium APG (Fig. 4a). Further analysis revealed that this growth defect was due in part to KCl restriction in this medium (e.g. nhx1Δvps20Δ) (Fig. 4b). Importantly, growth sensitivity to high KCl and low pH phenotypes conferred by nhx1Δ and individual ESCRT mutants (see Fig. 1) were additive in the double mutants (Fig. 4b). Double mutants also gained sensitivity to alkaline pH, which, unlike acid pH sensitivity, could not be rescued by the addition of KCl. Evaluation of trafficking phenotypes confirmed these findings. Proper targeting of the acid hydrolase CPY to its resident compartment, the vacuole, requires a functional endocytic pathway. Missorting and abnormal secretion of CPY are the defining phenotypes of all VPS mutants. As reported previously, defects in nhx1Δ and ESCRT pathway mutants resulted in the extracellular appearance of CPY (Fig. 4c). We found that double mutants secreted more CPY than the parental single gene mutant strains (Fig. 4c). For example, although CPY secretion from both nhx1Δ and vps20Δ mutants was observed to be modest, there was a substantial increase in the double mutant. Interestingly, this additive effect was difficult to detect in only one example, snf7Δ. We showed previously that the vacuolar pH in snf7Δ is more alkaline, in contrast to other ESCRT pathway mutan"

Methodology/Principal Findings We tested oral MB in inbred high-copy number SOD1 G93A mice, at 25 mg/kg/day beginning at 45 days of age. We measured disease onset, progression, and survival. There was no difference in disease onset between MB-treated mice and controls, although subgroup analysis showed a modest but statistically significant delay in disease onset in MB-treated female mice only (control 122±10.2 versus MB 129±10.0 days). MB-treated mice of both sexes spent more time in less severe stages of disease, and less time in later, more severe stages of disease. There was a non-significant trend to longer survival in MB-treated animals (control males reached endpoint at 161±14.1 days, versus 166±10.0 days for MB-treated animals, and control females reached endpoint at 171±6.2 days versus 173±13.4 days for MB-treated animals). Conclusions/Significance In spite of a strong theoretical rationale, MB had no significant effects on onset or survival in the inbred SOD1 G93A mouse model of ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2131571730,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL77 gene encodes the essential protein UL77, its function is characterized in the present study. Immunoprecipitation identified monomeric and oligomeric pUL77 in HCMV infected cells. Immunostaining of purified virions and subviral fractions showed that pUL77 is a structural protein associated with capsids. In silico analysis revealed the presence of a coiled-coil motif (CCM) at the N-terminus of pUL77. Chemical cross-linking of either wild-type pUL77 or CCM deletion mutant (pUL77ΔCCM) implicated that CCM is critical for oligomerization of pUL77. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitations of infected and transfected cells demonstrated that pUL77 interacts with the capsid-associated DNA packaging motor components, pUL56 and pUL104, as well as the major capsid protein. The ability of pUL77 to bind dsDNA was shown by an in vitro assay. Binding to certain DNA was further confirmed by an assay using biotinylated 36-, 250-, 500-, 1000-meric dsDNA and 966-meric HCMV-specific dsDNA designed for this study. The binding efficiency (BE) was determined by image processing program defining values above 1.0 as positive. While the BE of the pUL56 binding to the 36-mer bio-pac1 containing a packaging signal was 10.0 ± 0.63, the one for pUL77 was only 0.2±0.03. In contrast to this observation the BE of pUL77 binding to bio-500 bp or bio-1000 bp was 2.2 ± 0.41 and 4.9 ± 0.71, respectively. By using pUL77ΔCCM it was demonstrated that this protein could not bind to dsDNA. These data indicated that pUL77 (i) could form homodimers, (ii) CCM of pUL77 is crucial for oligomerization and (iii) could bind to dsDNA in a sequence independent manner."

However, limited information is available on the association between HT and breast cancer in Asian women characterized mainly by dietary phytoestrogens intake and low prevalence of contraceptive pills prescription.A total of 65,723 women (20-79 years of age) without cancer or the use of Chinese herbal products were recruited from a nation-wide one-million representative sample of the National Health Insurance of Taiwan and followed from 1997 to 2008. Seven hundred and eighty incidents of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed. Using a reference group that comprised 40,052 women who had never received a hormone prescription, Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the hazard ratios for receiving different types of HT and the occurrence of breast cancer.5,156 (20%) women ever used E+P, 2,798 (10.8%) ever used E-alone, and 17,717 (69%) ever used other preparation types. The Cox model revealed adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 2.05 (95% CI 1.37-3.07) for current users of E-alone and 8.65 (95% CI 5.45-13.70) for current users of E+P. Using women who had ceased to take hormonal medication for 6 years or more as the reference group, the adjusted HRs were significantly elevated and greater than current users and women who had discontinued hormonal medication for less than 6 years. Current users of either E-alone or E+P have an increased risk for invasive breast cancer in Taiwan, and precautions should be taken when such agents are prescribed."
https://openalex.org/W1972803287,"Background We introduced a series of computer-supported workshops in our undergraduate statistics courses, in the hope that it would help students to gain a deeper understanding of statistical concepts. This raised questions about the appropriate design of the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) in which such an approach had to be implemented. Therefore, we investigated two competing software design models for VLEs. In the first system, all learning features were a function of the classical VLE. The second system was designed from the perspective that learning features should be a function of the course's core content (statistical analyses), which required us to develop a specific–purpose Statistical Learning Environment (SLE) based on Reproducible Computing and newly developed Peer Review (PR) technology. Objectives The main research question is whether the second VLE design improved learning efficiency as compared to the standard type of VLE design that is commonly used in education. As a secondary objective we provide empirical evidence about the usefulness of PR as a constructivist learning activity which supports non-rote learning. Finally, this paper illustrates that it is possible to introduce a constructivist learning approach in large student populations, based on adequately designed educational technology, without subsuming educational content to technological convenience. Methods Both VLE systems were tested within a two-year quasi-experiment based on a Reliable Nonequivalent Group Design. This approach allowed us to draw valid conclusions about the treatment effect of the changed VLE design, even though the systems were implemented in successive years. The methodological aspects about the experiment's internal validity are explained extensively. Results The effect of the design change is shown to have substantially increased the efficiency of constructivist, computer-assisted learning activities for all cohorts of the student population under investigation. The findings demonstrate that a content–based design outperforms the traditional VLE–based design."
https://openalex.org/W2071888549,"Understanding morphological transformations is essential to elucidating the evolution and developmental biology of many organisms. The Gram-positive soil bacterium, Streptomyces coelicolor has a complex lifecycle which lends itself well to such studies. We recently identified a transcriptional regulator, devA, which is required for correct sporulation in this organism, with mutants forming short, mis-septate aerial hyphae. devA is highly conserved within the Streptomyces genus along with a duplicate copy, devE. Disruption of devE indicates this gene also plays a role in sporulation; however the phenotype of a devE mutant differs from a devA mutant, forming long un-septate aerial hyphae. Transcriptional analysis of devA and devE indicates that they are expressed at different stages of the lifecycle. This suggests that following duplication they have diverged in regulation and function. Analysis of fully sequenced actinomycete genomes shows that devA is found in a single copy in morphologically simpler actinobacteria, suggesting that duplication has lead to increased morphological complexity. Complementation studies with devA from Salinispora, which sporulates but does not form aerial hyphae, indicates the ancestral gene cannot complement devA or devE, suggesting neo-functionalisation has occurred. Analysis of the synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide changes within the devA paralogues suggest subfunctionalisation has occurred as both copies have diverged from the ancestral sequences. Divergence is also asymmetric with a higher level of functional constraint observed in the DNA binding domain compared with the effector binding/oligomerisation domain, suggesting diversification in the substrate specificity of these paralogues has contributed to their evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2008879337,"Upstream reciprocity (also called generalized reciprocity) is a putative mechanism for cooperation in social dilemma situations with which players help others when they are helped by somebody else. It is a type of indirect reciprocity. Although upstream reciprocity is often observed in experiments, most theories suggest that it is operative only when players form short cycles such as triangles, implying a small population size, or when it is combined with other mechanisms that promote cooperation on their own. An expectation is that real social networks, which are known to be full of triangles and other short cycles, may accommodate upstream reciprocity. In this study, I extend the upstream reciprocity game proposed for a directed cycle by Boyd and Richerson to the case of general networks. The model is not evolutionary and concerns the conditions under which the unanimity of cooperative players is a Nash equilibrium. I show that an abundance of triangles or other short cycles in a network does little to promote upstream reciprocity. Cooperation is less likely for a larger population size even if triangles are abundant in the network. In addition, in contrast to the results for evolutionary social dilemma games on networks, scale-free networks lead to less cooperation than networks with a homogeneous degree distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2111643991,"Protein evolution includes the birth and death of structural motifs. For example, a zinc finger or a salt bridge may be present in some, but not all, members of a protein family. We propose that such transitions are manifest in sequence phylogenies as concerted shifts in substitution rates of amino acids that are neighbors in a representative structure. First, we identified rate shifts in a quartet from the Fpg/Nei family of base excision repair enzymes using a method developed by Xun Gu and coworkers. We found the shifts to be spatially correlated, more precisely, associated with a flexible loop involved in bacterial Fpg substrate specificity. Consistent with our result, sequences and structures provide convincing evidence that this loop plays a very different role in other family members. Second, then, we developed a method for identifying latent protein structural characters (LSC) given a set of homologous sequences based on Gu's method and proximity in a high-resolution structure. Third, we identified LSC and assigned states of LSC to clades within the Fpg/Nei family of base excision repair enzymes. We describe seven LSC; an accompanying Proteopedia page (http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Fpg_Nei_Protein_Family) describes these in greater detail and facilitates 3D viewing. The LSC we found provided a surprisingly complete picture of the interaction of the protein with the DNA capturing familiar examples, such as a Zn finger, as well as more subtle interactions. Their preponderance is consistent with an important role as phylogenetic characters. Phylogenetic inference based on LSC provided convincing evidence of independent losses of Zn fingers. Structural motifs may serve as important phylogenetic characters and modeling transitions involving structural motifs may provide a much deeper understanding of protein evolution."
