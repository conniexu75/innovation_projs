https://openalex.org/W1949772429,"A solution of the nonionic detergent Triton X-114 is homogeneous at 0 degrees C but separates in an aqueous phase and a detergent phase above 20 degrees C. The extent of this detergent phase separation increases with the temperature and is sensitive to the presence of other surfactants. The partition of proteins during phase separation in solutions of Triton X-114 is investigated. Hydrophilic proteins are found exclusively in the aqueous phase, and integral membrane proteins with an amphiphilic nature are recovered in the detergent phase. Triton X-114 is used to solubilize membranes and whole cells, and the soluble material is submitted to phase separation. Integral membrane proteins can thus be separated from hydrophilic proteins and identified as such in crude membrane or cellular detergent extracts."

Enzymic activity may be regenerated by replenishment with phospholipid. However, restoration of enzymic activity in phospholipid-depleted Complex I and III has been shown to require the presence of cardiolipin. These results are, therefore, similar to findings on the absolute catalytic requirement of cardiolipin for cytochrome oxidase activity (Fry, M., and Green, D. E. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 93, 1238-1246). At least two roles for phospholipid involvement in electron transfer processes are proposed, a catalytic role provided specifically by cardiolipin and a dispersive role that may be provided by various phospholipids or detergents. The absolute requirement of enzymic activity for cardiolipin suggests that this phospholipid plays a crucial role in the coupled electron transfer process."
https://openalex.org/W1492566521,"The Eco RI endonuclease and methylase recognize the same hexanucleotide substrate sequence. We have determined the sequence of a fragment of DNA which encodes these enzymes using the chain-termination method of Sanger (Sanger, F., Nicklen, S., and Coulson, A. R. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 5463-5467). The amino acid sequences of both enzymes were derived from the DNA sequence. The coding regions selected include the only open translational frames of sufficient length to accommodate the enzymes. They coincide with previously established gene boundaries and orientation. The predicted amino acid sequences correlate well with analyses of the purified protein. Comparison of the nucleotide and protein sequences reveals no homology between the endonuclease and methylase which might provide insight into the origin of the restriction-modification system or the mechanism of common substrate recognition. Based on secondary structure predictions, the two enzymes also have grossly different molecular architecture. The base composition of the sequence is 65% A + T, and the codon usage is significantly different from that observed in several Escherichia coli chromosomal genes. In some cases, frequently selected codons are recognized by minor tRNA species. A spontaneous mutation in the endonuclease gene was isolated. Serine replaces arginine at residue 187. In crude extracts, Eco RI specific cleavage is approximately 0.3% wild type."

https://openalex.org/W1492663625,"Abstract The fluorescent ATP derivative 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienylidine) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) binds specifically with enhanced fluorescence to the ATP site of purified eel electroplax sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase, (Na,K)-ATPase. A single homogeneous high affinity TNP-ATP binding site with a KD of 0.04 to 0.09 microM at 3 degrees C and 0.2 to 0.7 microM at 21 degrees-25 degrees C was observed in the absence of ligands when binding was measured by fluorescence titration or with [3H]TNP-ATP. ATP and other nucleotides competed with TNP-ATP for binding with KD values similar to those previously determined for binding to the ATP site. Binding stoichiometries determined from Scatchard plot intercepts gave one TNP-ATP site/175,000 g of protein (range: 1.64 X 10(5) to 1.92 X 10(5) when (Na,K)-ATPase protein was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. The ratio of [3H]ouabain sites to TNP-ATP sites was 0.91. These results are inconsistent with half-of-sites binding and suggest that there is one ATP and one ouabain site/alpha beta protomer. (Na,K)-ATPase maintained a high affinity for TNP-ATP regardless of the ligands present. K+ increased the KD for TNP-ATP about 5-fold and Na+ reversed the effect of K+. The effects of Na+, K+, and mg2+ on ATP binding at 3 degrees C were studied fluorimetrically by displacement of TNP-ATP by ATP. The results are consistent with competition between ATP and TNP-ATP for binding at a single site regardless of the metallic ions present. The derived KD values for ATP were : no ligands, 1 microM; 20 mM NaCl, 3-4 microM; 20 mM KCl, 15-19 microM; 20 mM Kcl + 4 mM MgCl2, 70-120 microM. These results suggests that a single ATP site exhibits a high or low affinity for ATP depending on the ligands present, so that high and low affinity ATP sites observed kinetically are interconvertible and do not co-exist independently. We propose that during turnover the affinity for ATP changes more than 100-fold owing to the conformational changes associated with ion binding, translocation, and release."

https://openalex.org/W1554578020,"Trinitrophenyl derivatives of adenine nucleotides (TNP-nucleotides: 2',3'-O-2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene complexes at neutral or basic pH) are potent inhibitors of (Na,K)-ATPase activity. The inhibitory potency of the derivatives tested followed the sequence: TNP-ADP greater than TNP-ATP greater than TNP-AMP much greater than TNP-IMP greater than TNP-adenosine. In the presence of Na+ plus K+, and affinity activation of ATPase activity by ATP was observed. Under these conditions, TNP-ATP inhibited (Na,K)-ATPase activity competitively with respect to ATP at the kinetically defined low affinity ATP In the presence of Na+ alone, only affinity activation by ATP was observed. Under these conditions, TNP-ATP inhibited (Na)-ATPase and enzyme phosphorylation by competing with ATP at the kinetically defined high affinity ATP The Ki values for inhibition were similar to the KD values determined by direct TNP-ATP binding measurements, indicating that the same TNP-ATP site is involved in the inhibition of (Na,K)-ATPase and (Na)-ATPase activities. We conclude that and affinity ATP sites are interconvertible (i.e. they represent two forms of the same site) and do not co-exist independently. TNP-ATP also inhibited competitively the K+-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity and enzyme phosphorylation by Pi, suggesting that the catalytic site for these substrates is associated with the TNP-ATP site. A kinetic model for (Na,K)-ATPase turnover based on a single ATP site which changes affinity during turnover is presented. The model was analyzed by the King-Altman (1956) J. Phys. Chem. 60, 1375-1378) method to obtain the steady state equation for the rate of ATP hydrolysis as a function of ATP concentration. Computer simulations using published values of the rate constants of intermediate steps suggest that the model is adequate to describe the observed dependence of enzyme activity on ATP concentration and the inhibition by TNP-ATP. The implications of these results on the structure and mechanism of the (Na,K) pump are discussed."

The measurements prove that the oxyferryl iron of this enzymic intermediate is spin-coupled to a porphyrin radical.

https://openalex.org/W1523972021,"Plasma membranes from rat adipocytes and liver and from human placenta have been labeled by covalent cross-linking to membrane-bound 125I-labeled multiplication stimulating activity (125I-MSA) with three different bishydroxysuccinimide esters: disuccinimidyl suberate, disuccinimidyl succinate, and ethyleneglycolyl bis(succinimidyl succinate). Dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiographic analysis of the 125I-MSA-labeled material in the presence of dithiothreitol reveals one single-labeled protein migrating with an apparent Mr = 255,000 regardless of the kind and concentration of cross-linker used. Electrophoresis in the absence of reductant indicates that the affinity-labeled species is not disulfide-linked to any other protein in the native plasma membrane, but contains internal disulfide bonds that compact its structure. The labeling of the Mr = 255,000 species increases with increasing concentrations of 125I-MSA between 0.3 and 3 nM. Labeling is abolished in a competitive manner by nonradioactive MSA but not by similar concentrations of insulin, proinsulin, or epidermal growth factor in all three tissues examined. The unique labeling of this Mr = 225,000 membrane component and its selective inhibition by MSA suggest that this protein is a plasma membrane receptor for MSA."

To identify the functional amino acid of the polypeptide, the activated residue was specifically labeled by the reductive cleavage of the intermediate with [3H]borohydride. Following acid hydrolysis, the reduced labeled derivative was found to be completely oxidizable by periodate with formation of [3H]formaldehyde, and was identified as ethanolamine by thin layer chromatography, electrophoresis, and amino acid analyzer chromatography. These results indicate that the activated amino acid residue of the polypeptide is COOH-terminal glycine."

https://openalex.org/W1515750629,"Escherichia coli NADPH-sulfite reductase is a complex hemoflavoprotein with an alpha 8 beta 4 subunit structure. The beta-subunits each contain one siroheme and a tetranuclear iron-sulfur center (Fe4S4). Isolated beta-monomers can catalyze the 6-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide. We have studied the beta-monomers with Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopy. The data show conclusively that the siroheme and the Fe4S4 cluster are strongly exchange-coupled. This is proven by the observations that (a) the two chromophores share a single electronic spin and (b) the addition of 1 electron to oxidized sulfite reductase changes the environments of 5 iron atoms. Spin-sharing is demonstrated in oxidized and 2-electron-reduced sulfite reductase and strongly implicated in 1-electron-reduced material. Thus, sulfite reductase provides the first example of an active site where a heme and an iron-sulfur cluster are closely linked as a functional unit, probably via a common bridging ligand."

https://openalex.org/W1499839066,"Antimycin, a specific and highly potent inhibitor of electron transfer in the cytochrome b-c1 segment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, does not inhibit reduction of cytochrome c1 by succinate in isolated succinate-cytochrome c reductase complex under conditions where the respiratory chain complex undergoes one oxidation-reduction turnover. If a slight molar excess of cytochrome c is added to the isolated reductase complex in the presence of antimycin, there is rapid reduction of one equivalent of c type cytochrome by succinate, after which reduction of the remaining c type cytochrome is inhibited. Antimycin fully inhibits succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity of isolated succinate-cytochrome c reductase complex in which the b-c1 complex undergoes multiple turnovers in a catalytic fashion. In addition, when antimycin is added to isolated reductase complex in the presence of cytochrome c plus cytochrome c oxidase, the inhibitor causes a crossover in the steady state level of reduction of the cytochromes b and c1 comparable to this classical effect in mitochondria. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that linear schemes of electron transfer are not adequate to account for the site of antimycin inhibition and the mechanism of electron transfer in the cytochrome b-c1 segment of the respiratory chain. The effects of antimycin are consistent with cyclic electron transfer mechanisms such as the protonmotive Q cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1553230471,"S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase from Escherichia coli is shown to require 2 divalent metal ions/enzyme subunit for maximal enzymatic activity. In the absence of substrate, the tetrameric enzyme binds 1 Mn(II) ion/subunit, whereas in the presence of a nucleotide substrate, adenylylimidodiphosphate, or the product pyrophosphate, there are two Mn(II)-binding sites/subunit. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of Mn(II) bound to the enzyme reveal a spin exchange interaction between 2 Mn(II) ions in complexes of enzyme and Mn(II) which also contain adenosylmethionine, K+, and either pyrophosphate or imidotriphosphate. Since a spin exchange interaction requires orbital overlap between the 2 ions, the metal ions must be bound close to one another, and they may share a common ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1553886309,"Arrhenius plots of 5'-nucleotidase activity in microsomes or plasma membranes from rat liver exhibited transitions at approximately 35 degrees C. The enzyme was purified from homogenates after solubilization in 2% Triton X-100 and 1% sodium deoxycholate. After the initial steps of the purification, the enzyme was recovered in membranes, as judged by both thin section and freeze-fracture electron microscopy, which contained sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. The purest fractions of 5'-nucleotidase were enriched approximate 3,000-fold, consisted of similar membranes, but only contained sphingomyelin. Thermal transitions were detected in Arrhenius plots of 5'-nucleotidase after detergent solubilization, in the membranes which contained the three phospholipids, but not in the purified fraction which contained only sphingomyelin; transitions were also detected after reassociation of the purified enzyme with microsomal or plasma membrane lipids and phosphatidylcholine but not with phosphatidylethanolamine. Phosphatidylcholines containing specific fatty acids all affected the energy of activation of 5'-nucleotidase, and the detergent Sarkosyl, which has been shown to dissociate phospholipids from 5'-nucleotidase (Evans, W. H., and Gurd, J. W. (1973) Biochem. J. 133, 189-199), caused a marked decrease in the stability of the enzyme to heating. Inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase by concanavalin A followed by reactivation with alpha-methyl-D-mannoside resulted in linear Arrhenius plots of 5'-nucleotidase activity in membrane fractions, and in lower transition temperatures for the detergent, solubilized enzyme. It is concluded that in situ, 5'-nucleotidase interacts with both sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine; the first apparently influences the stability of the enzyme and the second, the energy of activation. In addition, the lipid environment of the enzyme seems to be altered as a result of lectin binding."
https://openalex.org/W1516273831,"Abstract The gene 0.3 protein of bacteriophage T7 prevents the DNA restriction system of EScherichia coli from interfering with T7 infection. A mutant strain of T7 that greatly overproduces the 0.3 protein has been constructed and used for purification of this protein. The 0.3 protein ws found to be extremely acidic and can be separated from virtually all other proteins of the infected cell by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Residual contaminating proteins and nucleic acids can be removed by gel filtration, but an even simpler final purification is possible, because under appropriate conditions the 0.3 protein is soluble in high concentrations of ethanol. Thus, a simple, essentially two-step purification can produce about 50 mg of pure 0.3 protein from 30 liters of culture. The purified protein appears to be a dimer of identical subunits. AS expected from its known function during infection, the purified 0.3 protein inhibits the nuclease and ATPase activities of partially purified Eco B, the DNA restriction enzyme of E. coli B, but it does not interfere with several different type II endonucleases tested. The inhibition of Eco B appears to require stoichiometric rather than catalytic amounts of 0.3 protein."

https://openalex.org/W1573290603,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein encoded by gene 32 of bacteriophage T4 has been determined by manual and automated sequencing of peptides derived from cyanogen bromide cleavage and digestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and staphylococcal protease. Tryptic digestion of citraconylated or succinylated gene 32 protein yields five peptides containing 4, 27, 42, 65, and 163 residues, respectively, which can be separated by Sephadex chromatography. Each of these tryptic peptides was subjected to automated sequencing and, if necessary, more extensive cleavage. The gene 32 protein contains 301 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 33,487. Based on its primary structure, the gene 32 protein is predicted to contain 36% alpha helix, 18% beta sheet, and 46% random coil. The native protein can be specifically cleaved at lysine 21 and 253 by limited trypsin digestion. Previous studies have shown that the B region (residues 1 to 21) is essential for cooperative binding to single-stranded DNA. The A region (residues 254 to 301) has been implicated in controlling the helix-destabilizing activity of gene 32 protein and in interacting with other T4 DNA replication proteins. The A region has a net charge of -10 and, in addition, contains two unusual stretches of 4 serine residues separated by glycine 284. The region between positions 72 and 116 contains 6 of the 8 tyrosine residues in the protein and may be important for DNA binding."

https://openalex.org/W1627511965,"Following insulin addition to the medium of primary cultures of hepatocytes, the activity of glucokinase increased by 50% during the first 4 h, remained constant for an additional 2 to 3 h, and was followed by a second increase in activity. This biphasic increase in activity was a reflection of the amount of glucokinase enzyme protein present as measured by quantitative immunoprecipitation. The level of cGMP was found to increase sharply 6 h following the addition of insulin and just prior to the second phase of the increase in glucokinase activity. When hepatocytes were cultured in the absence of carbohydrates, only the initial phase of the increase in enzyme activity in response to insulin was observed, and no increase in the level of cGMP was found. However, the addition of 8-bromo-cGMP to the culture medium at 6 h or later could restore the second increase in activity. The addition to the medium of glucose, fructose, pyruvate, or lactate enhanced the insulin-induced increase in glucokinase, but only fructose, pyruvate, and lactate increased the activity of the enzyme in the absence of insulin. When the phosphorylation of hexoses was blocked by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to the culture medium, an intermediate level of glucokinase activity was observed in response to insulin. The full response was restored by the inclusion of 8-bromo-cGMP in the medium. Both phases of the increase in glucokinase activity were inhibited by cycloheximide, whereas the addition to the culture medium of cordycepin or actinomycin D prevented only the initial increase in activity and not the second increase, which arose from the addition of 8-bromo-cGMP to the cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1534126997,A pool of random wild type yeast DNA fragments obtained by partial Sau IIIA restriction enzyme digestion and inserted in the Bam HI site of the hybrid yeast Escherichia coli plasmid ((pFL1) has been used to transform to prototrophy a methionyl-tRNA synthetase-impaired mutant requiring methionine. In the numerous prototroph strains recovered at least two independent clones have been obtained which show nonchromosomic inheritance character and an approximately 30-fold increase in methionyl-tRNA synthetase activity as compared to the wild type. Measurement of the Km for methionine in the transformed yeast cells indicates that the activity has been restored by decreasing the Km for methionine to the same level as found for the wild type methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Southern blotting experiments show that the yeast DNA's fragments inserted in the two independent plasmids share a common sequence which must correspond at least partly to the structural gene for methionyl-tRNA synthetase. They also suggest that the methionyl-tRNA synthetase gene is differently orientated in the two plasmids
https://openalex.org/W1546360136,"Glucagon caused a 2-2.5-fold increase in 86Rb+ (a K+ tracer) uptake in primary monolayers of rat hepatocytes. Removal of the hormone led to a slow reversal of the effect over a period of hours. Glucagon acted by increasing the maximum velocity of influx. Ouabain inhibited Rb+ uptake in both hormone-induced and control cells by 85-90%. Hormone stimulation and ouabain inhibition did not affect exit. The induction by glucagon required 3-4 h for full expression and was dependent on protein synthesis and changes in cAMP. Half-maximum stimulation occurred at a concentration of 0.4 nM of the hormone. The ionophores monensin and gramicidin, which lead to Na+ influx, stimulated ouabain-sensitive Rb+ transport. This suggested that the (Na,K)-pump rate is limited by the internal Na+ concentration in both glucagon-stimulated and control cells."

https://openalex.org/W1532273809,"The ESR spectra of the free radicals formed by the autoxidation of serotonin, 5-hydroxyindole, and 5-hydroxytryptophan in 1 N NaOH are presented. The analysis of the hyperfine splitting constants in H2O and D2O characterize these free radicals as semiquinone-imines, the one-electron oxidation product of the corresponding indole. At alkaline pH, autoxidation of these compounds ultimately leads to solid precipitate and unresolved ESR spectra characteristic of polymeric material. The reduction of cytochrome c at pH 7.4 by a wide variety of indoles correlates with the amplitude of the ESR signal in 1 N NaOH, as do other processes thought to be related to 5-hydroxyindole free radical formation. Relative to the rate of cytochrome c reduction, neither serotonin nor the serotonin free radical appears to react with oxygen to form superoxide. In the presence of NAD(P)H, the serotonin radical most probably oxidizes NAD(P)H to form the NAD(P). radical. The NAD(P). radical then reacts with oxygen to form superoxide, which ultimately reduces cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1572420301,"The site of the reaction between horse heart ferrocytochrome c and ferricyanide was investigated by measuring the reaction rate of cytochrome c derivatives specifically modified at single lysine residues to form trifluoroacetyl or trifluoromethylphenylcarbamyl amino groups. Cytochrome c derivatives singly modified at lysines 8, 13, 25, 27, 72, 79, and 87 surrounding the heme crevice had rate constants decreased from that of native cytochrome c by factors of 1.29, 2.03, 1.12, 1.35, 1.46, 1.29, and 1.19, respectively. Modification of a given lysine with the bulky trifluoromethylphenylcarbamyl group caused nearly the same decrease in reaction rate as modification with the trifluoroacetyl group, indicating that the effect was due to removal of an electrostatic interaction between the protonated lysine amino group and ferricyanide. Modification of lysines 22, 55, 99, and 100 at the right side, bottom, and back of cytochrome c had no effect on the reaction rate. These results indicate that the reaction site is located at the exposed edge of the heme and that the electrostatic interaction between ferricyanide and cytochrome c is dominated by the lysine amino groups surrounding the heme crevice, which include lysine 86, in addition to the ones listed above. We have used the specific lysine modification results to estimate the contribution of each lysine amino group to the electrostatic interaction and have developed a semiempirical relation for the total electrostatic interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1523148131,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphatase has been purified from the rat epididymal fat pad. The phosphatase occurs in a complex with the carboxylase. In the purification of the phosphatase, the high molecular weight complex was initially separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and the phosphatase was isolated from the complex by adjusting to 80% saturation with ethanol and by chromatography on Sephadex G-75. The molecular weight of the phosphatase is 71,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and gel chromatography on Sephacryl-200 in the presence of 6 M urea. The Km for acetyl-CoA carboxylase and glycogen phosphorylase a are 1.5 microM and 37 microM, respectively. The phosphatase has a broad substrate specificity, being active toward glycogen synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, phosphorylase a, phosphoprotamine, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate, in addition to acetyl-CoA carboxylase from fat tissue and liver. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibits the dephosphorylation of phosphoprotamine, indicating that the same activity is responsible for dephosphorylating both substrates. The phosphatase requires no metal ion for activity and is not inhibited by the rat liver phosphorylase phosphatase inhibitor protein. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and the phosphatase is compared to other phosphoprotein phosphatases."

The inhibition reflects decreased affinity of receptors for opioid ligands. Whereas in membranes, only opioid agonist binding is sensitive to guanine nucleotide inhibition, both agonist and antagonist binding is reduced in the case of soluble receptors. Furthermore, soluble receptors are more sensitive to the effects of guanine nucleotides than are membrane-bound receptors. These observations are consistent with the suggestion that solubilized receptors may be complexes of an opiate binding protein and a guanine nucleotide-sensitive regulatory component."
https://openalex.org/W1602909948,"Interaction of cGMP-dependent protein kinase with histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, or poly(L-arginine) resulted in changes in enzyme conformation such that inactivation of cGMP binding and activation of basal catalytic activity (assayed without cGMP) occurred. Total kinase activity as determined by phosphorylation of exogenous substrates subsequently decreased, but autophosphorylation of the enzyme was enhanced. The reaction was specific for nucleosome core histones and poly(L-arginine); H1, troponin, and poly(L-lysine) had no effect. Inactivation of cyclic nucleotide binding sites followed pseudo-first order kinetics and, at various histone concentrations, exhibited saturation kinetics at low ionic strength (2 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8), but non-saturation kinetics at higher ionic strength (37.5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 12.5 mM MgCl2). Saturation kinetics was observed with poly(L-arginine) at both low and high ionic strength. Kinetic parameters measured under saturation conditions were determined for each core histone and poly(L-arginine). Core histones and poly(L-arginine) were noncompetitive inhibitors of cGMP binding; core histones and poly(L-arginine) interacted competitively at an enzyme site designated as the poly(L-arginine) binding site. Regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase contain a similar poly(L-arginine) binding site. Modulator proteins bind to poly(L-arginine) or arginyl residues in histone to prevent interaction with the poly(L-arginine) binding site on the enzymes. Through this mechanism, modulator proteins maintain cyclic nucleotide dependency and full enzyme activity."

https://openalex.org/W1600197857,"This study was initiated to determine whether glycogen phosphorylase activation was defective in hearts of alloxan diabetic rats. When hearts were perfused by gravity flow for 1 to 10 min with various concentrations of epinephrine, activation of glycogen phosphorylase in the diabetic was significantly greater at every time and epinephrine concentration than that seen in the normal. Cyclic AMP accumulation and protein kinase activation by epinephrine in the diabetic were not appreciably different or were lower than the normal responses to the hormone. The effects of epinephrine on cAMP and protein kinase were blocked in both normal and diabetic hearts by propranolol. While the beta blocker prevented phosphorylase activation in the normal hearts, it did not block phosphorylase activation by epinephrine in the diabetic hearts. Likewise, the alpha agonist phenylephrine activated phosphorylase in the diabetic but not in the normal hearts. While glucagon produced the same phosphorylase hypersensitivity in diabetic hearts, the cAMP and protein kinase responses were not altered by diabetes. Phosphorylase phosphatase activity was found to be unaltered by either epinephrine or diabetes, whereas phosphorylase kinase activation by epinephrine in the diabetic was double the normal response. These data are consistent with a diabetes-related unmasking of an alpha effect on cardiac phosphorylase activation and an unexplained increase in the sensitivity of phosphorylase kinase activation by protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1541322922,"Abstract The Ca2+-dependent regulator protein (CDR), also frequently termed was determined to influence the dephosphorylation of mixed calf thymus histones or purified histones 1, 2A, or 2B by a partially purified bovine brain phosphoprotein phosphatase. CDR increase the rate of dephosphorylation of mixed histones more than 20-fold. With increasing concentrations of mixed histones as substrate, a proportionate increase of CDR concentration was required to maintain maximal expression of histone phosphatase activity. Mixed histones suppressed the activation by CDR of a bovine brain cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity, with activation being restored by increased quantities of CDR. Dephosphorylation of casein and phosphorylase alpha by the phosphatase preparation was not affected by CDR. These observations support the interpretation that the effects of CDR on histone dephosphorylation are substrate-directed. The rates of dephosphorylation of histones 1, 2A, and 2B by the phosphatase were 4- to 12-fold more rapid at low (sub-micromolar) concentrations of free Ca2+ than at high (200 microM) Ca2+ in incubations containing CDR, but they were unaffected by Ca2+ in incubations without CDR. The addition of stoichiometric quantities of calmodulin increased the apparent Km of the phosphatase for the various histones 2- to 6-fold, while maximal velocities were 4- to 12-fold higher at low than at high added Ca2+. The inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on histone dephosphorylation was immediately reversible by chelation of Ca2+ with EDTA. Ca2+-dependent inhibition of histone 1 or 2B phosphatase activities was also produced by rabbit skeletal muscle troponin C, but not by rabbit skeletal muscle parvalbumin, by poly(L-aspartate) or poly(L-glutamate). The phosphorylated fragment from the NH2-terminal region of either H2A (generated by treatment with N-bromosuccinimide) or H2B (generated by treatment with cyanogen bromide) was dephosphorylated by the phosphatase, with the rates of dephosphorylation being reduced 3- to 6-fold by Ca2+ in incubations containing CDR."
https://openalex.org/W1553818986,"Abstract The guanylyl imidodiphosphate-activated state of turkey erythrocyte cyclase can be reversed to the basal state by the simultaneous action of beta-agonists and GTP. The rate of reversal diminishes progressively with decreasing concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors on the membrane surface, whereas the extent of reversal is always maximal. The rate of reversal is found to be linearly dependent on the concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors within the membranes. This result supports the notion that the interaction of the enzyme unit and the beta-adrenergic receptor is catalytic and therefore of the collision coupling type. The dependence of the rate of reversal reaction on epinephrine concentration is noncooperative with an apparent dissociation constant of KD = 3.0 X 10(-6) M. The fraction of guanylyl imidodiphosphate-activated cyclase system which can be reversed by GTP and a beta-agonist strongly depends on temperature and reveals a sharp transition at 24 degrees C which is the freezing temperature of the inner monolayer. It is suggested that the GTP regulatory unit is inactive when the inner monolayer is frozen."
https://openalex.org/W1504543595,"A tetranuclear ferredoxin from Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa [4Fe-4S](+2,+3) has been examined by electron paramagnetic resonance techniques. The temperature-dependence and relaxation characteristics of the spectral lines indicate that the spin-lattice interaction is described at low temperatures by a T2 law which gives way to a T9 Raman relaxation as the temperature is raised. At higher temperatures an Orbach process becomes dominant. In the presence of dysprosium complexes the relaxation and line widths are modified. From crystallographic structure determinations of similar proteins we are able to relate the dysprosium effects to the spatial separation between the complex and the tetranuclear cluster. This scale is then tested against a ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum which contains two tetranuclear clusters, [4Fe-4S](+1,+2). We find that for these soluble iron-sulfur proteins the dysprosium complexes form a shell at the protein surface. The magnetic interaction between the clusters and the complexes altering the relaxation time goes as r-6, while the low temperature line broadening is described by an r-3 dipole interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1516509282,"The reaction between ferric Pseudomonas cytochrome c peroxidase and reduced azurin was investigated by static titration, rapid scan, and stopped flow techniques as well as circular dichroism measurements. Kinetics of the reduction of the enzyme under pseudo-first order conditions reveals a biphasic logarithmic curve indicating that the reaction between enzyme and azurin is complex and comprises of two reactions, one rapid and a slower one. The relative portion of the fast phase from the overall reaction increases with increasing azurin concentration. Kinetic results can be explained by postulating the presence of two different enzyme forms which are slowly interconvertible. Both enzymatic forms form a complex with reduced azurin. The electron transfer between proteins occurs within the molecular complex of azurin and the peroxidase."

https://openalex.org/W1533592451,"Ten-nm filaments have been isolated from control and colchicine-treated primary cultures of rat ovarian granulosa cells. Negative stain electron microscopy indicates an average filament diameter of 10.3 nm in the isolated fiber bundles, which, upon sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, are found to contain a major polypeptide with a molecular weight of 57,000 and several minor components including actin. One-dimensional peptide mapping and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrate similarity between the granulosa cell and baby hamster kidney cell 10-nm filament subunit protein, both of which are distinguishable from keratin, desmin, actin, and tubulin. Quantitative gel densitometry experiments demonstrate little difference in the total amount of the 10-nm filament protein in control cells or cells treated with colchicine, accounting for 12 or 15% of the total cellular protein, respectively. The purification procedure, which involves extraction in Triton X-100 and KCl followed by DNase I treatment, yields 709% of the total granulosa cell intermediate filament protein, and 70% of the newly synthesized 57,000 molecular weight component. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of cultures labeled with [32P]phosphate show by autoradiography that the 57,000-dalton polypeptide, actin, and a 130,000-dalton protein are the most readily phosphorylated polypeptides in granulosa cell cultures. These studies identify the major intermediate filament subunit protein of granulosa cells as a 57,000-dalton phosphorylatable polypeptide which comprises a substantial portion of the granulosa cell cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1550211825,"Abstract An endodeoxyribonuclease has been purified from nuclei of bovine small intestinal mucosa to a homogeneous state by a procedure involving affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose. The endonuclease, which was found to be bound to chromatin, has a pH optimum of 5.4. It requires Mn2+ or Co2+ for activity and its maximum activity with Mg2+ is about 80% of that with Mn2+. Its activity is strongly inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking agents, and by ethidium bromide. The enzyme does not attack RNA and is inhibited by it. Its isoelectric point is 8.5 +/- 0.1, and its molecular weight is 49,000 +/- 3,000, determined by sucrose gradient sedimentation and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that the enzyme is composed of two nonidentical subunits with molecular weights of 30,000 and 23,000. The enzyme catalyzes the endonucleolytic cleavage of circular duplex ColE1 DNA via single strand scissions from the initial stage of degradation. The average size of the limit products of native phage T7 or ColE1 DNA is about 2,000 to 1,500 base pairs, estimated by neutral sucrose gradient sedimentation or agarose gel electrophoresis. The enzyme degrades denatured DNA about 20 times faster than native DNA. The products contain 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl termini, and all four deoxymononucleotides are present in almost equal amounts at the 5'-termini."
https://openalex.org/W1591680773,"We have developed a rapid autoradiographic colony assay for detecting mutants with elevated levels of certain biosynthetic enzymes. Four Escherichia coli strains in which the specific activity of the membrane enzyme diglyceride kinase is increased 5-10-fold have been obtained with this approach. The mutant kinase has the same thermal denaturation profile and subcellular localization as the wild type. Five other membrane enzymes involved in phospholipid bilayer assembly are unaffected. In one of these strains (GK-1) the mutation (dgkR-1) responsible for the elevated kinase has been mapped at a new site near minute 92, while the previously identified structural gene (dgk) lies near minute 90. When the structural gene for the kinase (dgk) is cloned on a multi-copy vector-like ColE1, the kinase can be overproduced 5-10-fold on the basis of gene dosage (Lightner, V. A., Larson, T. J., Tailleur, P., Kantor, G. D., Raetz, C. R. H., Bell, R. M., and Modrich, P. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9413-9420). Introduction of such hybrid plasmids into a mutant harboring dgkR-1 leads to a multiplicative (rather than additive) effect, resulting in specific activities of diglyceride kinase that are 35-75-fold higher than normal. These results show that dgkR-1 is a trans-acting mutation and suggest the existence of novel regulatory proteins (or metabolites) that direct the expression of certain membrane enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1606769590,"Kinetic data for the reversible folding and unfolding by urea of horse heart ferricytochrome c, in 0.05 M phosphate + 0.25 M Na2SO4 buffer, pH 7.0, in the region of the main denaturation transition, 4-9 M, are reported. Stopped flow technique and absorptivity at 695, 528, and 361 nm as the monitoring probes were used. The decay profiles in the region of the transition 6-7.2 M urea are adequately described by a rate law with two exponential decay terms, but a rate law with only a single term is found to be applicable at the lower and higher limits of the transition. The apparent rate constant for the fast phase exhibits urea dependence with a minimum value at about 6.5 M urea, while the apparent rate constant of the slow phase is found to be independent of urea and has a value of 0.04 +/- 0.02 s-1. The assignment of the two apparent rate constants to the respective steps and the characterization of the processes involved were carried out through correlation of the kinetic data to the results from equilibrium studies for urea denaturation ( Myer, Y. P., MacDonald, L. H., Verma, B. C., and Pande, A. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 199-207). A mechanism X1 in equilibrium X2 in equilibrium D, where the first step is the urea-dependent unfolding and folding, and the second, an apparent urea-independent process involving possibly reorganization of the unfolded form X2, has been proposed to account for the above findings. The X2 in equilibrium D process is further considered in light of various possibilities: the incorrect folding of the unfolded form, the alteration of heme iron coordination, and the cis-trans isomerization of proline."
https://openalex.org/W1587998140,"Using RNA-directed synthesis of the alpha-peptide of beta-galactosidase as an assay, a factor was purified that inactivated further function of the mRNA. In the presence of Ca2+ ions to inhibit most nuclease activity, inactivation of mRNA occurred during incubation with ribosomes or with a 1 M KCl wash of ribosomes. The inactivation activity required Mg2+ ions, and purified as a single factor which did not bind to DEAE-cellulose, but bound reversibly to phosphocellulose. The factor eluted from Sephadex G-150 with an apparent molecular weight of about 43,000. Purified 700-fold, it showed no detectable exonuclease activity, and little or no cleavage of a variety of single-stranded substrates, including full length lac operon mRNA; but repurified inactivated mRNA was still inactive for protein synthesis. The factor did not inhibit poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. When proteins isolated from the ribosomal wash were individually tested, highly purified RNase III, which purifies in the same way and has the same size, also inactivated lac mRNA. The ribosomal wash from an RNase III- strain showed little if any activity compared to that from an isogenic RNase III+ strain. The possibility of a site-specific inactivating cleavage of mRNA by RNase III at or near the 5' end is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1590549804,"As part of our investigations on the relationship between DNA structure and gene regulation, a 352-base pair Hae III fragment was cloned containing the leftward operator-promoter (PL) region of bacteriophage lambda. This was accomplished without the aid of a phenotypic assay for the cloned fragment. A Hae III digest of a segment of the lambda genome was first fractionated by RPC-5 column chromatography. The partially purified PL fragment was then ligated into the Eco RI site of the pBR322 plasmid vector and cloned into the recBC+ Escherichia coli host C600(R-M-) using a technique that converts the Hae III ends of the fragment into Eco RI sites. Similar cloning attempts into a recBC- host (C600-SF8) were unsuccessful. The cloned fragment has the PL promoter oriented toward the tetracycline resistance genes of the vector, and is isolated from the plasmid (pRW601) by digestion with Eco RI followed by sucrose gradient sedimentation. The fragment was identified as PL by restriction mapping, repressor binding, sequencing, and promoter location. The now complete sequence of this fragment, part of which was known previously, reveals a large A/T-rich region immediately adjacent to the PL promoter. We have generated deletions in this region in order to study the influence of this sequence on promoter function."
https://openalex.org/W1481269322,"NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acid sequences of the Eco RI restriction and modification enzymes have been determined. The results allow localization of the coding regions within the DNA segment which controls activity of both enzymes. Processing of the endonuclease is limited to removal of NH2-terminal formylmethionine whereas, in the case of the methylase, formylMet-Ala is removed."
https://openalex.org/W1489713073,"(Na+ + K+)-stimulated ATPase was purified from dog kidney and its catalytic and glycoprotein subunits were separated. The enzymatic activity of the ATPase was totally inhibited by ouabain and partially inhibited by cesalin, maromomycin, concanavalin A, and wheat germ agglutinin. The inhibitions by cesalin or macromomycin can be reversed by the addition of phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylserine, but not phosphatidylcholine. The specific binding of 125I-cesalin to the enzyme was inhibited by concanavalin A, wheat germ agglutinin, macromomycin, and the antibodies prepared in rabbits against the holoenzyme and the glycoprotein subunit, but not by ouabain, simple sugars, or the antibody against the catalytic subunit. It is proposed that the antitumor activities of cesalin and macromomycin are initiated in part by their binding to the glycoprotein subunit of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1492630846,"We have measured the temperature and frequency dependence of solvent proton magnetic relaxation rates in solutions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome oxidase (EC 1.9.3.2) in its native low spin oxidized, its reduced, and its carbonyl reduced derivative. In solutions of the native oxidized enzyme, a large paramagnetic enhancement of the proton NMR relaxation rates, propagated to the solvent by the fast exchange mechanism, is observed. The ratio (T1/T2)pmg = 1.25 +/- 0.10 at 24 MHz demonstrates that dipole-dipole interaction of the neighboring paramagnets is the dominant relaxation mechanism. Measurements of proton relaxation in solutions of cytochrome oxidase from which the hemes D have been extracted demonstrates that hemes C do not contribute to the observed paramagnetic effects. The electron spin relaxation time of the ferric hemes D of 3.2 +/- 0.4 ns is calculated from the frequency dispersion data. This is the longest value reported for hemoprotein solutions so far. These features of a low spin ferric hemoprotein are similar to those found recently both for the microbial and for the microsomal cytochrome P-450. The calculated distances between the exchanging proton(s) and heme D iron ions demonstrate the high accessibility of the environment of heme D from the solvent side, also for molecules not penetrating the inner coordination sphere."
