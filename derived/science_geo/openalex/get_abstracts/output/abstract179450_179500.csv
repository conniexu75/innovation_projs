https://openalex.org/W2117936709,"Anopheles gambiae is the principal vector of malaria, a disease that afflicts more than 500 million people and causes more than 1 million deaths each year. Tenfold shotgun sequence coverage was obtained from the PEST strain of A. gambiae and assembled into scaffolds that span 278 million base pairs. A total of 91% of the genome was organized in 303 scaffolds; the largest scaffold was 23.1 million base pairs. There was substantial genetic variation within this strain, and the apparent existence of two haplotypes of approximately equal frequency (“dual haplotypes”) in a substantial fraction of the genome likely reflects the outbred nature of the PEST strain. The sequence produced a conservative inference of more than 400,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms that showed a markedly bimodal density distribution. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed strong evidence for about 14,000 protein-encoding transcripts. Prominent expansions in specific families of proteins likely involved in cell adhesion and immunity were noted. An expressed sequence tag analysis of genes regulated by blood feeding provided insights into the physiological adaptations of a hematophagous insect."
https://openalex.org/W1963857381,"Peripheral inflammation induces p38 MAPK activation in the soma of C fiber nociceptors in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after 24 hr. Inflammation also increases protein, but not mRNA levels, of the heat-gated ion channel TRPV1 (VR1) in these cells, which is then transported to peripheral but not central C fiber terminals. Inhibiting p38 activation in the DRG reduces the increase in TRPV1 in the DRG and inflamed skin and diminishes inflammation-induced heat hypersensitivity without affecting inflammatory swelling or basal pain sensitivity. p38 activation in the DRG is secondary to peripheral production of NGF during inflammation and is required for NGF-induced increases in TRPV1. The activation of p38 in the DRG following retrograde NGF transport, by increasing TRPV1 levels in nociceptor peripheral terminals in a transcription-independent fashion, contributes to the maintenance of inflammatory heat hypersensitivity."

Supporting evidence is obtained from the observation of a nonlinear threshold behavior in the pump-intensity dependence of the emission, a polariton-like dispersion relation above threshold, and a decrease of the relaxation time into the lower polariton state. The condensation of microcavity exciton polaritons is confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W2037350416,"Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance is a major cause of worldwide increases in malaria mortality and morbidity. Recent laboratory and clinical studies have associated chloroquine resistance with point mutations in the gene pfcrt . However, direct proof of a causal relationship has remained elusive and most models have posited a multigenic basis of resistance. Here, we provide conclusive evidence that mutant haplotypes of the pfcrt gene product of Asian, African, or South American origin confer chloroquine resistance with characteristic verapamil reversibility and reduced chloroquine accumulation. pfcrt mutations increased susceptibility to artemisinin and quinine and minimally affected amodiaquine activity; hence, these antimalarials warrant further investigation as agents to control chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria."

These results strongly indicate that CL plays a central role in higher order organization of components of the respiratory chain of mitochondria. Broader understanding of how lipid-protein interactions determine protein structure and function is increasing. Recent crystallographic results of multimeric membrane-associated complexes have revealed lipids inserted between the protein subunits (1Essen L. Siegert R. Lehmann W.D. Oesterhelt D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11673-11678Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 2McAuley K.E. Fyfe P.K. Ridge J.P. Isaacs N.W. Cogdell R.J. Jones M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14706-14711Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Even monomeric proteins such as OmpF of Escherichia coli show outer membrane-specific lipid A molecules in the crystal structure (3Ferguson A.D. Welte W. Hofmann E. Lindner B. Holst O. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 585-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The highly ordered state of these lipids necessary for their resolution supports a role for specific and tight association of defined lipid species with membrane proteins. Considerable evidence also supports the organization of the respiratory chain in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes into “respirasomes” or supercomplexes made up of smaller multimeric complexes (4Schagger H. Crit. Rev. 2001; 52: 119-128Google Scholar). For oxidative phosphorylation, such supercomplexes may provide added efficiency by eliminating the need for diffusion of substrates and products between individual complexes and provide a means for channeling intermediates between individual complexes. What role does the lipid environment play in supporting supercomplex formation? Are there specific protein-lipid interactions involved or is the collective property of the membrane responsible for higher order complex formation? In 1974, Skulachev (5Mikel'saar K. Severina I.I. Skulachev V.P. Usp. Sovrem. Biol. (in Russian). 1974; 78: 348-370PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that cardiolipin (CL) 1The abbreviations used are: CL, cardiolipin; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; Cox2p, subunit 2 of cytochromec oxidase complex; Cobp, b component of cytochrome bc 1 complex; BN, blue native might participate in linking together components of the respiratory chain. CL is a minor phospholipid with distribution limited to bacterial cytoplasmic membranes and to the inner membrane of mitochondria where energy transducing oxidative processes of cells are centered. Structured CL is associated with theb subunit of the cytochrome bc 1complex (complex III) in yeast (6Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Complex III is a homodimer of 10 different subunits in yeast and 11 subunits in mammalian cells (7Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (514) Google Scholar). When CL was removed from mammalian complex III, structure was perturbed and the complex lost all function (8Gomez Jr., B. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9031-9038Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Only CL and its immediate metabolic precursor phosphatidylglycerol (PG) restored activity to the resolved complex. Although PG restored full activity, the affinity of the multiple subunits for each other was diminished. Similarly, mammalian cytochrome c oxidase complex (complex IV) contains tightly bound CL that when removed results in loss of structure and function (9Sedlak E. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14966-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In yeast and mammalian cells complexes III and IV form a supercomplex composed of a heterodimer of individual homodimers that remains intact after detergent solubilization (10Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 11Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Here we show that both complex III and IV in CL-lacking yeast mutants do not associate to form a supercomplex under conditions of analysis where such a supercomplex is observed in extracts from wild type cells (10Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 11Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The amount of such a supercomplex is dependent on the CL content of the mitochondria and is reflected in the growth properties of the cells on a non-fermentable carbon source. These results strongly suggest that CL plays a specific role in supporting a critical interaction between complexes III and IV in vivo that cannot be substituted by the elevated levels of PG in the mutant. YPH500 (ade2–101, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, lys2–801, trp1Δ63, ura3–52, MATα) (12Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as wild type strain in this study. YZD2 (ade2–101, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, lys2–801, trp1Δ63, ura3–52, crd1Δ::HIS3, MATα), with the entire CRD1(encodes CL synthase) open reading frame disrupted, was constructed by homologous recombination with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product of HIS3 gene flanked by 5′ and 3′ regions that lie outside of the CRD1 gene coding sequence. Amplification was accomplished from plasmid pRS303 (12Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with primers 5′-ATCGGGAGTATACAATATTTACAATTGAAAAAATATAGAAAGGAGGCAATTGAGAAACAAGCAGGCCTGGTAGCATAGTTTGGTCCCtgatgcggtattttctccttacg-3′ and 5′-GTTGATTTAGTGTATTTTCCACTACATAAAAACTAAAAAACATTCAAAATGAAAAGTCAGGACCCTTTTCAAAAAGGATCGCAATTAatgcggcatcagagcagattgta-3′ (homology regions flanking CRD1 are in capital letters, and HIS3 homology regions are in lowercase letters). Yeast transformation experiments were done using the Alkali-CationTM yeast transformation kit (Bio 101, Inc.). ACRD1 null derivative (crd1Δ) of YPH500 was selected on histidine dropout minimal medium glucose plates (13Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Genomic PCR with three sets of primers (external CRD1 and internal HIS3, internal HIS3 and externalCRD1, two primers external to CRD1) confirmed the disruption. The doxycycline-regulated plasmid, pYMZ1 (CEN4, ARS1, URA3,CMVp/tetR-VP16,tetO-CYC1p/CRD1/ADH-1t), was constructed as follows. The CRD1 gene was isolated by PCR amplification of DNA prepared from plasmid pYCLS10-1 (14Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with primers 5′-ataggatcc ATGATTCAAATGGTGCCC-3′ and 5′-atactgcag CTATTTTAAAAGTTTAAAAGCG-3′ (CRD1 homology regions are capitalized, start and stop codons are in boldface, and the BamHI and PstI sites are in italics). An 852-bp fragment was cut with BamHI and PstI and ligated into plasmid pCM189 (15Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) behind the tetracycline-regulated promoter. DNA was amplified and verified by DNA sequencing of the junction points of the new plasmid. Yeast spheroplast transformations were accomplished as mentioned above. Transformants were selected on yeast nitrogen base uracil dropout medium containing glucose (13Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). YZD2/pYMZ1 was maintained on YPEG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1% ethanol, and 3% glycerol) medium (13Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) in the absence of doxycycline (derepression conditions). Phospholipid composition analyses were performed as described previously (16Ostrander D.B. Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Rho M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25262-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pregrown overnight at 30 °C in either complete synthetic defined media with 1% ethanol and 3% glycerol (13Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) or in YPEG. For doxycycline-regulated cells, the overnight culture was supplemented with 10 μg/ml of doxycycline (near complete repressed conditions). Cells were diluted into the same growth medium as the overnight cultures but supplemented with [32P]Pi (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) at 10 μCi/ml and the indicated doxycycline concentration. Cultures were grown for four to five generations at 30 °C to constant radio specific activity and harvested during exponential phase of growth. Isolated phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography using HPTLC Silica Gel 60 plates (Whatman) impregnated with boric acid and chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65/28/8) as solvent (17Fine J.B. Sprecher H. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 660-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-migration with standard phospholipids (Sigma) was used to identify individual spots. Phospholipids were quantified by phosphor imaging using a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the total amount of organic soluble [32P]Pidisplayed after separation. Phospholipid composition is expressed as mole % of each lipid species with correction for 2 mol of phosphate/mol of CL. Crude mitochondria were prepared from cells in exponential phase of growth after spheroplast formation using zymolyase (16Ostrander D.B. Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Rho M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25262-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Sample preparation and BN-PAGE was carried out essentially as previously described (10Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria (200 μg of protein) were solubilized in 40 μl digitonin buffer (1% (w/v) digitonin, 50 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml α2-macroglobulin, 0.1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem)). After solubilization, samples were centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min (TLA100.3 rotor, Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge). 4 μl of sample buffer (5% (w/v) Serva Blue G (Serva) in 500 mmaminocaproic acid) were added prior to electrophoresis using a 4–8% gradient of polyacrylamide. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets for Western blot analysis and specifically located using monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) specific for Cox2p (cytochromec oxidase (complex IV) subunit 2) or polyclonal antibody (Gottfried Schatz, Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland) specific for Cobp (cytochrome b subunit of complex III). Final detection was with secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and a Bio-Rad FX for quantification. High molecular weight markers from Amersham Biosciences were used as standards. Respiratory activity of isolated mitochondria was measured with a Clark oxygen electrode using NADH or ascorbate plus diaminoduren (cytochrome c oxidase activity) as substrate in the presence of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (14Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Protein was measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. A “biological reagent” was developed in which the CL content of yeast mitochondria could be regulated in vivo. A low copy “tet-off” plasmid system, pYMZ1, was employed to afford exogenous regulation of a plasmid copy of the CRD1 gene in a crd1Δ background (YZD2). In this system exogenous addition of the repressor doxycycline to the growth medium showed a dose-dependent reduction of CL levels with a parallel increase in PG levels (Fig.1). Although fully repressed or derepressed levels of CL did not reach that observed in acrd1Δ or CRD1 strain, respectively, the use of the regulated system plus these latter two strains afforded a complete range of CL levels. As expected, the only lipid that increased in a dose dependent manner was PG, the immediate precursor to CL. The steady state levels of other phospholipids were not significantly changed by either mutation or doxycycline levels supporting a specific effect on mitochondrial phospholipid composition. Since doxycycline is not metabolized by or has no known regulatory effects in yeast, this system is superior to uncover effects directly related to specific gene expression. Use of natural regulated promoters in yeast results in large unrelated changes in cell metabolism when switching between metabolizable regulatory molecules. CRD1 cells grew considerably faster and to a higher final A 600 than crd1Δ cells (Fig. 2) as has been observed previously (18Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Doxycycline had no effect on the growth properties ofCRD1 cells, and YZD2/pYMZ1 cells in the absence of doxycycline grew as well as wild type cells consistent with a near wild type CL content. However, YZD2/pYMZ1 in the presence of doxycycline (10 μg per ml) displayed growth properties intermediate between wild type and crd1Δ cells consistent with its intermediate CL content (0.8 mol %). YZD2/pYMZ1 cells grown in decreasing levels of doxycycline showed increasing growth rate and finalA 600 (data not shown). Direct cell count reflected the A 600 measurements in all cases. Mitochondria isolated from both CRD1 and crd1Δ cells had similar rates of NADH oxidation as well as similar cytochromec oxidase activity consistent with previous results (14Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,20Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M., Gu, Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). As expected digitonin extracts of mitochondria isolated fromCRD1 cells subjected to BN-PAGE showed exclusively supercomplex formation (∼1000 kDa) between complex IV (Fig.3 A, lane 3) and complex III (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) as detected by antibody specific for Cox2p and Cobp, respectively. Previous reports (10Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 11Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cells grown on non-fermentable carbon sources displayed almost exclusively a supercomplex composed of a heterodimer containing one homodimer each of complex III and complex IV. On the other hand, extracts of mitochondria from crd1Δ cells displayed primarily molecular species of much smaller apparent molecule size that reacted uniquely with antibody specific for a component of either complex IV (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) or complex III (Fig. 3B, lane 1). The mobilities of these smaller species are consistent with those of a homodimer of complex IV (440 kDa) or a homodimer of complex III (600 kDa) (10Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), respectively. No antibody-specific material was detected below the 443-kDa molecular mass standard indicating the absence of monomers of complexes III and IV. Quantification of Western blots from several experiments showed 90% of complexes III and IV as individual homodimers and not organized into a supercomplex. Therefore, the affinity of complex III and complex IV for each other is dramatically reduced when these complexes are assembled in cells containing PG in place of CL. Growth of YZD2/pYMZ1 cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml doxycycline (0.8 mol % CL) resulted in a mixture of individual homodimers of complex III (Fig. 3 B, lane 2), individual homodimers of complex IV (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), and supercomplex. Supercomplex represented 67 or 70% of the Cobp- or Cox2p-specific signal, respectively. Growth of YZD2/pYMZ1 cells in the absence of doxycycline (2 mol % CL) resulted in only supercomplex formation (not shown). Therefore, the observation of a supercomplex made up of homodimers of complexes III and IV is highly dependent on CL in a dose-dependent manner. We report here a useful biological reagent to uncover potential involvement of the mitochondrial-localized anionic phospholipid CL in cell function. The ability to regulate CL content of the mitochondria affords an opportunity to correlate phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner with the level of CL to more strongly support an involvement of CL in a particular cellular process. A parallel increase in the level of PG cannot be prevented, but in vitro experiments can be used to differentiate a role for CLversus PG. No other phospholipids were significantly affected by either regulation or elimination of CRD1expression. Therefore, the primary site of the affect should be in the mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction as the primary result of lack of CL in the presence of compensating PG is further supported by the lack of any noticeable effect of the crd1Δ allele on growth of yeast at 30 °C on glucose as the carbon source (14Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar,19Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). At 30 °C on a non-fermentable carbon source crd1Δ cells are primarily compromised in both growth rate and final cell density or cell yield in a CL dose-dependent manner. Given the specificity of this effect on carbon source and the association of CL with energy transducing complexes of the inner mitochondrial membrane, a likely molecular basis for these phenotypes would be in organization and/or function of these complexes. Previous reports have shown that complex III and IV form a supercomplex made up of a heterodimer of homodimers of complex III and complex IV. Since this supercomplex was sufficiently stable at high digitonin concentrations (8 g/g of protein) to be displayed under native condition on BN-PAGE, it is unlikely that detergent facilitates supercomplex formation or that this complex is transient in vivo (11Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The novel and significant result reported here is the almost complete lack of this supercomplex in extracts of cells lacking CL relative to wild type cells and the detection of an intermediate level of supercomplex at intermediate CL levels. These results strongly indicate that CL plays a central rolein vivo in the association between complexes III and IV. As noted below, the homodimers may still have limited affinity for each other due to the presence of PG. However, PG is most likely required for their individual activities. The effect of lack of both PG and CL on components of the electron transport chain cannot be assessed because null mutants (pgs1Δ) lacking phosphatidylglycerol-P synthase are defective in translation of the mitochondrial-encoded subunits of these complexes (16Ostrander D.B. Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Rho M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25262-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Purified complex III and IV from several sources contain tightly bound phospholipid molecules including CL. CL is associated with and appears to be required for the structure and function of mammalian complex IV (9Sedlak E. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14966-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) as further evidenced by its preliminary resolution in the crystal structure (21Mizushami T. Yao M. Inoue N. Aoyama H. Yamaguchi E. Yamaguchi H. Tsukihara T. Nakashima R. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1999; 55 (Abstr. P06.4.069)Google Scholar). Several lipid molecules have been resolved in the crystal structure of complex III from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Particularly interesting is the location of a single CL molecule bound between cytochromes b andc 1 of the 10-subunit monomer. Mutants with alterations in the residues to which CL is bound grew slower, but these mutations did not result in a parallel lose of activity of complex III. Reduced CL levels also compromise the growth properties of yeast without having a noticeable effect on uncoupled respiratory chain activity as measured in isolated mitochondria. This would suggest the loss in growth efficiency is related to a role of CL that cannot be replaced effectively by PG. The novel requirement for CL now revealed by our results is in the association of complexes III and IV into a supercomplex that in vivo might also positively contribute to efficiency of energy transducing systems and cell growth properties. How might CL facilitate a specific and functional interaction between complex III and IV? X-ray crystal structures of several multimeric membrane protein complexes strongly support a role for lipids as providing a deformable rather than rigid interface between subunits of these larger complexes (22Fyfe P.K. McAuley K.E. Roszak A.W. Isaacs N.W. Cogdell R.J. Jones M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 106-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Essential in this role is the ability to fill cavities and grooves between hydrophobic interfaces within the membrane bilayer while providing specific ionic bridges at the water-hydrophobic interface. In addition, membrane proteins interact with less tightly bound annular lipids on their hydrophobic surface, but these lipids must also fit into this irregular landscape and may also provide surfaces for interaction between less tightly associated proteins. A cavity formed by membrane-imbedded transmembrane helices of cytochrome c 1 and cytochrome b has been suggested as a possible site of interaction between complex III and complex IV (4Schagger H. Crit. Rev. 2001; 52: 119-128Google Scholar). We suggest CL may fill this cavity and provide a flexible amphipathic linkage between the above complexes. The primary attractive forces between complexes III and IV appear to be hydrophobic interactions, since detergents dissociate the supercomplex at low ionic strength (11Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our observation that some supercomplex can be detected in cells lacking CL but with elevated PG that may facilitate low affinity interactions. A single molecular of PG may not fill the space, and the head groups of two PG molecules may result in steric hindrance. Our data also establish that there is no absolute requirement for CL in forming homodimers of complex III or complex IV and is consistent with the ability of PG to uniquely substitute for CL in reconstitution of activity for the delipidated, highly homologous, mammalian complex III (8Gomez Jr., B. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9031-9038Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the idea that redox complexes in mitochondria and bacteria might be assembled in CL-enriched domains (23Haines T.H. Dencher N.A.

We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against 53BP1 in mammalian cells to demonstrate that 53BP1 is a key transducer of the DNA damage checkpoint signal. 53BP1 was required for p53 accumulation, G 2 -M checkpoint arrest, and the intra-S-phase checkpoint in response to ionizing radiation. 53BP1 played a partially redundant role in phosphorylation of the downstream checkpoint effector proteins Brca1 and Chk2 but was required for the formation of Brca1 foci in a hierarchical branched pathway for the recruitment of repair and signaling proteins to sites of DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2170479468,"The gravitational pull of subducted slabs is thought to drive the motions of Earth's tectonic plates, but the coupling between slabs and plates is not well established. If a slab is mechanically attached to a subducting plate, it can exert a direct pull on the plate. Alternatively, a detached slab may drive a plate by exciting flow in the mantle that exerts a shear traction on the base of the plate. From the geologic history of subduction, we estimated the relative importance of ""pull"" versus ""suction"" for the present-day plates. Observed plate motions are best predicted if slabs in the upper mantle are attached to plates and generate slab pull forces that account for about half of the total driving force on plates. Slabs in the lower mantle are supported by viscous mantle forces and drive plates through slab suction."
https://openalex.org/W100965007,"The first step toward light perception is 11-cis to all-trans photoisomerization of the retinaldehyde chromophore in a rod or cone opsin-pigment molecule. Light sensitivity of the opsin pigment is restored through a multistep pathway called the visual cycle, which effects all-trans to 11-cis re-isomerization of the retinoid chromophore. The maximum throughput of the known visual cycle, however, is too slow to explain sustained photosensitivity in bright light. Here, we demonstrate three novel enzymatic activities in cone-dominant ground-squirrel and chicken retinas: an all-trans-retinol isomerase, an 11-cis-retinyl-ester synthase, and an 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase. Together these activities comprise a novel pathway that regenerates opsin photopigments at a rate 20-fold faster than the known visual cycle. We suggest that this pathway is responsible for sustained daylight vision in vertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W1989433038,"In retinal rods, Ca(2+) exerts negative feedback control on cGMP synthesis by guanylate cyclase (GC). This feedback loop was disrupted in mouse rods lacking guanylate cyclase activating proteins GCAP1 and GCAP2 (GCAPs(-/-)). Comparison of the behavior of wild-type and GCAPs(-/-) rods allowed us to investigate the role of the feedback loop in normal rod function. We have found that regulation of GC is apparently the only Ca(2+) feedback loop operating during the single photon response. Analysis of the rods' light responses and cellular dark noise suggests that GC normally responds to light-driven changes in [Ca(2+)] rapidly and highly cooperatively. Rapid feedback to GC speeds the rod's temporal responsiveness and improves its signal-to-noise ratio by minimizing fluctuations in cGMP."

It does so indirectly by binding to its G-protein-coupled receptor, PTH/PTH-related protein receptor 1 (PTHR1), on stromal/osteoblastic cells (1Liu B.Y. Guo J. Lanske B. Divieti P. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1952-1964Google Scholar). These cells support osteoclast formation via expression of M-CSF and receptor activator of NFκB-ligand (RANKL) (2Khosla S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5050-5055Google Scholar). Mice deficient in either are incapable of forming osteoclasts, and together these proteins are sufficient to stimulate osteoclast formation in vitro in the absence of stromal/osteoblastic cells (3Yoshida H.

Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Google Scholar). The action of RANKL is blocked by osteoprotegerin (OPG), which functions as a soluble decoy receptor (9Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimamoto G. DeRose M. Elliott R. Colombero A. Tan H.L. Trail G. Sullivan J. Davy E. Bucay N. Renshaw-Gegg L. Hughes T.M. Hill D. Pattison W. Campbell P. Sander S. Van G. Tarpley J. Derby P. Lee R. Boyle W.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Google Scholar). PTH simultaneously stimulates RANKL and inhibits OPG expression in primary cultures of stromal/osteoblastic cells and in bone tissue from parathyroidectomized rats infused with this hormone (10Lee S.K. Lorenzo J.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3552-3561Google Scholar, 11Ma Y.L. Cain R.L. Halladay D.L. Yang X. Zeng Q. Miles R.R. Chandrasekhar S. Martin T.J. Onyia J.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4047-4054Google Scholar). Based on this, it has been proposed that PTH influences osteoclast formation primarily by regulation of the RANKL/OPG ratio (2Khosla S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5050-5055Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms utilized by PTH to regulate these genes remain largely unknown.Binding of PTH to PTHR1 on stromal/osteoblastic cells activates both the protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways, and both pathways have been implicated in PTH-induced osteoclast formationin vitro (12Swarthout J.T. D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Partridge N.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 1-17Google Scholar). Activation of these pathways by PTH leads to activation of multiple transcription factors, including CREB, AP-1, and Runx2 (12Swarthout J.T. D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Partridge N.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 1-17Google Scholar). Specifically, PKA stimulates the ability of DNA-bound CREB to activate transcription by phosphorylation of serine 133 (Ser-133) resulting in CBP/p300 co-activator recruitment (13Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Google Scholar). PTH stimulation of AP-1 is indirect requiring CREB-mediated transcription of AP-1 family members such as c-fos (14Pearman A.T. Chou W.Y. Bergman K.D. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25715-25721Google Scholar). Finally, it has been suggested that PTH may regulate the transcriptional activity of the RUNT domain transcription factor Runx2 via PKA phosphorylation (15Selvamurugan N. Pulumati M.R. Tyson D.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5037-5042Google Scholar). Whether PTH regulates RANKL or OPG expression via any of these factors is unknown.The goal of the studies described here was to identify molecular mechanisms involved in PTH regulation of RANKL and OPG expression. To accomplish this, we generated a cell line in which PTH stimulates a robust induction of RANKL and inhibition of OPG. These cells were used to demonstrate that PTH directly stimulates RANKL transcription as well as mRNA stability and indirectly inhibits OPG expression. In addition we found that activation of PKA, but not PKC, is sufficient and required for PTH regulation of both genes. Finally, activation of the transcription factor CREB was shown to be required for full stimulation of RANKL by PTH, and both CREB and AP-1 are involved in PTH-suppression of OPG.DISCUSSIONOur results in UAMS-32P and primary bone marrow cells indicate that PTH directly stimulates RANKL transcription via cAMP activation of PKA. Furthermore, PTH suppression of OPG also requires activation of PKA but differs from regulation of RANKL in that intermediate gene expression is required. Although previous work indicated that PTH stimulation of RANKL and inhibition of OPG involves a cAMP-activated pathway (30Takami M. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Miyaura C. Suda K. Woo J.T. Martin T.J. Nagai K. Suda T. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4711-4719Google Scholar, 31Kanzawa M. Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Chihara K. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 142: 661-664Google Scholar, 32Halladay D.L. Miles R.R. Thirunavukkarasu K. Chandrasekhar S. Martin T.J. Onyia J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 84: 1-11Google Scholar), it remained unclear whether the downstream mediator of cAMP is the well-characterized PKA pathway or the recently described Epac pathway (24de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Google Scholar). Our demonstration that inhibition of MEK did not alter PTH regulation of either RANKL or OPG argues against involvement of the Epac pathway.Consistent with our studies, recent work with a different murine stromal cell line (MS1) also indicates that PKA, but not PKC, is required for simultaneous stimulation of RANKL and suppression of OPG after a 7-day PTH exposure (33Kondo H. Guo J. Bringhurst F.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1667-1679Google Scholar). The previous studies with this cell line suggesting that both PKA and PKC are required for PTH-stimulated osteoclast formation utilized 3-week co-cultures of MS1 and spleen cells (1Liu B.Y. Guo J. Lanske B. Divieti P. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1952-1964Google Scholar, 34Liu B.Y. Wu P.W. Bringhurst F.R. Wang J.T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 627-635Google Scholar). It is possible that pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines that utilize PKC were produced during this comparatively long culture period and, via stimulation of RANKL, contributed along with PTH to the total number of osteoclasts formed.The transcription factors CREB, c-fos, and Runx2 have been shown to mediate at least some of the gene regulatory effects of PTH (12Swarthout J.T. D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Partridge N.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 1-17Google Scholar). Our results indicate that CREB, but not c-fos or Runx2, is involved in the PTH stimulation of RANKL. The lack of c-fos involvement is not unexpected, because new protein synthesis was not required for PTH stimulation of RANKL and previous work has shown that PTH stimulates c-fos indirectly via CREB (27Tyson D.R. Swarthout J.T. Partridge N.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1255-1261Google Scholar). In addition, the lack of Runx2 involvement is consistent with our previous study indicating that this factor is not required for basal, OSM-, or 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated RANKL expression (35O'Brien C.A. Kern B. Gubrij I. Karsenty G. Manolagas S.C. Bone. 2002; 30: 453-462Google Scholar). Expression of A-CREB did not completely block PTH stimulation of RANKL. This residual stimulation may be due to an inability of the dominant-negative protein to completely block endogenous CREB activation. Alternatively, the residual stimulation may be due solely to effects of PTH on RANKL mRNA stability, which may not involve CREB.We were surprised to find that PKA and CREB activity are required for regulation of RANKL by OSM and 1,25(OH)2D3. These results suggest that the PKA-CREB pathway is a necessary component of transcriptional activation of the RANKL gene regardless of the nature of the stimulus. Although our results could have been due to A-CREB inhibition of genes required for gp130 or VDR action, our finding that OSM stimulated a different target gene, namely c-fos, in the presence of A-CREB argues against this possibility. It is also possible that the protein complex consisting of A-CREB and wild-type CREB sequestered co-factors essential for STAT3 and VDR action such as p300/CBP (36Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Google Scholar). However, the A-fos protein, which functions via a mechanism similar to A-CREB, had no effect on RANKL expression in response to any of the stimuli used, suggesting that this class of dominant-negative B-ZIP factors does not limit co-factor availability.How might CREB be required for the actions of multiple signaling pathways on RANKL expression? Our finding that PTH, but not OSM or 1,25(OH)2D3, stimulated CREB transcriptional activity suggests that only basal CREB activity is required for the regulation of RANKL by OSM and 1,25(OH)2D3. The lack of CREB transcriptional modulation by OSM or 1,25(OH)2D3 also suggests that these agents do not alter PKA activity in UAMS-32P cells. Nonetheless, PKA activity was required for gp130 and VDR action on RANKL. Therefore, we hypothesize that basal PKA activity is a prerequisite for the effects of both the gp130 and VDR pathways on RANKL. Basal PKA activity may result from factors present in the serum-containing medium or autocrine production of factors that activate PKA. Basal PKA activity may in turn maintain basal CREB phosphorylation, which by itself is not sufficient for high level RANKL expression but, together with activated STAT3 or VDR, is able to induce RANKL transcription. In the case of PTH, strong activation of PKA may lead to levels of CREB phosphorylation that are sufficient to stimulate RANKL transcription without additional stimulus-dependant factors.The ability of osteoclastogenic cytokines and hormones to stimulate RANKL expression appears to be restricted to stromal/osteoblastic cells and mammary epithelium (37Fata J.E. Kong Y.Y. Li J. Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Moorehead R.A. Elliott R. Scully S. Voura E.B. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Khokha R. Penninger J.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 41-50Google Scholar). However, both CREB and STAT3 are broadly expressed and activated by many agents (25Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Google Scholar, 38Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar), and the VDR can be activated in a variety of different tissues as well (39Issa L.L. Leong G.M. Eisman J.A. Inflamm. Res. 1998; 47: 451-475Google Scholar). These observations raise the question of how activation of broadly expressed factors leads to RANKL expression specifically in stromal/osteoblastic cells. We postulate that cell type-specific factors function together with broadly expressed transcription factors to regulate RANKL expression. The finding that both AP-1 and Runx2 binding sites are required for PTH stimulation of the collagenase 3 promoter illustrates one mechanism whereby a tissue-specific transcription factor (Runx2) acts in concert with a broadly expressed factor (AP-1) to control osteoblast-specific expression of a gene (40Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Google Scholar). In addition, although CREB is broadly expressed, it appears to be involved only in the differentiation and/or survival of specific cell types, such as neurons, T cells, and adipocytes (41Rudolph D. Tafuri A. Gass P. Hammerling G.J. Arnold B. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4481-4486Google Scholar, 42Reusch J.E. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Google Scholar).PTH transiently stimulates gp130-utilizing cytokines such as IL-6, IL-11, and leukemia inhibitory factor in primary osteoblasts and cell lines (43Feyen J.H. Elford P. Di P.F.E. Trechsel U. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 633-638Google Scholar, 44Lowik C.W. van der Pluijm G. Bloys H. Hoekman K. Bijvoet O.L. Aarden L.A. Papapoulos S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, blockade of IL-6 or gp130 signaling reduced osteoclast formation or bone resorption induced by PTH or 1,25(OH)2D3 in vitro andin vivo (45Girasole G. Passeri G. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C.

Based on these studies, it has been suggested that PTH might stimulate RANKL and/or inhibit OPG by stimulating expression of IL-6-type cytokines. Our demonstration that intermediate gene expression is not required for PTH stimulation of RANKL argues against this scenario and is consistent with our earlier finding that blockade of gp130 signaling specifically in stromal/osteoblastic cells did not block PTH-induced osteoclastogenesis (16O'Brien C.A. Gubrij I. Lin S.C. Saylors R.L. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19301-19308Google Scholar). It is unlikely that gp130 cytokines are involved in PTH suppression of OPG, because OSM did not inhibit OPG in UAMS-32P cells.Given these results, what role might IL-6 type cytokines play in PTH-induced bone resorption? IL-6 may be required for maximal osteoclast precursor proliferation (51Roodman G.D. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 19: 3562-3571Google Scholar, 52Jilka R.L. Bone. 1998; 23: 75-81Google Scholar). Alternatively, IL-6 may be required for PTH-induced bone resorption via a mechanism that does not involve regulation of osteoclast formation. IL-6 is capable of prolonging the lifespan of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (53Kerst J.M. Slaper-Cortenbach I.C. van der Schoot C.E. Hooibrink B. dem Borne A.E. van Oers R.H. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 1550-1557Google Scholar), and gp130 cytokines augment RANKL/M-CSF-induced osteoclast formation (54Cappellen D. Luong-Nguyen N.H. Bongiovanni S. Grenet O. Wanke C. Susa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21971-21982Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of gp130 cytokines in PTH-induced bone resorption may be to prolong the lifespan of differentiated osteoclasts.In conclusion, this study provides evidence that PTH stimulates osteoclast formation via PKA-mediated induction of RANKL and suppression of OPG in stromal/osteoblastic cells and that stimulation of RANKL involves CREB-mediated transcription. Furthermore, PTH appears to inhibit OPG expression via a PKA-CREB-AP-1 pathway. Because PKA activation of CREB occurs in a variety of cell types, our work suggests that other factors limit the expression of RANKL to cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Identification of the cis-acting elements in the RANKL gene responsible for cell type-specific RANKL expression, as well as regulation by osteoclastogenic agents, should shed light on the mechanisms whereby CREB, together with STAT3 and the VDR, regulate RANKL expression.

It does so indirectly by binding to its G-protein-coupled receptor, PTH/PTH-related protein receptor 1 (PTHR1), on stromal/osteoblastic cells (1Liu B.Y. Guo J. Lanske B. Divieti P. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1952-1964Google Scholar). These cells support osteoclast formation via expression of M-CSF and receptor activator of NFκB-ligand (RANKL) (2Khosla S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5050-5055Google Scholar). Mice deficient in either are incapable of forming osteoclasts, and together these proteins are sufficient to stimulate osteoclast formation in vitro in the absence of stromal/osteoblastic cells (3Yoshida H.

Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Google Scholar). The action of RANKL is blocked by osteoprotegerin (OPG), which functions as a soluble decoy receptor (9Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S.

Tarpley J. Derby P. Lee R. Boyle W.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Google Scholar). PTH simultaneously stimulates RANKL and inhibits OPG expression in primary cultures of stromal/osteoblastic cells and in bone tissue from parathyroidectomized rats infused with this hormone (10Lee S.K. Lorenzo J.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3552-3561Google Scholar, 11Ma Y.L. Cain R.L. Halladay D.L. Yang X. Zeng Q. Miles R.R. Chandrasekhar S. Martin T.J. Onyia J.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4047-4054Google Scholar). Based on this, it has been proposed that PTH influences osteoclast formation primarily by regulation of the RANKL/OPG ratio (2Khosla S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5050-5055Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms utilized by PTH to regulate these genes remain largely unknown. Binding of PTH to PTHR1 on stromal/osteoblastic cells activates both the protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways, and both pathways have been implicated in PTH-induced osteoclast formationin vitro (12Swarthout J.T. D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Partridge N.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 1-17Google Scholar). Activation of these pathways by PTH leads to activation of multiple transcription factors, including CREB, AP-1, and Runx2 (12Swarthout J.T. D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Partridge N.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 1-17Google Scholar). Specifically, PKA stimulates the ability of DNA-bound CREB to activate transcription by phosphorylation of serine 133 (Ser-133) resulting in CBP/p300 co-activator recruitment (13Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Google Scholar). PTH stimulation of AP-1 is indirect requiring CREB-mediated transcription of AP-1 family members such as c-fos (14Pearman A.T. Chou W.Y. Bergman K.D. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25715-25721Google Scholar). Finally, it has been suggested that PTH may regulate the transcriptional activity of the RUNT domain transcription factor Runx2 via PKA phosphorylation (15Selvamurugan N. Pulumati M.R. Tyson D.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5037-5042Google Scholar). Whether PTH regulates RANKL or OPG expression via any of these factors is unknown. The goal of the studies described here was to identify molecular mechanisms involved in PTH regulation of RANKL and OPG expression. To accomplish this, we generated a cell line in which PTH stimulates a robust induction of RANKL and inhibition of OPG. These cells were used to demonstrate that PTH directly stimulates RANKL transcription as well as mRNA stability and indirectly inhibits OPG expression. In addition we found that activation of PKA, but not PKC, is sufficient and required for PTH regulation of both genes. Finally, activation of the transcription factor CREB was shown to be required for full stimulation of RANKL by PTH, and both CREB and AP-1 are involved in PTH-suppression of OPG. DISCUSSIONOur results in UAMS-32P and primary bone marrow cells indicate that PTH directly stimulates RANKL transcription via cAMP activation of PKA. Furthermore, PTH suppression of OPG also requires activation of PKA but differs from regulation of RANKL in that intermediate gene expression is required. Although previous work indicated that PTH stimulation of RANKL and inhibition of OPG involves a cAMP-activated pathway (30Takami M. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Miyaura C. Suda K. Woo J.T. Martin T.J.

Although the cause and effect relationship between these inclusions and cell death remains unclear, the molecular constituents of inclusions reveal clues about the events leading to their formation. For example, Lewy bodies are rich in ubiquitin and proteasome subunits (3Iwatsubo T. Yamaguchi H. Fujikura M. Yokosawa H. Ihara Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Am. J.

This 465-amino acid protein has mild homology to ubiquitin at its N terminus and contains two RING finger domains at its C terminus.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 899-908Google Scholar) have addressed the tendency of α-synuclein to aggregate as ubiquitinated inclusions, but no information is available about the ability of Parkin to aggregate. In this report, we show that overexpression of Parkin in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor leads to the accumulation of Parkin aggregates as single, large, eosinophilic peri-nuclear inclusions consisting of a core and a halo. These structures are similar to aggresomes (24Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Google Scholar), the formation of which results in the redistribution of several cellular factors, such as intermediate filaments, chaperones, and proteasome subunits to these inclusion bodies. Based on our observations, we suggest that the formation of Lewy bodies in the brains of PD patients is similar to the formation of aggresome-like structures when proteasome activity is impaired.

Goat polyclonal synphilin-1 antibody (1:200), rabbit polyclonal α-synuclein antibody (1:200), and rabbit polyclonal mannosidase II antibody (1:200) were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Full-length Parkin cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GCCGAATTCACCATGATAGTGTTTGTCAGGTTC-3′ and 5′-GGCGGATCCCTACACGTCGAACCAGTGG-3′. These primers contained additional restriction enzyme cleavage sites to facilitate insertion of the product in pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma) to express FLAG- tagged Parkin, in pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to express GFP-Parkin, and in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Ubiquitin cDNA was isolated by PCR from human adult brain cDNA library using primers 5′-GGAAGCTTAATGCAGATCTTCGTGAAGACTCTG-3′ and 5′-GGCGAATTCTACCCACCCTGAGACGGAGTAC-3′. The amplified sequence was inserted into pHM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to express HA-tagged ubiquitin. COS-7 and human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the supplier's instructions. Cells were cultured for 24 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After homogenizing with 20 strokes using a Dounce homogenizer, cells were centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The soluble and insoluble fractions were used in Western blots for FLAG, α-synuclein, and synphilin-1. The Triton X-100-insoluble pellets were dissolved in a buffer (PBS plus 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After centrifugation, supernatant was diluted in 10× volume of the same buffer lacking SDS. Immunoprecipitations were performed with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma) followed by washing with lysis buffer four times. Immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blots using mouse anti-ubiquitin antibody (P4D1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) with ECL detection reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HEK 293T or COS-7 cells were cultured in 60-mm plates, transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection kit, and plated in collagen-coated Biocoat® slides (BD Biosciences) for 1 day. Before staining, 5 μm of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was added for 16 h. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed with PBS three times, and permeabilized with 0.6% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After washing the cells again with PBS three times, they were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 20 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody diluted in PBS and 1% BSA at 4 °C for 2 h. Cells were washed five times for 5 min each with PBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS with 1% BSA and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed five times with PBS, mounted with ProLong® antifade mounting material (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) under a coverglass, and analyzed under a Zeiss (LSM 510) confocal microscope or epi-fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axiophot). For quantification of inclusions, 10 microscopic fields were randomly selected, and the percentage of inclusion-positive cells was counted among transfected cells expressing FLAG-Parkin. For nuclear staining, fixed cells were incubated with 10 μm4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min after secondary antibody incubation. For thioflavin S staining, fixed cells were incubated with 0.1% thioflavin S (Sigma) for 5 min and washed with 70% ethanol three times before antibody staining. For H & E staining of MG-132-treated COS-7 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-Parkin, cells were washed with PBS twice and incubated with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at room temperature for 3 min. Cells were then rinsed with deionized water three times and destained with acidic alcohol for a few seconds. After rinsing the cells again with deionized water, bicarbonate solution (1 g/liter) was added, and cells were incubated for 3 min. After this bluing step, cells were washed again with deionized water and placed in 70% ethanol for 3 min, followed by staining with eosin (0.5 g of Eosin Y, 2.5 ml of acetic acid, 500 ml of 70% ethanol) for 1 min. Cells were then washed with three changes of 95% ethanol and dehydrated with absolute ethanol. Slides were dried, mounted, and analyzed under a light microscope. To investigate the molecular properties of Parkin, cDNA constructs were used to transiently overexpress this protein in cell lines. HEK 293T cells transfected with N-terminally FLAG-tagged Parkin expressed a high molecular weight complex (HMW) of Parkin detected in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction as well as monomeric Parkin detected in both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions on Western blots (Fig. 1 A). Expression of FLAG-Parkin in COS-7 cells reproduced this finding (data not shown). Similarly, the expression of non-tagged Parkin in PC12 cells also led to the formation of a HMW complex recognized by Parkin antibody (data not shown). Because Parkin contains 35 cysteine residues, which are vulnerable to oxidation and tend to form intra- and inter-molecular disulfide bridges, 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was added onto the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and boiled prior to Western blotting. DTT treatment failed to inhibit the formation of the HMW complex (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the HMW complex does not represent Parkin oxidation products. Incubation with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 increased the amount of Parkin HMW complex in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that this complex contains ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. We then examined if Parkin could be covalently modified by ubiquitin as well. Western blot analysis of the FLAG-Parkin immunoprecipitate with anti-ubiquitin antibody showed that the HMW bands are ubiquitin-positive (Fig. 1 C), consistent with previous reports showing Parkin ubiquitination (18Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Google Scholar, 21Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Google Scholar). To study the intracellular formation and distribution of aggregated Parkin, fluorescence microscopy was employed to detect the expression of FLAG-Parkin in COS-7 cells. Following transient transfection, FLAG-Parkin was detected in the peri-nuclear and Golgi complex regions as demonstrated by co-localization with mannosidase II and the trans-Golgi network marker γ-adaptin (Fig.2, A and B), as reported previously (25Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Yoshikawa M. Kitada T. Matsumine H. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Yamamura Y. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 668-672Google Scholar, 26Kubo S.I. Kitami T. Noda S. Shimura H. Uchiyama Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Hattori N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 42-54Google Scholar) in both human brain tissue and cell lines. We also found Parkin to be co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum marker BIP/GRP78 (27Waelter S. Boeddrich A. Lurz R. Scherzinger E. Lueder G. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1393-1407Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C) and the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 (28Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 D). Additionally, several small spherical inclusions were detected throughout the cytoplasm in some cells (Fig.2 E). The relative frequency of inclusion formation was 0.7% of transfected cells. Because Triton X-100-insoluble forms of FLAG-Parkin are ubiquitin-positive, we investigated whether these aggregates are ubiquitinated. Staining of the same cells with an anti-ubiquitin antibody revealed that most Parkin-positive inclusions also contain ubiquitin (Fig. 2 E). These observations suggest that Parkin can aggregate when overexpressed and that this process is associated with its ubiquitination. After treatment of FLAG-Parkin-transfected COS-7 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 15 h, about 20% of transfected cells manifested a single large, round, peri-nuclear inclusion (Fig.3 A) that appeared to impinge upon the nuclear envelope. Similar inclusions were observed in COS-7 cells expressing GFP-Parkin and in HEK 293T cells expressing FLAG-Parkin, indicating that this process is not unique to FLAG-tagged Parkin or to COS-7 cells (data not shown). Other inhibitors of the proteasome, such as lactacystin and PSI (23Rideout H.J. Larsen K.E. Sulzer D. Stefanis L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 899-908Google Scholar), induced the formation of similar inclusions in ∼15–20% of transfected cells (Fig.3 B), indicating that the formation of these inclusions is due to proteasomal dysfunction rather than the unique effect of an individual drug. Double immunocytochemical studies revealed that these inclusions are localized at the Golgi complex as demonstrated by significant co-localization of Parkin immunoreactivity with the Golgi marker mannosidase II (29Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moremen K.W. Tulsiani D.R. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Google Scholar). Notably, the presence of these inclusions disrupts the normal morphology of the Golgi complex (Fig.3 C). We also investigated whether ubiquitin is present in these peri-nuclear, Parkin-containing inclusions. To this end, COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with FLAG-Parkin cDNA together with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged ubiquitin followed by treatment with MG-132 for 15 h. Double immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the majority of FLAG-positive inclusions co-localize with HA immunoreactivity (Fig. 3 D), indicating that Parkin-positive inclusions are ubiquitinated. Specificity of FLAG-Parkin immunoreactivity in these inclusions was verified by pre-adsorption with FLAG peptide resulting in absence of signal, whereas immunocytochemistry with ubiquitin antibody revealed positive staining of aggregates (Fig. 3 E). We also analyzed non-Parkin-transfected, MG-132-treated COS-7 cells with ubiquitin immunostaining and found no peri-nuclear inclusions, implying that the formation of such inclusions is dependent on the overexpression of Parkin. The large peri-nuclear inclusions containing Parkin had marked similarities to structures, termed aggresomes, formed by other proteins (27Waelter S. Boeddrich A. Lurz R. Scherzinger E. Lueder G. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1393-1407Google Scholar, 28Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar, 30Garcia-Mata R. Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Google Scholar, 31Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Google Scholar, 32Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Google Scholar). Overexpression of certain proteins or inhibition of proteasome activity in cells expressing these proteins leads to the accumulation of stable, high molecular weight, detergent-insoluble, and multiubiquitinated aggregates in a large structure located peri-nuclearly on one side (24Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Google Scholar). Other characteristic features of the aggresome include its formation at the centrosome/microtubule organizing center (MTOC). To assess whether peri-nuclear Parkin aggregates are similar in structure to aggresomes, additional co-localization studies were carried out. Comparison of the fluorescence from Parkin aggregates with the staining pattern of γ-tubulin, a marker for the centrosome/MTOC (33Dictenberg J.B. Zimmerman W. Sparks C.A. Young A. Vidair C. Zheng Y. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 163-174Google Scholar), revealed that both signals are co-localized, indicating a close physical relationship between the aggresome and centrosome (Fig.4 A). The presence of aggresome at the centrosome/MTOC suggests direct involvement of microtubules (MT) in their formation. To address this link, MT-disrupting drugs, such as nocodazole and vinblastine sulfate, were employed together with proteasome inhibition (Fig. 4 B). Treatment with these drugs markedly abrogated the MG-132-induced accumulation of Parkin as a single large peri-nuclear aggresome. Rather, FLAG-Parkin immunofluorescence was observed throughout the cytoplasm with no obvious concentration near the centrosome/MTOC (Fig. 4 C). These data suggest that an intact MT is required for the formation of Parkin-containing aggresomes through retrograde transport of misfolded proteins along microtubules as demonstrated previously (28Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar, 30Garcia-Mata R. Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Google Scholar, 32Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Google Scholar) for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, GFP-250, and superoxide dismutase. Among the components of intracellular inclusion bodies associated with some neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson and Alzheimer, are deposits of abnormal intermediate filament proteins such as neurofilaments (34Goldman J.E. Yen S.H. Chiu F.C. Peress N.S. Science. 1983; 221: 1082-1084Google Scholar, 35Trojanowski J.Q. Schmidt M.L. Shin R.W. Bramblett G.T. Rao D. Lee V.M. Brain Pathol. 1993; 3: 45-54Google Scholar). Similarly, one of the characteristic features of aggresomes is the deposition of intermediate filaments such as vimentin, particularly redistributed to the aggresomal region forming a ring-like halo (28Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar). FLAG-Parkin-transfected cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor elicited the same response, showing a ring of vimentin immunoreactivity around aggregated Parkin (Fig.4 D). Additionally, these inclusions are quite stable as they persist after an 8-h wash-out of MG-132 (Fig. 4 E). Taken together, these observations indicate that the peri-nuclear inclusion containing Parkin has the structural characteristics of an aggresome. The proteasome complex is involved in the degradation of incompletely folded or misfolded proteins. In the case of mutant huntingtin and GFP-250, proteasome subunits have been detected in their respective aggresomes (27Waelter S. Boeddrich A. Lurz R. Scherzinger E. Lueder G. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1393-1407Google Scholar, 30Garcia-Mata R. Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Google Scholar). Additionally, proteasome subunits are found in Lewy bodies of PD (4Ii K. Ito H. Tanaka K. Hirano A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 125-131Google Scholar). To investigate whether Parkin-containing aggresomes also recruit the proteasome, we analyzed the distribution of the 20 S proteasome α-subunit. As expected, we found co-localization of the α-subunit with Parkin within aggresomes (Fig.5 A), supporting previous reports (8Choi P. Ostrerova-Golts N. Sparkman D. Cochran E. Lee J.M. Wolozin B. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 2635-2638Google Scholar, 21Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Google Scholar) that the proteasome is involved in Parkin degradation. Molecular chaperones interact with aggregation-prone proteins and facilitate their re-folding or degradation (36Hartl F.U. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 92-102Google Scholar). Hsp70, for example, has been shown to be recruited to the centrosomal locus upon inhibition of proteasomal function (37Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Google Scholar). Because aggresomes contain misfolded proteins destined for degradation, it is likely that such proteins could be complexed with chaperones. To investigate whether chaperones are associated with Parkin aggresomes, the distribution of Hsp70 and its co-chaperone, Hsp40, was examined. These chaperones were detected in the periphery of the aggresome forming a ring around Parkin immunoreactivity (Fig. 5, B and C), similar to the staining pattern of vimentin (Fig. 4 D). Interestingly, Hsp70 and Hsp40 were recently found in Lewy bodies of PD brains and in neuronal inclusions of α-synuclein transgenic Drosophila(38Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Google Scholar). We also analyzed the localization of BIP/GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone, within Parkin-containing aggresomes. Compared with its staining pattern in the absence of MG-132 (Fig.2 C), BIP/GRP78 redistributed to aggresomes in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells and co-localized with Parkin in the halo (Fig.5 D). α-Synuclein is a major constituent of Lewy bodies (7Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Google Scholar), some of which also contain Parkin (9Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Google Scholar, 39Choi P. Golts N. Snyder H. Chong M. Petrucelli L. Hardy J. Sparkman D. Cochran E. Lee J.M. Wolozin B. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2839-2843Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to examine the presence of α-synuclein in Parkin aggresomes. α-Synuclein immunoreactivity was found localized primarily in the periphery of the aggresomes around Parkin aggregates (Fig.6 A). A halo-like staining for α-synuclein has also been observed in Lewy bodies (9Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Google Scholar, 40Wakabayashi K. Hayashi S. Kakita A. Yamada M. Toyoshima Y. Yoshimoto M. Takahashi H. Acta Neuropathol. 1998; 96: 445-452Google Scholar). Synphilin-1, originally identified as an α-synuclein interacting protein (41Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Google Scholar) and found in Lewy bodies (42Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 521-523Google Scholar), also interacts with and is ubiquitinated by Parkin (20Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Lim K.L. Tanaka Y. Huang H. Gao J. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Google Scholar). We detected synphilin-1 immunoreactivity in peri-nuclear aggresomes co-localizing with Parkin (Fig.6 B). However, the staining pattern for synphilin-1 is somewhat different from that of α-synuclein. Whereas α-synuclein is concentrated mainly in the periphery, synphilin-1 is located in the entire aggresome structure covering the core, consistent with a previous observation that synphilin-1 is concentrated primarily in the dense core of Lewy bodies (42Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 521-523Google Scholar). The presence of α-synuclein and synphilin-1 in Parkin-containing aggresomes was also confirmed in Western blot analyses (Fig. 6, C and D), demonstrating HMW smears of the respective proteins only in the insoluble fraction of MG-132-treated cells. α-Synuclein forms aggregates having a structure similar to amyloid, characterized by β-pleated sheet (43Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Google Scholar), which stains with thiazole dyes such as thioflavin S and T. Additionally, some Lewy bodies are thioflavin S-positive (2Pollanen M.S. Dickson D.W. Bergeron C. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 52: 183-191Google Scholar, 44Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Sisk A. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Brain Res. 1998; 799: 301-306Google Scholar). Because the Parkin-containing aggresome also includes α-synuclein and shows many features of a Lewy body, we double-stained Parkin-transfected, MG 132-treated cells with thioflavin S and Parkin. About 60% of the resultant aggresomes stained positively with thioflavin S, suggesting that these inclusions have amyloid-like features (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, similar to Lewy bodies, H & E staining revealed that Parkin-containing aggresomes are eosinophilic (Fig. 7 B). The characterization of a newly recognized intracellular structure named aggresome has recently been described (24Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Google Scholar, 27Waelter S. Boeddrich A. Lurz R. Scherzinger E. Lueder G. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1393-1407Google Scholar, 28Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar, 30Garcia-Mata R. Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Google Scholar, 31Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Aggresomes form by the accumulation and deposition of misfolded proteins in a single large structure surrounding the centrosome. Aggresomes have been detected in cells expressing cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, presenilin-1, GFP-250, mutant huntingtin, superoxide dismutase, and prion protein when these molecules are overexpressed or when the cells are treated with drugs that inhibit proteasome activity. These observations, therefore, can provide clues about the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by morphologically and biochemically distinct intracellular inclusions containing aggregated, ubiquitinated proteins often bundled with hyperphosphorylated and disordered intermediate filaments (45Mayer R.J. Lowe J. Lennox G. Doherty F. Landon M. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 317: 809-818Google Scholar). The accumulation of wild-type or mutant intracellular proteins due to misfolding or defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system is a common occurrence in PD (46McNaught K.S. Olanow C.W. Halliwell B. Isacson O. Jenner P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 589-594Google Scholar). The major indication that altered protein handling is a critical factor in this disorder is the presence of proteinaceous, intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and in other brain regions affected by the PD pathology (2Pollanen M.S. Dickson D.W. Bergeron C. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 52: 183-191Google Scholar). A wide range of proteins has been identified in Lewy bodies including α-synuclein, Parkin, ubiquitin, UCH-L1, synphilin-1, components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and protein adducts of 3-nitrotyrosine (3Iwatsubo T.

Hyman B.T. Selkoe D.J. Kosik K.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1655-1667Google Scholar). The presence of Parkin in Lewy bodies prompted us to investigate the aggregate-forming capability of Parkin in a cellular model. In the present report, we demonstrate that Parkin has a tendency to aggregate into inclusion bodies when overexpressed. These aggregates also contain ubiquitin, suggesting that the process of Parkin aggregation is coupled to its ubiquitination. But the relative frequency of microscopically visible aggregates is less than 1% although abundant amounts of Parkin exist as Triton X-100-insoluble high molecular complexes. Therefore, these HMW complexes could be viewed as small inclusions that cannot be detected by our conventional immunocytochemical methods or simply as oligomers that may act as seeds for the formation of larger inclusions when appropriate conditions prevail. Because Parkin is degraded by the proteasome, it is conceivable that the impaired proteasomal activity found in the parkinsonian nigra (49McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Google Scholar) could lead to slowed Parkin clearance, thus increasing the possibility for its aggregation. In fact, the frequency of inclusion formation in our experimental paradigm was markedly increased upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors jumping up to 20% of Parkin-transfected cells. The inclusions formed by MG-132 treatment are different from those seen in untreated control cells in several respects. Inclusions in cells with compromised proteasomal function appear as single large peri-nuclear structures resembling aggresomes, whereas those seen in untreated cells are small and scattered throughout the cytoplasm. Aggresomes are characterized by their content of γ-tubulin, vimentin, chaperones, and proteasome subunits, all components present in Parkin-containing inclusions. Furthermore, α-synuclein and synphilin-1 are detected in Parkin-containing inclusions, consistent with the recent observation (20Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Lim K.L. Tanaka Y. Huang H. Gao J. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Google Scholar) that co-expression of these three proteins in cells results in the formation of ubiquitin-positive cytosolic inclusions. These three proteins are also known to be constituents of Lewy bodies in PD brains. These observations lead us to speculate that the formation of Lewy bodies containing Parkin is analogous to the formation of aggresome-like structures when proteasomal activity is compromised. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction has recently been reported (22Lee H.J. Shin S.Y. Choi C. Lee Y.H. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5411-5417Google Scholar) to result in α-synuclein aggregates structurally similar to aggresomes, pointing to another cellular insult that can cause protein clumping into single, large inclusions. The parallels between the Lewy body and the aggresome are complex due to differences in the organization of microtubules and the centrosome in post-mitotic neurons versus dividing cells (50Baas P.W. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 1998; 14: 175-180Google Scholar). Nevertheless, many similarities between aggresomes and Lewy bodies have been uncovered by our present findings. First, both types of inclusions share the same major constituent proteins including Parkin, α-synuclein, synphilin-1, ubiquitin, proteasome subunit, Hsp70, and Hsp40. Second, morphologically, the core and halo structure of Lewy bodies is preserved in the aggresome with α-synuclein in the periphery and synphlin-1 in the core (42Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 521-523Google Scholar). Third, some Lewy bodies have been reported to be localized in the juxtanuclear region (51Esiri M.M. Hyman B.T. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Graham D.I. Lantos P.L. 6th Ed. Greenfield's Neuropathology. 2. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 153-233Google Scholar) typical of the aggresome (24Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Google Scholar). Peri-nuclear α-synuclein-positive inclusions similar to Lewy bodies have also been seen in transgenicDrosophila overexpressing α-synuclein (38Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Google Scholar). Fourth, some Lewy bodies are thioflavin S-positive, which may result from the amyloid-like aggregation of α-synuclein because Lewy bodies do not contain amyloid β-protein (52Arai H. Lee V.M. Hill W.D. Greenberg B.D. Trojanowski J.Q. Brain Res. 1992; 585: 386-390Google Scholar). Fifth, both Lewy bodies and Parkin-containing aggresomes are eosinophilic. And sixth, Lewy bodies contain neurofilament proteins (34Goldman J.E. Yen S.H. Chiu F.C. Peress N.S. Science. 1983; 221: 1082-1084Google Scholar), although the presence of γ-tubulin and vimentin in these neuronal structures remains to be determined. The stimuli that promote Parkin aggregation in the brain are likely to be diverse. Here we show that overexpressing this protein in a cellular model results in the formation of Parkin- and ubiquitin-positive inclusions. Thus, conditions that enhance Parkin expression (21Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Google Scholar) could promote its aggregation. On the other hand, proteasomal activity is reportedly down-regulated in PD brains (49McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Google Scholar), a condition that promotes the formation of Parkin-containing inclusions. Our findings with wild-type Parkin coupled with the fact that Parkin is present in Lewy bodies suggest that this protein is involved in the pathogenesis of not only inherited PD but of sporadic forms of the disease as well. In PD not associated with parkin mutations, sequestration of Parkin into inclusions, thereby inhibiting its E3 function, could be another mechanism leading to the accumulation of its toxic substrates, thus accelerating neuronal degeneration. The foregoing observations demonstrate that Parkin is prone to aggregate into large peri-nuclear inclusion bodies when proteasomal activity is impaired. Whether Parkin-positive inclusions per se relate to cell toxicity remains to be determined. However, if the aggregation of Parkin in certain conformations is deleterious to neurons, its prevention or resolution would have therapeutic value in PD."
https://openalex.org/W2166634100,"Successful propagation of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum within a susceptible mosquito vector is a prerequisite for the transmission of malaria. A field-based genetic analysis of the major human malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, has revealed natural factors that reduce the transmission of P. falciparum. Differences in P. falciparum oocyst numbers between mosquito isofemale families fed on the same infected blood indicated a large genetic component affecting resistance to the parasite, and genome-wide scanning in pedigrees of wild mosquitoes detected segregating resistance alleles. The apparently high natural frequency of resistance alleles suggests that malaria parasites (or a similar pathogen) exert a significant selective pressure on vector populations."
https://openalex.org/W2026210863,"Mon1 and Ccz1 were identified from a gene deletion library as mutants defective in the vacuolar import of aminopeptidase I (Ape1) via the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. The mon1Δ and ccz1Δ strains also displayed defects in autophagy and pexophagy, degradative pathways that share protein machinery and mechanistic features with the biosynthetic Cvt pathway. Further analyses indicated that Mon1, like Ccz1, was required in nearly all membrane-trafficking pathways where the vacuole represented the terminal acceptor compartment. Accordingly, both deletion strains had kinetic defects in the biosynthetic delivery of resident vacuolar hydrolases through the CPY, ALP, and MVB pathways. Biochemical and microscopy studies suggested that Mon1 and Ccz1 functioned after transport vesicle formation but before (or at) the fusion step with the vacuole. Thus, ccz1Δ andmon1Δ are the first mutants identified in screens for the Cvt and Apg pathways that accumulate precursor Ape1 within completed cytosolic vesicles. Subcellular fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that Mon1 and Ccz1 physically interact as a stable protein complex termed the Ccz1-Mon1 complex. Microscopy of Ccz1 and Mon1 tagged with a fluorescent marker indicated that the Ccz1-Mon1 complex peripherally associated with a perivacuolar compartment and may attach to the vacuole membrane in agreement with their proposed function in fusion.

Compartmentalization allows eukaryotic cells to regulate intracellular functions by separating competing reactions and localizing enzymes and substrates at specific locations within the cell. Efficient compartmentalization necessitates dynamic protein trafficking processes by which cells are able to establish and maintain the identity and function of each organelle. The vacuole (lysosome) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays a central role in the turnover of cytoplasmic organelles, degradation of intracellular/extracellular components, and maintenance of cellular physiology (1Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Google Scholar). To carry out these functions, the vacuole maintains a variety of degradative enzymes. Both resident hydrolases and their substrates arrive at this destination through a variety of sorting pathways. The main routes by which vacuolar hydrolases are delivered to this organelle are the carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), 1The abbreviations used are: CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; Ape1, aminopeptidase I; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; Cvt, cytoplasm to vacuole targeting; GFP, green fluorescent protein; prApe1, precursor aminopeptidase I; PVC, pre-vacuolar compartment; SMD, synthetic minimal medium with dextrose; SD/-N, synthetic minimal medium with dextrose but lacking nitrogen; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; ORF, open reading frame; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and multivesicular body (MVB) pathways, which involve transit through a portion of the secretory pathway, and the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway by which the cargo molecules are packaged as cytosolic membrane-bound intermediates (2Kim J. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 198: 153-201Google Scholar, 3Lemmon S.K. Traub L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 457-466Google Scholar). Resident proteins are also transmitted by inheritance from mother cell vacuoles to daughter cells during cell division (4Weisman L.S. Wickner W. Science. 1988; 241: 589-591Google Scholar). Substrates enter the vacuole through endocytosis, autophagy and the vacuole import and degradation pathway (reviewed in Ref. 5Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Google Scholar). One common feature in all of these processes is membrane fusion. The membrane fusion mechanism acts to ensure specificity for the directed movement of proteins while also maintaining the distinct composition of each organelle within the highly compartmentalized eukaryotic cell. The cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway that is used to deliver the soluble hydrolase aminopeptidase I (Ape1) to the vacuole has been under investigation (for reviews see Refs. 2Kim J. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 198: 153-201Google Scholar, 5Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Google Scholar, and 6Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10807-10810Google Scholar). Under vegetative conditions, precursor Ape1 (prApe1) is assembled into a large Cvt complex composed in part of multiple prApe1 dodecamers in the cytosol that becomes enwrapped within a double-membrane Cvt vesicle (7Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Google Scholar). Upon completion, the cytosolic Cvt vesicle targets to the vacuole. The outer membrane of the Cvt vesicle fuses with the vacuole membrane and the intact inner vesicle (Cvt body) passes into the vacuole lumen (8Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Google Scholar). The Cvt body is ultimately broken down by resident vacuolar hydrolases, resulting in the release and maturation of prApe1. Precursor Ape1 is transported to the vacuole by another pathway, termed autophagy (Apg), under starvation conditions (2Kim J. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 198: 153-201Google Scholar, 9Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Google Scholar). In the Apg pathway, portions of cytoplasm are sequestered within relatively larger double membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) that are also targeted to the vacuole (7Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Google Scholar). Although Apg is a degradative process, mutants defective in autophagy,apg/aut, overlap with cvt mutants (10Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Google Scholar). Morphological and biochemical analyses further indicate that the Cvt and Apg pathways use analogous mechanisms (2Kim J. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 198: 153-201Google Scholar, 5Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Google Scholar, 9Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Google Scholar). To gain additional insight into the Cvt/Apg pathways, we screened a gene deletion library for mutants that are defective in prApe1 maturation. We found two mutants that are required for Cvt/Apg import that had not been previously implicated in these pathways. The product of one of these genes, Ccz1, has been suggested to be involved in multiple trafficking pathways to the vacuole (11Kucharczyk R. Dupre S. Avaro S. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Slonimski P.P. Rytka J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4301-4311Google Scholar). Overexpression of the Rab protein Ypt7 rescues the sensitivity to calcium, caffeine, and zinc observed with the ccz1Δ strain. The Ypt7K127E mutant has been identified as a specific mutation that suppresses the ccz1Δ phenotype (12Kucharczyk R. Kierzek A.M. Slonimski P.P. Rytka J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3137-3145Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation data further support the physical interaction between Ccz1 and Ypt7 (12Kucharczyk R. Kierzek A.M. Slonimski P.P. Rytka J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3137-3145Google Scholar). The mon1Δ strain is sensitive to monensin and brefeldin A (13Muren E. Oyen M. Barmark G. Ronne H. Yeast. 2001; 18: 163-172Google Scholar), but is otherwise uncharacterized. In this study, we show that strains lacking either of these two proteins have similar phenotypes. Both Mon1 and Ccz1 are required not only for the Cvt/Apg pathways but also other vacuole biogenesis processes including the sorting of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins through the CPY, ALP, and MVB pathways and endocytosis. Biochemical and morphological evidence further indicate that the Cvt/Apg pathways are blocked at a stage after the formation of the sequestering vesicles but prior to their fusion with the vacuole. These studies also suggest that Ccz1 and Mon1 co-localize to a unique membrane and that they physically interact. Finally, we demonstrate the in vivo localization of these two proteins to a perivacuolar compartment and the vacuole membrane, a site consistent with their proposed role in fusion. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Synthetic minimal medium (SMD) contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and auxotrophic amino acids and vitamins as needed.

CompleteTMEDTA-free protease inhibitor was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The pME3 vector containing the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIS5 auxotrophic marker was a gift from Dr. Neta Dean (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). The pFA6a knockout and tagging vectors containing TRP1, HIS3, orKanMX markers were generous gifts from Dr. Mark Longtine (Oklahoma State University) (14Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Google Scholar). The CFP (pDH3) and YFP (pDH5) plasmids were from the Yeast Resource Center (University of Washington). FM 4-64 dye was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Antisera against Ape1 (15Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Google Scholar), Prc1 (16Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol.

Antisera against Pgk1, Ypt7, and Anp1 were provided by Dr. Jeremy Thorner (University of California, Berkeley, CA), Dr. William Wickner (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH), and Dr. Sean Munro (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK), respectively. Antibodies against Pho8, Dpm1, and Pep12 were obtained from Molecular Probes, and the anti-HA antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). To prepare antiserum against Mon1, the NH2 terminus of the Mon1 ORF (1–585 bp) was PCR-amplified and fused to the COOH terminus of the maltose-binding protein. The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. colistrain BL21. Fusion protein purification and antiserum generation were as described (17Wang C.-W. Kim J. Huang W.-P. Abeliovich H. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30442-30451Google Scholar). AMATα haploid gene deletion library was obtained from ResGen/Invitrogen Corporation (Huntsville, AL). The mutants provided from the company were inoculated on YPD plates and incubated at 30 °C for 12–24 h. The cells on YPD plates were collect and resuspended in 50 μl of MURB (50 mm NaPO4, 25 mm MES, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 3 m urea, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) and converted into crude cell extracts by glass bead lysis and boiling. The extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-Ape1 antisera. The chromosomal MON1 and CCZ1 loci were deleted by a PCR-based, one-step procedure (18Noda T. Kim J. Huang W.-P. Baba M. Tokunaga C. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 465-480Google Scholar). In brief, the corresponding auxotrophic marker was amplified from the pME3 or pFA6a knockout plasmids by PCR using oligonucleotides that contained sequences outside of the marker, flanked by sequences that encode regions at the beginning and end of the corresponding ORFs. PCR products were used to transform yeast strain SEY6210. Putative knockout strains were checked by Western blot for the Ape1 phenotype. Similar strategies were applied for the chromosomal HA and fluorescent protein tagging. To clone theMON1 and CCZ1 genes, both ORFs and their upstream/downstream sequences were PCR-amplified using genomic DNA as template. The resulting PCR products for MON1 include 360 bp before the sequence encoding the start codon and 405 bp after the stop codon. The fragments were digested with SacI andSmaI and inserted into the SacI andSmaI site of the pRS416/426 vector to generate plasmids pMON1(416/426). The PCR products for the cloning of CCZ1contain ∼300-bp upstream and 700-bp downstream of the CCZ1ORF. The PCR products were digested with KpnI to generate pCCZ1(416/426). To construct COOH-terminal HA epitope-tagged Ccz1, theCCZ1 ORF was PCR-amplified using pCCZ1(416) as a template. The resulting PCR product was digested and inserted into pRS416HA and pRS426HA that contains a 3×HA epitope (19Rehling P. Darsow T. Katzmann D.J. Emr S.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 346-353Google Scholar). To construct an NH2-terminal YFP fusion to Mon1, the MON1 ORF was PCR-amplified using pMON1 (416) as a template. The resulting PCR products were inserted into pCuYFP (306) to generate pCuYFP-MON1 (306). The construct was linearized with KpnI and transformed into strain PSY44 to replace endogenous MON1 with pCuYFP-MON1 (strain PSY45). The plasmids pCvt19-CFP(414) (20Kim J. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E.

All oligonucleotide sequences and additional details of the plasmid constructions will be provided upon request. Immunoblot analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (25Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis of Prc1, yeast cells were grown to an OD600 of 1.0 and converted into spheroplasts. The spheroplasts from 20 OD600 units of cells were resuspended in 300 μl of SMD medium containing 1.3m sorbitol, and labeled with 20 μCi of Tran[35S] label for 5 min, followed by a chase reaction in SMD containing 1.3 m sorbitol, 0.2% yeast extract, 4 mm methionine, and 2 mm cysteine at a final density of 2.0 OD600/ml. Samples were removed at the indicated time points and 1 mm NaN3 was added to stop the reaction. The samples were subjected to a 5,000 ×g centrifugation for 3 min. The resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were separately precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were resuspended in MURB buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (25Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Google Scholar). For kinetic analyses of Ape1, Pep4, and Ste3, yeast cells were grown to an OD600 of 1.0 in SMD medium. Cells (20 OD600units) were resuspended in 300 μl of SMD medium and labeled with 20 μCi of Tran[35S] label for 5–10 min, followed by a chase reaction as above at a final density of 20 OD600/ml. Samples were removed at the indicated time points and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Crude extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (25Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Google Scholar). Cell viability and starvation curves and peroxisome degradation rates were determined as described previously (17Wang C.-W. Kim J. Huang W.-P. Abeliovich H. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30442-30451Google Scholar). The membrane flotation assay was performed essentially by the method described previously (26Kim J. Kamada Y. Stromhaug P.E. Guan J. Hefner-Gravink A. Baba M. Scott S.V. Ohsumi Y. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 381-396Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Spheroplasts derived from the mon1Δstrain were resuspended in PS200 lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol) containing 5 mmMgCl2 at a spheroplast density of 20 OD600/ml. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet fractions from 10 OD600 units of cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 15% Ficoll-400 (w/v) in lysis buffer with or without the addition of 0.2% Triton X-100. The resuspended pellet fractions were overlaid with 1 ml of 13% Ficoll-400 in lysis buffer and then overlaid with 200 μl of 2% Ficoll-400 in lysis buffer. The resulting step gradient was subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The top 500 μl was designated as the float fraction (F), the remaining solution was considered as the nonfloat fraction (NF), and the gradient pellet was designated as the pellet fraction (P). The three fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, washed twice with acetone, and analyzed by immunoblot. The protease protection assay was performed as described previously (17Wang C.-W. Kim J. Huang W.-P. Abeliovich H. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30442-30451Google Scholar). In brief, log-phase cultures were subjected to osmotic lysis in PS200 containing 5 mmMgCl2. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet fractions (P13) were resuspended in lysis buffer in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml proteinase K and/or 0.2% Triton X-100. Reactions were carried out on ice for 30 min followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and immunoblot analysis. Mon1-HA cells expressing pCcz1-HA(416) were grown to mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.6) in SMD medium. The cells were converted into spheroplasts and resuspended in PS200 lysis buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 and the CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture at a density of 20 OD600/ml. After a preclearing spin (500 × g, for 5 min, at 4 °C), the total lysate was subjected to low-speed centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min), resulting in the supernatant (S13) and pellet (P13) fractions. The S13 fraction was subjected to high speed centrifugation (100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C) to generate the supernatant (S100) and pellet (P100) fractions. The resulting fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis. To examine membrane binding of Ccz1-HA and Mon1-HA the membrane fractions from lysed spheroplasts were treated with 1m KCl, 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 10.5), 3 m urea, or 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (17Wang C.-W. Kim J. Huang W.-P. Abeliovich H. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30442-30451Google Scholar). OptiPrep™ density gradient analysis was performed using a modification of a previously described procedure (17Wang C.-W. Kim J. Huang W.-P. Abeliovich H. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30442-30451Google Scholar). In brief, a Mon1-HA strain expressing Ccz1-HA was grown to mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.6) and converted into spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were subjected to osmotic lysis in PS200 containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysate was subjected to very low speed centrifugation (800 × gfor 5 min) to remove the remaining intact spheroplasts. After this preclearing step, the crude lysate from 35 OD600 units of cells was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting total membrane fraction was resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer and then applied on top of a density gradient (12 ml, linear) consisting of 10–55% OptiPrep™ in PS200 lysis buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture. The gradients were subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 12 h at 4 °C in a Sorvall Th-641 rotor. Samples were collected from the top of the gradients into 14 fractions. The fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and washed twice with acetone followed by immunoblot analyses. The protocol for co-immunoprecipitation with Ccz1-HA was modified from a previously described procedure (12Kucharczyk R. Kierzek A.M. Slonimski P.P. Rytka J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3137-3145Google Scholar). In brief, 10 OD600 units of log-phase cells were lysed with glass beads in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) with the addition of protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After a 10-min solubilization on ice, total cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. To the resulting supernatant, 10 μl of anti-HA antiserum was added followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. Sepharose beads were washed with lysis buffer a total of eight times. Bound proteins were eluted in MURB followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. All strains used for microscopy were grown in SMD medium to mid-log phase. In vivo FM 4–64 staining was performed as described previously (27Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Google Scholar). Microscopy analysis was performed using a Nikon E-800 fluorescent microscope (Mager Scientific Inc., Dexter, MI). Images were captured by an ORCA II CCD camera (Hamamatsu Corp., Bridgewater, NJ) using Openlab 3 software (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA). Although various cvt, apg, andaut mutants defective in the Cvt and Apg pathways have been isolated and analyzed (reviewed in Refs. 5Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Google Scholar and 28Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Google Scholar), many questions concerning these pathways remain to be answered. We are interested in the molecular mechanism governing the dynamic aspects of the Cvt and Apg pathways. We reasoned that the identification of additional mutants would provide further insight into the protein machinery of these processes. Accordingly, we screened a haploid gene deletion library based on the accumulation of prApe1, a cargo protein that is delivered to the vacuole through the Cvt/Apg pathways. Among the new mutants identified, mon1Δ and ccz1Δ showed a complete block in prApe1 maturation. Although mon1Δ has not been previously reported as having a role in the Cvt pathway, complementation analyses indicate that CCZ1 is allelic withCVT16, a previously uncharacterized CVT gene (10Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Google Scholar). The ccz1Δ mutant was originally identified due to its sensitivity to caffeine, calcium, andzinc (29Kucharczyk R. Gromadka R. Migdalski A. Slonimski P.P. Rytka J. Yeast. 1999; 15: 987-1000Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the strain displays a severe vacuole protein-sorting defect. Immunofluorescent data suggest that Ccz1 localizes to the endosomal compartment, and it has been suggested to act in concert with the Rab protein Ypt7 (11Kucharczyk R. Dupre S. Avaro S. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Slonimski P.P. Rytka J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4301-4311Google Scholar, 12Kucharczyk R. Kierzek A.M. Slonimski P.P. Rytka J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3137-3145Google Scholar). There has not been a published report describing Mon1 function. TheMON1 gene, YGL124c, encodes a 644-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 73.5 kDa. A data base search indicates that Mon1 does not have homology with other proteins ofS. cerevisiae. However, possible homologues having 24–37% identity with Mon1 exist in S. pombe,Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. Ccz1 has no significant homologues. When wild type cells are grown under nutrient-rich conditions, the majority of Ape1 is present as the 50-kDa mature form (Fig.1 A), although a small fraction is present as the 61-kDa precursor. In contrast, both themon1Δ and ccz1Δ strains accumulated only the precursor form of Ape1. The defect in prApe1 processing in these mutants was rescued by expressing either single or multicopy versions of the corresponding genes on plasmids, confirming the essential roles of Mon1 and Ccz1 for the Cvt pathway (Fig. 1 A). Precursor Ape1 is delivered to the vacuole through autophagy under starvation conditions. We utilized a starvation-sensitivity analysis to determine whether the mon1Δ and ccz1Δ strains were able to carry out autophagy. Wild type cells, or mutants specific to the Cvt pathway, are starvation-resistant while mutants defective for autophagy lose viability in the absence of nitrogen (17Wang C.-W. Kim J. Huang W.-P. Abeliovich H. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30442-30451Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 B, the wild type strain was resistant to starvation over the time course examined. In contrast, mon1Δ andccz1Δ strains, similar to the apg1Δ mutant, displayed a rapid loss of viability in SD-N medium. Viability in themon1Δ strain was restored when these cells expressed Mon1 from a CEN-based plasmid. Starvation-sensitivity indicates that autophagy is not fully functional in the mon1Δ and ccz1Δ strains. Recently, however, we have demonstrated that some mutants that are autophagy defective by this criterion are still able to induce the formation of autophagosomes under starvation conditions. For example, theaut7Δ strain is starvation-sensitive but is able to induce the formation of small, abnormal autophagosomes in SD-N (30Abeliovich H. Dunn Jr., W.A. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1034Google Scholar). In addition, some components of the Cvt and Apg pathways are only essential for one of these two pathways. For example, Vac8 and Cvt9 are only required for the Cvt pathway whereas Apg17 appears to function only in autophagy (26Kim J. Kamada Y. Stromhaug P.E. Guan J. Hefner-Gravink A. Baba M. Scott S.V.

https://openalex.org/W2079165221,"We examined whether Gbx2 is required after embryonic day 9 (E9) to repress Otx2 in the cerebellar anlage and position the midbrain/hindbrain organizer. In contrast to Gbx2 null mutants, mice lacking Gbx2 in rhombomere 1 (r1) after E9 (Gbx2-CKO) are viable and develop a cerebellum. A Gbx2-independent pathway can repress Otx2 in r1 after E9. Mid/hindbrain organizer gene expression, however, continues to be dependent on Gbx2. We found that Fgf8 expression normally correlates with the isthmus where cells undergo low proliferation and that in Gbx2-CKO mutants this domain is expanded. We propose that Fgf8 permits lateral cerebellar development through repression of Otx2 and also suppresses medial cerebellar growth in Gbx2-CKO embryos. Our work has uncovered distinct requirements for Gbx2 during cerebellum formation and provided a model for how a transcription factor can play multiple roles during development."

TSC1 and TSC2 form a physical and functional complex to regulate cell growth. Recently, it has been demonstrated that TSC1·TSC2 functions to inhibit ribosomal S6 kinase and negatively regulate cell size. TSC2 is negatively regulated by Akt phosphorylation. Here, we report that TSC2, but not TSC1, associates with 14-3-3 in vivo. Phosphorylation of Ser1210 in TSC2 is required for its association with 14-3-3.

TSC is caused by mutation in either the TSC1 (hamartin) or TSC2 (tuberin) gene, of which each contributes to ∼50% of the genetic defects (1Young J. Povey S. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 313-319Google Scholar, 2Crino P.B. Henske E.P. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1384-1390Google Scholar). Studies of TSC patients and animal models support the hypothesis that TSC1 and TSC2 are tumor suppressor genes. Homozygous deletion of either TSC1 or TSC2 in mice produces an embryonic lethal phenotype, suggesting an essential function in development. As predicted, heterozygous deletion of either TSC1 or TSC2 in mice results in a significant increase of carcinomas in many tissues with a 100% incidence of renal carcinomas (3Onda H. Lueck A. Marks P.W. Warren H.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 687-695Google Scholar, 4Kobayashi T. Minowa O. Sugitani Y. Takai S. Mitani H. Kobayashi E. Noda T. Hino O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8762-8767Google Scholar). Mutation of TSC1 or TSC2 results in similar phenotypes, suggesting that the two proteins function in the same pathway. Biochemical studies have shown that TSC1 and TSC2 form a stable complex (5van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Google Scholar). Genetic studies inDrosophila have demonstrated that TSC1·TSC2 plays a major negative role in the regulation of cell growth. Mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2 results in a significant increase of cell mass inDrosophila (6Gao X. Pan D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1383-1392Google Scholar, 7Potter C.J. Huang H. Xu T.

Overexpression of either TSC1 or TSC2 inDrosophila produces little phenotype, while co-expression of both TSC1 and TSC2 causes a significant reduction of cell size. Furthermore, genetic epistatic studies indicate that TSC1·TSC2 acts downstream of the insulin receptor (6Gao X. Pan D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1383-1392Google Scholar, 7Potter C.J. Huang H. Xu T.

Recently, we and other groups have demonstrated that TSC1·TSC2 functions to inhibit S6K activation (9Gao X. Zhang Y. Arrazola P. Hino O. Kobayashi T. Yeung R.S. Ru B. Pan D. Nat.

Heiberger K.M. Glogauer M. el-Hashemite N. Onda H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 525-534Google Scholar). In TSC1−/− or TSC2−/− cells, S6K is highly activated. S6K activation requires phosphorylation of multiple sites. Interestingly, TSC1·TSC2 specifically inhibits the phosphorylation of Thr389, but not phosphorylation of Thr421 and Ser424 in S6K. Thr389is the primary site phosphorylated by mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) (15Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Google Scholar). Furthermore, TSC1·TSC2 also inhibits phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1), which is also an mTOR target. Both genetic data and biochemical data indicate that TSC1·TSC2 inhibits the function of mTOR (9Gao X. Zhang Y. Arrazola P. Hino O. Kobayashi T. Yeung R.S. Ru B. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 699-704Google Scholar, 11Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Google Scholar). Several groups, including ours, have shown that TSC2 is directly phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt (11Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Google Scholar, 12Porter C.J. Pedraza L.G. Xu T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 658-665Google Scholar, 13Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Google Scholar). These studies provide an important link between TSC2 and growth factor signaling. In this report, we show that TSC2 interacts with 14-3-3, but not the binding-defective 14-3-3 mutant. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of TSC2. We have identified that Ser1210 of TSC2 is phosphorylated in vivo and is the primary binding site of 14-3-3. In contrast, mutation of all AKT phosphorylation sites in TSC2 had no effect on its interaction with 14-3-3. Overexpression of 14-3-3 enhanced phosphorylation of both S6K and 4E-BP1. Furthermore we demonstrated that interaction between TSC2 and 14-3-3 is also modulated by serum starvation. Anti-phospho-S6K and anti-phospho-4E-BP1 were from Cell Signaling Inc. and anti-TSC2, anti-TSC2 blocking peptide, anti-14-3-3β (K-19), anti-14-3-3β (C-20), anti-14-3-3θ, anti-14-3-3ζ, anti-14-3-3γ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-HA and anti-Myc were from Covance; anti-FLAG and mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma. Rat TSC1 and TSC2 constructs were generously provided by Dr. Y. Xiong. HA-tagged S6K1 and all other DNA constructs including Myc-1433β, Myc-1433β-DN (dominant negative), and FLAG-4E-BP1 were laboratory stocks. Expressions of those plasmids are controlled by the pCMV promoter. Mutant constructs of TSC2 were created by PCR mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells and Phoenix (retrovirus packaging cells) were seeded and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). LExF2 (TSC2−/− cell line) were cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS (16Yeung R.S. Xiao G.H. Jin F. Lee W.C. Testa J.R. Knudson A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11413-11416Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINETM Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transiently transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. Immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids. The serum-starved cells were washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM and incubated with 0.25 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) for 4 h. HA-tagged TSC2 was immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phosphorylated TSC2 was visualized by autoradiography. Phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described previously (11Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Google Scholar). The TSC2 cDNA was subcloned to the retrovirial vector pPGS-CMV-CITE-Neo. The vectors containing TSC2 were transfected into the Phoenix retrovirus packaging cell line using the calcium phosphate method (Profection Kit, Promega). 48 h post-transfection, retrovirus produced by the Phoenix cells was used for infection of LExF2 cells. LExF2 cells stably expressing TSC2 were selected for and maintained by G418 (300 μg/ml). We have previously found that TSC2 is negatively regulated by AKT phosphorylation (11Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Google Scholar). Akt recognition sequences often overlap with putative 14-3-3 binding sites (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar, 18Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Google Scholar). 14-3-3 has been shown to regulate the function of many cellular proteins via a direct association (19Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Google Scholar). We tested whether TSC2 interacts with 14-3-3 in HEK293 cells. Our data showed that 14-3-3β co-precipitated with HA-TSC2 (Fig.1 a). In contrast, a dominant negative 14-3-3, which is unable to bind target proteins (20Thorson J.A. Yu L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Google Scholar), did not associate with TSC1·TSC2 (Fig. 1 a). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation confirmed that TSC2 could be immunoprecipitated with 14-3-3 (Fig. 2 a). 14-3-3 is a family of highly related proteins with numerous isoforms. We found that HEK293 cells express 14-3-3 β, γ, θ, and ζ. Our results showed that TSC2 interacts with all endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms tested present in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 b). These results suggest that TSC2 interacts with different 14-3-3 isoforms.Figure 2TSC2, but not TSC1, interacts with 14-3-3. a, binding of TSC2 with co-transfected 14-3-3. HEK293 cells were transfected with 100 ng of Myc-TSC1, HA-TSC2, and FLAG-14-3-3β as indicated.

IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To demonstrate that TSC2 interacts with 14-3-3 under physiological conditions, we immunoprecipitated endogenous TSC2 from 293 cells. Western blot with the anti-14-3-3β (K-19) antibody, which recognizes all 14-3-3 isoforms, indicated that TSC2 associates with 14-3-3 under physiological conditions (Fig. 1 c). Preincubation of the TSC2 antibody with a competing peptide completely eliminated TSC2 and the co-precipitated 14-3-3 (Fig. 1 c). These results demonstrated that TSC2 is associated with 14-3-3 under physiological conditions and suggest that 14-3-3 may play a role in the regulation of TSC2. TSC1 and TSC2 form a physical and functional complex in vivo. To determine whether the TSC1·TSC2 complex, TSC1 or TSC2 alone interacts with 14-3-3, HEK293 cells were transfected with these constructs, and co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed. Immunoprecipitation of 14-3-3 β did not bring down TSC1 alone. Co-precipitation of 14-3-3 and TSC1 was observed only when TSC2 was present in the transfection (Fig. 2 a), indicating that TSC1 alone cannot interact with 14-3-3. In contrast, 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitated with TSC2 regardless of the presence of TSC1. These results demonstrate that 14-3-3 can interact with TSC2 alone or the TSC1·TSC2 complex. The interaction between transfected TSC2, but not TSC1, and endogenous 14-3-3 further confirmed that 14-3-3 interacts with TSC2 or with the TSC1·TSC2 complex, but not with TSC1 (Fig. 2 b). Interestingly, 14-3-3 interacts with TSC2 stronger than with the TSC1·TSC2 complex (Fig.2). We tested the effect of 14-3-3 on the TSC1·TSC2 complex and found that 14-3-3 had no significant effect on the complex formation between TSC1 and TSC2 (data not shown). Serial deletions of TSC2 were constructed to locate the domain responsible for 14-3-3 interaction. Our results showed that fragments 1–608, 1–1080, 1–1200, and 1321–1765 did not bind 14-3-3, while fragments 1–1320, 1101–1320, 1080–1765 interacted with 14-3-3 at a level similar to the wild type TSC2 (Fig. 3 a). These data demonstrate that the 14-3-3 binding site in TSC2 is localized between residues 1101 and 1320. It has been well established that 14-3-3 binds to phosphorylated residues with a consensus recognition sequence (18Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Google Scholar). We first tested whether the Akt phosphorylation sites are required for 14-3-3 binding. The TSC2–6A mutant, which has all six predicted Akt phosphorylation sites (residues 939, 1086, 1088, 1378, 1422, 1756) substituted by alanine (11Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Google Scholar), still binds to 14-3-3 at a level no different from wild type TSC2 (Fig.3 b). This observation shows that the 14-3-3 binding site in TSC2 is different from the Akt phosphorylation sites. Sequence analysis by scansite (www.scansite.mit.edu) (21Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Google Scholar) predicts that TSC2 contains several putative 14-3-3 binding sites. We created single and double mutations by substituting the top four predicted 14-3-3 binding sites (Fig. 3 b). Our data demonstrated that Ser1210 is essential for 14-3-3 binding, while mutations of the other putative sites had no effect on 14-3-3 binding (Fig.3 b). These data are completely consistent with the deletion data that fragment 1101–1320 contains the 14-3-3 binding site. We further mutated Ser1210 in the fragment 1101–1320 and confirmed that Ser1210 is essential for 14-3-3 binding (Fig. 3 b). Therefore, TSC2 utilizes Ser1210 as the primary 14-3-3 binding site. We wanted to test whether the interaction between 14-3-3 and TSC2 requires the phosphorylation of TSC2. GST-TSC2 was expressed and purified from transfected HEK293 cells. Purified GST-TSC2 was treated with λ-phosphatase. Dephosphorylation of GST-TSC2 is evident by an increased electrophoretic mobility of the protein (Fig.4 a). The purified GST-TSC2 was incubated with immunoprecipitated Myc-14-3-3β and the co-precipitation of GST-TSC2 by Myc-14-3-3β was determined. Treatment with phosphatase completely eliminated the interaction between GST-TSC2 and Myc-14-3-3β (Fig. 4 a). To directly demonstrate the phosphorylation status of Ser1210 in TSC2, we performed in vivo 32P labeling and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of TSC2. The TSC2/S1210A mutant eliminated a single phosphopeptide spot depicted by the arrow in Fig. 4 b, while the rest of phosphopeptides were unchanged (Fig. 4 b). These results strongly indicate that Ser1210 is an in vivo phosphorylation site in TSC2. Binding of 14-3-3 may modulate the cellular function of TSC2. We have shown that one of the physiological functions of TSC1·TSC2 is to inhibit S6K activation. In TSC2−/− LExF2 cells, S6K is highly activated. The abilities of wild type and 14-3-3 binding-defective mutant TSC2 to inhibit S6K were tested in the TSC2−/− cells. We observed that both wild type and the 14-3-3 binding-defective TSC2 could inhibit S6K (Fig. 4 c). These data indicate that 14-3-3 binding may not modulate the ability of TSC2 to inhibit S6K. However, the lack of a difference between the wild type and the mutant TSC2 could be due to the fact that the majority of the expressed TSC2 is not phosphorylated on Ser1210, therefore, free of 14-3-3 binding. Our two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping data also indicates that the majority of TSC2 is not phosphorylated on Ser1210, because the intensity of this phosphopeptide is significantly weaker compared with the Akt phosphorylation site Ser939 (Fig.4 b) (11Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Google Scholar). Sequences surrounding Ser1210 have limited resemblance to PKA and PKC-δ phosphorylation sites. Inhibition of PKA (data not shown) or PKC-δ by rottlerin had no effect on the interaction between TSC2 and 14-3-3 (Fig. 4 d). We also observed that inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway by wortmannin and the ERK pathway by PD90589 had no effect on the interaction (Fig.4 d), which suggests that the Akt phosphorylation sites are not involved. Interestingly, serum starvation resulted in a visible reduction of association between TSC2 and 14-3-3 (Fig. 4 d). The above data indicate that the complex formation between TSC2 and 14-3-3 may be modulated by cell growth status. To test the effect of 14-3-3 on downstream effectors of TSC2, we examined the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1. Phosphorylation of these two proteins was inhibited by TSC1·TSC2. We discovered that co-expression of 14-3-3β elevated the Thr389 phosphorylation of S6K (Fig. 4 e). Similarly, expression of 14-3-3β also enhanced the basal phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 4 e). These observations indicate that 14-3-3 may negatively regulate the functions of TSC2. The cellular functions of the TSC1·TSC2 tumor suppressor gene products have just begun to be elucidated. TSC1·TSC2 plays an important role in cell growth regulation and cell size control. Recent studies have demonstrated the TSC2 protein was phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt-dependent phosphorylation (11Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Google Scholar, 12Porter C.J. Pedraza L.G. Xu T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 658-665Google Scholar, 13Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that TSC2 binds to 14-3-3 under physiological conditions. We have mapped a single site, Ser1210, in TSC2 responsible for binding with 14-3-3. The binding of 14-3-3 requires the phosphorylation of Ser1210. During the preparation of this manuscript, Nellist et al. (22Nellist M. Goedbloed M.A. De Winter C. Verhaaf B. Jankie A. Reuser A.J. Van Den Ouweland A.M. Van Der Sluijs P. Halley D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39417-39429Google Scholar) also reported that TSC2 interacts with 14-3-3. However, they showed that 14-3-3 binds to multiple sites in TSC2 and concluded that the Akt phosphorylation sites in TSC2 are responsible for 14-3-3 binding (22Nellist M. Goedbloed M.A. De Winter C. Verhaaf B. Jankie A. Reuser A.J. Van Den Ouweland A.M. Van Der Sluijs P. Halley D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39417-39429Google Scholar). We have no obvious explanation why the data by Nellist et al. (22Nellist M. Goedbloed M.A. De Winter C. Verhaaf B. Jankie A. Reuser A.J. Van Den Ouweland A.M. Van Der Sluijs P. Halley D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39417-39429Google Scholar) are dramatically different from ours. Nevertheless, our data clearly indicate that one major 14-3-3 binding site exists in TSC2, and Akt phosphorylation sites are not responsible for 14-3-3 binding. Overexpression of 14-3-3 results in elevated phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1. In contrast, overexpression of TSC1·TSC2 suppresses the phosphorylation of these two proteins, indicating 14-3-3 and TSC1·TSC2 have opposite effects on S6K activation. Our results indicate that 14-3-3 binds to phosphorylated TSC2 and may suppress its activity. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the interaction between TSC2 and 14-3-3 is decreased under serum-starved conditions. Serum starvation is predicted to activate TSC2 and suppress cell growth. The dissociation of 14-3-3 may partly contribute to TSC2 activation and S6K inhibition under conditions of serum starvation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the effect of 14-3-3 on S6K and 4E-BP1 may not be mediated by TSC2. It has been reported that 14-3-3 may positively modulate the function of TOR in yeast (23Bertram P.G. Zeng C. Thorson J. Shaw A.S. Zheng X.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1259-1267Google Scholar). 14-3-3 has also been shown to interact with mTOR (24Mori H. Inoue M. Yano M. Wakabayashi H. Kido H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 61-64Google Scholar). Therefore, 14-3-3 may regulate S6K and 4E-BP1 through multiple targets. Future studies to identify the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Ser1210 will provide new insights into the mechanism of TSC2 regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2053598967,"Rab11-FIP2 is a member of a newly identified family of Rab11-binding proteins that have been implicated in the function of recycling endosomes. Here we show that Rab11-FIP2 may also be involved with the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. First we demonstrate that Rab11-FIP2 contains an NPF motif that allows it to bind Reps1, a member of a family of EH domain proteins involved in endocytosis. We also show that Rab11-FIP2 associates with the α-adaptin subunit of AP-2 complexes, which are known to recruit receptors into clathrin-coated vesicles. Finally, we find that overexpression of Rab11-FIP2 suppresses the internalization of epidermal growth factor receptors, but not transferrin receptors, through binding sites that promote complex formation with Rab11, Reps1, and α-adaptin. These findings suggest that Rab11-FIP2 may participate in the coupling of receptor-mediated endocytosis to the subsequent sorting of receptor-containing vesicles in endosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1987252571,"The glucosyltransferase amylosucrase is structurally quite similar to the hydrolase α-amylase. How this switch in functionality is achieved is an important and fundamental question. The inactive E328Q amylosucrase variant has been co-crystallized with maltoheptaose, and the structure was determined by x-ray crystallography to 2.2 Å resolution, revealing a maltoheptaose binding site in the B′-domain somewhat distant from the active site. Additional soaking of these crystals with maltoheptaose resulted in replacement of Tris in the active site with maltoheptaose, allowing the mapping of the −1 to +5 binding subsites. Crystals of amylosucrase were soaked with sucrose at different concentrations. The structures at ∼2.1 Å resolution revealed three new binding sites of different affinity. The highest affinity binding site is close to the active site but is not in the previously identified substrate access channel. Allosteric regulation seems necessary to facilitate access from this binding site. The structures show the pivotal role of the B′-domain in the transferase reaction. Based on these observations, an extension of the hydrolase reaction mechanism valid for this enzyme can be proposed. In this mechanism, the glycogen-like polymer is bound in the widest access channel to the active site. The polymer binding introduces structural changes that allow sucrose to migrate from its binding site into the active site and displace the polymer.

In this mechanism, the glycogen-like polymer is bound in the widest access channel to the active site. The polymer binding introduces structural changes that allow sucrose to migrate from its binding site into the active site and displace the polymer. Amylosucrase (AS) 1The abbreviations used are: AS, amylosucrase; OB, oligosaccharide binding site; SB, sucrose binding site; Glc, glucosyl is a bacterial glucosyltransferase (E.C. 2.4.1.4) that catalyzes the transfer of a d-glucopyranosyl moiety from sucrose onto an acceptor molecule. When the acceptor is a polysaccharide, only α-1,4-linkages are produced. In the presence of glycogen, AS catalyzes the transfer of a d-glucose moiety onto a glycogen branch (1Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 103-108Google Scholar), but in the absence of glycogen the reaction pathway is more complex; here, polymer synthesis, hydrolysis of sucrose, synthesis of smaller maltosaccharides, and synthesis of sucrose isoforms are observed (2Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Sarcabal P. Planchot V. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 219-223Google Scholar). Hydrolysis is always just a minor side reaction. The function of AS in vivo is undoubtedly the extension of glycogen-like oligosaccharides, which is clearly demonstrated by the formidable increase in k catobserved when glycogen is present (1Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 103-108Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarities, the enzyme has been placed in the retaining α-glycoside hydrolase family 13 according to Henrissat and Davies (3Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Google Scholar). Family 13 is the largest of all the families and contains mainly enzymes acting on starch, such as α-amylase and cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase), but also included are enzymes specific for the cleavage of other glucosidic linkages such as α-1,6- and α-1,1-bonds. It is widely believed that the catalytic mechanism in family 13 occurs via a double displacement reaction in which a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is formed (4Yoshioka Y. Hasegawa K. Matsuura Y. Katsube Y. Kubota M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 619-628Google Scholar, 5Mosi R. He S.M. Uitdehaag J. Dijkstra B.W. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9927-9934Google Scholar, 6Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Google Scholar, 7Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Google Scholar). The existence of such an intermediate has also been found in the retaining β-glycoside hydrolase lysozyme, about which a detailed structural study has recently been published (8Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Laine R. Withers S.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 835-838Google Scholar). In a subsequent step, this glucosyl moiety is transferred onto a water molecule (main reaction catalyzed by α-amylases) or onto a hydroxyl group from a sugar acceptor in a transglucosylation reaction. Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases however, react intramoleculary with the non-reducing end of the covalently linked heptasaccharide (6Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Google Scholar). Both steps are suggested to proceed via oxocarbenium ion transition states. Full-length AS from Neisseria polysaccharea consists of a single polypeptide chain with 636 amino acid residues, and from sequence alignment the two catalytic acidic residues Asp286 and Glu328 (crystal structure numbering) found in α-amylases were identified (9Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Planchot V. Monsan P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 375-381Google Scholar). The structure of recombinant AS from N. polysaccharea with Tris bound in the active site has been reported recently by Skov et al. (10Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25273-25278Google Scholar). Single site mutational studies of residues Asp286 and Glu328 showed in both cases a total inactivation of AS (11Sarcabal P. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Potocki De Montalk G. Svensson B. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 33-37Google Scholar). Additionally, the mutation of three other active site residues conserved in family 13 (Asp393, His187, and His392) resulted in a large decrease in activity. From these structural and mutational studies, Asp286 was identified as the nucleophile, and Glu328 was identified as the proton donor. The importance of the conserved residues in the active site was further underlined by the structures of AS in complex with the saccharides glucose and sucrose (12Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. Potocki De Montalk G. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Google Scholar). A unique feature for AS is an N-terminal domain (termed N) consisting of 90 residues forming five helices. This domain shows no structural similarity to any known protein structure. Apart from the common α-amylase A-, B-, and C-domains (7Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Google Scholar), it was also observed that AS contained an extra domain (termed B′) between β-strand 7 and α-helix 7 of the (β/α)8 domain, and the absence of this B′-domain in α-amylases led to speculations concerning a possible role in the transferase activity. The proposed catalytic residues of AS lie in the bottom of a pocket, a feature seen in other family 13 enzymes such as the hydrolase oligo-1,6-glucosidase (13Watanabe K. Hata Y. Kizaki H. Katsube Y. Suzuki Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 142-153Google Scholar). Other exo-acting hydrolases, e.g. β-amylase (14Oyama T. Kusunoki M. Kishimoto Y. Takasaki Y. Nitta Y. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 1120-1130Google Scholar) and glucoamylase (15Aleshin A. Golubev A. Firsov L.M. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19291-19298Google Scholar), also exhibit this pocket architecture. Because sucrose is a cheap and renewable d-glucose donor compared with the various nucleotide derivatives, the industrial potential of AS for synthesis of glucan, oligosaccharide, or glucoconjugates is large. For optimal utilization of the enzyme in targeting controlled synthesis of specific α-glucans starting from sucrose, it is, however, necessary to minimize the side reactions. This requires a thorough analysis of the substrate binding and the specificity determining contacts in the active site. Recently, we described the active site interactions between AS and a β-d-glucose molecule (12Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. Potocki De Montalk G. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Google Scholar). We also described the interactions between the inactive active site mutant E328Q and sucrose based on the crystal structure at 2.0 Å resolution. Both complexes gave information on the substrate binding mode. The sucrose complex shows how the substrate binds prior to cleavage of the glucosidic bond, whereas the d-glucose complex mimics the covalent intermediate. However, to gain insight into the other stages of this complex enzymatic reaction it is necessary to study the binding of the other substrate, the oligosaccharide chain to be elongated, and the product regulation of the enzyme. Such information can be obtained through soaking and co-crystallization experiments. In this paper we describe a number of different complexes such as co-crystallized E328Q·Tris·maltoheptaose before and after soaking with maltoheptaose and AS·Tris·sucrose from soaking AS·Tris crystals with three different concentrations of sucrose. Expression and purification of recombinant wild-type AS from N. polysaccharea has been described by Potocki de Montalk et al. (1Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 103-108Google Scholar), and described similarly for the E328Q mutant by Sarçabal et al. (11Sarcabal P. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Potocki De Montalk G. Svensson B. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 33-37Google Scholar). AS and E328Q both lack 10 N-terminal residues as compared with the genomic sequence and contain four additional residues originating from the expression vector. Apart from the intended mutation, the E328Q mutant contains another substitution, H131Y, which is evident from the density maps and probably due to a PCR error. AS crystals were grown as described previously (16Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 203-205Google Scholar). Crystals of the AS variant E328Q with 14 mm maltoheptaose as additive (A crystals) were grown under similar crystallization conditions. These crystals showed a slight difference in morphology (being more cubic) as compared with the thin plate-like crystals obtained previously. Consequently, the diffraction was less anisotropic, and the spots had lower mosaicity. The A crystals were subsequently transferred to a crystallization buffer containing 20 mm maltoheptaose and soaked for 24 h (B crystals). Native AS crystals (C, D, and E) were soaked with a solution mimicking the crystallization conditions supplemented with sucrose as follows: C crystals 14 mm for two h; D crystals, 100 mm for 24 h; and E crystals, 1m for 24 h. The crystals (A–E) were mounted in a thin fiber loop and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data for all crystals were collected at cryogenic temperature (120 K). Processing was done with the HKL package (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab None of the crystals showed any significant changes in the cell dimensions, and the model from the AS·Tris structure (10Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25273-25278Google Scholar) could be used for initial phasing. Refinement was done using CNS (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), and model building and the insertion of saccharides were done in O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar) using ς-A (20Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect A. 1986; 42: 140-149Google Scholar) weighted 2F o −F c, F o −F c, and composite omit maps. For all data sets, 5% of the reflections were set aside for cross-validation. Refinements were initiated with rigid body refinement. Subsequently, standard simulated annealing and minimization protocols from CNS, using the MLF target function along with individual restrained B-factor refinement, were applied. The maltooligosaccharide models were built by patching together glucose molecules with bond lengths and angles from the CNS libraries. For the sucrose molecules, the occupancy was also fitted. Water molecules were included in the models if they returned spherical 1.5 ς density in the 2F o −F c maps and obeyed hydrogen bonding criteria. Anisotropic scaling and bulk solvent correction were applied throughout the refinement. The models were analyzed for stereo chemical properties at the end of the refinement using Procheck (21Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). An analysis of the protein saccharide interactions was done using Ligplot (22Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are also given in Table I. Coordinates for the structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank at Rutgers University with the entries 1MVY, 1MW0, 1MW1, 1MW2, and 1MW3 for crystals A–E, respectively. In three of the structures (A, B, and D) one or more oligosaccharides are identified in specific binding sites. The interactions between AS and carbohydrate are quite similar in the three structures at equivalent binding sites. The B structure has the most extensive carbohydrate-binding network with three maltoheptaose molecules per AS molecule, and a total of 18 glucose units are included in the final model. In addition to electron density from the protein, this crystal structure contains electron densities with an elongated shape corresponding to two saccharides on the surface of the enzyme. The two saccharides are probably maltoheptaose molecules, but the precise length could not be determined. Hence, only two and four glucose units, respectively, are included in the final model because of the weak electron density of the other residues. For both oligosaccharide binding (OB) sites, the positions of one of the glucosyl units coincide with the positions of the glucose molecules found in the AS·glucose structure (12Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. Potocki De Montalk G. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Google Scholar). We therefore adopt the same binding site numbering, i.e. the active site is OB1, the first surface binding site is OB2, and the second surface binding site is OB3. Accordingly, the polysaccharide modeled with four glucose units is found in OB2 on the B′-domain, whereas the chain with two units is found in OB3. OB3 is located at the surface of the C-terminal β-sandwich domain. A Tris molecule is bound in the active site (OB1). The different binding sites are labeled in Fig. 1, and the hydrogen bonding interactions in OB2 are illustrated in Fig.2. The four glucosyl (Glc) rings modeled in OB2 are Glc724, Glc735, Glc726, and Glc727, where Glc727 is the reducing end of the maltoheptaose molecule. All four glucose moieties are in the most stable 4C1 configuration, and the conformation of the sugar chain is very similar to that found in a cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase·maltoheptasose complex (23Uitdehaag J.C.M. van Alebeek G.J.W.M. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7772-7780Google Scholar). The conformation of the polysaccharide can be described by the torsion angles φ and ψ across the glucosidic bond. φ is defined with O5 (first unit), C1 (first unit), O1 (bridging atom), C4 (second unit), and ψ with C1 (first unit), O1 (bridging atom), C4 (second unit), and C5 (second unit). The values being Glc724-Glc725 (73°, −148°), Glc725-Glc726 (82°, −152°), and Glc726-Glc727 (101°, −137°). In OB3 the φ,ψ-value for the Glc733-Glc734 bridge is 115°, −112°.Figure 2Schematic representation of the interactions at the OB2 binding site. The numbering of the glucosyl units Glc721–Glc727 (top, 721-727) in the maltoheptaose molecule is also shown. Glc727 is the reducing end.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Here, three well defined carbohydrate chains are identified in the oligosaccharide binding sites OB1, OB2, and OB3. The three sites are indicated in Fig. 1. In OB2, all seven glucosyl rings of a maltoheptaose molecule could be identified. Detailed OB2 interactions are shown in Fig. 2. The chain has the following φ,ψ-values: Glc721-Glc722 (82°, −137°), Glc722-Glc723 (72°, −148°), Glc723-Glc724 (123°, −98°), Glc724-Glc725 (70°, −155°), Glc725-Glc726 (80°, −148°), and Glc726-Glc727 (103°, −132°). The heptasaccharide is bound to the enzyme by 13 direct and 10 water-mediated hydrogen bonds. The binding is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between Phe417 and Glc725 and between Phe426 and Glc726. All interactions except three hydrogen bonds are with residues from the B′ domain. Glc722 and Glc723 are involved in two hydrogen bonds to Arg425 from a symmetry-related molecule. Only Glu365 changes conformation upon binding of the heptasaccharide, enabling it to make a hydrogen bond with Glc725. Under these conditions, the Tris molecule has been displaced from the active site (OB1), and a well defined maltoheptaose molecule is now found here. OB1 includes the α-amylase family −1 and +1 binding sites, which were mapped out previously in the E328Q·sucrose complex (12Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. Potocki De Montalk G. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Google Scholar). A composite omit map of the electron density observed in OB1 is shown in Fig. 3. The electron density is very clear, and five additional connected glucosyl binding sites are determined. Specific interactions with AS amino acids are shown in Fig.4. The maltoheptaose chain has a very distinct kink around the −1,+1 glucosidic bond with a φ-angle of 33° and a ψ-angle of −155°. The rest of the chain has the following φ,ψ-values: Glc712-Glc713 (67°, −148°), Glc713-Glc714 (72°, −170°), Glc714-Glc715 (104°, −129°), Glc715-Glc716 (80°, −152°), and Glc716-Glc717 (102°, −140°). At the non-reducing end of the molecule (in the active site) there are many contacts to the enzyme and only few water molecules. At the other end of the molecule, water contacts dominate. However, the last glucosyl unit (Glc717) has three hydrogen bonding contacts to amino acid side chains from a symmetry-related molecule.Figure 4Schematic representation of the interactions at the OB1 binding site. Subsite numbering from the non-reducing end (left), starting with Glc711 at the −1 subsite, is also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In OB3, the electron density from four of the glucosyl rings of the maltoheptaose molecule could be seen and modeled. The chain has the following φ,ψ-values: Glc731-Glc732 (1°, −134°), Glc732-Glc733 (103°, −143°), and Glc733-Glc734 (114°, −116°). A single sucrose molecule is found in the structure located on the surface of AS. This is referred to as the second sucrose binding site (SB2) because it was shown that the AS mutant E328Q binds sucrose at the active site (12Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. Potocki De Montalk G. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Google Scholar). The binding position is shown on Fig.1 labeled SB2. The residues involved in hydrogen bonding are shown on Fig. 5. No water-mediated hydrogen bonds are observed. Additional interactions include hydrophobic contacts to residues Phe436, Trp498, and Asp506. The pyranose ring of the sucrose moiety is in the most stable chair form, the 4C1 configuration, whereas the furanose is in the 4E envelope form. High B-factors for the sucrose molecule revealed that the binding site was not fully occupied. Further fitting of the sucrose molecule gave an occupancy of 0.77 with a B-factor of 23 Å2. The average B factor for the amino acid residues in AS was 13.9 Å2. A Tris molecule is found in the active site as in the previously published structure (10Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25273-25278Google Scholar) and in the D and E structures described below. A sucrose molecule is located at the same position as in the 14 mm complex with a similar hydrogen bonding pattern and similar hydrophobic interactions to the enzyme. In addition to the residues involved in hydrophobic contacts in the 14 mm complex, there are additional interactions to Val434 and Asp507. The occupancy was found to 0.81 with a B-factor of 20 Å2, indicating a higher occupancy of the sucrose-binding site compared with the 14 mm complex. The average B factor for the amino acid residues in AS was 14.2 Å2 here. A large electron density corresponding to at least a maltotetraose molecule is observed in OB2 in this structure. It is not possible to determine the precise length of the bound oligosaccharide. The carbohydrate-enzyme interactions are very similar to those found in the A-structure. Three molecules of sucrose are found on the surface of AS in this structure. A sucrose molecule very similar to those observed in the C and D crystals is seen here with almost identical enzyme interactions (Figs. 1 and 5). Two additional water-mediated hydrogen bonds are seen. Bave for this sucrose molecule is 17 Å2, indicating full occupation of the site. The average B factor for the amino acid residues in AS was 14.1 Å2. The second sucrose molecule is located near the N-domain of AS. Residues Tyr15 and Arg20 are involved in hydrogen bonding, and two additional water-mediated hydrogen bonds are observed. Apparently, no strong hydrophobic interactions exist in this binding site. The occupancy was found to 0.90 with a B-factor of 21 Å2. The third sucrose found on the AS surface is positioned in the interface between two symmetry-related molecules with interactions to Asn207, Thr592, and Phe559. The occupancy was found to 0.92 with a B-factor of 23 Å2. There is no oligosaccharide observed in this structure. The result of co-crystallizing E328Q with maltoheptaose (crystal A structure) is partial occupation of the surface oligosaccharide-binding site (OB2). In a previous soaking experiment with maltotriose (data not shown), the trisaccharide was also found at this binding site with the glucosyl moieties occupying position similar to Glc724, Glc725, and Glc726 in the B crystals. It is also at this position that an oligosaccharide (probably a reaction product) is found in the D structure (see below). This emphasizes that OB2 most probably is a genuine oligosaccharide binding site in vivo and not a crystallization artifact. The active site is not occupied by an oligosaccharide, but, as in the native structure (10Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25273-25278Google Scholar), a Tris molecule is bound here. This is not very surprising, because Tris was present in the crystallization medium and has been found in the active site of a number of other glycoside hydrolases (24Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1503-1516Google Scholar, 25Sevcik J. Solovicova A. Hostinova E. Gasperik J. Wilson K. Dauter Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 854-866Google Scholar, 26Sabini E. Schubert H. Murshudov G. Wilson K.S. Siika-Aho M. Penttila M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 3-13Google Scholar). However, as seen in the B crystal structure, further soaking of these crystals with maltoheptaose (but without Tris) has two effects. The OB2 site now has all seven subsites occupied (Fig.2), and, in addition, maltoheptaose is now able to exclude Tris from the active site and map out OB1 (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). Apart from the OB2 hydrogen-bonding interactions shown in Fig. 2, a number of hydrophobic interactions are observed, but only one obvious stacking interaction between the glucosyl ring of Glc726 and Phe417 is seen. The detailed interactions between the maltoheptaose and the active site access channel (OB1) are shown in Fig. 4. Using α-amylase nomenclature, these would be the subsites −1 to +6. In contrast to the α-amylases, the active site architecture is of the pocket type in which further negative subsites are blocked by the Asp144-Arg509 salt bridge. The electron density clearly shows that the non-reducing end of the maltoheptaose is at the −1 position. This is one of the few structures wherein a substrate/product spans the active site. It can be seen (Fig. 4) that the conserved residues in the active site are involved in hydrogen bonding with the maltoheptaose molecule. At the reducing end of the maltoheptaose molecule the glucosyl ring of Glc717 has contacts to a symmetry-related E328Q molecule, so only subsites −1 to +5 are expected to be functionally relevant. OB1 lacks aromatic stacking interactions outside the active site (subsites −1,+1), but Arg415 seems to provide a hydrophobic platform for the rings at subsites +4 and +5. The −1 glucosyl moiety of OB1 is bound in a conformation identical to the conformation observed in the previously described AS·d-glucose and E328Q·sucrose complexes (12Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. Potocki De Montalk G. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Google Scholar). Furthermore, it superimposes perfectly on the sucrose pyranosyl moiety when the E328Q·sucrose complex and the B structure are compared. It differs, however, from the d-glucose complex by tilting slightly away from the phenyl ring of Phe147, thus having less stacking interactions with the aromatic ring. Binding at the −1 subsite is stabilized by nine direct and one water-mediated protein-enzyme hydrogen bonds similar to those observed in the E328Q sucrose and d-glucose complexes. The glucosidic bond between the −1 and +1 glucosyls is oriented as in the E328Q sucrose complex so that the oxygen lone pair would be aligned almost linearly with the H-OE1 of the wild-type Glu328. This complex thus resembles the product immediately after the transglucosylation reaction has taken place. The +1 glucosyl unit is stabilized by three direct and two water-mediated hydrogen bonds. The glucosyl unit is oriented in a way that the atoms O1 and O6 of the fructosyl moiety occupy almost the same positions as O3 and O6 of the glucosyl moiety when compared with the E328Q·sucrose complex. The glucosyl is also involved in hydrogen bonds with Arg446, Asp394, and Glu328, respectively. The Glu328(OE2)-O6 hydrogen bond is probably very important for the exact alignment of the proton donor with respect to its substrate. A similar hydrogen bond was observed in the structure of the maltogenic α-amylase from Bacillus stearothermophilus(27Dauter Z. Dauter M. Brzozowski A.M. Christensen S. Borchert T.V. Beier L. Wilson K.S. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8385-8392Google Scholar) and in the structure of Aspergillus oryzae α-amylase (28Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Google Scholar), both in complex with acarbose, and in the structure of the Bacillus subtilis α-amylase in complex with maltopentaose (29Fujimoto Z. Takase K. Doui N. Momma M. Matsumoto T. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 393-407Google Scholar). Comparing the interactions seen (number of hydrogen bonds) in the +1, +2, and +3 subsites of the Bacillus and Aspergillus amylases to amylosucrase (Glc712-Glc714) suggests that the binding is significantly stronger in amylosucrase. It should also be noted that seven of the nine hydrogen bonds observed are with residues from the B′-domain. Comparisons of the B-structure with the Tris,d-glucose, and E328Q·sucrose complexes show significant movements of the residues Arg226 and Thr398. Upon binding of maltoheptaose in OB1, the Thr398 backbone conformation changes with a ψ-angle shift of 90°, probably due to a change of the Thr side-chain conformation, which enables hydrogen bonding to the +3 glucosyl moiety. This results in slight backbone movement of the residues 397–409. The position of Arg226 is changed so that it is possible to make two hydrogen bonds to the +2 glucosyl. This, in turn, results in a backbone movement of residues 224–229. Probably as a consequence, the positions of the Phe residues 229, 250, and 436 are affected. Phe229and Phe436, which are both partially solvent-accessible and located on the interface between the B and B′-domain, show the largest deviations with changes in the χ1 dihedral angle for both residues and also a change in the χ2 dihedral angle for Phe229. The OB1 and OB2 sites are only separated by the B′-helix 410–422 (Fig.1), giving a possibility of allostery between the two binding sites. The position of residue Phe417 is related to the position of Arg415 via the helix hydrogen bonding. This helix has crystal contacts to a symmetry-related molecule mentioned above, thus unfortunately blocking any connecting subsites. Furthermore, the glucosyl rings that are closest together are both identified as the reducing ends of the two maltoheptaose molecules. To connect the two subsites by a linear α-1,4-linked oligoglucosyl chain, this chain would have to bulge away from the enzyme, making a helical turn. Detailed experimentally based knowledge on how (if at all) the two subsites can be connected can only be obtained from a co-crystallization of AS and an oligosaccharide with a length of >10 glucosyl units in another crystal form. This could perhaps also reveal whether the third observed binding site, OB3, could be connected to OB1 and/or OB2. The crystal structures of native AS soaked with different concentrations of sucrose (structures C–E) reveal that AS has an additional sucrose-binding site (SB2) close to the active site (Fig. 1). SB2 is positioned just outside where the α-amylase active site cleft would be if the Asp144-Arg509salt bridge (10Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25273-25278Google Scholar) was open. The direct AS·sucrose hydrogen bonding contacts shown in Fig. 5 reveal interactions (including some hydrophobic interactions not shown on Fig. 5) with the B′-domain (residues 394–450). As can be imagined (Fig. 1), sucrose bound at this position can enter the active site only if a large amplitude movement of the B′-domain take place. This suggests the need for allosteric regulation. SB2 was not occupied in the E328Q·sucrose structure in which the sucrose concentration involved was comparable with that used in the crystal C experiment. However, the experimental conditions were different. The E328Q·sucrose complex was the result of a co-crystallization, whereas soaking experiments were used in crystal structures C–E. Also, in the C–E structures native AS was used in contrast to the inactive mutant used for E328Q·sucrose structure. We have not been able to displace Tris from the active site of the wild type enzyme with sucrose or an oligosaccharide, stressing that the substrate binding properties of the two proteins certainly are different. This difference probably reflects that AS can compensate the positive charge of Tris at neutral pH better than the E328Q variant. The changes in occupancy and B-factors for the sucrose molecule observed from crystals C to E suggests that the affinity of sucrose for the SB2 site is weak to moderate, and it is likely that the SB2 site would also be observed in the E328Q structure at higher concentrations. This observed weak binding is also in agreement with a subsequent transfer of the sucrose molecule away from SB2 into the active site. In crystal structure D an oligosaccharide is observed at the OB2 site. This suggests that the enzyme has been active during the experiment, either in the crystalline state or from residual enzyme in solution. It is remarkable that the site is occupied in the D crystals but not in C or E crystals. However, 100 mm has been shown to be an optimal sucrose concentration for the enzyme; at higher sucrose concentrations the reaction rate is saturated (1Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 103-108Google Scholar, 11Sarcabal P. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Potocki De Montalk G. Svensson B. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 33-37Google Scholar). The additional sucrose binding sites observed when AS crystals were soaked with 1m sucrose (E structure) are not expected to be of functional relevance. Fig. 1 clearly shows that the interactions between AS and its substrates, sucrose and a α-1,4-linked glucosyl chain, are closely related to the B′-domain (residues 394–450). Of the 57 amino acid residues, six had contacts to OB2, eight had contacts to OB1, and three had contacts to SB2. We have previously shown that it is likely that AS uses the well established double displacement reaction mechanism characteristic for the glycoside hydrolase family 13, but many details of the catalysis need to be clarified. One important question that arose from the E328Q·sucrose and AS·glucose structures was how the enzyme controlled hydrolysis with only one access channel to the active site. The structures described here suggest that there could be two entrances to the active site, i.e. one that is occupied by an oligosaccharide and one that can be in an open and in a shut state. Because AS is expected to be a chain elongator of already existing oligosaccharides in vivo, it seems reasonable to assume that the large substrate access channel is occupied by the polymer already at the start of the elongation reaction. The superposition of structures D and B excluding the B′-domain (Fig. 6) shows that, even in the crystalline environment, sucrose binding does introduce domain movement. It can be hypothesized that, in solution, this movement is sufficient to allow sucrose to enter the active site. The domain movement relative to the AS·Tris complex is smaller than the one shown in Fig. 6, indicating an allosteric mechanism wherein oligosaccharide binding on the B′-domain enhances domain mobility upon sucrose binding. If this access was closed when sucrose moves to the active site, water access would be prohibited. Binding of sucrose in the active site will displace the oligosaccharide at least two subsites in the positive direction, probably still shielding for water access through this active site substrate access channel. How fructose can exit the active site after the sucrose molecule has been split is not clear. If this happens before transglucosylation, the architecture suggests that it can only occur through the oligosaccharide access channel. It should be remembered that it is only the glucosyl-enzyme intermediate that has to be protected from water to avoid hydrolysis. AS seems to do this very effectively, because hydrolysis is always a minor side reaction (2Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Sarcabal P. Planchot V. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 219-223Google Scholar). The structures presented show that the B′-domain is designed for alteration of a hydrolase into a polymerase. The B′-domain has two (probably connected) oligosaccharide binding sites and also defines a low affinity sucrose-binding site. The domain seems to become more mobile upon oligosaccharide binding, so allosteric regulation of the sucrose access is suggested.

In all cases, GPI biosynthesis involves the addition of GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI) to give GlcNAc-PI, which is then de-N-acetylated byN-acetyl-d-glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol deacetylase (EC 3.1.1.69), referred to here as GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase, to form GlcN-PI (32Doering T.L.

Thus, the trypanosomal enzyme can de-N-acetylate GlcNAc-PI containing either d- or l-myo-inositol and α- or β-d-GlcNAc, whereas the human (HeLa) enzyme strictly requires α-d-GlcNAc (1Ferguson M.A.J.

These differences, and the ability of the trypanosomal enzyme to tolerate a C8 O-alkyl substituent on C2 of thed-myo-inositol residue, were recently exploited in the design and synthesis of two parasite-specific GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase suicide substrate inhibitors (38Smith T.K.

The gene encoding the rat de-N-acetylase (PIG-L) was the first to be cloned (34Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and a yeast homologue (GPI12) has been shown to complementPIG-L-deficient mammalian cells and vice versa (35Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Maeda Y. Nakamura N. Kinoshita T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the molecular cloning of the T. brucei andL. major homologues TbGPI12 andLmGPI12, demonstrate functional complementation in aPIG-L-deficient mammalian cell line, and describe the creation of a T. brucei TbGPI12 conditional null mutant. We further demonstrate that membranes from the conditional null mutant are deficient in GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity under non-permissive conditions and that TbGPI12 is an essential gene in bloodstream form T. brucei. The 401-bp end-sequence of an Institute for Genomic Research genome survey sequence clone (AQ644232), returned from the tBLASTn search with yeast GPI12p (accession number P23797), was used to design a reverse PCR primer (5′-cgcGGATCCtcatgcgacccccaattccttcacttc-3′ (capital letters indicate a BamHI site)) that was used with Pfupolymerase, blood-stream form T. bruceicDNA, and a forward primer based on the 5′ mini-exon (5′-ggcccgctattattagaacagtttctgta-3′) to amplify an ∼0.8-kb fragment containing the entire TbGPI12 ORF. Amplification conditions were 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min for 30 cycles. The PCR product was purified from an agarose gel (QIAEX II kit) and ligated into a pUC18 cloning vector using a SureClone ligation kit (Amersham Biosciences). Twelve representative clones were used for DNA sequencing, revealing a 759-bp ORF. The same PCR product (the TbGPI12 probe) was fluorescein-labeled by random priming (Gene Images kit; Amersham Biosciences) or labeled with32P (Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit; Stratagene) for use in Southern blotting and for probing a BAC library filter, respectively (see below). A tBlastn search with the sequence LVIAHPDDEAMFFAP, a sequence strictly conserved in rat and human PIG-L and substantially conserved in yeast GPI12, identified an L. major expressed sequence tag sequence (AA728250) with 85% similarity. The corresponding cDNA clone was kindly provided by Prof. J. M. Blackwell (Cambridge University) and fully sequenced. The clone contained the full-length LmGPI12 gene. For expression in mammalian cells, the TbGPI12 gene was PCR-amplified usingPfu in two segments. The 5′-end of the ORF was amplified using forward primer 5′-gagAAGCTTCATATGcatggtgctttggcgtttggg-3′ and reverse primer 5′catggcggaaaagctGgtgaacaatgag-3′ and the 3′-end of the ORF was amplified using forward primer 5′-ctcattgttcacCagcttttccgccatg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-cgGGATCCtcaCAGGTCCTCCTCCGAGATTAGCTTCTGTTCGTTAATTAAtgcgacccccaattcctt-3′. The two PCR products were used together in a furtherPfu PCR reaction to yield a product containing a silent mutation that removed a HindIII site (capital italic letters indicate the mutation), a myc epitope tag fused to the C terminus of TbGPI12 (underlined letters), and 5′-HindIII and 3′-BamHI restriction sites (capital letters). The purified construct was digested withHindIII and BamHI and ligated into the respective cloning sites of the pcDNA3.1/Hygro (+) (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector. The LmGPI12 gene was also PCR-amplified using Pfuin two segments. The 5′-end of the ORF was amplified using forward primer 5′-cccAAGCTTgggatgcacagtatcacagtt-3′ and reverse primer 5′-gcaggtggaggatGcctggaggcatgttc-3′ and the 3′-end of the ORF was amplified using forward primer 5′-gaacatgcctccaggCatcctccacctgc-3′and reverse primer 5′-cgcGGATCCgcgctagagctcttcgatctc-3′. The two PCR products were used together in a further Pfu PCR reaction to yield a product containing a silent mutation that removed a BamHI site (capital italic letters indicate the mutation) and 5′-HindIII and 3′-BamHI restriction sites (capital letters). The purified construct was digested withHindIII and BamHI and ligated into the respective cloning sites of pcDNA3.1/Hygro (+). The pcDNA3.1/Hygro (+) plasmids (empty and containingTbGPI12-myc or LmGPI12) were purified (Qiagen Maxi-Prep), precipitated, washed with ethanol, resuspended in sterile water, and used for transient transfections. Trypsin-treatedPIG-L-deficient and CD59- and decay-accelerating factor (DAF)-transgenic CHO-K1 (clone M2S2) cells (34Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were washed twice and resuspended at 1–2 × 107/ml in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of 1 ml were mixed with 50–70 μg of plasmid DNA, incubated for 20 min on ice, and electroporated in a 0.4-cm cuvette at 260 V, 950 μF, with a Bio-Rad gene-pulser. The cells were immediately transferred to 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.3 mg/ml G418 (to maintain the CD59- and DAF-containing plasmid), and cultured at 37 °C. Two days after transient transfection, the cells were incubated with anti-CD59 (B229; 10 μg/ml) and anti-DAF (813.6; 10 μg/ml) mouse monoclonal antibodies, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako F0313) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy using an MRC-600 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Nikon Microphot-SA). T. brucei genomic DNA (5 μg/lane) was digested with various restriction enzymes and the products were resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel. After transfer to nitrocellulose and UV-cross-linking, the blot was hybridized with fluorescein-labeled TbGPI12 probe (16 h, 60 °C) and washed twice with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min and twice with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min. Blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody according to the manufacturers instructions (gene images CDP-Star kit; AmershamBiosciences). A T. brucei strain 427 BAC library filter (CHORI RPCI-102), representing 46-fold genome coverage, was probed with a 32P-labeled TbGPI12 probe under the same conditions described for the Southern blot. Fifty positive clones were identified and the corresponding TbGPI12-containing BAC plasmids were purified from 3-ml cultures of four clones, using the “DNA isolation from BAC & PAC clones” protocol recommended by CHORI BACPAC Resources (www.chori.org/bacpac). The presence of theTbGPI12 gene was confirmed by PCR using 5′-gagAAGCTTCATATGcatggtgctttggcgtttggg-3 and 5′-cgcGGATCCtcatgcgacccccaattccttcacttc-3′ forward and reverse primers. One clone was selected and the purified BAC plasmid DNA (1 μg) was used as template for DNA sequencing using primers from within the gene, 5′-catcgcttcatcgtccgggtgtgc-3′ and 5′-attccgccgacctcattgttcaca-3′. Consequently, 466 bp of 5′-UTR and 648 bp of 3′-UTR sequence were obtained. Based on these data, 426 bp of 5′-UTR immediately upstream of the start codon were PCR-amplified using Pfu and genomic DNA template with the forward primer 5′-ataagaatGCGGCCGCcctccccccgcgcctacggatg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-gtttaaacttacggaccgtcaagcttgtgtatgagcgactccctcaac-3′. Likewise, 478 bp immediately downstream of the stop codon were PCR-amplified using with the forward primer 5′-gacggtccgtaagtttaaacggatccatcgaagaaatttagcccccgc-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ataagtaaGCGGCCGCcgactccggcatcttgtaaattg-3′. The two PCR products were used together in a further PCR reaction to yield a product containing the 5′-UTR linked to the 3′-UTR by a shortHindIII, PmeI, and BamHI cloning site (underlined letters) and NotI restriction sites at each end (capital letters). Subsequently, the PCR product was cloned into the NotI site of pGEM-5Zf(+) vector (Promega) and the hygromycin phosphotransferase (HYG) and puromycin acetyltransferase (PAC) drug resistance genes were introduced into the targeting vector via theHindIII/BamHI cloning site. The previously described HindIII-silenced, C-terminallymyc-tagged TbGPI12 construct was ligated into theHindIII/BamHI cloning site of the pLew100 tetracycline-inducible expression vector (39Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Plasmids were prepared (Qiagen Maxi-Prep), digested with NotI, precipitated with ethanol, redissolved in sterile water, and used for electroporation of bloodstream form T. brucei strain 427 (variant 221), which are stably transfected to express T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor protein under continuous G418 selection (39Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar).

Total RNA was prepared (Qiagen RNeasy Protect Midi kit) from 2 × 108 cells. Samples of RNA (5 μg) were run on formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for hybridization with [α-32P]dCTP labeled TbGPI12 probe (Stratagene Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit). As a loading control, a β-tubulin probe was used on the same blot. Bloodstream formT. brucei membranes (cell-free system) were prepared (15Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T.

Samples were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C, and glycolipid samples were recovered for analysis by HPTLC before and after enzyme treatments. Samples were digested with jack bean α-mannosidase and Bacillus thuringiensisphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (both from Glyko) as described in (46Güther M.L.S. Masterson W.J. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples and glycolipid standards were applied to 10 cm aluminum-backed silica gel-60 HPTLC plates (Merck) and developed with chloroform/methanol/1 m ammonium acetate/13m ammonia/water (180:140:9:9:23, v/v). Radiolabeled components were detected by fluorography at −70 °C after spraying with En3Hance (PerkinElmer) using Kodak XAR-5 film and an intensifying screen. A partial gene sequence was found in The Institute for Genomic Research T. brucei data base with a tBLASTn search, using the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeGPI12 protein sequence as the query. The putativeTbGPI12 gene fragment contained the 3′-end of the gene (377 bp), including a stop codon, followed by 24 bp of putative 3′-UTR. A cDNA clone was obtained by PCR using bloodstream formT. brucei cDNA as the template, a forward primer based on the 5′-spliced leader (a 35-bp sequence trans-spliced onto allT. brucei mRNA), and a reverse primer based on the 3′-end sequence found in the data base. The 0.8-kb product contained a 759-bp ORF (GenBankTM accession number AY157267). A genomic clone was also obtained by PCR using genomic DNA as the template, a forward primer to the 5′-end of the gene based on the cDNA clone, and a reverse primer based on the 3′-UTR sequence found in the data base. Both the cDNA and genomic DNA ORF sequences were identical. A tBlastn search with the sequence LVIAHPDDEAMFFAP, a conserved sequence in rat and human PIG-L that is largely conserved in yeast GPI12 (34Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J.

The corresponding cDNA clone was fully sequenced and found to contain the full-length LmGPI12gene (GenBank™ accession number AY157268). The predicted amino acid sequences of the two parasite putative GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylases, aligned with related sequences, are shown in Fig. 1. All of the sequences predict proteins with the majority of their sequence in the cytoplasm and anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum via a single N-terminal transmembrane domain, an arrangement that has been demonstrated experimentally for rat PIG-L (34Nakamura N.

The PIG-L/GPI12 sequences have similarity to the pfam02585 family of prokaryote sequences that include Rv1170, a GlcNAcα1–1-d-myo-inositol de-N-acetylase involved in mycothiol synthesis inMycobacterium tuberculosis (47Newton G.L."
https://openalex.org/W1972461292,"Regulation of synaptic strength is essential for neuronal information processing, but the molecular mechanisms that control changes in neuroexocytosis are only partially known. Here we show that the putative G protein-coupled receptor Methuselah (Mth) is required in the presynaptic motor neuron to acutely upregulate neurotransmitter exocytosis at larval Drosophila NMJs. Mutations in the mth gene reduce evoked neurotransmitter release by approximately 50%, and decrease synaptic area and the density of docked and clustered vesicles. Pre- but not postsynaptic expression of normal Mth restored normal release in mth mutants. Conditional expression of Mth restored normal release and normal vesicle docking and clustering but not the reduced size of synaptic sites, suggesting that Mth acutely adjusts vesicle trafficking to synaptic sites."
https://openalex.org/W2035683581,"The phylum Chaetognatha (also called arrow worm), with only about 100 living species, is found in oceans throughout the world and plays an important role in the food web as primary predators ([1][1]). Its fossil record, however, is sparse. The Carboniferous Paucijaculum samamithion has been the only definitive fossil chaetognath ([2][2]). Some of the Cambrian protoconodonts could be grasping spines of this group ([3][3]). The Middle Cambrian Amiskwia was considered as a chaetognath ([4][4]), but with a sluglike head, terminal anus, and cephalic tentacles, it could well be a mollusk.

We report a probable chaetognath Eognathacantha ercainella from the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shale [about 520 million years (Ma) old] near Haikou, Kunming (South China). The single specimen is an adult, 25 mm long. A certain straightness in preservation suggests that the body in Eognathacantha ercainella may have been relatively rigid. It consists of a head, a trunk, and a possible tail ([Fig. 1][5], A and C). The rounded head is wider than long ([Fig. 1][5], B and D), measuring about 2.8 mm in width; it is wider than the rest of the body. Projecting anteriorly and laterally from the head are about 12 slightly recurved grasping spines, each about 900 μm long ([Fig. 1][5]B). As in modern chaetognaths, the spine bears an expanded base ([Fig. 1][5]B), which is likely embedded within the tissue ([5][6]). In the anterior part of head, there are numerous smaller spine-like structures (about 200 to 250 μm long) interpreted as possible teeth. In the middle part of head, there are numerous bluish papillae-like structures (about 150 μm long) surrounding a small slitlike structure interpreted as possibly a mouth ([Fig. 1][5]B).

A pair of transverse, cuplike structures at the posterior margin of the head is interpreted as muscle marks of a hood ([Fig. 1][5], C and D). Such a hood is diagnostic of chaetognaths, and it is an extension of the epidermis, attached ventrally between the head and the trunk. The hood is provided with retractor and extensor muscles.

A thick brown layer envelope over the head is presumably a cuticle as in recent chaetognaths. This cuticle, however, disappears at the border between the head and trunk.

In contrast to the head, the trunk, 2.5 mm wide and 15 mm long, lacks evidence of a cuticle. The trunk epiderm, colored light yellow, presumably has no cuticle (Fig.1, A and C).

The posterior part of the body, about 8 mm long with a thick brown envelope, is considered as tail, which tapers posteriorly. If the envelope represents its cuticle, it differs from the cuticle-less tail of most living chaetognaths ([5][6]).

Modern chaetognaths usually bear paired lateral fins and a wide tail fin, all of which are supported by rays. Eognathacantha ercainella , however, preserves only a pair of narrow fins without fin rays ([Fig. 1][5], A and C). The fins extend continuously from the anterior part of the trunk throughout the trunk and the tail. It is impossible to determine whether the fins are in the frontal plane of the body as in modern chaetognaths or otherwise. The fins have a uniform width of 0.4 mm wide, except throughout the anterior 2 mm, where they narrow anteriorly. No widening of the tail fin can be seen in this fossil form.

A bulbous structure at the anterior end of the trunk is presumably a pharynx (which is bulbate in modern chaetognaths), and this narrows posteriorly to join a slender, light bluish line, interpreted as the intestine ([Fig. 1][5], A to D). This runs posteriorly, with a possible anus at its posterior end in front of the tail ([Fig. 1][5]A). The position of this possible anus, just anterior to the tail, corresponds to that of extant chaetognaths.

The Carboniferous fossil, Paucijaculum , represents the only previously known fossil Chaetognath and is poorly preserved. The grasping spines are the only trait definitely supporting the chaetognath identity. The general morphology of the Carboniferous Paucijaculum differs from that of our Cambrian species in having a smaller head and a tail fin that seems to be more similar to that of modern chaetognaths.

The affinity of the 520 Ma Eognathacantha ercainella with chaetognaths is supported by a widened head distinct from a trunk, presumably a tail (based on cuticularizaton in this fossil form), grasping spines and possible teeth on the head, and a hood on the border between head and trunk. The discovery of the Lower Cambrian chaetognath supports the hypothesis that all living animal phyla may have appeared in Cambrian times or even earlier, although only one-third of them have been recorded from Lower Cambrian.

The Plk1 protein level is low in G1 phase, increases during S phase, remains high through G2-M phase, and is rapidly decreased after mitosis. During the G2 to M phase transition, Plk1 is phosphorylated and its kinase function is stimulated. In M phase, Plk1 is distributed at spindle poles, kinetochore during prophase and metaphase, and redistributed to the spindle equatorial region during anaphase and concentrated within post-mitotic bridge during telophase (6Golstein R.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Ziemiecki A. Ried T. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1509-1517Google Scholar, 7Golstein R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J.

It is believed that this complex localization pattern may reflect multiple roles for Plk1 throughout mitosis. Additionally, previous work shows that Plk1 is able to activate Cdc2 by phosphorylating and activating Cdc25C (12Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Google Scholar, 13Qian Y.W.

Recently, we reported that Plk1 phosphorylates cyclin B1 and Cdc25C and targets them to the nucleus during prophase (18Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Shinya N. Iwamatsu A. Nishida E. Nature. 2001; 410: 215-220Google Scholar, 19Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 341-348Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Plk1 plays a role in the regulation of entry into M phase as well. Thus, we have been interested in subcellular localization of Plk1 during S and G2 phases that has not been examined in detail with the exception of the localization of Plk1 to the centrosome. Proteins larger than 45 kDa often require a specific sequence called nuclear localization signal (NLS) to be targeted to the nucleus. NLSs are defined as the sequence sufficient and necessary for nuclear import of their respective proteins and are generally functional in targeting heterologous proteins to the nucleus. Classical NLSs are either monopartite or bipartite. Of the two basic types of NLSs, a monopartite NLS consists of a single short consecutive basic amino acid, the first example of which was the SV40 large T-antigen NLS (PKKKRKV), and a bipartite NLS comprises two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a 10–12-amino acid spacer, which was first reported in the NLS of nucleoplasmin (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKKLDK) (20Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar, 21Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Google Scholar, 22Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated localization of Plk1 to the nucleus as well as to the cytoplasm during S and G2 phases and identified for the first time a bipartite nuclear localization signal sequence in Plk1 that regulates nuclear translocation of Plk1. In addition, we present several lines of evidence suggesting that nuclear localization of Plk1 before mitosis is important for ensuring normal cell cycle progression. HeLa cells were cultured and synchronized with a double thymidine block as previously described (23Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transiently transfected by the use of FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions with the use of 2 μg of total DNA/35-mm dish. After 20 h, cells were fixed and stained. Fractionation of HeLa cell extracts in each time after release from double thymidine block was performed as described previously (24Yang J. Bardes E.S.G. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M.A. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Google Scholar). The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were normalized to contain equal quantity of total proteins. The mutagenesis of Plk1 3A was performed using a mutagenic primer 5′-GTTTTGGAGCTCTGTGCCGCGGCGTCCCTCCTGGAGCTG-3′ by the use of QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To yield Plk1 4A, a mutagenic primer 5′-CTGTCGCGCGGCGGCCGCCCTGGAGCTGC-3′ was used. PCR products of Plk1 WT, 3A, 4A, and 7A were subcloned into pSRα-HA vector. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A sequence corresponding to residues 124–148 of human Plk1 was amplified by PCR with a 5′ primer 5′-CGGGATCCGACTTTGTATTTGTAG-3′ and a 3′ primer 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCACAGTGCCTTCCTC-3′, generating BamHI andSalI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and the fragment was inserted into pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain GST-Plk1 (25 amino acids). GST-Plk1 WT, GST-Plk1 7A, and GST-Plk1 (25 amino acids) were bacterially expressed and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (23Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Google Scholar). GST-Plk1 proteins were injected into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells as described previously (25Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Google Scholar). At 1 h after injection, cells were fixed and stained with anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). SRα-HA-Plk1 WT or 7A was injected into the nucleus of HeLa cells at 4 h after the release from double thymidine block. Indirect immunofluorescent staining for endogenous Plk1 was performed as described previously (6Golstein R.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Ziemiecki A. Ried T. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1509-1517Google Scholar). Cells at each time after release from double thymidine block were stained with rabbit anti-Plk1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and mouse anti-γ-tubulin antibody (Clontech). Transfected or injected SRα-HA-Plk1 was stained with rabbit anti-HA antibody (Clontech) as described previously (23Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Google Scholar). Injected cells were also stained with mouse anti-cyclin B1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-MPM2 antibody (UBI), and rabbit anti-phospho-(Tyr-15)cdc2 antibody in each experiment. To examine subcellular localization of endogenous Plk1 during interphase, we used the indirect immunofluorescent staining and the biochemical cell fractionation method in synchronized HeLa cells. Consistent with previous observations (6Golstein R.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Ziemiecki A. Ried T. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1509-1517Google Scholar, 7Golstein R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Google Scholar, 8Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21086-21091Google Scholar, 9Lee K.S. Grenfell T.Z. Yarm F.R. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9301-9306Google Scholar, 10Arnaud L. Pines J. Nigg E.A. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 424-429Google Scholar, 11Jang Y.J. Lin C.Y. Ma S. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1984-1989Google Scholar), the protein level of Plk1 is very low in G1/S phase, but its localization to the centrosome is detectable (Fig. 1, 0h). In S and G2 phases, Plk1 increases dramatically and localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in addition to the centrosome (Fig. 1, 4h and 6h). At prophase, the protein level of Plk1 is maximal and it shows both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 1, 8h). Thus, these observations indicate that Plk1 has the ability to enter the nucleus constitutively during interphase. It is generally believed that those proteins whose molecular mass is larger than 50 kDa cannot pass through the nuclear pore by passive diffusion. Because Plk1 is ∼67 kDa, Plk1 should have some mechanism to enter the nucleus. We found a region in human Plk1 where two clusters of basic amino acids, residues 134–136 (RRR) and residues 143–146 (KRRK), are aligned in tandem (Fig. 2A). This region lies in the kinase catalytic domain in the primary sequence, and its sequence is highly conserved in Xenopus Plx1 and DrosophilaPolo (Fig. 2A). The yeast orthologs, Cdc5 and Plo1, lack the first cluster of basic amino acids but contain the second one (Fig. 2A). We hypothesized that this region in mammalian Plk1 might function as a bipartite NLS sequence. To test this possibility, we first constructed a fusion protein between GST and a sequence corresponding to residues 124–148 of Plk1 GST-Plk1(25 a.a.)) and co-injected this fusion protein and TRITC-BSA into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Whereas TRITC-BSA remained in the cytoplasm, the fusion protein translocated to and accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). Under the same conditions, GST alone did not translocate to the nucleus (Fig. 3A). The nuclear import of this fusion protein was almost completely suppressed by RanQ69L, a dominant negative form of Ran (Fig. 3A). Thus, a putative NLS region of Plk1 is able to function as a typical NLS that is dependent on the Ran/importin system. We then produced a fusion protein between GST and full-length Plk1 (Fig. 3B, GST-Plk1 WT) and injected it into the cytoplasm. Within 1 h after injection, GST-Plk1 WT translocated to and accumulated in the nucleus, whereas co-injected TRITC-BSA remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). This nuclear import of GST-Plk1 WT was also almost completely suppressed by RanQ69L. We next produced a GST fusion protein of a mutant Plk1 in which all of the seven arginine and lysine residues present in the identified NLS sequence were mutated to alanines (GST-Plk1 7A; see also Fig. 2). When injected into the cytoplasm, GST-Plk1 7A did not translocate to the nucleus and remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the identified NLS sequence is required for Plk1 to enter the nucleus. To assess the importance of the first and second clusters of basic amino acids in the identified NLS sequence of Plk1, we made several mutant forms of Plk1 in which the first, second, or both basic amino acid cluster(s) was mutated to alanines, respectively (see Fig. 2B). We then expressed HA-tagged forms of these mutants (3A, 4A, or 7A) and wild-type Plk1 in HeLa cells and examined their subcellular distribution by staining with anti-HA antibody. In more than half of the transfected cells, Plk1 WT accumulated in the nucleus, and in the remainder, Plk1 WT showed pan-cellular distribution (Fig. 4, WT). The mutation at the first basic cluster slightly affected the subcellular distribution. In ∼40% of the transfected cells, Plk1 3A showed nuclear accumulation (Fig. 4, 3A). In contrast, nuclear accumulation was markedly impaired in the mutation at the second basic cluster. Plk1 4A showed pan-cellular distribution in ∼80% of transfected cells, and in ∼20% of the cells, it showed exclusively cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 4, 4A). The double mutation abolished completely nuclear localization. Plk1 7A showed exclusively cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 4, 7A). These results indicate that both the first and the second basic clusters contribute to nuclear translocation of Plk1, and therefore the identified NLS is in fact a bipartite NLS. In addition, the obtained data suggest that the second basic cluster alone can work as NLS although not so strong. It should be noted that the second basic cluster is conserved even in yeast orthologs of Plk1 (see Fig. 2A). To know possible physiological significance of nuclear localization of Plk1 during interphase, we examined the affect of expression of the NLS-disrupted mutant of Plk1 (Plk1 7A) on the cell cycle progression. We injected a plasmid harboring Plk1 7A or Plk1 WT into the nucleus of HeLa cells at 4 h after release from double thymidine block, and we followed the cell cycle progression by examining the state of chromosomes. A pGFP empty vector was injected as a control. Although uninjected HeLa cells entered the M phase at ∼10 h after the release from the double thymidine block, the injection procedure under our conditions appeared to induce a slight delay (from 1 to ∼ 2 h) in the cell cycle progression. Approximately half of the empty vector-injected cells (∼56%) was in M phase at 12 h (Fig. 5B,Vector). The expression of Plk1 WT did not affect the timing of M phase entry significantly. 48% of the cells expressing Plk1 WT were in M phase at 12 h (Fig. 5A and B,WT). In contrast, the expression of Plk1 7A seemed to block M phase entry. Only 5 to ∼10% of the cells expressing Plk1 7A were in M phase at 12 h (Fig. 5A and B,7A), and the majority of the cells had a large G2-like nucleus and grew to cover a large surface area (Fig. 5A, 7A). At 14 h, there was no increase in M phase cells in the cells expressing Plk1 7A, whereas most of the cells expressing Plk1 WT or the pGFP vector-injected cells went through mitosis and entered the G1 phase. Rather surprisingly, the cells expressing Plk1 7A did not enter the M phase and appeared to stay in G2 phase even at 24 h after release (data not shown). To examine whether the cells expressing Plk1 7A were arrested in G2, we first checked subcellular localization of cyclin B1, which normally translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus before nuclear envelope breakdown during prophase (23Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Google Scholar, 26Pines J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1-17Google Scholar, 27Ookata K. Hisanaga S. Okano T. Tachibana K. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1763-1772Google Scholar, 28Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E73-E79Google Scholar, 29Yang J. Kornbluth S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 207-210Google Scholar). At 12 h after the release, all of the Plk1 7A-injected cells (n= 65) showed exclusively cytoplasmic localization of cyclin B1 (Fig. 6A), suggesting that the cells are arrested in G2. We then performed cell staining with anti-MPM2 antibody, which is believed to recognize mitotic phosphoproteins. Although ∼50% pGFP- or Plk1 WT-injected cells showed strong staining with this antibody at 12 h, few cells expressing Plk1 7A (≦4%) were MPM2-positive (Fig. 6B). This result also suggests that the cells expressing Plk1 7A did not enter the M phase. Finally, we assessed the activation state of M-phase promoting factor by examining the phosphorylation state of Cdc2 on Tyr-15. The cell staining with anti-phospho-Tyr-15 Cdc2 antibody demonstrated that although >60% pGFP- or Plk1 WT-injected cells were negative for this staining, only ∼20% Plk1–7A-injected cells were negative (Fig. 6C). This suggests that Cdc2 was not activated in most of the cells expressing Plk1 7A, consistent with the idea that the cells are arrested in G2. We have here demonstrated that Plk1 localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in addition to the centrosome in S and G2phases. Moreover, our results have identified a bipartite NLS that is responsible for nuclear localization of Plk1. Remarkably, the expression of an NLS-disrupted mutant of Plk1, Plk1 7A, during S phase is found to arrest the cells in G2 phase. These results suggest that nuclear localization of Plk1 directed by its NLS during interphase is required for cells to enter mitosis. In a recent study in which the injection of anti-Plk1 antibodies into cultured cells arrested the cells in G2, Lane and Nigg (30Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Google Scholar) suggested the existence of a centrosome-maturation checkpoint that is sensitive to the impairment of Plk1 function in cells (31Mundt K.E. Golsteyn R.M. Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 377-385Google Scholar). Similarly, we also hypothesize that there may be some checkpoint mechanism that senses nuclear localization of Plk1 or its interacting protein(s). Because the expression of Plk1 7A does not affect subcellular localization of endogenous Plk1, 2E. Taniguchi, F. Toyoshima-Morimoto, and E. Nishida, unpublished observations. it is possible that expression of Plk1 7A, which is exclusively cytoplasmic, may retain some interacting protein(s) in the cytoplasm by competing with endogenous Plk1 and thereby could trigger activation of an assumed checkpoint pathway, resulting in G2 arrest. To examine whether localizing Plk1 7A in the nucleus rescues the G2 arrest, we added an NLS sequence of SV40 large T-antigen (PKKKRKVEDP) to the C terminus of the Plk1 7A (Plk1 7A-SV40NLS) and injected the plasmid harboring Plk1 7A-SV40NLS into the nuclei of HeLa cells. Unfortunately, however, this mutant Plk1 did not accumulate strongly in the nucleus but showed pan-cellular distribution. In addition, the expression of this mutant also induced the G2arrest.2 Therefore, this experiment could not determine propriety of our simple hypothesis. On the other hand, more complicated scenarios are also possible. We cannot completely exclude the possibility that Plk1 7A might not be activated properly during the G2 to M phase transition, although Plk1 7A has essentially the same basal kinase activity as Plk1 WT.2 The NLS of Plk1 described here is located within the subdomain V of the kinase catalytic domain. Only the sequence in Plk1 but not the sequence in the subdomain V of other protein kinases, matches the consensus sequence of NLS sequences. According to the predicted three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of Plk1 by the Swiss model, the NLS identified here forms a helix at the surface of the activation loop. Thus, the NLS may be well positioned for interactions with the nuclear import transporters. We thank K. Todokoro for a mouse Plk1 cDNA."

Insulin activation of one mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, the MEK/ERK kinase cascade, is well described. However, the effect of insulin on the parallel p38 pathway is less well understood. The present work examines the effect of inhibiting the p38 signaling pathway by use of specific inhibitors, either alone or in combination with insulin, on the activation of ERK1/2 and on the regulation of gene transcription in rat hepatoma cells. Activation of ERK1/2 was induced by insulin and was dependent on the activation of MEK1, the kinase upstream of ERK in this pathway. Treatment of cells with p38 inhibitors also induced ERK1/2 activation/phosphorylation. The addition of p38 inhibitors followed by insulin addition resulted in a greater than additive activation of ERK1/2. The two genes studied, c-Fos and Pip92, are immediate-early genes that are dependent on the ERK1/2 pathway for insulin-regulated induction because the insulin effect was inhibited by pretreatment with a MEK1 inhibitor. The addition of p38 inhibitors induced transcription of both genes in a dose-dependent manner, and insulin stimulation of both genes was enhanced by prior treatment with p38 inhibitors. The ability of the p38 inhibitors to induce ERK1/2 and gene transcription, both alone and in combination with insulin, was abolished by prior inhibition of MEK1. These data suggest possible cross-talk between the p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and a potential role of p38 in insulin signaling.

Insulin is a primary regulator of energy metabolism, is essential for normal growth and development, and can directly or indirectly stimulate DNA synthesis (1Messina J.L. Kostyo J.L. Volume V: Hormonal Control of Growth. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 783-811Google Scholar). Upon binding of insulin, the insulin receptor becomes activated, resulting in its phosphorylation and the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. The growth factor binding protein 2 (Grb2)-son of sevenless complex (SOS) can then be recruited directly along with Shc or via insulin receptor substrate 1 or 2 (2Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Google Scholar). Usually, this leads to activation of Ras, Raf, and the MEK 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PD, PD098059; SB, SB202190; GST, glutathione S-transferase; P-, phosphorylated. kinase cascade, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 (3Whitmarsh A.J.

A parallel MAPK signaling pathway is the mixed lineage kinase/apoptosis signaling kinase, MAPK kinase 3/6, p38 kinase cascade. The effects of insulin on the p38 pathway are inconsistent. In fetal neurons, insulin can inhibit the p38 pathway as well as apoptosis (5Heidenreich K.A. Kummer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Google Scholar). Conversely, in cultured myoblasts, insulin can induce p38 activity and is required for cytoskeletal rearrangement and myoblast differentiation (6Conejo R. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 96-108Google Scholar, 7Conejo R. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 82-94Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that insulin stimulates p38 activity in L6 myotubes and that this activation is important for insulin-induced glucose transport (8Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Google Scholar, 9Sweeney G. Keen J. Somwar R. Konrad D. Garg R. Klip A.

Following fasting, the liver is the major source of plasma glucose, and hepatic glucose output is tightly regulated by insulin (12Butler P.C. Kryshak E.J. Schwenk W.F. Haymond M.W. Rizza R.A. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 217-225Google Scholar). Recently, the significance of hepatic insulin signaling was elegantly demonstrated in liver-specific insulin receptor knockout mice. These animals demonstrated severe hyperglycemia in the presence of dramatic hyperinsulinemia (13Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Google Scholar). The minimal deviation hepatoma cell line H35 (and its derivatives Fao as well as the H4IIE cells used in the present studies) has long been used as a model for the effect of insulin on intracellular signaling and hepatic gene expression (14Mukhopadhyay N.K.

These cells express receptors that bind insulin with a similar affinity to isolated rat hepatocytes and adipocytes, and insulin induces glycogen synthesis at physiologic concentrations (16Hofmann C. Marsh J.W. Miller B. Steiner D.F. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 865-874Google Scholar). Further, as in the liver, in these cell lines insulin regulates the transcription, mRNA levels, and activity of gluconeogenic enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and ornithine decarboxylase (17Granner D. Andreone T. Sasaki K. Beale E. Nature. 1983; 305: 549-551Google Scholar, 18Rosella G. Zajac J.D. Kaczmarczyk S.J. Andrikopoulos S. Proietto J. Mol.

Gurr J.A. In Vitro. 1984; 20: 723-731Google Scholar). Aside from its metabolic role, another important action of insulin is promoting growth. The induction of gene expression, including several immediate-early genes, may be important in cell cycle progression (25Messina J.L. Cuatrecasas P. Jacobs S.J. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology: Insulin. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 399-419Google Scholar,26O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Google Scholar). The proto-oncogene c-Fos is an early response gene and a member of a family of genes that, in combination with c-Jun and its family members, binds to AP-1 sites. In addition to insulin, c-Fos is induced by a variety of stimuli including a number of mitogens (26O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Google Scholar, 27Messina J.L. J. Biol.

Pip92 is a proline-rich cytoplasmic protein that shares little homology to any known proteins but is another regulated immediate-early gene. Its mRNA is induced by serum in fibroblasts and pheochromocytoma cells (29Lau L.F. Nathans D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3145-3151Google Scholar, 30Charles C.H. Simske J.S. O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6769-6774Google Scholar) and is increased in activated T-cells, and differentiated HL-60 cells (31Coleclough C. Kuhn L. Lefkovits I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1753-1757Google Scholar, 32Shimizu N. Ohta M. Fujiwara C. Sagara J. Mochizuki N. Oda T. Utiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12157-12161Google Scholar). We have previously shown that insulin regulates Pip92 mRNA abundance in rat hepatoma cells (33Bortoff K.D. Zhu C.C. Hrywna Y. Messina J.L. Endocrine. 1997; 7: 199-207Google Scholar). Studies examining the mechanism of regulation of the Pip92 and c-Fos genes found that their induction in response to stimuli is dependent upon a serum-responsive element, in addition to other elements, within each gene (34Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Google Scholar, 35Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Google Scholar). Little is known about interactions between the p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways. A few recent reports have suggested that some cross-talk may occur but with variable results. The data published to date indicate that any interplay between these two MAPK pathways may be specific to the cell type and the particular stimulus. Even less is known about the effects of the p38 pathway on insulin activation of ERK1/2. The present work describes cross-talk between the insulin-activated MEK/ERK pathway and the p38 pathway and the effects of the cross-talk on expression of two insulin-regulated immediate-early genes, c-Fos and Pip92. We identify the MEK/ERK pathway as a necessary component of insulin induction of these genes and demonstrate the ability of p38 inhibitors to modulate MEK/ERK signaling and insulin- and MEK/ERK-dependent gene expression. Rat H4IIE hepatoma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2in Swim's 77 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 3% calf serum, 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). Serum was withdrawn from subconfluent cultures 24–48 h prior to experimental treatments. All of the insulin treatments (Sigma) were 10 nm. SB202190, SB202474, and SB203580 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were used at 2 and 10 μm. PD98059 (50 μm) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), as were phosphorylated (active) ERK1/2, total ERK, and secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antisera. The transcription rates were assayed by the nuclear run-on method (36Messina J.L. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 754-761Google Scholar). Briefly, transcriptionally active nuclei were labeled with [32P]UTP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), RNA-isolated, hybridized with cDNA spotted on nitrocellulose, and autoradiographed. Densitometric data from autoradiographs were analyzed using ZeroD Scan from Scanalytics. The rat Pip92 cDNA was cloned from a library of insulin-induced genes as previously described (33Bortoff K.D. Zhu C.C. Hrywna Y. Messina J.L. Endocrine. 1997; 7: 199-207Google Scholar), and the complete murine c-Fos cDNA in pBR322 was obtained from the ATCC (pc-fos3). Serum-deprived cultures were washed with 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline. Whole cell (SDS) lysates were prepared as previously reported (37Ji S. Guan R. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13434-13442Google Scholar) and were assayed for protein content using the Bio-Rad DC assay. The lysates (50 μg) were resolved by discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a 10% resolving gel (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad MiniProtean II system and transferred to S & S Protran BA85 membranes using the Mini Transblot apparatus (39Burnette W.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Google Scholar, 40Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Total proteins or phosphoproteins were visualized by ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) reagents and autoradiography or digital image recording (41Whitehead T.P. Kricka L.J. Carter T.J. Thorpe G.H. Clin. Chem. 1979; 25: 1531-1546Google Scholar). Using the AlphaInnotech Fluorchem FC imager, sequential images of the chemiluminescent membranes were recorded. The range of emission intensities between faint bands and bright bands detected provides a linear data relationship with antigen concentration (42$$Google Scholar, 43$$Google Scholar, 44Kendrick N.C. Johansen J.J. Lee P.R. Santek D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 297-304Google Scholar, 45Tarlton J.F. Knight P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 123-128Google Scholar, 46Malek A.M. Izumo S. Alper S.L. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 1150-1153Google Scholar). Only bands in the linear optical density (O.D.) range were analyzed, and those beyond this range in each exposure were identified and rejected by the onboard software. Comparison of experimental bands to control bands of intermediate intensity allowed a broad range of signal intensities to be analyzed. Densitometric data from three to six experiments were averaged. Nonradioactive kinase assay kits were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology and used according to the supplied protocols. Briefly, p38 and ERK kinases were purified by immunoprecipitation with specific immobilized antiserum from 0.5–1.0 mg of soluble cell lysate by standard methods. The immune complex was washed two times in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 7.5 μg/ml aprotonin, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, and 0.125 mm NaVaO4) and then twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VaO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The immune complexes were then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of the purified recombinant substrate, GST-ATF-2 or GST-Elk, respectively (47Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Google Scholar, 48Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Google Scholar, 49Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was terminated by the addition of 1% SDS loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Phosphorylated substrate was detected by Western blotting with antisera specific for the phosphorylated form of ATF-2 or Elk1. Analysis of variance and Student'st tests were performed using the Instat program (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The values from the experimental treatments were expressed as fold change compared with the vehicle-treated controls within each experiment. The relative strength of correlations was calculated using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs). To directly characterize the intracellular signaling pathways activated by insulin in rat hepatoma cells, Western blots were performed using antisera to total and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2). As expected, treatment of H4IIE cells with insulin caused a large and rapid increase in phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Pretreatment of cells with the MEK 1 inhibitor (PD98059 (PD)) abolished the insulin effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation at all time points tested (Fig. 1A). Studies were performed to investigate the cross-talk between the MEK/ERK and p38 signaling pathways. To determine whether regulation of p38 was involved in acute insulin activation of ERK1/2, serum deprived cells were pretreated with the p38 inhibitor SB202190 (SB) at concentrations of 2 or 10 μm over a period of 5–270 min and compared with control (vehicle-treated) cells. Western blots revealed that, by itself, 2 μm SB, and to a greater extent 10 μm SB, induced ERK1/2 activation in a time-dependent manner (P-ERK1/2; Fig. 1, B andC). The levels of total ERK1/2 immunoreactive protein were not significantly or consistently altered by any of the treatments (Fig. 1, A–C, lower panels), indicating that changes in P-ERK1/2 bands reflected changes in the fraction of activated kinase. The results of three or more experiments with each concentration and at each time of SB treatment were compiled and expressed as the average fold increases of band intensity compared with untreated control cell lysate within each experiment (Fig. 1D). Treatment with 2 μm SB resulted in a maximum of 15.6-fold induction of P-ERK1/2 over control by 30 min compared with 33-fold above control by 60 min in cells treated with 10 μm SB. For both concentrations of SB, P-ERK1/2 remained elevated above control levels even at 150 and 270 min, the longest time points tested. Studies were performed to ensure that our measurements of P-ERK1/2 by Western blot were linear within the range of proteins used and the amount of P-ERK1/2 generated. Using a highly sensitive digital video camera, chemiluminescent Western blots were imaged directly. Over a 1–30-fold range, P-ERK1/2 band intensity in Western blots correlated with whole cell lysate concentration and, thus, P-ERK1/2 concentration in a linear fashion (Fig. 1E). In addition, to ensure that insulin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 correlated well with ERK activity, we performed ERK1/2 kinase assays (Fig. 1F). We found an identical pattern of ERK1/2 activity compared with ERK1/2 dual phosphorylation (P-ERK1/2) as described previously (50Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Google Scholar, 51Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Google Scholar). Because there was such consistency between P-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity, the simpler (P-ERK1/2) assay was used throughout the remainder of the studies. To examine whether the p38 inhibitor alters the ability of insulin to activate ERK1/2, H4IIE cells were pretreated with either 2 or 10 μm SB for 30 min. The cells were then either harvested immediately or treated with insulin for 5–240 min. Pretreatment with SB alone caused the expected, concentration-dependent large increase in P-ERK1/2. In addition, the induction of P-ERK1/2 was greatly augmented by insulin treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). Insulin treatment alone caused a maximum increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation of ∼28-fold by 5 min followed by a decrease to a plateau of around 2–3-fold above control levels between 120 and 240 min (Fig. 2C, left panel). Pretreatment with the lower concentration of SB (2 μm) caused an approximate doubling of the maximum level of insulin-induced P-ERK1/2 (28 versus 59-fold), and the higher concentration of SB (10 μm) caused an ∼4-fold increase in maximum ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with insulin alone (110-fold above serum free control). These increases in response to insulin are in addition to the elevated P-ERK1/2 at the beginning of insulin treatment that results from the 30-min incubation with SB. For comparison, in the right panel of Fig. 2C is the effect of SB alone (replicated from Fig. 1C, but on the expanded scale necessary for these experiments) or the combination of SB and insulin as presented in the left panel. Regulation of ERK activity in in vitro kinase assays parallels the induction of P-ERK1/2 in H4IIE cells treated with SB alone or prior to insulin addition (Fig. 2D). This indicates a greater than additive effect of 2 and 10 μm SB in combination with insulin to induce P-ERK1/2 as compared with the effects of the agents added separately (Fig. 2C). For example, if the effects are compared (treatment with SB 2 μm plus insulin versus the addition of the effects of SB 2 μm alone plus the effects of insulin alone), at 5, 15, and 120 min, there were 42, 122, and 266% increases above additivity, respectively, for induction of P-ERK1/2, suggestive of a synergistic effect of the combination of low dose SB and insulin. The effect of pretreatment with the higher dose of SB (10 μm), followed by insulin addition resulted in 81, 161, and 150% increases above additivity for induction of P-ERK1/2 at 5, 15, and 120 min, respectively, above the simple addition of the effects of 10 μm SB alone and insulin alone. Throughout all of these experiments, there were no significant changes in the amount of total ERK1/2 protein, indicating that changes in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 reflected changes in the fraction of activated kinase (Fig. 2,A and B, lower panels). To ensure that the effects of p38 inhibition by SB are not a unique feature of this compound, a separate but chemically similar inhibitor was also tested. The distinct inhibitor, SB203580, was also found to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation when added alone (Fig. 3A, lane 1). SB203580 also acted synergistically with insulin to increase ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). As a further control, a structurally related but inactive compound, SB202474, which does not inhibit p38 kinase activity, was also tested on H4IIE cells and was unable to increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation on its own or in combination with insulin treatment (Fig. 3B). To examine the effects of activation of the ERK1/2 pathway and the possible cross-talk of the ERK and p38 pathways in insulin regulation of gene expression, nuclear run-on assays were performed. H4IIE cells were either not treated or treated with 10 nm insulin, and the transcription rate of c-Fos and Pip92 was measured. In addition, other cells were pretreated either with vehicle (control) or with the MEK1 inhibitor (PD) to inhibit signaling through the MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway. As we have previously reported (27Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11700-11705Google Scholar, 33Bortoff K.D. Zhu C.C. Hrywna Y. Messina J.L. Endocrine. 1997; 7: 199-207Google Scholar), following 30 min of insulin treatment, there were significant increases in transcription of both genes (Fig. 4). There was no significant effect on the transcription of either gene when cells were treated with PD alone (50 μm). In cells pretreated with PD, the effects of insulin on c-Fos and Pip92 were reduced ∼70–80%, to levels not significantly different from basal (control) levels of transcription. These results indicate that MEK1, and most likely ERK1/2 activation, is necessary for the full effect of insulin-mediated induction of both c-Fos and Pip92 genes. A control gene, β-tubulin, was not significantly altered by insulin or PD alone or by the combination of the two. We then determined whether regulation of p38 could effect insulin-mediated regulation of c-Fos and Pip92 transcription. Serum-deprived cells were pretreated with the p38 inhibitor (SB) at concentrations of 2 or 10 μm and compared with vehicle control. Following a pretreatment period, the cells were stimulated acutely with 10 nm insulin for 30 min or left untreated. Low dose (2 μm) SB alone increased c-Fos transcription 5.5-fold while having a slight but nonsignificant effect on Pip92 (Fig. 5A; insulin data from Fig. 4B added to this graph for comparison). Pretreatment with 2 μm SB followed by stimulation with insulin for 30 min resulted in a 26.5-fold increase in c-Fos and a 12.2-fold induction of Pip92 transcription (Fig. 5A). For the two induced genes, the effect of 2 μm SB alone was less than that of insulin (48% for c-Fos and 21% for Pip92), whereas the combination of insulin and SB on transcription is greater than additive. If the effects are compared (treatment with SB 2 μm plus insulinversus the addition of the effects of SB 2 μmalone plus the effects of insulin alone), there was a 55% increase above additivity for c-Fos and a 61% increase above additivity for Pip92, suggestive of a synergistic effect (Fig. 5A), similar to that found in P-ERK1/2 induction. There was no significant effect of any of these treatments on transcription of the control gene, β-tubulin. The higher dose of SB (10 μm) by itself caused a dramatic 36-fold increase in c-Fos transcription, much larger than the 11.5-fold effect of insulin alone (the insulin data is again shown in Fig. 5B for comparison). Unlike the lower dose of SB, which was ineffective, the 10 μm concentration of SB induced Pip92 transcription 5.5-fold, similar to the 6.3-fold effect of insulin alone. When H4IIE cells were pretreated with the higher dose of SB and were then exposed to insulin for 30 min, there was no further increase in c-Fos transcription compared with 10 μm SB alone. However, this regimen resulted in an induction of Pip92 transcription that is 83% larger (21.5-fold) than the sum of the effects of 10 μm SB alone (5.5-fold) and insulin alone (6.3-fold), again suggesting a synergistic interaction of insulin and SB. The synergistic effects of SB and insulin on gene transcription coincided well with the synergistic effects of the p38 inhibitor and insulin on the induction of P-ERK1/2. Previous studies from our laboratory (27Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11700-11705Google Scholar) have shown that other potent inducers or combinations of inducers of immediate-early gene expression cause a maximum induction of 35–45-fold in c-Fos transcription in H4IIE cells and could never induce transcription beyond the 35–45-fold that is also observed in the present experiments. This suggests that the increase in transcription induced by 10 μm SB (alone) may achieve the maximum possible induction of c-Fos transcription in H4IIE cells. Thus, the combination of SB and insulin could not cause a further increase. It is clear that the addition of SB can increase phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and result in the increased transcription of insulin-regulated, ERK-dependent genes. Additionally, there is a synergistic induction of P-ERK1/2 and the ERK-dependent genes, c-Fos and Pip92, when SB and insulin are combined. However, whether a common pathway was used by both insulin and p38 inhibitors to activate ERK1/2 and subsequently induce c-Fos and Pip92 expression was tested by again using the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059. After 30 min of pretreatment with PD, the cells were treated or not for a further 30 min with SB. Greatly overexposed Western blots (Fig. 5C) indicated that the MEK1 inhibitor completely blocked SB-induced increases in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, as well as slightly reducing basal phosphorylation, suggesting that MEK1 activity is required for the activation of ERK1/2 by the p38 inhibitor. When the effects of MEK1 inhibition were studied on the stimulation of c-Fos and Pip92 expression, there was an inhibition of the SB (10 μm) induction of both genes by PD pretreatment (Fig. 5B). In addition, when cells were pretreated with PD prior to the combination of SB and insulin, the large induction of both c-Fos and Pip92 transcription were completely inhibited (Fig. 5B). This suggests that SB induces transcription of these ERK1/2-dependent genes, acting at the level of MEK1 or at a point in the insulin signaling pathway upstream of MEK1. The similarities in the induction of ERK1/2 activation/phosphorylation and transcriptional regulation of both c-Fos and Pip92 was striking. To further examine the relationship between these two variables, the correlation was quantitated (52Motulsky H.J. Searle P. InStat Guide to Choosing and Interpreting Statistical Tests. Graphpad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). Linear regression lines were obtained for induction of each gene (represented as the y variable) and the corresponding level of P-ERK induction (represented as thex variable) for each treatment described. The slopes of the lines obtained for c-Fos and Pip92 were 0.32 and 0.21, respectively (Fig. 6). The strengths of the correlation described by these regression lines (rs = 0.9084 and 0.8772, respectively) and their significance (p < 0.0001) (53Rosner B.A. Fundamentals of Biostatistics. 3rd Ed. PWS-KENT Publishing Company, Boston, MA1990Google Scholar) further support the idea that insulin alone, p38 inhibitor alone, or the combination of treatments all regulate c-Fos and Pip92 via ERK1/2. We then measured whether insulin had a direct effect on p38 activity in H4IIE cells. Consistent with our cross-talk hypothesis, basal activity of p38 was observed in quiescent cells. A modest, but not statistically significant increase in p38 activity was sustained over a time course of insulin treatment at all times greater than 5 min (Fig. 7). Small changes in p38 activity in response to insulin are consistent with recent reports of studies in a cultured skeletal muscle cell line (10Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Google Scholar). To study the regulation of insulin signaling, the activation (phosphorylation) state of ERK1/2 was examined in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells. Insulin treatment alone resulted in a rapid increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activity, whereas pretreatment with the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, abolished the effect of insulin on P-ERK1/2 as well as insulin induction of the c-Fos and Pip92 genes, implying that insulin control of these genes proceeded primarily through the MEK1-ERK1/2 pathway. Our findings agree with work in rat hippocampal neurons indicating that Raf- or fibroblast growth factor-mediated activation of ERK1/2 via MEK1 is required for the rapid activation of Pip92 transcription (34Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin induction of a c-Fos reporter construct was prevented by MEK1 inhibition (54Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Google Scholar). Thus, MEK/ERK activation is important for the activation of these genes and, as presented here, is of specific importance for insulin induction of c-Fos and Pip92 in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells. When H4IIE cells were treated with SB alone, there was a dose-dependent induction of P-ERK1/2 and of c-Fos and Pip92 transcription. Further, when cells pretreated with SB were given a secondary insulin stimulus, there was a greater-than-additive activation of ERK1/2 and of c-Fos and Pip92 transcription. It is not entirely clear why the lower concentration of SB alone is more potent with respect to transcription of c-Fos than Pip92, but presumably there are other factors involved in c-Fos and Pip92 transcription because they are not uniformly induced in these studies. One possibility is that Pip92 has a higher “threshold” of ERK1/2 activity necessary for induction than does c-Fos. The activation of ERK1/2 observed by treatment of cells with the p38 inhibitor SB202190 was also observed when cells were treated with a different p38 inhibitor, SB203580. The chemically related compound SB202474, which does not inhibit p38, has no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation either alone or in combination with insulin. This implies that it is the inhibition of p38 itself and not a nonspecific action of one of the p38 inhibitors that results in induction of P-ERK1/2. One could hypothesize that p38 activity inhibits transcription through a mechanism separate from the ERK1/2 pathway used by insulin in the regulation of these two genes and that the synergistic actions of the p38 inhibitors and insulin were due to SB having effects downstream of ERK1/2 activity. Thus, when p38 was inhibited by SB, this separate inhibitory pathway would have been neutralized, and the c-Fos and Pip92 genes would be induced to a greater degree. Clearly, this hypothesis was incorrect because the p38 inhibitors resulted in activation of ERK1/2 and acted to synergistically induce P-ERK1/2 in combination with insulin. Another hypothesis initially considered was that basal p38 activity was responsible for a separate and distinct “off” signal for transcription. In this model, transcription would be turned on by insulin, but the off signal would be deficient in the presence of p38 inhibition, and transcription would continue unchecked. This also was not supported by the evidence, because the p38 inhibitors alone could induce P-ERK1/2 and transcription of the c-Fos and Pip92 genes, even in the absence of insulin. Alternatively, the p38 pathway may have a tonic, inhibitory effect on MEK/ERK signaling, and inhibition of p38 by SB increased ERK1/2 pathway activity resulting in induction of ERK1/2-dependent genes. When a stimulator of the MEK/ERK pathway was added in combination with the p38 inhibitors, a greater fold induction of P-ERK1/2 and the c-Fos and Pip92 genes was obtained. This is a potential explanation of the data obtained in the present work, because the addition of an active, but not the inactive p38 inhibitor by itself resulted in activation of ERK1/2 signaling and subsequent transcription of c-Fos and Pip92. Our data also suggested that the activation occurs at or above the level of MEK1, because inhibition of MEK1 activity blocked the induction of transcription and P-ERK1/2 by insulin alone, SB alone, and the combination of SB and insulin. Conversely we found the basal level of p38 activity is modestly induced by insulin. The fact that this occurs with a slightly delayed time course, corresponding to the downward slope of the peak of insulin-induced ERK1/2 activity, fits well with the idea that p38 may play a negative regulatory role. Data regarding the activation of other, parallel, MAPK pathways by insulin has been somewhat contradictory. However, recent studies have indicated a major role of the p38 signaling pathway in insulin-inducible glucose transport. In these studies, insulin induced p38 activity in L6 myotubes. The p38 inhibitors, SB202190 and SB203580, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport by 40–60% without altering insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation (8Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Google Scholar, 9Sweeney G. Keen J. Somwar R. Konrad D. Garg R. Klip A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4806-4812Google Scholar, 10Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Google Scholar, 11Somwar R. Niu W. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Randhawa V.K. Huang C. Ramlal T. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46079-46087Google Scholar). In the present studies, the same inhibitors activated ERK and worked synergistically with insulin to stimulate ERK-dependent genes. This suggests a potential complex role of the p38 signaling pathway in the multiple actions of insulin. This may also imply a role for p38 that varies in the different insulin target tissues. Several recent reports suggest possible cross-talk between the MEK/ERK and p38 pathways, in ways supportive of our findings. For instance, in PANC-1, HL-60, L1210, and ECV304 cells, ERK1/2 activity or phosphorylation is increased by SB203580 or SB202190 (55Ding X.Z. Adrian T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 447-453Google Scholar, 56Flamigni F. Facchini A. Giordano E. Tantini B. Stefanelli C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 25-32Google Scholar, 57Flamigni F. Facchini A. Stanic I. Tantini B. Bonavita F. Stefanelli C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 319-328Google Scholar, 58Ishii Y. Sakai S. Honma Y. Leukocyte Res. 2001; 25: 813-820Google Scholar). In human skin fibroblasts, phorbol ester- and Raf-mediated induction of MEK1 and ERK1/2 are inhibited when p38 is activated by constitutively active MAPK kinase 3b, the kinase upstream of p38 (59Westermarck J. Li S.P. Kallunki T. Han J. Kahari V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2373-2383Google Scholar), and in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA and P-ERK1/2 are increased by SB treatment and reduced by constitutively active MAPK kinase 6b, another kinase upstream of p38 (60Singh R.P. Dhawan P. Golden C. Kapoor G.S. Mehta K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19593-19600Google Scholar). These observations suggest a role for the p38 pathway in MEK-ERK-dependent processes. However, several other reports obtained results different from those presented here; in baboon smooth muscle cells and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts use of the p38 inhibitor activates Raf, the upstream kinase for MEK1, but somehow fails to activate MEK1 and ERK1/2 (61Kalmes A. Deou J. Clowes A.W. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 71-74Google Scholar, 62Hall-Jackson C.A. Goedert M. Hedge P. Cohen P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2047-2054Google Scholar). Treatment with SB203580 did not alter epidermal growth factor-induced ERK activation in Swiss 3T3 cells or IGF-1-induced ERK activation in L6 myotubes (62Hall-Jackson C.A. Goedert M. Hedge P. Cohen P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2047-2054Google Scholar), and in mIMCD3 cells, inhibition of p38 blocks activation of P-ERK1/2 by hypertonic NaCl treatment (63Yang X.Y. Zhang Z. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F176-F185Google Scholar). Thus, there is extensive heterogeneity in the nature of the interactions between the MEK-ERK and p38 pathways. There appear to be cell type differences, differences in interactions with various stimulators of intracellular signaling, and differences in the effects of p38 activation or inhibition on the downstream effects being measured following activation of the MEK-ERK pathway. The present studies have identified potential cross-talk between the MEK-ERK and p38 pathways and a role of this interaction in insulin signaling and insulin action. The modest and slightly delayed effect of insulin on p38 activity may indicate that it functions to limit ERK1/2 activation and subsequent gene transcription rather than actively decreasing ERK1/2 activity and transcription. Future studies are required to identify the target at or upstream of MEK1 in the MEK-ERK signaling pathway affected by addition of p38 inhibitors, and why these effects may be tissue-specific. Future experiments will also be needed to determine whether insulin regulation of other insulin-sensitive genes is modulated by changes in p38 activity and subsequent changes in MEK1/ERK signaling.

These enzymes all contain a lectin-like (QXW)3 repeat sequence at the C terminus that consists of three tandem repeats (α, β, and γ). The putative lectin domain of one of the most ubiquitous isozymes, GalNAc-T1, is reportedly not functional. In this report, we have reevaluated the role of the GalNAc-T1 lectin domain. Deletion of the lectin domain resulted in a complete loss of enzymatic activity. We also found that GalNAc-T1 has two activities distinguished by their sensitivities to inhibition with free GalNAc; one activity is sensitive, and the other is resistant. In our experiments, the former activity is represented by the O-glycosylation of apomucin, an acceptor that contains multiple glycosylation sites, and the latter is represented by synthetic peptides that contain a single glycosylation site. Site-directed mutagenesis of the lectin domain selectively reduced the former activity and identified Asp444 in the α repeat as the most important site for GalNAc recognition. A further reduction of the GalNAc-inhibitable activity was observed when both Asp444 and the corresponding aspartate residues in the β and the γ repeats were mutated. This suggests a cooperative involvement of each repeat unit in the glycosylation of polypeptides with multiple acceptor sites.

This suggests a cooperative involvement of each repeat unit in the glycosylation of polypeptides with multiple acceptor sites. O-Glycosidically linked oligosaccharides, called mucin-type oligosaccharides, are linked to polypeptides through an α-linkage (GalNAcα1 → Ser (or Thr)) and are known to occur on mucins as well as on other secretory and membrane glycoproteins (1Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Google Scholar). The initial step in the biosynthesis of these structures is catalyzed by a group of enzymes known as the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-transferases). 1The abbreviations used are: GalNAc-transferase, UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; GT1, glycosyltransferase 1; HA, hemagglutinin These enzymes transfer GalNAc from the nucleotide-sugar donor, UDP-GalNAc, to certain serine and threonine residues on acceptor proteins (2Elhammer Å.P. Kézdy F.J. Kurosaka A. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 171-180Google Scholar, 3Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Google Scholar, 4Marth J.D. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 701-705Google Scholar). Recent progress in the molecular cloning of GalNAc-transferases has revealed a large gene family, with 10 distinct isozymes identified to date (5–16). All cloned GalNAc-transferases are type II membrane proteins (17Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Google Scholar) with a common domain structure that includes a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stem domain, a putative catalytic domain, and C-terminal (QXW)3 repeats. The luminal, putative catalytic domain of the GalNAc-transferases consists of two conserved subdomains, termed the glycosyltransferase 1 (GT1) motif and the Gal/GalNAc-transferase motif (18Hagen F.K. Hazes B. Raffo R. de Sa D. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6797-6803Google Scholar). The exact roles of these domains in catalysis are not clear. However, recent reports have revealed some interesting possibilities, including a demonstration of a specific interaction of the GT1 motif with UDP-GalNAc (19Tenno M. Toba S. Kézdy F.J. Elhammer Å.P. Kurosaka A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4308-4316Google Scholar) and the possible involvement of the Gal/GalNAc-transferase motif in the catalytic activity (18Hagen F.K. Hazes B. Raffo R. de Sa D. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6797-6803Google Scholar). The C-terminal (QXW)3 repeats occur exclusively in the GalNAc-transferases (20Hazes B. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1490-1501Google Scholar). This domain, which consists of three tandem repeats (α, β, and γ) with ∼50 amino acid residues in each repeat unit, is homologous to the B-chain in the plant lectin ricin (20Hazes B. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1490-1501Google Scholar). Hence, it is assumed that the (QXW)3repeats of the GalNAc-transferases can function as a lectin, although no direct sugar binding activity has been demonstrated. X-ray crystallography studies have revealed distinct features of the ricin molecular structure (21Rutenber E. Ready M. Robertus J.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 624-626Google Scholar, 22Rutenber E. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 260-269Google Scholar, 23Tahirov T.H. Lu T.H. Liaw Y.C. Chen Y.L. Lin J.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 354-367Google Scholar). Each repeat unit in the molecule has a unique, globular structure with several conserved hydrophobic amino acids at the core. Moreover, the cysteine residues in the repeats are essential for proper folding, and several amino acid residues in the molecule have been shown to interact with the haptenic monosaccharide, galactose. There is no information available about the three-dimensional structures of the (QXW)3repeats in the GalNAc-transferase lectin domains. However, computer-based analysis predicts conformational similarity with the ricin lectin domain (24Imberty A. Piller V. Piller F. Breton C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1353-1356Google Scholar, 25Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Google Scholar). Until recently, the function of the GalNAc-transferase lectin domain remained largely unknown. However, recent work has demonstrated the importance of this domain for GalNAc-T4, an isozyme that requires prior O-glycosylation of the acceptor peptides for catalytic activity (26Hassan H. Reis C.A. Bennett E.P. Mirgorodskaya E. Roepstorff P. Hollingsworth M.A. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38197-38205Google Scholar, 27Hanisch F.G. Reis C.A. Clausen H. Paulsen H. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 731-740Google Scholar). In contrast, glycosylation by GalNAc-T1, one of the most ubiquitous isozymes, is considered independent of the (QXW)3 repeats, since the mutations in this domain resulted in no effects or only modest effects on the activity (18Hagen F.K. Hazes B. Raffo R. de Sa D. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6797-6803Google Scholar). In this report, we have reevaluated the functional role of the GalNAc-T1 lectin domain, and we demonstrate that this domain is involved in glycosylation of polypeptides with multiple acceptor sites. Detailed information on the structure-function relationship of the lectin domain is also presented.

Underlined nucleotides are those altered to introduce mutations to GalNAc-T1. Rat GalNAc-T1 cDNA was obtained as outlined by Hagen et al. (28Hagen F.K. Gregoire C.A. Tabak L.A. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 901-909Google Scholar). The plasmid,pInsProAΔN42, containing cDNA for soluble, tagged, rat GalNAc-T1 was prepared by deleting the coding sequence for the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain from full-length GalNAc-T1 cDNA, and by fusing cDNA for an insulin signal sequence and a Protein A-IgG binding domain to the resulting 5′-end of the truncated GalNAc-T1 cDNA (Fig. 1 A), as described previously (19Tenno M. Toba S. Kézdy F.J. Elhammer Å.P. Kurosaka A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4308-4316Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis onpInsProAΔN42 was performed using primers listed above (19Tenno M. Toba S. Kézdy F.J. Elhammer Å.P. Kurosaka A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4308-4316Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the mutant clones was verified by DNA sequencing using ALFexpress II (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein (P-ΔN42), containing a Protein A-IgG binding domain at the N terminus, and mutant P-ΔN42 were expressed in COS7 cells and purified from the conditioned medium as described previously (19Tenno M. Toba S. Kézdy F.J. Elhammer Å.P. Kurosaka A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4308-4316Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of the recombinant molecules were also carried out as described (19Tenno M. Toba S. Kézdy F.J. Elhammer Å.P. Kurosaka A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4308-4316Google Scholar). The protein bands on the immunoblots were scanned and quantitated with a Luminoimage Analyzer LAS-1000 PLUS (Fujifilm). The activities of P-ΔN42 and mutant P-ΔN42 were determined as described below, and the activity levels were corrected for the enzyme protein concentration in the medium. A truncated form of rat GalNAc-T1, lacking the 32 N-terminal amino acid residues, including the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain, was amplified by PCR, using full-length GalNAc-T1 cDNA, cloned in pcDNA3.1, as a template. For this reaction, the primer set, MEcoT22I-GNT1 and 3.1R, was used. A truncated form of rat GalNAc-T1, lacking the 32 N-terminal (including the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains) and the 130 C-terminal amino acid residues (including the (QXW)3 repeats), was amplified by PCR using the primer set, MEcoT22I-GNT1 and DC130. PCR was carried out with KOD dash DNA polymerase for 30 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR products were purified and ligated into the pGEM-T easy (Promega) to generate plasmids containing the truncated GalNAc-T1cDNAs (pΔN32 andpΔN32ΔC130). A synthetic linker fragment, encoding His and hemagglutinin (HA) tags (HHHHHHGGYPYDVPDYAGG) with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pAcGP67A(a baculovirus transfer vector) to produce the vector,pAcGP67A-His/HA. pAcGP67A-His/HA contains His and HA tag sequences, downstream of a secretion signal sequence and a signal peptide cleavage site, such that the in-frame ligation of a cDNA encoding a protein of interest leads to the production of a secreted protein with a His and an HA tag at the N terminus.pΔN32 andpΔN32ΔC130 were digested withEcoT22I, and the coding sequences for ΔN32 and ΔN32ΔC130 were subcloned into the PstI sites ofpAcGP67A-His/HA, generating the plasmidspAcGP67A-His/HA/ΔN32 andpAcGP67A-His/HA/ΔN32ΔC130, for expression of secreted, truncated rat GalNAc-T1 fused to His and HA tags (H-ΔN32 and H-ΔN32ΔC130). Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in TMN-FH medium (Pharmingen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Co-transfection of Sf9 cells, with the plasmid (pAcGP67A-His/HA/ΔN32 orpAcGP67A-His/HA/ΔN32ΔC130) and Baculo-GoldTM DNA (Pharmingen), was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, 0.4 μg ofpAcGP67A-His/HA/ΔN32 orpAcGP67A-His/HA/ΔN32ΔC130 was mixed with 0.1 μg of Baculo-GoldTM DNA and then co-transfected into Sf9 cells in 24-well plates. Five days after transfection, recombinant viruses were collected from the culture medium. To prepare large virus stocks, the recombinant viruses were inoculated in Sf9 cells with multiplicity of infection of 0.01, and the culture media were harvested after 3–5 days. For the expression of H-ΔN32 and H-ΔN32ΔC130, recombinant viruses were inoculated into Sf9 cells with a multiplicity of infection of 5. After 3–5 days, the culture medium containing the recombinant proteins was collected. To assess binding activity with UDP, conditioned medium containing either H-ΔN32 or H-ΔN32ΔC130 was mixed with 20 μl of UDP-hexanolamine-agarose, in 600 μl of Buffer A (25 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 20 mm MnCl2 and 100 mm NaCl), and incubated by rocking, at 4 °C, for 2 h. Following centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was recovered, and the resin was washed with Buffer A. The supernatants were combined and referred to as the unbound fraction. The resin was washed twice with Buffer B (25 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 20 mm MnCl2, 1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Adsorbed proteins were eluted by washing the resin twice with Buffer C (25 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 m NaCl and 50 mm EDTA). Finally, strongly bound proteins that were not eluted with EDTA were released by boiling the resin in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Mutant GalNAc-T1 proteins in each fraction were immunoprecipitated by incubating with an anti-His6 tag antibody (Invitrogen) and Protein-G Sepharose. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The recombinant proteins on the membrane were probed with anti-HA 3F10 antibodies conjugated with peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and visualized using the ECL Western blotting analysis system from Amersham Biosciences. Control experiments were carried out as described above, with the exception that the conditioned media containing H-ΔH32 or H-ΔH32ΔC130 were preincubated with either 2 mm UDP or 50 mm GDP in 600 μl of Buffer A for 30 min at 4 °C, before adding 20 μl of UDP-hexanolamine-agarose to the incubation mixture. In the binding experiments with apomucin-Sepharose, samples containing either H-ΔN32 or H-ΔN32ΔC130 were fractionated in a similar fashion with the exception that Buffers A and B contained 0.25 mm UDP. Proteins recovered from each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and detection by ECL. GalNAc-transferase assays using apomucin as acceptor were carried out as described previously (19Tenno M. Toba S. Kézdy F.J. Elhammer Å.P. Kurosaka A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4308-4316Google Scholar). In assays using a peptide acceptor, the reaction was carried out in an incubation mixture composed of Buffer D (50 mmimidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10 mmMnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 6 nmol of UDP-[3H]GalNAc with ∼30,000 dpm) containing 0.5 μg of PPDAATAAPL or GVVPTVVPG and an appropriate amount of enzyme in a total volume of 40 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 0–16 h, and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 0.25 mEDTA. The reaction products were subsequently separated on C18 cartridges (Varian), as described (29O'Connell B.C. Tabak L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 423-425Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of P-ΔN42 and its mutants were carried out as described previously (19Tenno M. Toba S. Kézdy F.J. Elhammer Å.P. Kurosaka A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4308-4316Google Scholar). A secreted fusion protein (P-ΔN42), composed of a truncated rat GalNAc-T1 sequence with a Protein A-IgG binding domain fused to the N terminus, was expressed in COS7 cells. P-ΔN42 retained full activity and generated the same K m values for donor and acceptor substrates as the full-length enzyme (19Tenno M. Toba S. Kézdy F.J. Elhammer Å.P. Kurosaka A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4308-4316Google Scholar). Consequently, it was used for the following studies. To investigate the role of the GalNAc-T1 (QXW)3repeats in catalysis, we prepared three deletion mutants, P-ΔN42ΔC45, P-ΔN42ΔC85, and P-ΔN42ΔC130, in which the γ repeat unit, the γ and β repeat units, and the entire (QXW)3 repeat domain were deleted, respectively (Fig. 1). The mutant P-ΔN42 molecules as well as intact P-ΔN42 were subsequently expressed in COS7 cells, the secreted fusion proteins were isolated from the culture medium, and their activities were determined, using deglycosylated bovine submaxillary mucin (apomucin) as acceptor. Previous work has demonstrated that bovine submaxillary apomucin is an efficient substrate of GalNAc-T1 (30Elhammer A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5249-5255Google Scholar). The molecule is characterized by a high content of serine, threonine, and proline residues and as a consequence contains a large number of putative sites forO-glycosylation (31Bhavanandan V.P. Hegarty J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5913-5917Google Scholar, 32Bhargava A.K. Woitach J.T. Davidson E.A. Bhavanandan V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6798-6802Google Scholar, 33Jiang W. Woitach J.T. Gupta D. Bhavanandan V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 550-556Google Scholar, 34Jiang W. Gupta D. Gallagher D. Davis S. Bhavanandan V.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2208-2217Google Scholar). Chemical analysis of the apomucin preparation used in this investigation failed to detect any remaining GalNAc, indicating that virtually all of the GalNAc residues were released from the mucin molecule. The secreted fusion proteins were quantified by Western blotting, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Their enzymatic activities were corrected for the levels of enzyme protein and expressed as relative to that of P-ΔN42 such that the effect of each mutation on the enzymatic activity could be evaluated. Western blotting of the COS7 cell-produced proteins showed that their molecular weights correlated well with the degree of the truncation and also that the expression levels of all of the mutant proteins were significantly decreased, as compared with P-ΔN42 (Fig.1). Moreover, the enzymatic activities of the mutant proteins were reduced to almost background level. This suggests that the (QXW)3 repeats are important for stable expression and/or secretion as well as for the enzymatic activity of GalNAc-T1. To assess the importance of the C-terminal sequence for the activity of GalNAc-T1, the deletion mutants P-ΔN42ΔC1, P-ΔN42ΔC3, P-ΔN42ΔC9, and P-ΔN42ΔC12 were generated (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, P-ΔN42ΔC1 and P-ΔN42ΔC3 were fully active, whereas the activity of P-ΔN42ΔC9 was about 50% of that of P-ΔN42. Interestingly, the deletion of 12 amino acid residues from the C terminus (P-ΔN42ΔC12) resulted in complete inactivation of P-ΔN42. The reason for the inactivation of this mutant enzyme is not clear, but it may be related to the loss of Trp548. This tryptophan residue is conserved in ricin and in all GalNAc-transferases cloned to date. Moreover, it is reported to be essential for the formation of the hydrophobic core in the globular lectin domain (21Rutenber E. Ready M. Robertus J.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 624-626Google Scholar, 22Rutenber E. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 260-269Google Scholar, 23Tahirov T.H. Lu T.H. Liaw Y.C. Chen Y.L. Lin J.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 354-367Google Scholar). The results from the C-terminal deletion experiments suggest that a properly folded (QXW)3 repeat domain is essential for the enzymatic activity of GalNAc-T1. The (QXW)3 repeats are predicted to contain three disulfide bonds (Cys442–Cys459, Cys482–Cys497, and Cys523–Cys540) (i.e. one disulfide bridge in each repeating unit) (Fig.3 A) (24Imberty A. Piller V. Piller F. Breton C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1353-1356Google Scholar). It is likely that these disulfide bonds stabilize the globular conformation of each unit. To examine whether disruption of the disulfide bonds in the repeats affects the enzymatic activity, we prepared mutant constructs for each cysteine residue in the (QXW)3 repeat domain. Fig. 3 B shows that all the mutant proteins generated were completely inactive. Moreover, their expression levels were significantly decreased. Consistent with the results from our constructs with deleted (QXW)3 repeats (see above), this again indicates that the integrity of this domain is important for GalNAc-T1 activity. The inactivation of P-ΔN42, caused by truncation of the (QXW)3repeats or disruption of the disulfide bonds in the (QXW)3 repeats, may result either from a conformational change in the entire enzyme molecule or from malfolding of the C-terminal repeat domain. To evaluate the effects of deletion of the C-terminal domain, we compared the UDP binding activities of the GalNAc-T1 mutants. As reported previously, GalNAc-T1 primarily recognizes the UDP portion of UDP-GalNAc (2Elhammer Å.P. Kézdy F.J. Kurosaka A. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 171-180Google Scholar, 19Tenno M. Toba S. Kézdy F.J. Elhammer Å.P. Kurosaka A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4308-4316Google Scholar). In fact, UDP affinity chromatography has been used successfully for purification of GalNAc-transferases (35Wang Y. Abernethy J.L. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12709-12716Google Scholar, 36Hagen F.K. Van Wuyckhuyse B. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18960-18965Google Scholar). To investigate the capacity of the mutant enzymes for nucleotide sugar binding, we generated the GalNAc-T1 mutant enzymes, H-ΔN32 and H-ΔN32ΔC130 that, instead of a large Protein A-IgG binding domain, have a His tag and an HA epitope tag (19 amino acid residues in total) fused to the N terminus (Fig.4 A). This was done because our preliminary binding experiments demonstrated that enzymatically active P-ΔN42 failed to bind to UDP-hexanolamine-agarose, whereas P-ΔN42ΔC130 retained capacity for binding (data not shown). We considered it possible that the large Protein A-IgG binding domain (∼30 kDa) in P-ΔN42 (Fig. 1 A) could sterically interfere with the binding to UDP immobilized on agarose. Deletion of the entire C-terminal lectin domain might mitigate this steric hindrance, thereby making retention of P-ΔN42ΔC130 on the UDP-hexanolamine-agarose possible. The His/HA tag fusion constructs were expressed as secreted proteins in insect cells, using the baculovirus expression system. The secreted molecules were purified with Ni+-chelating chromatography and assayed for enzymatic activity. Whereas H-ΔN32 was enzymatically active at levels similar to P-ΔN42, H-ΔN32ΔC130 was inactive. This was also the case for P-ΔN42ΔC130. Culture media containing either H-ΔN32 or H-ΔN32ΔC130 were mixed with UDP-hexanolamine-agarose. Following incubation, the suspension was centrifuged to obtain fractions containing UDP-hexanolamine-unbound (the supernatant) and UDP-hexanolamine-bound (the resin) material. The UDP-hexanolamine-bound fraction was washed with the buffer containing 1m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. The adsorbed proteins on the resin were then eluted by chelating Mn2+, a metal ion essential for donor substrate binding, with EDTA. H-ΔN32 or H-ΔN32ΔC130 recovered in the bound and unbound fractions was immunoprecipitated with an anti-His6 tag antibody, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting, using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA-antibody. Adsorbed proteins not eluted with EDTA were released by boiling the resin in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In contrast to the results from the constructs containing a Protein A-IgG binding domain, both H-ΔN32 and H-ΔN32ΔC130 were capable of binding to UDP-hexanolamine-agarose (Fig. 4 B). H-ΔN32 appeared to bind stronger than H-ΔN32ΔC130. Still, small amounts of the recombinant proteins were also found in the unbound fractions. This may represent denatured proteins, since no enzymatic activity was detected in these fractions (data not shown). The specificity of the interaction(s) of H-ΔN32 and H-ΔN32ΔC130 with UDP-hexanolamine-agarose was investigated by preincubating both molecules with either 2 mm UDP or 50 mm GDP before adding the resin. Fig. 4 B shows that whereas GDP had no effect (data not shown), UDP completely blocked the binding of both molecules to UDP-hexanolamine-agarose, suggesting that the binding of both H-ΔN32 and H-ΔN32ΔC130 is specific for the UDP moiety on the resin. Taken together, these results suggest that the C-terminal deletion mutant proteins retain the capacity for UDP-binding, although they lack enzymatic activity. Next, we compared the acceptor binding activity of H-ΔN32 and H-ΔN32ΔC130. Medium containing either recombinant protein was mixed with apomucin-Sepharose. The apomucin-resins were treated as described above for UDP-hexanolamine-agarose, except that the buffers contained 0.25 mm UDP. H-ΔN32 bound quite avidly to apomucin (Fig.4 C). Most of the H-ΔN32 added to the apomucin matrix was recovered in the EDTA and SDS-PAGE sample buffer eluates. H-ΔN32 recovered in the unbound fraction was enzymatically inactive, suggesting that all enzymatically active molecules bound to the matrix. H-ΔN32ΔC130 also bound to apomucin-Sepharose, although with significantly lower affinity. Bound H-ΔN32ΔC130 was for the most part recovered in the EDTA eluate and in the wash fraction. None of the protein was recovered in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer eluate. It should be noted that both H-ΔN32 and H-ΔN32ΔC130 required UDP for binding to apomucin. Without UDP, both failed to bind and were recovered exclusively in the unbound fractions (Fig. 4 C). It appears likely that the binding of UDP produces a change in the conformation of the catalytic domain that allows binding to apomucin. The lectin domain appears not to be involved in this conformational change. Together with the experiments described above, these results suggest that H-ΔN32ΔC130, although enzymatically inactive, retains the capacity to bind to both UDP and apomucin. Consequently, deletion of the lectin domain from GalNAc-T1 apparently does not cause significant change in the overall conformation of the catalytic domain of the enzyme. The data also indicate that the catalytic domain in itself may be sufficient for binding to the substrates and that the interaction of the enzyme with the acceptor substrate (apomucin) was based on the protein-protein interaction, since the mutant, H-ΔN32ΔC130, in which the entire (QXW)3 domain is deleted, was capable of binding with apomucin. The reason for the weaker binding of H-ΔN32ΔC130 to apomucin and UDP, as compared with H-ΔN32, is not clear, but it may be related to the specific interactions between the catalytic and lectin domains of the molecule, as described under “Discussion.” Fig.5 shows a comparison of the amino acid sequences of ricin and GalNAc-T1 (QXW)3 repeats. X-ray crystallography studies of the ricin (QXW)3 repeats have demonstrated that they contain two independent active domains (1α and 2γ), both of which are capable of binding lactose (21Rutenber E. Ready M. Robertus J.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 624-626Google Scholar, 22Rutenber E. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 260-269Google Scholar). In these domains, the haptenic monosaccharide galactose is located in a cleft, in which conserved hydrophobic residues contribute to form a compact hydrophobic core. In the ricin 1α domain (Fig. 5 A), Asp22, Asn46, Gln47, Gln35, and Trp37 (Asp234, Asn255, Gln256, Ile246, and Tyr248 in the 2γ domain) are involved in binding with galactose. Trp49(Trp258 in the 2γ domain) is an essential aromatic residue for the hydrophobic core of the globular domain (21Rutenber E. Ready M. Robertus J.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 624-626Google Scholar, 22Rutenber E. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 260-269Google Scholar). Although the sequence identities are modest between the (QXW)3 repeats of GalNAc-T1 and ricin, threading methods predict both molecules to have similar globular conformations (20Hazes B. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1490-1501Google Scholar, 24Imberty A. Piller V. Piller F. Breton C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1353-1356Google Scholar). Judging from the structure of ricin, the α repeat, of the three repeats in GalNAc-T1, is most likely to have sugar binding activity, since this unit contains all amino acid residues required for the sugar binding and the hydrophobic core formation, with the exception of Gly455 (Fig. 5 B). We investigated the role of the GalNAc-T1 α repeat unit using site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids corresponding to residues identified as being involved in ligand binding in ricin. We mutated the possible sugar-binding sites, Asp444, Phe457, Asn465, and Gln466 of P-ΔN42, into alanine. We also mutated Gly455 into glutamine such that the mutated α repeat unit would have sugar-binding sites identical to those in ricin. Phe468, a residue putatively essential for the hydrophobic core structure, was also mutated. Three different mutations (F468W, F468Y, and F468A) were generated at this site. F468W and F468Y represent conservative amino acid replacements, whereas F468A is expected to result in disruption of the hydrophobic core due to loss of the aromatic ring and also to cause a conformational change in the repeat"

For some RPTPs the enzymatically inactive membrane-distal phosphatase domains (D2) were found to bind enzymatically active membrane proximal PTP (D1) domains, and oligomerization has been proposed as a general regulatory mechanism. The RPTP-like proteins IA-2 and IA-2β, major autoantigens in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, contain just a single enzymatically inactive PTP-like domain. Their physiological role is as yet enigmatic. To investigate whether the catalytically inactive cytoplasmic domains of IA-2 and IA-2β are involved in oligomerization, we exploited interaction trap assay in yeast and glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation strategies on lysates of transfected COS-1 cells. The results show that IA-2 and IA-2β are capable of homo- and heterodimerization to which both the juxtamembrane region and the phosphatase-like segment can contribute. Furthermore, they can form heterodimers with some other RPTP members, most notably RPTPα and RPTPε, and down-regulate RPTPα enzymatic activity. Thus, in addition to homo-dimerization, the enzymatic activity of receptor-type PTPs can be regulated through heterodimerization with other RPTPs, including the catalytically inactive IA-2 and IA-2β.

One of the major regulatory mechanisms in signal transduction pathways is the phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Two enzyme classes exert the delicate control of phosphotyrosine levels within cells: protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RPTP, receptor PTP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JM, juxtamembrane; PD, phosphatase-like domain; PDZ, PSD-95, DlgA, and 20-1; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RPTP, receptor PTP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JM, juxtamembrane; PD, phosphatase-like domain; PDZ, PSD-95, DlgA, and 20-1; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Members of the superfamily of PTPs can be classified into cytosolic and transmembrane or receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs). The latter consist of an ectodomain, which displays the use of a bewildering variety of protein modules, a single membrane-spanning region, and one (such as in PTPBR7 and DEP1 (1Ogata M. Sawada M.

Develop. 1999; 85: 3-14Google Scholar, 5Schaapveld R.Q.J. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 247-262Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in RPTPs that possess two phosphatase domains the membrane-proximal (D1) domain is catalytically active, whereas the membrane-distal (D2) domain shows no or only limited activity (6Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Google Scholar). Still, D2 domains are highly conserved among species, sometimes even more so than the D1 domains (7Schaapveld R.Q. van den Maagdenberg A.M. Schepens J.T. Weghuis D.O. Geurts van Kessel A. Wieringa B. Hendriks W.J. Genomics. 1995; 27: 124-130Google Scholar), pointing toward significant functional relevance. Evidence is accumulating that D2 domains are involved in protein interactions that regulate RPTP activity, including homo- and heterodimerization through interactions with D1 domains and/or the so-called wedge in the membrane proximal segment (8Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J.

Furthermore, D2 domain-mediated interactions themselves may be regulated as witnessed for the oxidative stress-induced stabilization of RPTPα dimers (17Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G.J. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Google Scholar). RPTP-like proteins exist that have a single but inactive PTP domain, and it has been suggested that the inactive domain is used as a phosphotyrosine recognition/binding moiety (18Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 301-306Google Scholar). Two such proteins, IA-2 and IA-2β, have drawn quite some attention because they were identified as the precursors of 40- and 37-kDa insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus-specific major auto-antigens, respectively (19Li Q.

The lack of phosphotyrosine-specific activity is due to some major substitutions of conserved amino acids within the PTP domain that are critical for the specific activity of PTPs against substrates. Specifically, the conserved proline in the so-called WPD loop is changed into a tyrosine, and the obligatory alanine close to the catalytic cysteine is an aspartic acid residue in the IA2 sequence. In IA-2β the catalytic aspartate of conventional PTPs in the WPD loop is replaced by an alanine, and again an aspartate replaces the obligatory alanine at position +2 from the catalytic cysteine of active PTPs. Indeed, appropriate back-mutations rendered the IA-2 PTP-like molecule catalytically active (28Magistrelli G. Toma S. Isacchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 581-588Google Scholar), in line with similar findings for inactive D2 PTP domains (29Lim K.L. Kolathkar P.R. Ng K.P. Ng C.H. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28986-28993Google Scholar, 30Buist A. Zhang Y.-L. Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. den Hertog J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 914-922Google Scholar, 31Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar). Many investigations are focused on the role of IA-2 and IA-2β in autoimmune diabetes, but only limited information is available about the physiological role of these RPTP-like proteins. Their expression pattern is restricted to cells of neuroendocrine origin where they are found as intrinsic membrane proteins of secretory granules (24Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18161-18170Google Scholar, 32Solimena M. Dirkx R. Hermel J.-M. Pleasic-Williams S. Shapiro J.A. Caron L. Rabin D.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2102-2114Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested their association with the cell cytoskeleton (32Solimena M. Dirkx R. Hermel J.-M. Pleasic-Williams S. Shapiro J.A. Caron L. Rabin D.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2102-2114Google Scholar, 33Cui L. Yu W.P. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34784-34791Google Scholar, 34Hermel J.-M. Dirkx R. Solimena M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2609-2620Google Scholar), which may be increased upon stimulation of insulin secretion (33Cui L. Yu W.P. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34784-34791Google Scholar). Recently, the binding of IA-2 to the PDZ domain of β2-syntrophin and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase in pancreatic beta cells has been reported (35Ort T. Maksimova E. Dirkx R. Kachinsky A.M. Berghs S. Froehner S.C. Solimena M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 621-630Google Scholar), and a model showing how IA-2 can link secretory granules with the cytoskeleton and signaling pathways regulating secretion has been proposed (36Ort T. Voronov S. Guo J. Zawalich K. Froehner S.C. Zawalich W. Solimena M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4013-4023Google Scholar). Both IA-2 and IA-2β also bind to the carboxyl-terminal domain of a novel spectrin, βIV spectrin, and, although the intracellular localization is different, a transient interactionin vivo during the intracellular route of this protein cannot be excluded (37Berghs S. Aggujaro D. Dirkx R. Maksimova E. Stabach P. Hermel J.-M. Zhang J.-P. Philbrick W. Slepnev V. Ort T. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 985-1001Google Scholar). This suggests that perhaps IA-2 and IA-2β are involved in the regulation of neuropeptide or peptide hormone secretory pathways, and some data even imply reversible phosphorylation of these RPTP-like proteins in the regulation of secretory-granule mobilization and recruitment in exocytosis (38Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 563-569Google Scholar). Here we report that IA-2 and IA-2β form homo- and heterodimers and can associate with other RPTP members. Importantly, co-expression of IA-2 and IA-2β together with RPTPα reduces the enzymatic activity of the latter. Oligomerization has been proposed as a regulatory mechanism for catalytically active PTPs (15Majeti R. Weiss A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2441-2448Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that the regulation of the enzymatic activity of RPTPs may in addition depend on the association with RPTP-like, catalytically inactive family members such as IA-2 and IA-2β. PCR fragments encompassing different regions of IA2 and IA-2β were cloned in pEG202 or pJG4-5 for the two-hybrid binding assay to create a fusion protein with the LexA DNA-binding domain, as well as a fusion with the LexA DNA activation domain, respectively, in pGEX to make GST fusion proteins, in pSG8VSV to make VSV-tagged fusion proteins or in pEGFP to obtain GFP fusion proteins. The different domains of IA-2 and IA-2β encompassed the following residues: the cytoplasmic domain of IA-2 (amino acid residues 601–979, GenBankTM accession number Q60673), the phosphatase domain of IA-2 (amino acids 733–979), the juxtamembrane region of IA-2 (amino acids 601–732), the cytoplasmic domain of IA-2β (amino residues 622–1001, accession number P80560), the IA-2β phosphatase domain (amino acids 767–1001), and the juxtamembrane region of IA-2β (residues 636–785). To generate expression plasmids for carboxyl-terminally myc epitope-tagged IA-2 and IA-2β, the stop codon was replaced by an oligonucleotide sequence encoding a BamHI or BglII site, respectively, using PCR. Restriction fragments of the phosphatase cDNAs were ligated into a cytomegalovirus promoter-based expression vector in a way that the open reading frame of the cDNAs was fused in-frame to a sequence encoding a five times-repeated myc epitope in the vector. All PCR-generated constructs were checked for mutations by automated DNA sequencing. The two-hybrid plasmid containing the phosphatase domain of PTP-BL and plasmids expressing VSV-tagged RPTPs DEP-1, RPTPς, and RPTPα or myc-tagged domains of RPTPε, RPTPμ, and RPTPα have been described previously (14Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar, 39Gross S. Knebel A. Tenev T. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Herrlich P. Bohmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26378-26386Google Scholar, 40Cuppen E. Gerrits H. Pepers B. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 671-683Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid plasmid containing the segment encoding 409 carboxyl-terminal residues of PTP-SL (which include the PTP domain) and the mammalian expression plasmids pSG8/PTP-SLcyt-VSV and pMyc-ERK2 will be described elsewhere. Plasmid DNAs and the yeast strain used for the interaction trap assay were provided by Dr. Roger Brent and colleagues (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) and used as described previously (41Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing the cytoplasmic domains of IA-2 or IA-2β fused to the LexA transcriptional activation or DNA-binding domain were introduced in yeast strain EGY48 (MATa trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::pLexAop6-LEU2) containing the reporter plasmid pSH18-34, which includes thelacZ reporter gene. Interactions were validated by growth and blue coloring on minimal agar plates lacking histidine, tryptophan, uracil, and leucine, which contain 2% galactose, 1% raffinose, and 80 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, buffered at pH 7.0. COS1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of COS-1 cells was performed by the DEAE-dextran method. In brief, for a 10-cm dish 9-ml serum-free medium was mixed with 15 μl of chloroquine (100 mm), 450 μl of DEAE-dextran (1 mg/ml), and 5 μg of plasmid DNA. Cells were washed once with serum-free medium, and the pre-mixed solution was added to the cells. Following a 2.5-h incubation, cells were shocked with 10% Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min. After gentle replacement of the Me2SO-containing medium, the cells were cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Monoclonal antibodies P5D4 (reactive against the VSV-G epitope-tag) and 9E10 (against the myc epitope tag) as well as the GFP-reactive polyclonal antiserum have been described previously (42Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Google Scholar, 43Kari B. Lussenhop N. Goertz R. Wabuke-Bunoti M. Radeke R. Gehrz R. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 345-352Google Scholar, 44Cuppen E. van Ham M. Wansink D.G. de Leeuw A. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 283-293Google Scholar). Polyvalent rabbit antiserum against IA-2 was a kind gift of Dr. Michael Christie (London, UK). Monoclonal antibody against GFP and polyvalent antiserum against the Myc tag were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The cDNA parts encoding the cytoplasmic domains of IA-2 and IA-2β were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pGEX vector for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced expression in bacterial host Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant proteins were purified with glutathione 4B-Sepharose beads as described previously (45Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Google Scholar). Triton X-100-soluble extracts (in buffer A: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 1 mm EGTA; 10% glycerol; 1% Triton X-100; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 10 μg/ml leupeptin; 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) of transfected COS1 cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with unloaded glutathione 4B-Sepharose beads or with beads loaded with 2 μg of GST, GST-IA2cyt, or GST-IA2βcyt, respectively. Beads were then washed five times with buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-VSV antibodies. Cells were harvested and lysed by scraping in 500 μl of ice-cold buffer A. After 5 min of incubation on ice, the lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B or protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads preloaded with monoclonal antibody P5D4 (2 μl of ascites fluid) or 9E10 (1 ml of hybridoma culture supernatant) at 4 °C overnight, while rotating. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in 20 μl of 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 200 mm dithiothreitol; 4% SDS; 0.2% bromphenol blue; 20% glycerol). Proteins were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western blotting. Blots were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mm NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20). Incubations with primary antibodies were done overnight at 4 °C. Incubations with secondary antibodies (20,000 times diluted peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG), and subsequent washes were done in TBST at room temperature. Labeled bands were visualized using freshly prepared chemiluminescent substrate (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5; 1.25 mm p-coumaric acid; 0.2 mm Luminol; 0.009% H2O2). COS1 cells, seeded in 6-cm dishes, were transiently transfected as indicated above. Cell extracts were obtained in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors, and assayed for PTP activity using pNPP as a substrate. Before harvesting, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. 200 μl of PTP assay buffer (0.1 mm succinic acid, pH 6.9; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; note the absence of phosphatase inhibitors) was added and cells were scraped. After freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing, the cells were sonicated twice for 10 s. The obtained lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × gat 4 °C for 20 min, and equal amounts of the extracts were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Obtained immunoreactivity for RPTPα protein was quantified by densitometric scanning of the ECL-generated x-ray film exposure using only the linear density range of the film. In parallel, aliquots were incubated in 500 μl of PTP assay buffer containing 10 mm pNPP as a substrate. At two different time points (30 and 60 min) 200-μl aliquots were taken, and the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of 2 m NaOH. The A415 nm value was measured spectrophotometrically. The recent finding of catalytically inactive membrane-distal RPTP phosphatase domain (D2) binding to enzymatically active membrane proximal PTP (D1) domains firmly established the dimerization potential of PTP domains (14Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar, 46Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar, 47Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar). To investigate whether the catalytically inactive cytoplasmic regions of the RPTP-like proteins IA-2 and IA-2β, which share a high sequence homology (72%), are capable of forming dimers, we exploited the LexA-based interaction trap in yeast (41Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar). The complete cytoplasmic portions of mouse IA-2 and IA-2β were subcloned in the appropriate bait as well as prey vectors, and following yeast transformation the combinations were scored for binding. The results reveal both homo- and heterodimeric interactions among the cytoplasmic domains of IA-2 and IA-2β (Fig. 1). These findings are specific, because both protein segments did not display binding to the protein encoded by the empty vector nor with phosphatase domain-containing segments of the unrelated PTP-SL/PTPBR7 (3van den Maagdenberg A.M.J.M. Bächner D. Schepens J.T.G. Peters W. Fransen J.A.M. Wieringa B. Hendriks W.J.A.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3832-3844Google Scholar) and PTP-BL (40Cuppen E. Gerrits H. Pepers B. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 671-683Google Scholar). As an independent means to underscore the observed interactions, we performed GST pull-down experiments (data not shown). Indeed, the bacterially expressed cytoplasmic region of IA-2 fused to GST (GST-IA2cyt), but not GST alone, could pull down the GFP-tagged cytoplasmic domain of IA-2 (GFP-IA2cyt) from lysates of transfected COS-1 cells. Likewise, GST-IA2βcyt was incubated with lysates from COS-1 cells overexpressing GFP-IA2βcyt, and again the GST fusion protein demonstrated association with GFP-IA2βcyt. In this assay we also tested whether the intracellular domains of IA-2 and IA-2β are capable of forming heterodimers. Indeed, the bacterially expressed cytoplasmic domain of IA-2 successfully brought down the GFP-tagged cytoplasmic domain of IA-2β and, reciprocally, GFP-IA2cyt was pulled down by GST-IA2βcyt (data not shown). Finally, to confirm the observed interaction also in vivo in mammalian cell systems, we co-expressed VSV-tagged cytoplasmic domains of IA-2 or IA-2β together with GFP-IA2cyt or GFP-IA2βcyt in COS-1 cells. In all combinations GFP-IA2cyt as well as GFP-IA2βcyt co-precipitated with VSV-IA2cyt or VSV-IA2βcyt (Fig. 2). The amount of GFP-tagged protein co-precipitated by VSV-IA2cyt appears to be more than that in the VSV-IA2βcyt precipitate, but this may relate to the lower expression level of IA-2β-derived proteins. In the reverse experiment, we were also able to show that the VSV-tagged domains co-precipitate with the GFP-containing constructs (data not shown). The above studies all depended on the use of truncated epitope-tagged fragments of IA-2 and IA-2β. To investigate whether these interactions may take place under more physiological conditions, we used full-length proteins in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In the absence of a mono-specific IA-2β antibody, we used full-length IA-2β that was tagged carboxyl-terminally with the VSV-G epitope in combination with full-length IA-2. The latter could be detected on Western blots using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against IA-2 that hardly cross-reacts with IA-2β. Upon immunoprecipitation of IA-2βVSV indeed full-length IA-2 was only detectable with the IA-2 antiserum when both proteins were co-expressed (data not shown), demonstrating the occurrence of full-length IA-2·IA-2β heterodimers. To illustrate the specificity of the interaction, we performed a similar experiment but using carboxyl-terminally myc-tagged IA-2β and VSV-tagged full-length IA-2 in combination with a VSV-tagged version of the active tyrosine phosphatase domain of PTP-SL (3van den Maagdenberg A.M.J.M. Bächner D. Schepens J.T.G. Peters W. Fransen J.A.M. Wieringa B. Hendriks W.J.A.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3832-3844Google Scholar) or with myc-tagged ERK2, a protein kinase. Independent of whether the myc- or the VSV-tagged protein was immunoprecipitated, we could only observe precipitation of IA-2·IA-2β complexes (Fig. 3). No interaction of the PTP-like molecules with ERK2 protein kinase or PTP-SL tyrosine phosphatase (see also Fig. 1) was observed. Importantly, comparison of signal intensities indicated that heteromeric complex formation by the phosphatase-like molecules was extensive. To examine how the intracellular domains of IA-2 and IA-2β interact, we made deletion mutants consisting of the juxtamembrane (JM) region or the phosphatase-like domain (PD) only. These mutants, all containing the VSV tag at their amino terminus, were investigated for their ability to co-immunoprecipitate with the cytoplasmic parts of IA-2 and IA-2β (Fig. 4). As compared with the entire IA-2 cytoplasmic domain, the phosphatase domain by itself displayed a higher binding affinity toward GFP-IA2cyt and GFP-IA2βcyt. The JM region, however, turned out to be the most effective in co-precipitating GFP-IA2cyt and GFP-IA2βcyt. To appreciate the difference in binding we should add that the ECL exposure time used in this experiment was much shorter than that used for Fig. 2. In contrast to the single band that is visible in lysates upon direct Western blot detection with anti-GFP antiserum, two sharp bands that are ∼4 kDa apart were detected following the immunoprecipitation. The lower band probably represents a degradation product rendered during the overnight precipitation. Because dimerization of phosphatases has recently been described as a regulatory mechanism for several RPTPs (9Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Google Scholar, 10Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Google Scholar, 11Blanchetot C. den Hertog J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar), we tested whether IA-2 and IA-2β can also interact with other RPTPs. Upon incubation of bacterially produced GST-IA2cyt and GST-IA2βcyt with lysates of COS-1 cells transfected with VSV-tagged RPTPα, RPTPς, and DEP-1, only the non-glycosylated form of RPTPα, but not the other RPTPs, was found to bind to the GST fusion proteins (Fig. 5). The three RPTPs used in this assay all represent a different subfamily of RPTPs (5Schaapveld R.Q.J. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 247-262Google Scholar). The phosphatase domain of the protein-tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL/PTPBR7 and PTP-BL had failed to interact with IA-2 and IA-2β cytoplasmic domains in earlier experiments (Figs. 1 and 3), underscoring interaction specificity. We subsequently performed co-precipitation experiments using transfected cell lysates containing myc-tagged portions of RPTPα, RPTPε, and RPTPμ together with VSV-tagged cytoplasmic domains of IA-2 or IA-2β. RPTPα and RPTPε belong to the same type IV subfamily of RPTPs, characterized by their short glycosylated extracellular parts, whereas RPTPμ represents a member of the type II, cell adhesion molecule-like subfamily (4den Hertog J. Mech. Develop. 1999; 85: 3-14Google Scholar, 5Schaapveld R.Q.J. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 247-262Google Scholar). All cytoplasmic domains co-precipitated with those of IA-2 and IA-2β. Interactions of RPTPα, RPTPε, and RPTPμ cytoplasmic domains with IA-2 were more pronounced than with IA-2β, again probably reflecting the lower expression levels of IA-2β (data not shown). We used again the VSV-tagged deletion constructs harboring the phosphatase domain or juxtamembrane region separately, to determine the parts involved in the interaction with the other RPTPs. These IA2 constructs were co-expressed together with different domains of RPTPα, RPTPε, and RPTPμ. All VSV-tagged proteins (VSV-IA2JM, VSV-IA2PD, and VSV-IA2cyt) were capable of interacting with single D1 or D2 phosphatase domains of RPTPα (Fig. 6) and RPTPε as well as with the D2 domain of RPTPμ (Fig. 7). Signal intensities suggest that association with the D2 domains is somewhat stronger than with the D1 domains. On the contrary, in the case that both PTP domains together are present (myc-εD12 construct) the interaction with IA-2 parts is almost abolished. Again the juxtamembrane region of IA-2 is the strongest binding partner of the different domains, whereas the phosphatase domain alone shows only a weak interaction. With IA-2β-derived constructs, essentially the same results were obtained (data not shown).Figure 7Interaction between IA-2 and RPTP ε/RPTPμ. COS1 cells were transiently transfected with the VSV-tagged juxtamembrane region, phosphatase domain, or the entire cytoplasmic region of IA-2 with or without various myc-tagged PTP domain combinations from RPTPε and PTPμ. IA-2 protein parts were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-VSV antibody P5D4, and co-precipitating proteins were visualized with polyvalent anti-myc antiserum (A).

Mutagenesis of these motifs revealed that they are essential for RNase T activity, indicating that they probably form the RNase T catalytic center in a manner similar to that found in other DEDD exonucleases. We also identified by sequence analysis three short, but highly conserved, sequence segments rich in positively charged residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of these regions indicated that they are involved in substrate binding. Additional analysis revealed that residues within the C-terminal region of RNase T are essential for RNase T dimerization and, consequently, for RNase T activity.

RNase T is one of eight exoribonucleases present inEscherichia coli (1Deutscher M.P. Li Z. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 67-105Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It belongs to the DEDD exonuclease superfamily, characterized by common motifs containing four invariant acidic residues, which in DNA polymerases were shown to form the exonuclease active site (2Zuo Y.

RNase T plays an important role in stable RNA metabolism in E. coli, including tRNA end turnover (3Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the substrates of RNase T in vivo share a common sequence feature consisting of a stable, double-stranded (ds) stem followed by a few unpaired 3′ nucleotides, RNase T actually is a single-strand-specific exoribonuclease that acts in the 3′-to-5′ direction in a non-processive manner (11Zuo Y.

However, whereas otherE. coli exoribonucleases stop several nucleotides downstream of an RNA duplex, RNase T can digest RNA up to the first base pair, although it slows as it approaches the duplex structure. The presence of a free 3′-hydroxyl group is required for the enzyme to initiate digestion (11Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

In this study, we investigate in detail structure-function relationships in RNase T using a combination of sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Our data indicate that the conserved acidic residues, as well as several other residues at the DEDD signature motifs, are important for RNase T catalytic activity, consistent with a common catalytic mechanism for all DEDD members. In addition, we also identified three other conserved sequence segments (the nucleic acid binding sequence (NBS) 1The abbreviations used are: NBS, nucleic acid binding sequence; RNT, RNase T; DP3E, DNA polymerase III ε subunit1The abbreviations used are: NBS, nucleic acid binding sequence; RNT, RNase T; DP3E, DNA polymerase III ε subunitsegments), containing a high level of positively charged residues in RNase T orthologs. Kinetic analyses of the corresponding mutants suggest that the basic residues of the NBS segments are involved in nucleic acid-binding. Finally, we have shown that the C-terminal region of RNase T is important for RNase T dimerization and, consequently, for activity. These data identify residues needed for RNase T action and provide essential information for the development of a detailed model of RNase T action presented in the accompanying article (15Zuo Y.

Quantitative data were obtained with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). One unit of RNase T activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 μmol of mononucleotide/h. E. coli strains CAN20-12E (RNase I−, II−, D−, BN−) and CAN20-12ET− (RNase I−, II−, D−, BN−, PH−) were described previously (17Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P.

The wild type rnt gene was PCR-amplified using the T5P and T3P primers, and the resulting product was cloned into the SacI and BamHI sites of plasmid pUC18 to generate plasimid pUT18. To facilitate site-directed mutagenesis, three more restriction sites, for NgoMI, BspEI, and NheI, were introduced into the pUT18 plasmid by silent mutations using the DNA primers shown in Table I. All mutant rnt clones were generated in the pUT18 plasmid by PCR, and all the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pUT18-based constructs were also used to overexpress RNase T in CAN20-12ET− cells that lack endogenous RNase T.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesisPrimerMutationSequence (5′→3′)T5PAAAGAGCTCATCGCGCCCGCT3PAAAGGATCCTGAATCATTGCTNM5GAAACAGCCGGCTTTAACGCCAAAACCTNM3GGCGTTAAAGCCGGCTGTTTCAACTBE5AGCGTCCGGATGTAACCGCGCCTBE3TACATCCGGACGCTTTAATACCTTTACGTNH5ACGCGCTAGCCTGAAACGTAACCCGTNH3TCAGGCTAGCGCGTTCTGCGGCGGCCATCTR13AR13AACTTACCGGTCTGTGCGACGCTTTTCGTGGTTTTTATCCTR15AR15AACTTACCGGTCTGTGCGACCGTTTTGCTGGTTTTTATCCTD23AD23AAAAGCCGGCTGTTTCAACAGCGATCACAACAGGTE25AE25AAAAGCCGGCTGTTGCAACATCGATCACAACAGGTK108AK108ATACATCCGGACGCTGCAATACCTTTACGTACTR114AR114AAGCGTCCGGATGTAACGCCGCCATTATGGTGTH120AH120AATGGTGGCGGCCAATGCCAATTTTGTD125AD125AGGCGCACAATGCCAATTTTGCTCACAGCTTTATGATGGTK139AK139AACGCGCTAGCCTGGCACGTAACCCGTTCCACCCTKRAAK139A/R140AACGCGCTAGCCTGGCAGCTAACCCGTTCCACCCTD150AD150ACCACCCTTTCGCCACTTTTGCCACTGCTGCACTGGTH181AH181ACGACAGCACCCAGGCGGCCTCCGCGCTGTD186AD186ACCGCGCTGTACGCCACCGAACGCACTW207AW207AGGAAACGTCTGGGAGGCGCGCCGCTATCTGCTW207StopW207StopAAAGGATCCTCAGCCTCCCAGACGPrimers T5P and T3p, which contain SacI and BamHI sites, respectively, were used for cloning the rnt gene into plasmid pUC18 to generate plasmidpUT18.

Fractions were collected, and the elution of RNase T was determined by a dot-blot assay using RNase T antibody coupled with a peroxidase-labeled second antibody (13Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The sequence of E. coli RNase T is closely related to that of the proofreading domains/subunits of bacterial DNA polymerases, such as the ε subunit of DNA polymerase III (Dp3E/DnaQ protein in E. coli) (2Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 8Koonin E.V. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2521-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 1 is a multiple sequence alignment of RNase T orthologs from a number of completed genome sequences. Also included are the Dp3E orthologs from the corresponding genomes for comparison. Like all other DEDD family members, the Exo motifs, especially the invariant acidic residues in these motifs common to all DEDD members, are also conserved in the RNase T orthologs. The three highly conserved Exo motifs are labeled ExoI,ExoII, and ExoIII in Fig. 1. RNase T orthologs are highly homologous to each other, with generally more than 50% sequence identity. Thus, besides the Exo motifs, there are many other highly conserved sequence segments among RNase T orthologs. Of these, the most prominent are three conserved, positively charged regions specific for the RNase T orthologs but absent from the bacterial DNA polymerase IIIs. They are labeled NBS1, NBS1, andNBS3, because, as will be shown, they cluster to form a nucleic acid-binding site. The selection of residues for site-directed mutagenesis in this study was based on multiple sequence alignments, such as those shown in Fig. 1. Our focus has been on conserved residues at the Exo motifs, the NBS segments, and the putative dimerization interface. To determine whether the invariant acidic and other residues present within the Exo signature motifs in RNase T actually are important for activity, several of these residues were mutated to alanines. Similar levels of RNase T overexpression were observed for the wild-type protein and for each of the mutant proteins based on Western blot analysis (data not shown). RNase T activity was assayed in cell extracts using tRNA-C-C-[3H]A as substrate (TableII). Other than D125A, all mutations in the DEDD signature motifs (D23A, E25A, H120A, D150A, H180A, and D186A) resulted in a dramatic reduction (≥95%) of RNase T activity compared with the wild-type protein. Kinetic analyses with several of the mutants indicated that the alanine substitutions generally lead to an increase of only a 2–3-fold in Km, suggesting that catalysis rather than substrate binding is probably the major factor accounting for the inability of the mutant proteins to remove the terminal A residue from tRNA. We conclude from these data that this set of amino acid residues, common to all DEDDh members (2Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 8Koonin E.V. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2521-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), is essential for RNase T activity. Interestingly, the aspartate residue at position 125 seems to be less important for RNase T activity. In the exonuclease domain of Klenow fragment DNA polymerase (18Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), the residue corresponding to Asp125 (Asp424) is known to coordinate with one of two divalent metal ions through two water bridges, leading to stabilization of the transition state and to the departure of the oxyanion from the group during catalysis. Detailed structural information will be required to explain why Asp125 is of reduced importance in RNase T.Table IIEffect of mutations at DEDD signature motifs on RNase T activityRNase T mutationRelative activityK m%μmWild type10010ExoI motifD23A1.423E25A1.3NDExolI motifH120A5.4NDD125A3433ExoIII motifH181A1.4NDD186A0.725OtherD150A1.4NDAssays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” using sonicated extracts prepared from CAN20–12ET− cells containing plasmid pUT18 with the indicated mutations.

Based on sequence analysis, the NBS sequence segments are characteristic for RNase T proteins. These segments are rich in positively charged arginine and lysine residues, raising the possibility that they may form a nucleic acid-binding site. To investigate whether the NBS segments might participate in substrate binding, alanine substitutions were made for several of the arginine and lysine residues individually and in combination. As shown in TableIII, mutations of residues within each NBS segment result in reduction of RNase T activity. Except for R13A, which is essentially inactive, individual alanine substitutions lead to ∼3–7-fold reductions in activity, whereas multiple substitutions lead to cumulative defects in activity under usual assay conditions. In contrast to the mutations in the DEDD motifs, the NBS mutant proteins, especially the multiple mutants, have greatly elevatedKm values for tRNA, but essentially no alterations in V max. The increasedKm values probably result from weakened RNase T binding of the tRNA substrate upon alanine substitution for the basic residues in the NBS segments. Earlier work (13Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) showed that for RNase T, the Km value for tRNA is near its binding constant.Table IIIEffect of mutations at NBS residues on RNase T activityRNase T mutationRelative activityK mV max%μmunit/mgWild type1001015NBS1 segmentR13A0.04∼150<0.1R15A14∼100∼22NBS2 segmentK108A26∼150∼29R114A24∼120∼22K108A/R114A6∼250∼16NBS3 segmentK139A35∼80∼24NBS2 and NBS3 segmentsK108A/K139A10∼200∼14K108A/R114A/K139A2>300ND3-aND, not determined.K108A/R112A/K139A/R140A0.6>300NDAll assay conditions and analyses were as described in Table II.3-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab All assay conditions and analyses were as described in Table II. NBS1 residue Arg13 seems to differ from the other single mutants in that mutant R13A displays extremely reduced RNase T activity. In fact, R13A is the most inactive of all the RNase T point mutations made. This finding suggests that Arg13 plays an important role in RNase T action and may affect not only substrate binding but also RNase T catalysis. We will return to this point in the accompanying article (15Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50160-50164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of NBS segments in substrate inding and catalysis, the RNase T activity of several NBS mutants was also assayed using very short oligonucleotides as substrates. We reasoned that if the NBS residues were distant enough from the catalytic center, they might be required for action on tRNA, but not for the binding of very short substrates. The DNA oligonucleotides dA4 and dA2 were used for these studies rather than RNA oligonucleotides because DNA substrates have considerably lowerKm values (10Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29654-29661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown in TableIV, for NBS1 mutant R15A and the NBS2/NBS3 triple mutant K108A/R112A/K139A, alanine substitutions have virtually no effect on RNase T activity against the short oligonucleotides, in contrast to the major loss in activity when tRNA was the substrate (Table III). These findings support the conclusion that the NBS basic residues contribute little to the binding of short oligonucleotides at the RNase T active site, even though they are essential for binding of long substrates, such as tRNAs. These data further support the idea that the reduced RNase T activity of NBS mutants using tRNA as substrate is most probably caused by weaker substrate binding, not reduced catalysis.Table IVEffect of mutations at NBS residues on RNase T activity agains short substratesRNase T MutationdA4dA2KmV maxKmV maxμmunits/mgμmunits/mgWild type2621424R15A61001949K108A/R114A/K139A4602533Oligonucleotide substrates were 5′ 32P-labeled.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Comparison of various protein structures of DEDD domain-containing proteins suggests that the very C termini of the DEDD domains are all directly involved in the interfacial interactions between domains or subunits. Involvement of the C terminus may also be true for dimerization of RNase T, as suggested by the structural modeling described in the companion article (15Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50160-50164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This conclusion was also supported by a mutation near the C terminus (G206S) that was shown previously to affect RNase T dimerization (14Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To further confirm the direct involvement of the C terminus of RNase T in its dimerization, we mutated the last tryptophan residue to an alanine (W207A). A second mutant, W207Stop, lacking the last nine residues at the C terminus, was also generated. These two RNase T mutant proteins were each examined for their dimerization status using gel filtration run at different temperatures. As shown previously (14Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), wild-type RNase T elutes as a single peak at the dimer position corresponding to 43 kDa over a wide range of temperatures (20 ° and 37 °C are presented here). In contrast, the W207Stop mutant protein elutes at the monomer position even at 10 °C, the lowest temperature tested (Fig.2). A similar result was also observed for the W207A mutant (data not shown). Earlier work had shown that low temperature promotes dimerization (14Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These data support the conclusion that the C terminus of RNase T is essential for RNase T dimerization. Further evidence for the involvement of C-terminal residues in dimerization comes from the temperature-sensitive nature of the activities of the W207A and W207Stop mutants (TableV). Thus, compared with wild type RNase T activity, the W207A mutant activity changes from about 2% at 45 °C to 34% at 25 °C, and the W207Stop mutant activity increases from 8% at 45 °C to about the same level as the wild type at 25 °C. These data initially were surprising because, as shown above, both the W207A and the W207Stop mutant proteins should exist as monomers at all of these temperatures and, as shown previously (14Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), there is a direct correlation between RNase T activity and its dimerization status. The most likely explanation is that the presence of tRNA substrate during the assay stabilizes the dimer form of the mutant enzymes and that this substrate-assisted dimerization is more effective as the temperature is lowered. In fact, tRNA has previously been shown to stabilize a dimerization mutant against temperature inactivation (13Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

Although RNase T is an important enzyme for various aspects of RNA metabolism, it was also found to act on single-stranded DNA substratesin vitro (9Viswanathan M. Dower K.W. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35126-35131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Among the DNA exonuclease activities found in E. coli, the RNase T DNase activity is most similar to the activity of the proofreading subunit of DNA polymerase III (10Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both activities act in the 3′-to-5′ direction on single-stranded DNA in a non-processive manner, releasing 5′ mononucleotides as the product. In fact, RNase T is a close homolog of the DNA polymerase III proofreading subunit (2Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 8Koonin E.V. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2521-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); both proteins belong to the DEDD exonuclease superfamily (2Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The proteins of the DEDD superfamily contain a characteristic core composed of four invariant acidic residues embedded within three highly conserved sequence motifs, which were shown in DNA polymerases to form the exonuclease active site (18Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar,19Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). The studies described here, in which mutations in residues of the DEDD signature regions of RNase T dramatically reduce its activity, suggest that RNase T exploits the same chemistry for nucleic acid degradation as other DEDD exonucleases. RNase T orthologs share a high degree of sequence identity. Besides the highly conserved DEDD signature motifs, RNase T orthologs contain other common sequence features, namely, the highly positively charged NBS sequence segments, shown in Fig. 1. These regions distinguish RNase T from DNA polymerase III. Alanine substitution of basic residues within the NBS segments led to reduced RNase T activity against tRNA substrates and increased Km values. These results lead to the suggestion that the NBS segments are required for binding of tRNA substrates. In contrast, mutation of the NBS regions generally does not affect RNase T activity against short oligonucleotide substrates, suggesting that most NBS residues are at some distance from the catalytic center. However, one NBS1 mutation, R13A, strongly affects RNase T activity against both long and, as will be shown in the accompanying article, short substrates. Thus, NBS residues seem to extend from the vicinity of the catalytic center, where they would bind the 3′ end of the substrate, to regions in which they would stabilize binding of long substrates, such as tRNA. Early studies found that purified RNase T was strongly inhibited by elevated ionic strength (12Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that charge interactions probably play an important role in RNase T action. This would be expected if basic residues within the NBS regions were involved in nucleic acid binding. In addition to the catalytic center and substrate-binding sites, we have also shown that the C terminus of RNase T is important for RNase T dimerization and, consequently, for its activity. It is not yet clear how the C-terminal residues that affect dimerization are related to residue Cys168, which was shown previously to participate in RNase T dimerization (13Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Earlier work showed that formation of a homodimer is required for RNase T to function (14Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the NBS substrate binding sites and the DEDD catalytic centers from two different subunits complement each other to form a fully functional active site through dimerization. Consistent with this explanation, the dimerization-defective mutant C168S has essentially unaffected tRNA binding, even at a temperature at which it is a monomer (13Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J.

The release of Smac antagonizes several IAPs and assists the initiator caspase-9 and effector caspases (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7) in becoming active, ultimately leading to death of the cell. Translocation of Smac along with cytochrome<i>c</i> and other mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins represent important regulatory checkpoints for mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Whether Smac and cytochrome <i>c</i> translocate by the same mechanism is not known. Here, we show that the time required for Smac efflux from the mitochondria of cells subjected to staurosporine-induced apoptosis is approximately four times longer than the time required for cytochrome <i>c</i> efflux. These results suggest that Smac and cytochrome <i>c</i> may exit the mitochondria by different pathways."

To examine the quaternary structure of CNG channels and how it changes during ion channel gating, we introduced single cysteines along the C helix of each subunit in an otherwise cysteineless channel. We found that cysteines on the C helices could form intersubunit disulfide bonds, even between diagonal subunits. Disulfide bond formation occurred primarily in closed channels and inhibited channel opening.

RNase T, a DEDD exonuclease, plays an important role in many aspects of stable RNA metabolism (1Deutscher M.P. Li Z. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The enzyme forms a homodimerin vivo, and formation of the homodimer is required for it to function (7Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), RNase T was examined by sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis to identify regions of the protein important for catalysis, substrate binding, and dimerization. We showed first that the DEDD signature motifs probably form the RNase T catalytic center. Second, sequence analysis identified several highly conserved, positively charged sequence segments, termed NBS1–3, 1The abbreviations used are: NBS, nucleic acid binding sequence; RNT, RNase T; DP3E, DNA polymerase III ε subunit that are present in all RNase T orthologs, but absent from the closely related proofreading domains/subunits of DNA polymerases, that seem to be involved in the binding of nucleic acid substrates. Finally, we showed that residues at the C terminus of each monomer of RNase T are important for dimerization. Based on this information, additional experiments, and homology modeling, we present here a structural and functional model for RNase T. Based on this model, we show that the NBS segments cluster in the tertiary structure to form a positively charged surface patch suitable for nucleic acid binding. We also propose that the DEDD catalytic center and the NBS are on opposite sides of an RNase T monomer and are brought together to create a complete active site through dimerization. Direct evidence for the complementarity of the two RNase T subunits in the homodimer was obtained by reconstituting partial RNase T activity from two inactive mutants, one an NBS mutant defective in substrate binding and the other a DEDD mutant defective in catalysis. These results explain the requirement for dimerization to generate functional RNase T. Purified Escherichia coli RNase T was prepared as reported previously (9Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. J. Biol.

Zuo, personal communication.served as templates for the homology modeling. Partially purified RNase T mutant proteins were obtained using Affi-Gel Blue chromatography. The S100 fraction (∼ 30 ml) was prepared in loading buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 100 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol. After loading the S100 fraction onto an Affi-Gel Blue column (1.0 × 60 cm), the column was washed with 2 volumes of the loading buffer and 2 volumes of washing buffer. The washing buffer was the same as loading buffer except that it contained 300 mm KCl. RNase T was eluted by increasing the KCl concentration to 1 m. Peak fractions eluted from Affi-Gel Blue are about 50% pure based on SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Sonicated cell extracts were prepared as described previously (16Padmanabha K.P. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1376-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from CAN20-12ET− cells carrying the corresponding pUT18 plasmid. For reconstitution, equal amounts of proteins from the two extracts were mixed, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then cooled at room temperature for 30 min. The mixtures were then used directly for activity measurement. Activity assays were carried out in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg of tRNA-CC-[3H]A substrate. For comparison, individual mutant cell extracts and the parental strain extract were treated and assayed in parallel. The DEDD exonuclease superfamily can be divided into two groups, DEDDy and DEDDh, depending on whether a conserved Y-x (3Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)-D sequence or a H-x (4Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)-D sequence is present in the ExoIII motif (17Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). RNase T is a member of the DEDDh group. Many protein structures from the DEDDy group, primarily proofreading domains of DNA polymerases, have been available for some time. However, DEDDh protein structures have appeared only recently. In this study, we used the crystal structures of two DEDDh members, that of E. coli exonuclease I (Protein Data Bank structure number1FXX) (15Breyer W.A. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that of E. coli oligoribonuclease, solved recently in our department,2 as templates to model theE. coli RNase T structure. E. coli exonuclease I exists as a monomer, whereas oligoribonuclease forms a homodimer. It was known that RNase T must form a homodimer to function (7Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, a monomer structure of RNase T was built first and optimized before it was modeled into a homodimer based on the relative orientation of the two subunits in the oligoribonuclease homodimer. Because of the lack of sequence homology, twelve amino acids each from the N and C termini of RNase T were omitted in the structural models shown here (Fig. 1). Some internal loop regions were modeled with predicted secondary structures as additional spatial restraints. The results of the homology modeling follow. The active sites of DEDD superfamily members share four invariant acidic residues embedded within the three Exo motifs. These residues, together with the substrate, are known to bind two divalent metal ions (18Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). In E. coli RNase T, the four acidic residues are Asp23, Glu25, Asp125, and Asp186 (Fig. 1). Also important is residue His120, which, by analogy with the structure of the Klenow fragment DNA polymerase exonuclease domain (18Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), binds to a water molecule coordinated with one of the metal ions and also hydrogen bonds to a non-bridging oxygen in the penultimate phosphate group of the substrate. Residue His120 is highly conserved in both RNT and DP3E proteins. All of these residues were shown to be important for catalysis by RNase T (8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the presumed mechanism of action of the exonuclease domain of Klenow fragment DNA polymerase, an additional residue, Tyr497, helps to align the hydroxide ion for hydrolysis (19Derbyshire V. Pinsonneault J.K. Joyce C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 363-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In E. coli RNase T, as well as all other DEDDh members, such as DP3E, DNA exonuclease I and oligoribonuclease, a conserved His (His181) is present at the adjacent position in the sequence. This residue also is required for RNase T catalysis (8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the tertiary structure modeled here, His181 sits at a position similar to that of Tyr497 in the Klenow fragment (Fig. 1) and therefore may play a role in catalysis similar to that proposed for Tyr497. Similar to other DEDD structures, the four catalytically important acidic residues in the model of RNase T sit at the bottom of a narrow pocket that allows only single-stranded terminal residues to enter. Surrounding this narrow pocket are several conserved phenylalanine residues, Phe29, Phe77, and Phe124(Fig. 1), which may be in direct contact with the substrate, and are thought to contribute to substrate recognition (21Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29654-29661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Residues Phe29 and Phe77 occupy positions corresponding to residues Leu361 and Phe473, respectively, in the Klenow fragment exonuclease domain. These residues are important for catalysis by the Klenow fragment. Similarly, in our model, it is likely that the 3′-terminal base of the substrate is sandwiched between the side chains of residues Phe29 and Phe77. It has been suggested that phenylalanine side chains strongly prefer to make van der Waals contacts with A, U, or G residues but not with C residues of an RNA molecule (20Jones S. Daley D.T. Luscombe N.M. Berman H.M. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Therefore, this Phe-base interaction may account for the known RNase T discrimination against removal of C residues (21Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29654-29661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similar to the role of Tyr423 in the Klenow fragment, the third Phe residue, highly conserved Phe124, might stack against the penultimate base of the substrate. We identified, based on sequence analysis (8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), three highly conserved sequence segments (NBS1–3) that are present in RNase T protein but absent from the closely related DNA polymerase III. The structural modeling, described here, indicates that these three NBS sequence segments cluster in the tertiary structure of RNase T (Fig.1). The NBS segments are rich in basic residues. E. coliRNase T contains 18 Arg/Lys residues, and nine of them are present in the three NBS segments. In addition, several other Arg/Lys residues are near the NBS segments in the tertiary structure. Therefore, on the surface of RNase T, the basic residues form a well defined, positively charged patch (see Fig. 1 C) that serves, we propose, as the substrate binding site (8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, this positively charged patch is quite distant from the putative catalytic center in an RNase T monomer. The next section will explain how the separated substrate-binding site and the catalytic center combine to allow RNase T to function. E. coli RNase T exists as a homodimer in vitro and in vivo, and the formation of the homodimer is essential for RNase T to function (7Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As with the tertiary structures of other known DEDD exonuclease domains, the modeled RNase T monomer has a relatively flat shape (Fig.1 A). Using the oligoribonuclease homodimer as the template, RNase T was modeled into a homodimer (Fig. 1 B). The resulting homodimer model has a number of features that make the structure attractive. Thus, it buries many highly hydrophobic residues at the interface, and the dimerization interface is located at a region similar to those of the inter-domain interfaces of other DEDD proteins, such as Klenow fragment (18Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) and E. coli exonuclease I (15Breyer W.A. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Formation of the homodimer of RNase T leads to a much more globular-shaped protein (Fig. 1 B). The buried interfacial hydrophobic residues include Phe14, Phe17, Met46, Phe149, Leu154, Leu157, Phe194, Ile197, Val198, Trp201, and probably Trp207; the latter residue had to be omitted from the models shown in Fig. 1 because the corresponding residue is lacking in the template structures. All of these residues cluster in the tertiary structure and form a hydrophobic core. The missing N-terminal and C-terminal residues would be expected to interact with the other subunit and to help bury the hydrophobic core within the dimerization interface. Upon formation of an RNase T homodimer, the positive surface patch formed by the NBS segments on one subunit is brought to the vicinity of the DEDD catalytic center present on the other subunit (Figs.1 B and 2). In fact, one residue, Arg13, from one subunit is directly adjacent to the catalytic center of the other subunit. The complementarity of the two RNase T subunits to generate a complete active site would explain the dimerization requirement for RNase T to function. Based on the RNase T homodimer modeled here, the distance from the DEDD catalytic center to the far edge of the positively charged NBS patch measures about 40 Å, which could accommodate 8–10 nucleotides of a single-stranded RNA segment, in excellent agreement with experimental observations (21Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29654-29661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additional experiments supporting the proposed model are presented below. In the proposed model, the three NBS sequence segments cluster in the RNase T tertiary structure to generate a substrate-binding domain that is, however, distant from the DEDD catalytic center in an RNase T monomer. Through dimerization, this NBS cluster is brought to the vicinity of the DEDD catalytic center of the other subunit. As was shown in the accompanying article (8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), mutation of several basic residues in the NBS domain affects RNase T binding of tRNA substrates. However, there is essentially no effect on activity against the short oligonucleotides dA4 and dA2. These data suggest that these residues, although important for substrate binding, are at least four nucleotides away from the catalytic site. However, this is not true for one NBS basic residue, Arg13. Alanine substitution of Arg13 not only completely abolished RNase T activity against tRNA (8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but also, as shown in TableI, dramatically affects activity when short oligonucleotides are used as substrates. The R13A mutation leads to a major reduction in V max, an increase inKm, and a 103–104-fold reduction in the V max/Kmvalue for each substrate. This observation provides direct evidence that Arg13 from one subunit must be very near the DEDD catalytic center of the other subunit and that it is involved in both catalysis and binding (Table I). Thus, these data suggest that the NBS patch extends from about 8–10 nucleotides away, as noted earlier, to the immediate vicinity of the DEDD catalytic center.Table IEffect of the R13A mutation on RNase T activity against short substratesRNase T MutationdA4dA2K mV maxV max/K mK mV maxV max/K mμmunits/mgμmunits/mgWild type217008502560024R13A105250.241400.250.0018Both oligonucleotide substrates were 5′-32P-labeled.

Kinetic constants were estimated using Lineweaver-Burk plots. One unit of RNase T activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 μmol of mononucleotide/h. Based on the structural model, a fully functional RNase T active site is composed of an NBS substrate-binding site and a DEDD catalytic center coming from two different subunits but brought together through dimerization (Fig. 2). According to this model, RNase T activity should be abolished by mutations at the catalytic center, at the substrate-binding site, or at the dimerization interface, and this was shown experimentally (8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A direct demonstration of the model would be the reconstitution of RNase T activity by the formation of heterodimers from subunits derived from two homodimers mutated at either the catalytic site or the substrate-binding site, as diagrammed in Fig. 2. In the accompanying article (8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we showed that the W207Stop mutant is defective in dimerization but displays temperature-sensitive activity such that at 25 °C, its activity is virtually the same against a tRNA substrate as the wild-type enzyme. This mutant protein provided an ideal platform to test this prediction because it could be used to easily generate heterodimers by first incubating at higher temperature to generate monomers, and then cooling to re-form the dimers. The protocol is described under “Expermental Procedures.” Using the pUT-W207Stop plasmid as starting material, the double-mutants D23A/W207Stop, E25A/W207Stop, and R13A/W207Stop were constructed and expressed in the exoribonuclease-deficient strain, CAN20-12ET− (Table II). The D23A/W207Stop and E25A/W207Stop constructs each contain a mutation at the DEDD catalytic center, whereas the R13A/W207Stop construct contains an additional mutation at R13. As shown in Table II, RNase T activity in extracts is very low for each of the individual double mutants. However, by incubating together equal amounts of the complementary mutant extracts, substantially increased RNase T activities were observed. The activity corresponds to ∼12% of that of the parent strain W207Stop under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 2, the maximum possible activity expected would be 25%, because only 50% of the dimers formed would be heterodimers, and each heterodimer has only one complete active site rather than two. Thus, approximately half of the maximum expected activity was obtained in this experiment. These data provide additional evidence that the substrate-binding site and the catalytic center of RNase T are located on different subunits and are brought together through dimerization to form fully functional RNase T active sites.Table IIReconstitution of RNase T activity from inactive mutantsStrainsRelative activity%W207Stop100R13A/W207Stop1.7D23A/W207Stop2.6E25A/W207Stop3.0RBA/W207Stop + D23A/W207Stop12R13A/W207Stop + E25A/W207Stop12Assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as the percentage of the control activity in the dimerization mutant W207Stop.

Values shown are the average of two independent experiments, each carried out in duplicate. As diagrammed in Fig. 2 and discussed in the text, the maximum activity expected for the heterodimers is 25%. DEDD exonucleases are involved in many aspects of nucleic acid metabolism (17Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In many instances, the DEDD domain is associated with various other functional domains, which may account for the variety of functions carried out by these enzymes. Although DEDD domains by themselves may display limited or no exonuclease activity, other domains or protein subunits can stimulate such activity. For example, removal of the polymerase domain from Klenow fragment leaves a DEDD exonuclease domain with no detectable activity (22Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In E. coli DNA polymerase III, although the DEDD exonuclease subunit (ε subunit) is independently active as an exonuclease, its activity is enhanced by association with the polymerase subunit (α subunit) and the θ subunit (23Maki H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4389-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11785-11791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, E. coli RNase T requires formation of a homodimer to function (7Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this work, we have built a structural and functional model ofE. coli RNase T based on homology modeling with crystal structures of other DEDD exonucleases as templates. According to this model, the catalytic center, consisting of the DEDD signature motifs, sits inside a narrow pocket, which is wide enough to hold only 1 to 2 single-stranded terminal nucleotides. This may account for the single-strand specificity of RNase T action (21Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29654-29661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the surface of RNase T, the highly conserved NBS segments cluster to form a nucleic acid-binding patch. In an RNase T monomer, the NBS patch and the DEDD catalytic center are on opposite sides of the protein. Through the formation of a homodimer, the NBS patch is brought close to the vicinity of the DEDD catalytic center of the other subunit to generate a complete active site. Our data indicate that most NBS basic residues are at least four nucleotides away from the catalytic center. In contrast, we propose that Arg13 sits very near the catalytic center. Thus, mutation of this residue leads to a dramatic loss of RNase T activity and a significant increase in the Km value, with tRNA as the substrate (8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and a major reduction in activity against substrates as small as the dinucleotide, dA2. These data are most consistent with the conclusion that Arg13 is very close to the DEDD catalytic center. This could only be accomplished through the formation of an RNase T homodimer, because in the monomers, these residues are on opposite faces. Upon formation of the homodimer, the NBS patch and the DEDD center would generate a continuous nucleic acid-binding site. The distance from the DEDD center to the edge of the NBS patch should be sufficient to bind a single-stranded nucleic acid segment of about 8–10 nucleotides, in excellent agreement with that suggested in a study of RNase T substrate specificity using a different approach (21Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29654-29661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The structural modeling, mutagenic analyses, and experimental observations all suggested that the two subunits of RNase T complement each other through dimerization, and this could be demonstrated directly by mixing an NBS mutant protein and a DEDD mutant protein and incubating under conditions to allow formation of heterodimer. RNase T activity was reconstituted, amounting to about half of that expected. Considering that the efficiency of monomer formation and of heterodimer formation are not known, and have not been optimized for this experiment, the level of reconstitution of activity is impressive. The functional complementarity of the RNase T subunits clearly explains the requirement of dimerization for RNase T to function. The model also explains several other observations with RNase T mutants. For example, in an earlier study (7Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a dominant-negative mutant, HA2, was isolated. HA2 contains two point mutations, R15H and G28R. Arg15 is a conserved residue in the NBS1 segment, whereas Gly28 is part of the highly conserved ExoI motif, suggesting that the HA2 mutant protein probably was defective in both substrate binding and catalysis. However, because neither mutation affects RNase T dimerization, heterodimers can form between HA2 and wild-type monomers. Because no wild-type active site could form in the heterodimer, they would be expected to be inactive; hence, this accounts for the dominant-negative phenotype. Another mutant, HA2-1, which contains the additional mutation, G206S, displays a much-reduced dominant-negative phenotype (7Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Based on the model, we now know that the C terminus of RNase T is important for its dimerization. The highly conserved Gly205 and Gly206 residues may form a tight turn in RNase T. Mutation of Gly206 to Ser would disrupt folding of the C terminus and, thus, the ability of this mutant to dimerize. Consequently, it would not act as a dominant-negative mutation. Mutations at Cys168 and residues at the C terminus lead to temperature-sensitive RNase T mutants (7Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, comparison of gel filtration analyses and activity assays showed that the C-terminal mutant, W207Stop, is more deficient in dimerization yet displays higher RNase T activity than the C168S mutant. This apparent paradox also can be explained by the RNase T structural model. According to this model, the C terminus is directly involved only in dimerization, whereas Cys168 is a buried residue on a short helix formed by residues 164–172. This short helix sits very close to the DEDD catalytic center; although it contributes to dimerization through interactions with the N and/or C termini of the complementary subunit, it probably also affects local folding near the catalytic center. The structural and functional model presented here provides a detailed framework with which to analyze the mechanism of action of RNase T and, perhaps, other members of the DEDD exonuclease family (17Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). So far, this model serves to explain the known properties of E. coliRNase T. It will be extremely interesting to compare this model with that of an x-ray structure of RNase T once the latter becomes available. Studies along these lines are now in progress."

The VII-30 mutant had all of the residues in the 99 loop replaced with those of trypsin. In the VII-39 mutant, both the 99 and 170 loops were replaced with those of trypsin. Thekcat/Km value for hydrolysis of the chromogenic peptidyl substrate S-2288 by VIIa-30 (103 mm−1s−1) was 3-fold higher than that of wild-type VIIa (30.3 mm−1 s−1) in the presence of soluble tissue factor (sTF). This enhancement was due to a decrease in the Km value but not to an increase in the kcat value. On the other hand, the kcat/Km value for S-2288 hydrolysis by VIIa-39 (17.9 mm−1 s−1) was 18-fold higher than that of wild-type (1.0 mm−1 s−1) in the absence of sTF, and the value was almost the same as that of wild-type measured in the presence of sTF. This enhancement was due to not only a decrease in the Km value but also to an increase in the kcat value. These results were in good agreement with their susceptibilities to a subsite 1-directed serine protease inhibitor. In our previous paper (Soejima, K., Mizuguchi, J., Yuguchi, M., Nakagaki, T., Higashi, S., and Iwanaga, S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 17229–17235), the replacement of the 170 loop of VIIa with that of trypsin induced a 10-fold enhancement of the kcat value for S-2288 hydrolysis as compared with that of wild-type VIIa in the absence of sTF. These results suggested that the 99 and the 170 loop structures of VIIa independently affect the Km andkcat values, respectively. Furthermore, we studied the effect of mutations on proteolytic activity towardS-alkylated lysozyme as a macromolecular substrate and the activation of natural macromolecular substrate factor X. To elucidate the functions of the surface loops of VIIa, we prepared two mutants, VII-30 and VII-39. The VII-30 mutant had all of the residues in the 99 loop replaced with those of trypsin.

Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Google Scholar). When tissue factor (TF) is expressed after injury of the vessel wall, it forms a complex with factor VIIa, and blood coagulation can be initiated. Forming a complex with TF markedly enhances the ability of VIIa to activate factors IX and X. In vitro, the formation of the active complex can be evidenced by measuring the esterolytic and amidolytic activities of VIIa (2Ruf W. Kalnik M.W. Lund-Hansen T. Edgington T.S. J. Biol.

Human zymogen VII is a single chain enzyme precursor with an NH2-terminal Gla domain, followed by two EGF-like domains, EGF 1 and EGF 2, and a COOH-terminal serine protease domain. Through limited proteolysis of the Arg152 [c15]Ile153[c16] peptide bond [chymotrypsinogen numbering in brackets], zymogen VII is converted to a two-chain form enzyme, activated VII (VIIa), bridged by a disulfide bond (Cys135–Cys262), which is composed of a light chain (residues 1–152) with Gla, EGF 1, and EGF 2 domains, and a heavy chain with a serine protease domain (residues 153–406) (6Hagen F.S.

The shape of VIIa could be described as a tulip, with the catalytic domain as the flower, the light chain as the stem, and the Gla domain as the bulb. TF winds around the light chain (the stem) and the Gla domain (the bulb) of FVII. Conversely, the catalytic domain of the coagulation proteases such as VIIa, IXa, Xa, and α-thrombin have active sites and internal cores that are similar to those of trypsin. Although these protease domains have a highly homologous three-dimensional structure, they display significant differences in specificity and catalytic activity. Furthermore, each protease requires a specific cofactor to express enhanced catalytic activity and physiological function, which differs from digestive serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. The serine protease domain consists of 12 β-strands and the loops between them. The β-strands form a scaffold of the catalytic domain, and their α-carbon traces are comparable despite differences in amino acid residues. The individual proteases may be characterized by the surface loops of varying lengths and compositions (13Bode W. Brandstetter H. Mather T. Stubbs M.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 501-511Google Scholar, 14Perona J.J. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29987-29990Google Scholar). For instance, in the case of α-thrombin, the 60 loop (loops numbered according to the chymotrypsinogen numbering system) plays an important role in substrate specificity (15Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Google Scholar). In the cases of activated protein C, IXa, and Xa, subsite 2 is present in the 99 loop and regulates their substrate specificities (16Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C.

Comparisons of the three-dimensional structures of the active site regions of α-thrombin, VIIa, IXa, Xa, and trypsin referred to the substrate specificities of these proteases (13Bode W.

Recently, Hopfner et al. (22Hopfner K.P. Brandstetter H. Karcher A. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Engh R.A. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6626-6635Google Scholar) reported that replacement of some residues in the 99 loop of IXa conferred enhanced catalytic activity toward synthetic peptidyl substrates. Furthermore, the 170 loop of IXa has some interaction with cofactor factor VIII (24Bajaj S.P. Schmidt A.E. Mathur A. Padmanabhan K. Zhong D. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

In β-tryptase, the 60 loop, 99 loop, and 170 loop have a major interface to form a tetramer, and this tetramerization is important for expressing activity (26Pereira P.J. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Google Scholar). In this study, to investigate the function of the 99 loop of VIIa, which contains a subsite 2 and is located close to Asp[c102], a member of a catalytic triad, we prepared two mutants and examined their enzymatic properties. One of the mutants had all of the residues in the 99 loop replaced with those of trypsin, and the other had both the 99 and 170 loops replaced with those of trypsin. Kinetic studies of these mutants in comparison with wild-type VIIa suggested that both the 99 and 170 loop structures of VIIa independently affect not only theKm and kcat values for peptidyl substrates, but also the substrate specificity of this enzyme, respectively.

All custom oligo-DNA primers were provided by Nippon Flour Mills Co., Ltd., Tokyo. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or of the highest quality commercially available. Recombinant human sTF was prepared as described (27Shigematsu Y. Miyata T. Higashi S. Miki T. Sadler J.E. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 87-90Google Scholar). The construction of VII mutants by PCR-based methods was performed as described previously (32Soejima K. Mizuguchi J. Yuguchi M. Nakagaki T. Higashi S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17229-17235Google Scholar). Sequences of primers for mutagenic PCR were as follows: 5′-AGCACGTACGACAGGAAGACTCTGAACCACGACATCGCGCTGCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′- GAGCAGCGCGATGTCGTGGTTCAGAGTCTTCCTGTCGTACGTGCT-3′ (antisense) for VII-30. In addition, a double mutant in the 99 and 170 loops, named VII-39, was constructed by the above methods using VII-31 cDNA as a PCR template (32Soejima K. Mizuguchi J. Yuguchi M. Nakagaki T. Higashi S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17229-17235Google Scholar). The vectors were confirmed to contain the entire sequences of the mutant DNA fragments by sequencing on an automated DNA sequencer. Expression and cell culture of VII mutants were performed as reported previously (32Soejima K. Mizuguchi J. Yuguchi M. Nakagaki T. Higashi S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

The mutant expression vectors were stably transfected into the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, CHO-K1, and highly expressing clones were selected by ELISA. Each clone was cultured and expanded in 150-mm dishes and roller bottles. The time course of changes in the expression level and activation of each mutant in the conditioned medium were analyzed by ELISA and Western blotting, respectively. Every day 1 ml of conditioned medium of each mutant was sampled, mixed with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 50 mm benzamidine HCl, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at −80 °C until used. The concentration of VII antigen for each supernatant was determined using an ELISA kit (Asserachrom VII:Ag). The activation and degradation of each mutant were analyzed as follows. Each frozen supernatant was thawed, and 500 μl of each aliquot was mixed with 50 μl of anti-factor VII monoclonal antibody gel and rotated for 1 h at room temperature with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm benzamidine-HCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. After the VII mutant was loaded, the gel was washed with 1 ml of equilibration buffer at least 3 times. The VII mutant was eluted with 100 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mmbenzamidine-HCl, and 10 mm EDTA. Aliquots of 20 μl of each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses. Anti-human FVII polyclonal antibody (Diagnostica Stago) was used as the primary antibody, and anti-rabbit IgG labeled with alkaline phosphatase (Dako) was used as the secondary antibody, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium was used as the substrate for development. Expression, cell culture, and purification of the VII mutants were performed as reported previously (32Soejima K. Mizuguchi J. Yuguchi M. Nakagaki T. Higashi S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17229-17235Google Scholar), with some modifications. Each clone was cultured and expanded in 10–20 roller bottles. Forty eight hours before harvesting, the culture media were replaced with ASF-104 media supplemented with 1 mm butyric acid, 20 μg/ml vitamin K, with or without 5% fetal bovine serum. The monoclonal antibody used for purification of the VII mutant did not react with fetal bovine serum potentially including bovine VIIa as a contaminant (data not shown). After harvesting, the conditioned media were mixed with 50 mmbenzamidine HCl, with or without 0.1% BSA, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (1.5–6 liters) were stored at −80 °C. The frozen media were thawed and filtrated through a 0.45-μm membrane filter and concentrated to 400–500 ml by ultrafiltration with a hollow fiber system (Asahi Kasei, Tokyo). The concentrated media were mixed with 2 mm CaCl2, and the pH was adjusted to 6 by adding 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 6, and the resulting media were subjected to Ca2+-dependent anti-factor VII monoclonal antibody-conjugated column chromatography at 4 °C. The column had been equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 6, containing 0.1m NaCl, 50 mm benzamidine HCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. After the medium was loaded, the column was washed with equilibration buffer and washed again with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm benzamidine HCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. Mutant factor VII was eluted with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm benzamidine HCl, 0.1% PEG 8000, and with a 0–10 mm EDTA gradient, and eluted peak fractions were pooled. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6, containing 0.1 mNaCl, 0.1% PEG 8000, 2 mm CaCl2 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method and by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (A280 = 13.9 for 1% VII). Purified VII derived from human plasma was used as a standard to estimate the protein concentration. After confirming that the contents of γ-carboxyglutamate in each of the VII mutants were the same as those of plasma-derived VII, using the alkaline hydrolysis method (33Fernlund P. Stenflo J. Roepstorff P. Thomsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6125-6133Google Scholar), we then used these VII mutants for all experiments. Activations of the zymogen VII mutants were achieved at 37 °C for 1–16 h by adding a 1:25–1:100 molar ratio of plasma-derived Xa in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 8000, and 10 mm CaCl2 with or without phospholipid vesicles. Phospholipid vesicles (phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine = 4:1) were prepared as described (34Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9418-9425Google Scholar). This reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 mm benzamidine HCl. Each VIIa mutant was loaded to an anti-factor X column to remove Xa, subjected to Ca2+-dependent anti-VII monoclonal antibody column chromatography at 4 °C, and eluted with 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, and 0.1% PEG 8000. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 8000, and 2 mm CaCl2. Zymogen VII-39 was autoactivated at 37 °C by 15–60 min of incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 8000, and 10 mm CaCl2. This autoactivation was terminated by the addition of 50 mm benzamidine HCl. Activated VIIa-39 was dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG 8000, and stored at −80 °C. All assays, including amidolysis of synthetic chromogenic substrates, TF dependence of VIIa mutants on amidolysis of S-2288, measurement of kinetic parameters for mutant VIIa-catalyzed amidolysis of S-2288, APMSF incorporation into VIIa mutants, and carbamylation of the α-amino group in VIIa mutants, were performed as reported previously (32Soejima K. Mizuguchi J. Yuguchi M. Nakagaki T. Higashi S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17229-17235Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all kinetic experiments were carried out under the following conditions: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG 8000; 200 μl of sample in 96-well microplates (F96 Polysorp NuncTM-Immuno Plate; NalgeNunc International Denmark); measurement at 30 °C with a SPECTRAmax plus® temperature-controlled microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Kinetics were measured based on initial rates. All experiments were performed in at least two independent trials. All experiments were performed in the BIAcore 1000 (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) instrument using sensor chip CM5 (Biacore), according to the method of Sørensenet al. (35Sørensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgård P. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11863-11868Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, 650 resonance units (RU) of sTF were immobilized on the sensor chip by means of an amine coupling method. Binding analyses were performed on the same chip repeatedly (regenerated with 50 mm EDTA between runs) at various protein concentrations (in the cases of VIIa-W and VIIa-30, ranging from 5 to 80 nm; in the cases of VIIa-31 and VIIa-39, ranging from 50 to 800 nm) in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 0.02% Tween 80 at 25 °C. The flow rate was 5 μl/min, and the association and dissociation phases were 7 and 15 min, respectively. Data were fitted by non-linear regression using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model and/or heterogeneous analyte-competition reactions model in BIAevaluation version 3.0. Proteolysis of TAP-lysozyme (500 μg/ml, 31.7 μm) was carried out at 37 °C for 0.5–6 h by adding a 1:25 molar ratio of VIIa mutant (1.27 μm) with or without sTF (6.35 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG 8000. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were withdrawn at various time intervals and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The activation of factor X was carried out in the absence or presence of sTF. In the absence of sTF, 90 μl of a 400 nm concentration of each of the VIIa mutants was incubated with 10 μl of various concentrations of factor X ranging from 6 to 100 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% PEG 8000, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm NaCl, at 30 °C, for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding a final concentration of 20 mm EDTA. In the presence of sTF, 45 μl of an 8 nm concentration of each of the VIIa mutants and 45 μl of a 400 nm sTF were mixed and preincubated at 30 °C, for 10 min, adding 10 μl of various concentrations of factor X ranging from 0.5 to 25 μm. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 or 10 min, and the reaction was terminated by adding a final concentration of 20 mm EDTA. To determine the amount of activated factor X (Xa), aliquots of 10 or 50 μl of each of the reaction mixtures described above were sampled and diluted. Kinetic analyses were performed using a final concentration of 1 mmof S-2765, and the amount of Xa was then calculated by reference to a standard curve constructed using known amounts of Xa. The locations and amino acid sequences of the 99 and 170 loops in the protease domain of VIIa are shown in Fig. 1. Construction of VII mutants is also shown in Fig. 2. In mutant VII-30, all of the residues in the 99 loop were replaced with those of trypsin. In VII-39, both the 99 and 170 loops were replaced with those of trypsin. The cDNAs of these mutants and wild-type VII were stably transfected into CHO-K1 cells. The CHO-K1 cells expressing VII-31 and wild-type VII were obtained in our previous study (32Soejima K. Mizuguchi J. Yuguchi M. Nakagaki T. Higashi S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17229-17235Google Scholar). The time courses of the activation of each mutant in cell culture were estimated by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Wild-type VII was expressed at a level of 6 μg/ml, and it showed no activation. VII-30, the 99 loop-replaced mutant, was expressed at a level of 1.5 μg/ml and showed activation from the 3rd to the 4th day, as revealed by the appearance of heavy and light chains, but the intact molecule still remained on day 6. VII-31, the 170 loop-replaced mutant, was expressed to 1 μg/ml and showed activation from the 2nd day, and the intact molecule was almost completely activated on day 6. VII-39, the mutant with replacement of both 99 and 170 loops, was expressed at less than 1 μg/ml and showed activation from the 2nd day. No intact molecule was seen on the 5th day, and degradation products were clearly detected on the 4th day. On SDS-PAGE, the bands of the heavy chains of VIIa-31 and VIIa-39 showed further mobility than those of VIIa-30 and wild-type VIIa (Figs. 3 and 4). This was probably because both wild-type and VII-30 have a carbohydrate attachment site, but this site is lost in VII-31 and VII-39 (Fig. 2). Carbohydrate chains, which exist on the heavy chains of both wild-type and VIIa-30, but not the heavy chains of VIIa-31 or VIIa-39, were detected by lectin blotting analysis (data not shown).Figure 2Construction of VII mutants.Sequences of the wild-type and VII mutants are indicated. VII-30 had all the residues in the 99 loop replaced with the counterpart of trypsin. VII-31 had all the residues in the 170 loop replaced with the counterpart of trypsin (32Soejima K. Mizuguchi J. Yuguchi M. Nakagaki T. Higashi S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17229-17235Google Scholar). VII-39 had both the 99 and 170 loops replaced with the counterparts of trypsin. The components of the catalytic triad are indicated byasterisks. Tissue factor contact sites in the heavy chain of VIIa are indicated as closed triangles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Time course of the activation of VII mutants in cell culture.

The time courses of the autoactivation of both purified VII-30 (left panel) and VII-39 (right panel) are indicated. All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining under reduced conditions. Incubation times of activation are indicated above the lanes. Activation of VII-30 under various conditions (A–C) is as follows: A, pH 8, and 2 mm CaCl2, at 37 °C; B, pH 8, and 2 mm CaCl2, at 37 °C with Xa (1:100 molar ratio); C, pH 8, and 2 mm CaCl2, at 37 °C with Xa (1:100 molar ratio) and phospholipids (10 μm). Autoactivation of VII-39 under various conditions (D–F): D, pH 8, and 2 mmCaCl2, at 37 °C; E, pH 8, and 10 mm EDTA, at 37 °C; F, pH 6, and 2 mm CaCl2, at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of the purified VII mutants was performed under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 4, the autoactivation of VII-30 was slow. After 17 h of incubation, the zymogen VII-30 could still be observed. The activation of VII-30 by Xa was completed within 6 h, and the addition of phospholipids strongly enhanced this activation, which was completed within 15 min. On the other hand, the autoactivation of VII-39 was completed in about 60 min. This autoactivation was affected by calcium ions and pH. In cases where calcium ions were chelated by EDTA or media pH was 6, autoactivation of VII-39 did not occur within 60 min. The amidolytic activities of wild-type, VIIa-30, VIIa-31, and VIIa-39 toward S-2288, in addition to the effects of TF on these activities, were examined in the absence and presence of various concentrations of sTF. As shown in panels A and B of Fig. 5, sTF potentiated the amidolytic activities of all the mutants and wild-type VIIa in a dose-dependent manner. The data were subjected to the Hanes-Woolf plot ([sTF]/v versus [sTF] plot; according to Ref. 36Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Google Scholar) analysis to determine the apparent dissociation constants (Kd (app)) for each mutant and wild-type VIIa complex with sTF (Fig. 5C). In VIIa-30 (Kd (app) = 14 nm), the affinity for sTF was similar to that of wild-type (Kd (app) = 20 nm); however, the affinities of VIIa-31 and VIIa-39 were reduced by about one order of magnitude (Kd (app) = 90 and 360 nm), respectively. The representative sensorgrams of each of the VIIa mutants are shown in Fig. 6. The data of VIIa-W and VIIa-30 could be comparatively well fitted by non-linear regression using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model in BIAevaluation version 3.0. VIIa-30 associated about 2.4-fold slower with sTF (2.4 × 105m−1s−1) than that o"
https://openalex.org/W2139728445,"We identified an alternative mRNA encoding a novel cadherin-7 isoform by reverse transcriptase-PCR of RNA from day 12 chicken embryos. The alternative mRNA contains 49 bases of insertion in the premembrane region, leading to the substitution of 14 amino acids and the introduction of a premature stop codon. Identification of a 49-bp insertion sequence in the genomic DNA corresponding to the intron of the cadherin-7 gene suggests that alternative splicing is the cause of the alternative mRNA. Transient expression of the variant form in COS-7 or 293 cells produced a soluble protein. Aggregation assays and immunoprecipitation showed that the variant protein interacts with full-length cadherin-7in vitro and in vivo and inhibits full-length cadherin-7-mediated cell adhesion. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the variant form was strongly expressed in dermomyotomes rather than in migrating neural crest cells, in contrast to the full-length cadherin-7, suggesting differential regulation of splicing and possible roles of variant cadherin-7 in the development of dermomyotomes and other tissues.

Cell adhesion molecules are usually transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate binding interactions at the extracellular surface and determine the specificity of cell-cell recognition. The cadherin, integrin, immunoglobulin, and selectin families are major cell adhesion molecules (1Hynes R.O. Lander D.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 303-322Google Scholar). The molecules of the cadherin family mediate calcium-dependent cell-to-cell adhesion, and they play roles in cell recognition and cell sorting during development (2Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Google Scholar, 3Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Google Scholar). They can be divided into six major subfamilies: 1) classic (type I) cadherins, 2) atypical (type II) cadherins, 3) desmocollins, 4) desmogleins, 5) protocadherins, and 6) Flamingo cadherins, and several cadherins clearly occupy isolated positions in the cadherin superfamily (4Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Google Scholar). The type I (classic) and type II (atypical) cadherins have a characteristic structure, with NH2-terminal domain, four CRs1 (CR1–CR4), 1The abbreviations used are: CR, cadherin repeat; Ab, antibody; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PB-cadherin, pituitary gland and brain-cadherin; P-cadherin, placental-cadherin; T-cadherin, truncated-cadherin; E-cadherin, epithelial-cadherin; E, embryonic day; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HCMF, hepes-buffered calcium and magnesium-free Hank's solution a pretransmembrane domain (CR5), a transmembrane domain, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain (2Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Google Scholar, 5Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Google Scholar), except for T-cadherin (6Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Google Scholar,7Doyle D.D. Goings G.E. Upshaw-Earley J. Page E. Ranscht B. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6937-6943Google Scholar). CR1 provides the binding specificity of cadherins (8Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Google Scholar, 9Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Google Scholar). The type I cadherins have an HAV motif in the CR1 domain, and this motif is important for calcium-dependent adhesion (10Blaschuk O.W. Pouliot Y. Holland C.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 679-682Google Scholar). The type II cadherins, on the other hand, have no HAV site. This difference may be responsible for the weaker intercellular adhesion shown by type II compared with type I cadherin (11Tanihara H. Kido K. Obata S. Heimark L.R. Davidson M. St. John T. Suzuki S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1697-1704Google Scholar). The highly conserved cytoplasmic domain, which associates with α- and β-catenin, plakoglobin, and p120, is responsible for the stabilization of cell-to-cell adhesion (12Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 37-44Google Scholar, 13Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Google Scholar, 14McCrea P.D. Turck C. Gumbiner M.B.

Cadherin-7, a type II cadherin, is expressed in some populations of migrating neural crest cells, proximal dorsal and ventral roots, and dorsal root ganglia in chicken embryos. It is also expressed in non-neural crest cells, such as motor neurons, and cells in the floor plate and in myotomes (5Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Google Scholar). Overexpression of cadherin-7 blocks neural crest segregation from neuroepithelial cells (17Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1998; 125: 2963-2971Google Scholar). The regulated expression of cadherins, including cadherin-7, in the neuroepithelium is essential to maintain its integrity and to send out neural crest cells in the correct direction (17Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1998; 125: 2963-2971Google Scholar). Cadherin-7 shows a partial affinity to cadherin-6B, but the heterophilic interaction is less stable than the homophilic (5Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Google Scholar). Cadherin-7 is involved in intercellular signaling between homotypic cells and in the sorting of heterotypic cells, but the precise function of cadherin-7 has not yet been determined (17Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1998; 125: 2963-2971Google Scholar, 18Redies C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 611-648Google Scholar). Splicing variants of type II cadherin have been reported for cadherin-11 (19Kawaguchi J. Takeshita S. Kashima T. Imai T. Machinami R. Kudo A. J. Bone Mineral Res. 1999; 14: 764-775Google Scholar) and PB-cadherin (20Sugimoto K. Honda S. Yamamoto T. Ueki T. Monden M. Kaji A. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 271: 11548-11556Google Scholar). These variant forms are truncated transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic domain that differs from full-length forms. In this report, we identified a soluble splicing variant form of chicken cadherin-7. Competitive PCR analysis and immunostaining showed differential expression patterns between the variant form and full-length cadherin-7. The variant protein interacted with and inhibited cell-to-cell adhesion mediated by full-length cadherin-7 in vitro and in vivo. Fertilized eggs of White Leghorn chickens were purchased from commercial sources. They were incubated at 38 °C, and staging of the embryos was performed according to Hamburger and Hamilton (21Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morph. 1951; 88: 49-92Google Scholar). Rabbits were purchased from commercial sources for the production of polyclonal antibodies (Abs). Total RNA was prepared from embryonic day (E) 12 chicken brains using Isogen (Nippon Gene Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR primers were designed based on the chicken full-length cadherin-7 cDNA sequence (GenBankTMaccession number D42150) as follows: U1847 (see Fig. 1, Band C), 5′-TGGCTATGGAGAGTCAGAATCC-3′; L2158 (see Fig. 1,B and C), 5′-CAGATTGTTCCTGTCTTCGG-3′. The cDNA was amplified with these primers by PCR. The PCR products were separated using 4.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplified fragment (360 bp) was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and sequenced on an ABI 310 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Applied Biosystems). Chick genomic DNA was extracted from whole E6 embryos according to the standard protocol (22Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Modified nested PCR of the genomic DNA was performed as follows. The chicken genomic DNA was first amplified using primers U1593 (see Fig. 3 A), 5′-AGAAGATGTTGATGAGCCACC-3′, and L2158, and the PCR product was further amplified with primers U1861 (see Fig. 2), 5′-CAGAATCCAGCACAGATTGG-3′, and L2158, using ExTaq polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). The PCR cycle conditions were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 10 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product of about 6 kbp was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector and sequenced.Figure 2Partial structure and nucleotide sequence of the chicken cadherin-7 gene. A, schematic representation of the cadherin-7 genomic organization leading to two alternative splicings: the variant form and full-length cadherin-7.

The variant form cDNA was amplified by PCR using two primers, U1593 and L2158. The amplified 634-bp fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector. The DNA was cut withNcoI (Takara) and re-ligated to delete a 249-bpNcoI fragment (Fig. 3 A). The copy number of competitor molecules was determined, and then 10-fold serially diluted competitor DNAs were added to PCR reactions. Total RNAs were prepared from each stage of the chicken embryos using Isogen, and first-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNAs in 20 μl of reaction mixture using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. The combinations of PCR primers are shown in Fig. 3 A. The nucleotide sequence of the primer L variant was 5′-TTGACCGCTTCTGAGAGGTAGG-3′, and the sequences of the other primers are described above. Competitive PCR was performed in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.2 mm each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm of each primer, 1 μl of each 10-fold serially diluted competitor, and 1 unit of rTaq polymerase (Takara) withTaq start antibody (Clontech). The PCR cycle conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and observed under UV illumination. To obtain a cDNA clone coding for full-length cadherin-7, a cDNA phage library from E9 chicken brain in the vector lambda ZapII (Stratagene) was screened with a radiolabeled probe for the cadherin-7 fragment (350 bp). The phage clone containing the cDNA for full-length cadherin-7 was subcloned into the plasmid vector, Bluescript II SK+ (pBS-cad7) (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan). After digestion with EcoRI, a 3-kb fragment containing the complete coding sequence was recloned into a eukaryotic expression vector, pCAGGS (23Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-209Google Scholar), to obtain pCA-cad7. L cells were transfected with pCA-cad7 using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Transfectants were screened by immunoblotting and immunostaining using CCD7–1, and a stable cell line expressing cadherin-7 (l-cad7) was thus obtained. The expression vector for cadherin-7 variant was constructed as follows. cDNA from E12 chicken brain was amplified with two primers, U427 (see Fig. 1 C) designed in the 5′-untranslated region, 5′-AGAGACAACTGGAATTGTGCC-3′, and L2158 (see Fig. 1, B and C). Amplified fragments contained both the full-length and variant cDNAs and were cloned in pGEM-T Easy Vector. A single-clone plasmid containing variant cDNA was selected by PCR using two primers, U1847 (see Fig. 1, B andC) and L variant (see Fig. 3 A), and verified by sequencing. The selected plasmid, pPCR-v, was amplified with two primers, U427, and Lxba I, 5′-GCTCTAGAATACAGGTTGACCGCTTC-3′. The primer of Lxba I was designed to remove the stop codon and introduce an XbaI site at the 3′-terminal end. The amplified U427-Lxba I fragment was cloned in pGEM-T Easy Vector and recloned into pEF-1/Myc-His A (Invitrogen) to generate the expression construct pEF-v. COS-7 or 293 cells were transfected with pEF-v (COS variant cells or 293 variant cells), and 293 cells were transfected with pEF-1/Myc-His A (293 mock cells) as control by LipofectAMINE Plus reagent. Following incubation with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) for 2 days, culture media were concentrated using Centricon YM30 tubes (Amicon) and replaced with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Media were finally concentrated up to about 30-fold. We confirmed that the expression level of variant protein was almost equal with the COS variant and 293 variant cells (data not shown). Monolayer cultures of l-cad7 were treated with 0.01% Trypsin (Sigma) and 10 mmCaCl2 in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free saline buffered with 10 mm HEPES (HCMF, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C. The treated cells were washed three times in HCMF with 1 mm EDTA and dissociated into single cells (24Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 464-474Google Scholar). The dispersed cells were suspended in HCMF with 1 mmCaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. 24-well plates (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) were coated with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature and washed twice with HCMF. The cell suspension (0.5 ml) was dispensed into each well with 30-fold-concentrated culture medium from COS variant cells or COS-7 cells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C on a gyratory shaker rotating at 40 rpm. Antibodies specific to the variant form of cadherin-7, anti-variant Ab, were generated in rabbits by immunizing with the COOH-terminal peptide of the variant form, NH2-GDVSPYLSEAVNLY-COOH (Fig. 1 B), conjugated with Keyhole Limpet hemocyanin as described before (25Liu F.T. Zinnecker M. Hamaoka T. Katz D.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 690-697Google Scholar). The antiserum was affinity-purified with an epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B column (Amersham Biosciences) that was modified with the variant peptide. The other antibodies used in the experiment were as follows: mouse IgG monoclonal antibody against cadherin-7; CCD7–1 (a generous gift from Drs. S. Nakagawa and M. Takeichi of Kyoto University); HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Wako, Osaka, Japan); biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Wako); HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Wako); and Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (Caltag). The concentrated culture media ofl-cad7, 293 variant and 293 mock cells were mixed with 2× sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mmEDTA, 2% SDS, 20% sucrose, 1.2% mercaptoethanol, 0.01% BPB). These cells were lysed with 1× sample buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10% sucrose, 0.6% mercaptoethanol, 0.005% BPB). The samples were boiled for 5 min and run in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were incubated with appropriate antibodies, and the signals were detected using the ECL or ECL Plus systems (Amersham Biosciences). The l-cad7 cells were dissociated into single cells as described in the methodology for the aggregation assay and re-aggregated in culture medium of COS variant cells in the presence of CaCl2 for 15 min. The re-aggregated cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmCaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1% trypsin inhibitor) with 1% Triton X-100. E5 chicken embryos were homogenized in lysis buffer without Triton X-100. The tissue lysate was centrifuged at 70 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (whole homogenate) was centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and fractionated into the supernatant (soluble fraction) and precipitate. The precipitate was suspended in lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (membranous fraction) was then collected. For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysate and whole homogenate with 1% Triton X-100 was incubated with a 1/10 volume of purified anti-variant Ab at 4 °C for 5 h, then protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100 and dissolved in sample buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min. Cultured cells were fixed and permeabilized in 100% methanol with 3% H2O2 for 1 h at room temperature. They were incubated with CCD7–1 antibody or anti-variant Ab, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated second antibody. For the detection of HRP, Tyramid reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used. For double-label immunostaining, they were incubated with CCD7–1 antibody, followed by biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and Streptavidin-Texas Red, and then with anti-variant Ab, followed by anti-rabbit IgG-HRP and Tyramid reagent. E5 chicken embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 2 h and washed in PBS at 4 °C overnight. They were permeabilized in a graded series of methanol in PBS (25, 50, 75, and 100% at 4 °C for 30 min each), placed in 6% H2O2 in methanol at room temperature for 2 h, and re-hydrated in PBS. Nonspecific binding of antibodies was blocked by immersion in 10% skim milk with 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBSMT) at room temperature for 2 h. Embryos were incubated with CCD7–1 antibody or anti-variant antibody at 4 °C overnight. The embryos were washed in 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 6 h at 4 °C, immersed in PBSMT for blocking of nonspecific binding of antibody, and then incubated with an appropriate HRP-conjugated second antibody at 4 °C overnight. The embryos were washed in PBST for 6 h at 4 °C. For the detection of HRP activity, they were immersed in PBS containing 166 μg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidine at room temperature for 30 min, and H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 0.003%. Embryos were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, followed by 100% chloroform, 50% paraffin in chloroform, and then embedded in paraffin. Serial 10-μm sections were cut on a microtome, de-waxed, and mounted on glass slides using Permount (Fisher). Two DNA fragments were detected by PCR reaction on cDNA from E12 chicken brain using primers that amplified the cDNA encoding for partial CR4 and the pretransmembrane domain of cadherin-7 (Fig.1 A). Nucleotide sequence data showed that the longer fragment had the partial cDNA sequence of full-length cadherin-7 and an insert sequence of 49 bp, which caused frameshift and a stop codon within the insert, and the shorter fragment corresponded to the partial cDNA sequence of full-length cadherin-7 (Fig. 1 B). Because the stop codon existed before the transmembrane domain, the variant transcript coded for the soluble form of cadherin-7, possessing only the extracellular domains of full-length cadherins (Fig. 1 C). To examine the origin of the 49-bp insert and exon-intron junction in the chicken genome, a genomic DNA fragment of ∼6 kbp, coding for the CR4 and pretransmembrane region, was cloned by PCR. The DNA clone was sequenced, and four exons were detected (Fig.2 B). Consensus GT and AG sequences, including the adjacent polypyrimidine tract were found in the 49-bp insertion (26Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Google Scholar). All data suggested that the variant form of cadherin-7 had been generated by alternative splicing (Fig.2 A). We carried out competitive PCR to compare the transcription levels of the variant form and full-length cadherin-7 at different developmental stages (Fig. 3). The expression level of the variant form was very low in whole embryos at stage 10, compared with that of the full-length cadherin-7. Because neural crest migration, somitogenesis, and myogenesis in the rostral region precede those in the caudal region, we examined the expression level of the variant form and full-length cadherin-7 in rostral and caudal halves of chick embryos at stage 17 separately. A significant expression of variant mRNA was detected in the rostral half of the trunk, although expression in the caudal half was still low. The amounts of variant transcripts in the rostral half were in the range from one-tenth to one-fifth of that of full-length cadherin-7. After this stage, the expression level of variant form in the trunk at wing level was almost constant until E9, maintaining the same ratio to that of full-length cadherin-7 (Fig. 3 C). To obtain information on the variant protein, we generated anti-variant Abs that specifically recognized the variant form of cadherin-7 by immunizing rabbits with the short COOH-terminal peptide. We introduced the cDNA of the variant form into COS-7 or 293 cells (COS or 293 variants) transiently and the cDNA of full-length cadherin-7 into L cells (l-cad7) stably. The expressions of full-length cadherin-7 and the variant form were confirmed by immunostaining with CCD7–1 and anti-variant Ab (Fig.4 A). It is noteworthy that full-length cadherin-7 signal was detected at the cell boundary, indicating that it was functioning in cell-to-cell interaction, whereas the signal for the variant form was found inside the cell body. Immunoblotting, using CCD7–1 and the anti-variant Ab, detected the 73-kDa band of the variant form with an Myc-His tag in the concentrated culture medium of 293 variant cells (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 7). In the cell lysate of 293 variant, CCD7–1 detected this band weakly (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), but anti-variant Ab did not detect it (Fig. 4 B, lane 8), because the sensitivity of anti-variant Ab was lower than that of CCD7–1. It was thought that the lower bands of lanes 1and 2 (Fig. 4 B) were degradation products. CCD7–1 detected the 105-kDa band of full-length cadherin-7 in the lysate of l-cad7 cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 6), but anti-variant Ab detected no band (Fig. 4 B,lane 12). Full-length cadherin-7 expressed by l-cad7 was highly degradable during lysis procedures as previously reported (17Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1998; 125: 2963-2971Google Scholar). The lower band of lane 6 (Fig.4 B) reflects these degradation products. Because full-length cadherin-7 was a membranous protein, CCD7–1 did not detect it in the concentrated culture medium of l-cad7 (Fig. 4 B,lane 5). Anti-variant Ab detected no band in the concentrated culture medium of l-cad7 (Fig. 4 B,lane 11). CCD7–1 and anti-variant Ab detected no band in the lysate and concentrated medium of 293 mock cells. We introduced a cell aggregation assay mediated by full-length cadherin-7 using l-cad7 cells to examine a possible function for the variant protein (5Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Google Scholar). The aggregation of l-cad7 cells was significantly slower in the presence of the conditioned medium from COS variant cells than in that of COS-7 cells within 30 min. Even after 120 min, the difference was still apparent. These aggregations were calcium-dependent (Fig. 5, A and B). These data suggest that the variant form inhibits cell aggregation mediated by full-length cadherin-7. We performed immunoprecipitation to confirm interaction of the variant protein with full-length cadherin-7. We collected and lysed the cells after 15-min aggregation, and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-variant Ab. The full-length cadherin-7 co-immunoprecipitated with the variant protein as shown in Fig. 5 C. These results indicate that the variant protein interacts with full-length cadherin-7. To localize the variant protein in chicken embryo, we fractionated the homogenate of whole E5 chicken embryos (Fig.6 A, lane 1) into soluble (Fig. 6 A, lane 2) and membranous fractions (Fig. 6 A, lane 3). CCD7–1 detected three bands in the whole homogenate. The 73-kDa band seemed to be the variant form, because anti-variant Ab detected the 73-kDa band that co-migrates with the variant cadherin-7 expressed in COS variant cells (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4 and 5). The 105- and 80-kDa bands seemed to correspond to the full-length cadherin-7 and its degradation product, respectively (see Fig. 5 C, lane 1). The majority of the variant form was found in the soluble fraction, but some was in the membranous fraction. Because the variant protein was soluble and was still found after resuspension and recentrifugation of the membranous fraction, we believe that the variant form in the membranous fraction interacts with full-length cadherin-7. The full-length and degraded forms of cadherin-7 were found only in the membranous fraction. To examine the interaction of the variant protein with full-length cadherin-7 in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation from the whole homogenate solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 using anti-variant Ab. Full-length cadherin-7 was co-immunoprecipitated with the variant protein (Fig. 6 A, lanes 6 and7). These results indicate that some of the variant protein interacts with the full-length cadherin-7. The degradation form of 80 kDa appears to have no interaction with the variant form, because it was not co-immunoprecipitated. The 100-kDa band that was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-variant Ab seemed to be another degradation product of full-length cadherin-7, because this band was often observed for l-cad7 cells (Fig. 6 A,lane 6). We examined the expression pattern of the variant form in E5 chicken embryo tissues, by comparing it with the staining generated by the CCD7–1 antibody that detects both full-length and variant cadherin-7. The variant form was expressed transiently and strongly in dermomyotomes, then at the dorsal and ventral lips and in the myotome. Faint signals of the variant form were detected in proximal dorsal and ventral roots and in dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 6 B,1 and 3). In contrast, the stronger signals of full-length cadherin-7 were detected in dorsal root ganglia and in proximal dorsal and ventral roots, and fainter signals were detected in dermomyotomes (Fig. 6 B, 2 and 4). The full-length cadherin-7 was strongly expressed in migrating neural crest cells, but signals of the variant form were faint in these cells (data not shown). In the present study, we first report an identification of the soluble isoform for cadherin-7. Differential expression of the isoform and inhibitory effect on the cell adhesion mediated by full-length cadherin-7 suggest new type of regulatory mechanism of cell adhesion and cell signaling. We identified the variant form of cadherin-7 in chicken embryos. Molecular cloning of the genomic fragment revealed that the variant mRNA originated by alternative splicing. Such a splicing variant of type II cadherin has been reported for cadherin-11 (19Kawaguchi J. Takeshita S. Kashima T. Imai T. Machinami R. Kudo A. J. Bone Mineral Res. 1999; 14: 764-775Google Scholar) and PB-cadherin (20Sugimoto K. Honda S. Yamamoto T. Ueki T. Monden M. Kaji A. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 271: 11548-11556Google Scholar). These variant proteins are truncated forms with an intact transmembrane and a different cytoplasmic domain. The variant protein of cadherin-7 consists of an NH2-terminal domain, four CRs (CR1–CR4), a shorter pretransmembrane domain, and a distinct COOH-terminal polypeptide of 14 amino acids but lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The variant protein might not be a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, because it does not have the hydrophobic COOH-terminal domain essential for glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-modification (27Ferguson M.J.A. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 57: 285-320Google Scholar), in contrast to T-cadherin (6Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Google Scholar,7Doyle D.D. Goings G.E. Upshaw-Earley J. Page E. Ranscht B. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6937-6943Google Scholar). To investigate whether the variant protein is soluble, we transfected the cDNA of the variant form of cadherin-7 into COS-7 and 293 cells and detected the variant protein in the conditioning medium as a soluble molecule. Furthermore, we fractionated the homogenates of E5 embryos into soluble and membranous fractions. The majority of the variant form was detected in the soluble fraction, and the small amount was found in the membranous fraction. We believe that the variant form of the membranous fraction interacts with full-length cadherin-7. Some soluble forms of the type I and II cadherins that were generated by proteolysis have been reported previously (28Wheelock M.J. Buck A.C. Bechtol B.K. Damsky H.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 34: 187-202Google Scholar, 29Paradies N.E. Grunwald G.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 33-45Google Scholar). Thus, this is the first demonstration of a soluble form of type I and II cadherins generated by alternative splicing. It is known that each subtype of cadherin molecules prefers homophilic to heterophilic interactions. Thus, cadherin molecules play a role in intracellular signaling between homotypic cells and in sorting heterotypic cells (5Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Google Scholar), and the CR1 domain determines their binding specificity (8Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Google Scholar, 9Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Google Scholar). The extracellular domain is able to act as a ligand for the same subtype of membranous-bound cadherins and inhibits adhesion mediated by the same subtype of membranous-bound cadherins. The soluble fragment of E-cadherin, generated by proteolysis, is able to disrupt cell-to-cell adhesion in cultured epithelial cells (28Wheelock M.J. Buck A.C. Bechtol B.K. Damsky H.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 34: 187-202Google Scholar) and is involved in carcinoma invasion in vivo (30Gofuku J. Shiozaki H. Doki Y. Inoue M. Hirao M. Fukuchi N. Monden M. Br. J.

Soluble P-cadherin, generated by proteolysis, is present in human milk and serum of women with or without breast cancer, but the exact function of this protein is not clear (34Soler A.P. Russo J. Russo I.H. Knudsen K.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 180-184Google Scholar, 35Knudsen K.A. Lin C.Y. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Keshgegian A.A. Soler A.P. Hum. Pathol. 2000; 31: 961Google Scholar). And the soluble recombinant T-cadherin inhibits neurite extension from selected neuron populations (36Fredette B.J. Miller J. Ranscht B. Development. 1996; 122: 3163-3171Google Scholar). Several mutations in cadherin-23, a member of the cadherin superfamily, introduce premature stop codons, and the soluble form of cadherin-23, as the result, is produced. These mutations cause hearing loss. The effect of soluble caderin-23 on this symptom is not clear, because it is thought that this arises from a loss of function of full-length cadherin-23 (37Di Palma F. Holme R.H. Bryda E.C. Belyantseva I.A. Pellegrino R. Kachar B. Steel K.P. Noben-Trauth K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 103-107Google Scholar,38Bolz H. Brederlow B.V. Ramirez A. Bryda E.C. Kutsche K. Norhwang H.G. Seeliger M. Cabrera M. Vila M.C. Molina O.P. Gal A. Kubisch C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 108-112Google Scholar). Both variant and full-length cadherin-7 have the same EC1 domain. It is possible that the variant protein binds to full-length cadherin-7 and inhibits cell-cell adhesion mediated by full-length cadherin-7. To examine this possibility, we performed aggregation assays with or without the variant form. The variant cadherin-7 slowed aggregation, indicating its inhibitory activity against the full-length cadherin-7. Furthermore, to confirm the interaction between the variant protein and the full-length cadherin-7, we performed immunoprecipitation using anti-variant Ab, and full-length cadherin-7 molecules were co-precipitated. Interaction of the variant protein with full-length cadherin-7 suggests that the variant form interrupts trans-interaction of homophilic binding of full-length cadherin-7 in vitro andin vivo. The expression patterns of cadherin-7 have been well investigated in early chicken embryos (5Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Google Scholar, 17Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1998; 125: 2963-2971Google Scholar). The cDNA probe used in these studies for in situ hybridization encoded the CR3 and CR4 regions of cadherin-7, and an anti-cadherin-7 monoclonal antibody, CCD7–1, recognized the extracellular domain. Therefore, they detected both full-length and variant forms of cadherin-7 at the transcriptional and protein levels. In this report, we performed competitive PCR and immunostaining using an anti-variant-specific antibody. Full-length cadherin-7 was strongly expressed in migrating neural crest cells; the signal of the variant form was detected strongly on dermomyotomes but only weakly in proximal dorsal and ventral roots and in dorsal root ganglia. The expression pattern of the variant form on dermomyotomes resembles the expression pattern of MyoD at stage 23 (39). The dermomyotome is a developmentally transient tissue that displays extensive cell movements and gives rise to both muscle and dermis. During development, dynamic cell adhesion, detachment, and migration are essential processes for morphogenesis, and therefore the regulation of cadherin activities must be involved (40Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Google Scholar). E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions are dynamically regulated by internal processes. Growth factor activation of receptor tyrosine kinase induces phosphorylation of E-cadherin and β-catenin, ubiquitination, and endocytosis, and epithelial cells then change their morphology (41Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M. Zechner D. Leddy H. Behrens J. Sommer T. Birchmeier W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 222-231Google Scholar). Our finding of inhibition against full-length cadherin-7 by a soluble variant form raises the possibility that an alternative regulation mechanism of cadherin activity from outside the cells occurs during development. To establish the mechanism of regulation of cadherin activity by the soluble form, it is necessary to study furtherin vivo on the role of the soluble form in dermomyotome development. We thank Drs. S. Nakagawa and M. Takeichi of Kyoto University for generous gifts of CCD7–1 antibody and hybridoma, Dr. S.

https://openalex.org/W2076400136,"To determine the effect of the redox state of the Rieske protein on ligand binding to the quinol oxidation site of the bc1 complex, we measured the binding rate constants (k1) for stigmatellin and myxothiazol, at different concentrations of decylbenzoquinone or decylbenzoquinol, in the bovine bc1 complex with the Rieske protein in the oxidized or reduced state. Stigmatellin and myxothiazol bound tightly and competitively with respect to quinone or quinol, independently of the redox state of the Rieske protein. In the oxidized bc1 complex, thek1 values for stigmatellin (∼2.6 × 106m−1s−1) and myxothiazol (∼8 × 105m−1s−1), and the dissociation constant (Kd) for quinone, were similar between pH 6.5 and 9, indicating that ligand binding is independent of the protonation state of histidine 161 of the Rieske protein (pKa ∼7.6). Reduction of the Rieske protein increased the k1 value for stigmatellin and decreased the Kd value for quinone by 50%, without modifying the k1 for myxothiazol. These results indicate that reduction of the Rieske protein and protonation of histidine 161 do not induce a strong stabilization of ligand binding to the quinol oxidation site, as assumed in models that propose the existence of a highly stabilized semiquinone as a reaction intermediate during quinol oxidation. To determine the effect of the redox state of the Rieske protein on ligand binding to the quinol oxidation site of the bc1 complex, we measured the binding rate constants (k1) for stigmatellin and myxothiazol, at different concentrations of decylbenzoquinone or decylbenzoquinol, in the bovine bc1 complex with the Rieske protein in the oxidized or reduced state. Stigmatellin and myxothiazol bound tightly and competitively with respect to quinone or quinol, independently of the redox state of the Rieske protein.

These results indicate that reduction of the Rieske protein and protonation of histidine 161 do not induce a strong stabilization of ligand binding to the quinol oxidation site, as assumed in models that propose the existence of a highly stabilized semiquinone as a reaction intermediate during quinol oxidation. The key reaction that allows energy conservation in ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (bc1 complex) is the bifurcation of electrons from quinol toward the iron-sulfur cluster of the Rieske protein and heme bL of cytochrome b (1Brandt U. Trumpower B.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 29: 165-197Google Scholar, 2Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 261-268Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed to explain the mechanism that prevents the thermodynamically favorable (but energetically wasteful) reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster by both electrons from quinol. These proposals differ, among other aspects, in the stability constant and the role assigned to semiquinone as a reaction intermediate in the quinol oxidation site (Qo site). Crofts and Wang (3Crofts A.R. Wang Z. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 69-87Google Scholar) originally proposed a highly unstable semiquinone, which according to recent modifications of this mechanism (4Crofts A.R. Hong S. Ugulava N. Barquera B. Gennis R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10021-10026Google Scholar, 5Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Google Scholar), would move from the Qo site subdomain occupied in crystal structures by inhibitors such as stigmatellin to the pocket occupied by myxothiazol and methoxyacrylate inhibitors. Because no electron paramagnetic resonance-detectable semiquinone is observed in the Qo site (6Jünneman S. Heathcote P. Rich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21603-21607Google Scholar), and the redox potentials of the iron-sulfur cluster and theb hemes exert a reciprocal control on their reduction rates by quinol, Snyder et al. (7Snyder C.H. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13535-13541Google Scholar) proposed a concerted mechanism in which the rapid oxidation of semiquinone by hemebL of cytochrome b drives the thermodynamically unfavorable one-electron reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster by quinol. In contrast to these models, Link (8Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Google Scholar) suggested that reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster by quinol leads to a stabilization of semiquinone through a strong hydrogen bond between this intermediate and one of the histidines that binds to the redox cluster (histidine 161 in the bovinebc1 complex). This unusually strong interaction between semiquinone and the reduced Rieske protein would restrain the soluble domain of this subunit from diffusing away from the interface with cytochrome b toward cytochromec1 until semiquinone reduces hemebL (9Iwata M. Björkman J. Iwata S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 169-175Google Scholar). This would ensure the recycling of the second electron from quinol through cytochrome b. The stable semiquinone intermediary would not be detected by electron paramagnetic resonance because of magnetic coupling between the reduced iron-sulfur cluster and semiquinone (8Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Google Scholar). The basis for assuming the existence of this stable semiquinone is the 250-mV shift in the redox potential of the iron-sulfur cluster induced by binding of stigmatellin (considered as an analogue of semiquinone) to the bc1complex (10von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Google Scholar). This effect has been interpreted as indicating an ∼105 higher binding constant of the inhibitor to the iron-sulfur cluster-reduced bc1 complex compared with the fully oxidized enzyme. In apparent agreement with this interpretation, removal of the Rieske protein from thebc1 complex changes stigmatellin inhibition from tightly bound (Kd < 0.1 nm) to weak and reversible (Kd ∼50 μm) (11Brandt U. Haase U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19958-19964Google Scholar). However, there is no direct evidence that binding of stigmatellin or quinone is stabilized by reduction of the Rieske protein. Moreover, we have shown recently (12Covián R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5783-5790Google Scholar) that quinone binding is not stabilized by protonation of histidine 161 of the Rieske cluster, nor is quinol binding stabilized by deprotonation of this residue, suggesting that the putative hydrogen bond formed between histidine 161 and Qo site ligands is not essential for binding of substrate and product. To obtain evidence on the stabilization of ligands at the Qo site upon reduction of the Rieske protein, we determined the binding rate constants of the tightly bound inhibitors stigmatellin and myxothiazol to the purified bovine heart bc1complex with the Rieske protein in the oxidized and reduced state and as a function of the protonation state of histidine 161, which has a pKa of ∼7.6 (13Link T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 81-84Google Scholar). The affinity toward quinone or quinol in these conditions was also determined through competition with the inhibitors. Our results indicate that the effect of the reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster, or the protonation of histidine 161, on the binding of ligands to the Qo site is much more weaker than that required by models that consider stabilization of semiquinone through a hydrogen bond to the reduced iron-sulfur cluster. Decylbenzoquinone, horse heart cytochromec, l-ascorbic acid, and Tween 20 were purchased from Sigma. Stigmatellin was from Fluka, and myxothiazol was from ICN Biomedicals Co. All other reagents of analytical grade were from standard suppliers. Decylbenzoquinol was prepared as described (14Ljungdahl P. Pennoyer J.D. Trumpower B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 181-191Google Scholar). UV-spectrophotometric quantification of decylbenzoquinone and decylbenzoquinol was performed in ethanol using extinction coefficients reported in Ref. 15Rich P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Google Scholar, and solubility in the aqueous detergent-containing reaction medium was verified as described before (12Covián R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5783-5790Google Scholar). Stigmatellin and myxothiazol quantification was performed using wavelengths and extinction coefficients reported previously (16von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Google Scholar). The isolation procedure and quantification of heme content was done as described previously (12Covián R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5783-5790Google Scholar). The purified bc1complex contained 7.1 and 3.6 nmol of hemes b andc1/mg of protein, respectively (no hemea was detected spectrophotometrically), and was stored at a concentration of 6–10 μm in 50% (v/v) glycerol and 0.01% β-d-laurylmaltoside at −20 °C and diluted to 1 μm before the assay. Rate constants were determined by using Equation 1, [Ea]t[Ea]0=e−k1[I]t+k−1Equation 1 which describes the time-dependent binding of an inhibitor (I) to the enzyme (E), where [Ea]t is the active enzyme remaining at time t, [Ea]0 is the active enzyme before the addition of inhibitor (time 0), k1 is the second order rate constant for the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme, and k−1 is the first order rate constant for the dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The complete derivation of Equation 1 can be found in Ref. 17Eyzaguirre J. Chemical Modification of Enzymes: Active Site Studies. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar. When [I] ≫ [Ea]0, the amount of free inhibitor can be considered constant throughout the time course of inhibitor binding. Under this condition, the initial rate of cytochromec reduction is a measure of the amount of active enzyme. Therefore, the time-dependent decrease of the initial rate at each inhibitor concentration was fitted to a single exponential decay function to obtain a pseudo-first order rate constant (k′1) that depended only on the concentration of [I]. k′1 is defined by Equation 2. k1′=k1[I]+k−1Equation 2 According to Equation 2, the value of the second order rate constant (k1) for the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme was obtained by plotting k′1 as a function of [I] and fitting the data to a straight line, where the slope is k1, and the ordinate isk−1. During the fitting procedure,k−1 was constrained to positive values. The variation of the binding rate constants as a function of the concentration of either decylbenzoquinone or decylbenzoquinol (k1 obs) was fitted to a competitive binding model according to Equation 3, k1obs=k11+⌊Q⌋KdEquation 3 where k1 is the second order rate constant describing the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme in the absence of quinone or quinol (Q), and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the bc1-Q complex. Mixed or non-competitive kinetic models resulted in poor fitting. All fitting procedures were performed using the Origin 5.0 program (OriginLab Corp.). The assay medium contained 0.01% Tween 20, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mmof citric acid (pKa3 6.8), Hepes (pKa 7.5), and Taps 1The abbreviations used are: Taps, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid (systematic). (pKa 8.4) to efficiently buffer the pH in the range of 6.5 to 9. All measurements were performed at 30 °C. No difference was found between the spectra of the air-oxidized complex at pH 7.5, where the Rieske protein is more oxidizing than cytochromec1, and at pH 9, where the redox potential of the Rieske protein decreases below that of cytochromec1 (13Link T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 81-84Google Scholar), indicating that the Rieske protein was oxidized fully (Fig. 1, traces a and b). Comparison with the ferricyanide-oxidizedbc1 complex (Fig. 1, trace c) indicated that >97% of cytochrome c1 in the complex was in the oxidized state. 1 nm air-oxidized enzyme was added to the reaction medium adjusted to the desired pH in a 1-ml cuvette containing 30 μm horse heart cytochromec and the appropriate concentration of decylbenzoquinone. After a 20-s preincubation, the inhibitor was added (time 0) followed by the addition at different times (8, 15, 23, 30, 45, or 60 s) of 16 μm decylbenzoquinol. The initial rate of cytochromec reduction was measured at 550–540 nm (ε = 19.1 mm−1 cm−1) in a SLM-Aminco DW-2000 dual wavelength spectrophotometer (scanning speed of 1 point/0.24 s) during the first 3–5 s of the reaction. Correction for non-enzymic reduction was described previously (12Covián R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5783-5790Google Scholar). Initial rates were measured without the inhibitor at each of the incubation times, and no decrease in the activity was found up to the maximum time (60 s), indicating that the enzyme is stable, and the decrease in activity is only because of the interaction with the inhibitor. To discard the possible reduction of the Rieske protein by endogenous reducing equivalents during the activity assay, binding of stigmatellin as a function of pH was also determined with the ferricyanide-oxidizedbc1 complex. In this case, 1 μmair-oxidized bc1 complex was incubated with 1 mm potassium ferricyanide. 1 nmferricyanide-oxidized complex was added to the reaction medium described above. Final concentration of ferricyanide in the reaction cuvette was 1 μm. Because ferricyanide oxidizes cytochrome c, one of the substrates of the reaction, a short lag of up to 5 s was observed after adding decylbenzoquinol before a linear rate could be achieved. Reduction of the Rieske protein was achieved by adding 1 mmfreshly prepared potassium ascorbate (pH 7.5) to 1 μm bc1 complex. Complete cytochromec1 (and hence Rieske protein) reduction was confirmed spectrophotometrically (Fig. 1, trace d), showing 1.06 μm of reduced cytochrome c1. Cytochrome b was oxidized completely, as observed in the dithionite minus ascorbate-reduced spectra (Fig. 1, trace g), with 2.3 μm b hemes not reduced by ascorbate. Ascorbate-reduced enzyme (1 nm) was added to 1 ml of reaction medium (pH 7.5) containing the indicated concentration of decylbenzoquinone. After 20 s of preincubation, the inhibitor was added, and after the desired time, 30 μm horse heart cytochrome c and 16 μm decylbenzoquinol were added simultaneously. The initial rates of cytochrome creduction were used to obtain the kinetic constants as explained above. Alternatively, reduction of the Rieske protein was achieved by adding different concentrations of decylbenzoquinol to 1 nmoxidized enzyme in the assay medium at pH 7.5. After 20 s, the inhibitor was added, and 30 μm oxidized horse heart cytochrome c was used to start the reaction at different times. Experimental data were treated as explained above to obtain the inhibitor binding and dissociation rate constants and theKd for decylbenzoquinol. Even the lowest concentration of decylbenzoquinol (4 μm) allowed immediate full reduction of cytochrome c1 when added to 1 μm (Fig. 1, trace e) or 10 nm bc1 complex (not shown). The decylbenzoquinol minus ascorbate-reduced spectrum showed that the same full reduction of cytochrome c1 (and therefore of the Rieske protein) was attained by adding ascorbate or decylbenzoquinol (Fig. 1, trace i). In addition, decylbenzoquinol reduced 28% of cytochrome b, mostly hemebH (peak at 562 nm; see Fig. 1, trace i). The time-dependent inhibition of the initial rate of the air-oxidized bc1 complex by stigmatellin and myxothiazol at four different concentrations of inhibitor and in the absence of decylbenzoquinone is shown in Fig. 2, A and B at pH 7.5. The second order rate constants for the binding of each inhibitor were obtained from the slope of the pseudo-first order rate constants as a function of inhibitor concentration (Fig. 2C). The binding rate of stigmatellin was three times higher than for myxothiazol (Table I). Interestingly, the dissociation rate constant for both inhibitors (k−1), which corresponds to the ordinate value, was close to zero, resulting in aKd value in the nanomolar range (Table I). This indicates tight binding of myxothiazol and, notably, of stigmatellin to the Qo site when the Rieske protein is oxidized. Both the binding and release rate constants for stigmatellin in the air-oxidized enzyme were very similar to those obtained in the ferricyanide-oxidizedbc1 complex (where 1 μmferricyanide was present in the reaction medium during the preincubation with the inhibitor), indicating that even in the air-oxidized condition the Rieske protein was oxidized fully (Fig. 2C).Table IKinetic parameters of stigmatellin, myxothiazol, quinone, and quinol binding to fully oxidized and Rieske protein reduced bovine bc1 complexRedox stateStigmatellinMyxothiazolk1k−1KdIaKd value for the inhibitor, corresponding tok−1/k1.KdQbKd value for decylbenzoquinone in the oxidized and ascorbate-reducedbc1 complex and for decylbenzoquinol in the decylbenzoquinol-reduced complex.

Open table in a new tab The iron-sulfur cluster of the Rieske protein is bound to two histidines (161 and 141), with pKa values of ∼7.6 and 9.2 when the cluster is oxidized (13Link T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 81-84Google Scholar). Histidine 161 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of a carbonyl group of stigmatellin, and quinone and quinol have been proposed to bind to the Qosite in a similar position to that occupied by stigmatellin (4Crofts A.R. Hong S. Ugulava N. Barquera B. Gennis R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10021-10026Google Scholar). In contrast, myxothiazol does not establish any interactions with iron-sulfur residues (5Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Google Scholar). Therefore, binding rate constants for both inhibitors were determined at different protonation states of histidine 161, from a >90% (at pH 6.5) to a <4% (at pH 9.0) protonation, in the absence of decylbenzoquinone (Fig. 3). The results showed that binding rates were independent of the protonation state of this residue and that dissociation rate constants remained below 0.005 s−1 at all pH values (Table I). The same results for stigmatellin were observed if the assays were performed in the presence of ferricyanide (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the Rieske protein was oxidized in the air-oxidized enzyme. The Kd values for decylbenzoquinone, calculated by fitting the variation in the observed k1 for both inhibitors as a function of decylbenzoquinone concentration (Fig. 4), showed a similar value at the extreme pH values of 6.5 and 9 and a slightly higher value at pH 7.5 (Table I). This result agrees with our previous finding (12Covián R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5783-5790Google Scholar) that the protonation state of histidine 161 does not affect the binding of substrate and product. These experiments were performed with the air-oxidizedbc1 complex to avoid the lag in the onset of linear rate produced by the presence of ferricyanide, which was more pronounced at high concentrations of decylbenzoquinone. Nevertheless, full oxidation of the Rieske protein in the air-oxidized complex has already been demonstrated according to the results of Fig. 2. Reduction of the bc1 complex with ascorbate or decylbenzoquinol slightly increased the affinity of the Qo site toward stigmatellin without affecting myxothiazol binding (see Fig. 5 and Table I). In turn, the affinity toward decylbenzoquinone, estimated by using either inhibitor, was increased 2-fold in the ascorbate-reducedbc1 complex (Table I). Decylbenzoquinol affinity was decreased slightly upon reduction of the Rieske protein as compared with the Km value for this substrate (8 μm) under steady-state conditions (12Covián R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5783-5790Google Scholar), which can be taken as an approximation of the Kd for decylbenzoquinol in the oxidized bc1 complex. The Kd for decylbenzoquinol was not modified when ascorbate was used to reduce the Rieske protein instead of quinol (not shown). These results indicate that ligand binding to the Qo site is affected only moderately by the reduction of the Rieske protein. Our finding that stigmatellin binds tightly to the Qo site independently of the redox state of the Rieske protein (Table I) indicates that the 250-mV increase in the redox potential of the iron-sulfur cluster induced by this inhibitor (10von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Google Scholar) cannot be attributed to a 105-fold tighter binding to the reduced Rieske protein (9Iwata M. Björkman J. Iwata S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 169-175Google Scholar). In consequence, the proposal of a stabilized, electron paramagnetic resonance invisible semiquinone as a reaction intermediate that prevents the transfer of the second electron of quinol to the iron-sulfur cluster is unsupported. The dissociation rate constant in all conditions was close to zero, indicating aKd value in the nanomolar range (Table I). The same results were obtained when the bc1 complex was oxidized with ferricyanide prior to the binding assay and with this oxidant present during the incubation with stigmatellin (Fig. 2C), discarding the possibility of reduction of the Rieske protein by endogenous reductants when the enzyme was diluted to 1 nm. Assuming a constant value fork−1 in all redox states of the enzyme, the 50% increase in k1 upon reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster would only account for 10 mV of the 250-mV increase induced by stigmatellin, according to the equations relating the change in redox potential, ΔG, and Kd (8Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Google Scholar). We consider that the effect of stigmatellin on the redox potential of the iron-sulfur cluster is the result of the stabilization of a conformation, in agreement with recent studies in which mutations in the hinge region of the Rieske protein restrain the soluble domain of this subunit from moving away from the interface with cytochromeb (18Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4567-4572Google Scholar, 19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 267: 3464-3470Google Scholar). Some of these mutations increase the redox potential of the iron-sulfur cluster up to 150 mV (in the absence of stigmatellin or any other ligand). Therefore, it seems likely that the environment surrounding the iron-sulfur cluster when the soluble domain of the Rieske protein is in contact with cytochrome b, a conformation which is also stabilized by stigmatellin according to crystal structures (20Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Google Scholar, 21Crofts A.R. Hong S. Zhang Z. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15827-15839Google Scholar), is the cause of the increase in the redox potential of the iron-sulfur cluster. This conclusion is also supported by the observation of a stigmatellin-induced increase of only 90 mV in the redox potential of the Rieske protein in some of the immobilized-Rieske protein mutants (19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 267: 3464-3470Google Scholar). Our results (Table I) also imply that, rather than changing the redox dependence of stigmatellin binding, mutations in the hinge region of the Rieske protein stabilize a conformation on which the binding of stigmatellin has little further effect. The condition in which the Rieske protein has been removed from the bc1 complex, causing theKd for stigmatellin to increase to 50 μm (10von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Google Scholar), may resemble the position observed in crystal structures in which the soluble domain of the Rieske protein is at thec1 interface (20Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Google Scholar, 21Crofts A.R. Hong S. Zhang Z. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15827-15839Google Scholar), where stigmatellin binding would be unfavorable. The 50% tighter binding of stigmatellin upon reduction of the Rieske protein found in the present work suggests a slight shift of the equilibrium between the different positions of the soluble domain of this subunit toward the cytochrome binterface. Thus, tight binding of stigmatellin to the Qosite occurs when the soluble domain of the Rieske protein (oxidized or reduced) is in contact with cytochrome b (5Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Google Scholar, 21Crofts A.R. Hong S. Zhang Z. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15827-15839Google Scholar). Therefore, an important conclusion derived from our results is that the redox potential of the oxidized iron-sulfur cluster of the wild-type Rieske protein increases 250 mV when this subunit is in the bposition, as has been observed in the Rieske protein mutants that constrain the movement of this subunit (18Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4567-4572Google Scholar, 19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 267: 3464-3470Google Scholar). By measuring the oxidation of cytochrome c1caused by the stigmatellin-induced increase in the redox potential of the Rieske protein at alkaline pH values, Zhang et al. (22Zhang L. Snyder C. Trumpower B.L. Yu L. Yu C.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 349-352Google Scholar) estimated binding rate constants that were almost 30 times lower than the values reported in the present work. These differences cannot be attributed to the different concentration and type of detergent used (which could in principle modify the effective concentration of inhibitor in the bc1 complex micelles), because the k1 value for stigmatellin assayed in 0.05% of lauryl maltoside (22Zhang L. Snyder C. Trumpower B.L. Yu L. Yu C.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 349-352Google Scholar) under our experimental conditions was 1.5 × 106m−1s−1 (not shown), 15 times higher than the values calculated by Zhang et al. (22Zhang L. Snyder C. Trumpower B.L. Yu L. Yu C.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 349-352Google Scholar). Two factors could explain the lower k1 values obtained from cytochrome c1 oxidation induced by stigmatellin. 1) Cytochrome c1 oxidation induced by stigmatellin is only possible when the Rieske protein is oxidized. The bc1 complex preparation used by Zhanget al. (22Zhang L. Snyder C. Trumpower B.L. Yu L. Yu C.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 349-352Google Scholar) contained only 17% of Rieske protein in the oxidized state. Thus, most of the stigmatellin binding occurred to the larger fraction of enzyme with the Rieske protein in the reduced state, which is undetected by the methodology used, resulting in underestimated k1 values. 2) Electron transfer between heme c1 and the iron-sulfur cluster is not possible when the Rieske protein is at the cytochrome binterface (21Crofts A.R. Hong S. Zhang Z. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15827-15839Google Scholar); therefore, the binding rate constants obtained from cytochrome c1 oxidation measurements correspond to the rate of stigmatellin binding to bc1complex molecules where the Rieske protein is at a position in which its redox potential is already higher than that of cytochromec1 but still in a sufficiently close distance from heme c1 to allow electron transfer. In contrast, the binding rate constants determined in the present work involve binding to all conformations of the bc1complex, including that where the Rieske protein is close to cytochromeb, a position in which the redox potential of the iron-sulfur cluster is 250 mV higher than at the interface with cytochrome c1. This high redox potential conformation in the b position can represent up to 50% of the total unbound enzyme, according to some crystal structures (20Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Google Scholar), and is more accessible to stigmatellin binding, because it is stabilized by this inhibitor (21Crofts A.R. Hong S. Zhang Z. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15827-15839Google Scholar). The protonation state of the histidine with pKa 7.5 that binds the iron-sulfur cluster did not affect the binding rate constant of stigmatellin in the oxidized bc1 complex significantly (Fig. 3). Zhang et al. (22Zhang L. Snyder C. Trumpower B.L. Yu L. Yu C.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 349-352Google Scholar) also found little effect of pH between 7.5 and 9.2 on stigmatellink1 values, which are probably underestimated for the reasons discussed above. We have proposed that this pKa 7.5 residue corresponds to histidine 161 of the Rieske protein, because our previous kinetic analysis suggested that this group is a primary acceptor of a proton from quinol (12Covián R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5783-5790Google Scholar). Electron transfer calculations and simulations also point to deprotonated histidine 161 as the residue that receives a proton from quinol simultaneously with the iron-sulfur cluster reduction (23Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33931-333944Google Scholar, 24Crofts A.R. Guergova-Kuras M. Kuras R. Ugulava N. Li J. Hong S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 456-466Google Scholar). Even though this residue is in hydrogen-bonding distance of the carbonyl of stigmatellin (5Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Google Scholar), our observation of pH- and redox-independent binding of stigmatellin suggests a more important role for the interactions between the hydrophobic side chain of the inhibitor and cytochromeb residues in determining the tight binding behavior of stigmatellin. In agreement with this last proposal, Ohnishi et al. (25Ohnishi T. Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 385-389Google Scholar) found that modifications of the side chain of stigmatellin (displacement or removal of methoxy groups and saturation of double bonds) decrease the affinity toward this inhibitor several orders of magnitude. Moreover, some of these derivatives, with a higher hydrophobicity than stigmatellin, induced a shift in the redox potential of the Rieske protein of only 80–90 mV, despite having the same carbonyl that is in hydrogen-bonding distance to histidine 161. Hydroxydioxobenzothiazoles (26Bowyer J.R. Edwards C.A. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8321-8330Google Scholar) and hydroxynaphthoquinones (27Matsuura K. Bowyer J.R. Ohnishi T. Dutton P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1571-1579Google Scholar) cause redox potential shifts similar to those induced by stigmatellin derivatives with modified side chains (∼70 mV), even though they also possess the carbonyl group. Genetic evidence also points to an important role of cytochromeb residues in determining the tight binding of stigmatellin (28Brasseur G. Sami Saribas A. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 61-69Google Scholar). Several residues at which mutations confer resistance to this inhibitor, such as methionine 125, phenylalanine 129, isoleucine 147, and leucine 295, are within 3 to 4 angstroms from side chain atoms of stigmatellin (5Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Google Scholar). Glutamate 272 hydrogen bonds to a hydroxyl group from the chromone moiety of stigmatellin, whereas other residues, such as glycine 137, asparagine 256, and tryptophan 273 appear to be important for determining the overall conformation of the stigmatellin binding pocket. These findings indicate that tight binding of stigmatellin (and its associated conformational and redox potential changes in the Rieske protein) cannot be attributed to a single strong hydrogen bond between the inhibitor and histidine 161 of the Rieske protein. However, because crystal structures clearly show a hydrogen bond between stigmatellin and histidine 161 (4,5), it is probable that the inhibitor recruits a proton to establish the hydrogen bond once it has bound to its site. It was shown previously that the protonation state of the pKa ∼7.5 residue, probably histidine 161 of the Rieske protein, affected the affinity of the bc1complex toward quinone slightly without affecting theKm value for quinol (12Covián R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5783-5790Google Scholar). Instead, quinone binding was modified by groups with pKa of 5.7 and 9.2 (probably glutamate 272 of cytochrome b and histidine 141 of the Rieske protein). In agreement with previous work, theKd values obtained for quinone (see Fig. 4 and TableI) showed a maximum at pH 7.5, slightly decreasing toward more acidic and basic pH values, probably as a result of the influence of other protonatable groups. Furthermore, the Kd value of 10–15 μm (Fig. 6) obtained for quinol with the reduced Rieske protein, where histidine 161 is expected to be protonated fully because of the shift in its pKa from 7.6 to >11 (13Link T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 81-84Google Scholar), was similar to theKm values reported previously obtained from measuring the steady-state activity between pH 6.7 and 9 (12Covián R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5783-5790Google Scholar). Because these Km values are an approximation of theKd for quinol in the oxidized enzyme (where histidine 161 has a pKa of 7.6), it follows that the affinity toward the substrate is not affected by the redox state of thebc1 complex. Therefore, our present results support the proposal that a particular protonation state of histidine 161 is not essential for ligand binding to the Qo site, even though ligands could recruit or eliminate a proton in this residue after binding. The insensitivity of myxothiazol binding to both the redox state of Rieske protein and the protonation state of the pKa 7.5 histidine of the Rieske protein was expected, considering that crystal structures show no interaction between this inhibitor and any Rieske protein residues (5Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Google Scholar). In contrast, methoxyacrylate inhibitors, which bind to the Qosite subdomain proximal to heme bL like myxothiazol (5Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Google Scholar), undergo a decrease in their Kdvalues as the redox centers of the bc1 complex are reduced sequentially (29Brandt U. Djafarzadeh-Andabili R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 238-242Google Scholar). In addition, the binding of these reversible inhibitors is favored by the deprotonation of histidine 161 (29Brandt U. Djafarzadeh-Andabili R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 238-242Google Scholar). Notably, we found that myxothiazol is a purely competitive inhibitor with respect to quinone and quinol, in contrast with the mixed-type inhibition pattern found for methoxyacrylates (30Brandt U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 499-506Google Scholar). These differences may be attributed to the smaller size of the methoxyacrylate compounds, which allows the simultaneous binding of quinone and methoxyacrylate to the Qo site. Moreover, the weaker interaction of methoxyacrylates with cytochrome bmight additionally cause their binding to be more sensitive to subtle conformational changes derived from either the reduction of redox centers or the deprotonation of residues in the Rieske protein. According to mutational studies (28Brasseur G. Sami Saribas A. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 61-69Google Scholar) and crystal structures (5Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Google Scholar), some residues that also interact with stigmatellin, such as methionine 125, phenylalanine 129, and leucine 295, are within 3 to 4 angstroms of myxothiazol side chain atoms. Other residues that specifically confer sensitivity to myxothiazol, such as alanine 126 and glycine 143, are also at close distance to side chain atoms. Two other residues (tyrosine 132 and phenylalanine 275) surround the amide group of the methoxyacrylate moiety (5Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Google Scholar), and their mutation confers resistance to both myxothiazol and methoxyacrylates. (28Brasseur G. Sami Saribas A. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 61-69Google Scholar). Therefore, as is the case with stigmatellin, the tightly bound nature of myxothiazol inhibition results mainly from interactions between cytochrome bresidues and the inhibitor side chain. Contrary to proposals that question the binding of quinone to the Qo site (31Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19006-19011Google Scholar), our kinetic analysis demonstrates directly that quinone and quinol, despite being undetectable in crystal structures, bind to the Qo site in competition with stigmatellin and myxothiazol. However, our results indicate that there is no basis for the assumption that the hydrogen bond between histidine 161 and the Qo site ligand is involved in a strong ligand stabilization upon reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster (8Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Google Scholar). Furthermore, tight binding of inhibitors to the Qo site should be attributed to the structure of the hydrophobic side chains of stigmatellin and myxothiazol, which are considerably different from the isoprenoid chain of ubiquinone or the aliphatic tail of decylbenzoquinone. Thus, stigmatellin and myxothiazol should not be considered as analogues of a highly stabilized semiquinone with respect to their tightly bound nature. Our results are consistent with models of quinol oxidation that propose a highly unstable semiquinone (3,7), which is oxidized rapidly by hemebL, thereby ensuring the bifurcation of electrons required to translocate protons in thebc1 complex. If a single quinol molecule binds to the Qo site (4Crofts A.R. Hong S. Ugulava N. Barquera B. Gennis R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10021-10026Google Scholar), the unstable semiquinone formed after Rieske protein reduction could rapidly move to the Qo site subdomain proximal to heme bL to be oxidized. It is likely that such movement also occurs with quinol and quinone, as suggested by the finding that substrate and product binding is not dependent on hydrogen bonding to histidine 161 of the Rieske protein (see Ref. 12Covián R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5783-5790Google Scholar and Table I), explaining why quinone is not detected in the Qo site of crystallized bc1complexes (5Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Google Scholar). Moreover, in the light of mutational studies that constrain the Rieske protein to the cytochrome b interface (18,19), the tight binding of stigmatellin to thebc1 complex, independently of the redox state of the Rieske protein, indicates that the redox potential of the iron-sulfur cluster is 250 mV more oxidant in the b position as compared with the freely moving subunit. This implies that the Rieske protein facilitates the first oxidation of quinol by becoming more oxidant when in contact with the Qo site and becomes more reducing at the cytochrome c1 interface to transfer electrons to this subunit efficiently."
