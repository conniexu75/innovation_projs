https://openalex.org/W2972982411,"How to define a light path topologically Controlling the flow of light in a robust and flexible manner will be critical for the development of the next generation of photonic integrated devices. Exploiting the inherent protection afforded by topology, topological photonics provides a solution for the robust propagation of light. Devices so far, however, have been fixed in their functionality. Zhao et al. created light paths that can be arbitrarily switched on and off by optical illumination. Propagation can be topologically steered along desired pathways by manipulating regions of gain and loss within the photonic structure through optical excitation. This approach provides a route to controlling topologically protected light paths in an integrated optical platform. Science , this issue p. 1163"

Such an approach would, however, be generalizable to many molecular species. Anderegg et al. created an optical tweezer array of calcium monofluoride molecules, which were laser cooled to their ground state (see the Perspective by Kotochigova). By distinguishing between single and multiple molecules in the tweezers, the researchers were able to observe molecular collisions. Boasting exquisite control over individual molecules, the optical tweezer array platform holds much promise for extending the applications of ultracold molecules.

Particles size and morphology were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Evaluation of the bacteriostatic effects was performed by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and comet assays. The smaller the particle size of Ag-NPs, the smaller the value of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC), indicating the greater the antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity was determined by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by bacteria and by bacterial membrane damage. In this study, we determined ROS-induced damage of bacteria caused by Ag-NPs. In conclusion, our findings indicated that Ag-NPs were effective at different particle sizes and concentrations and that the smaller the particle size of Ag-NPs, the greater the antibacterial activity."

Eng et al. tested how exposure to these compounds influenced the behavior of a migrating songbird. Ingestion of field-realistic levels of neonicotinoid insecticides reduced feeding and accumulation of body mass and fat stores, which led to delayed departure from stopover sites. Such delays can lead to reduced migration survival and decreased reproductive success and therefore have the potential to impose population-level impacts. Science , this issue p. 1177"

If only one bond is available, the resultant electron-deficient nitrene can react rapidly with hydrocarbons to fill out its valence shell. Metal-stabilized nitrenes have been widely implicated in carbon-nitrogen bond-forming reactions, but the putative intermediates have rarely been synthesized directly. Carsch et al. now report preparation of a copper nitrene complex from an azide precursor. X-ray absorption and diffraction studies support a triplet electronic state that does not engage in multiple bonding with the copper center. Science , this issue p. 1138"

But the effect of a neighbor can be profound. Mehrabi et al. used a photolabile compound to initiate a reaction in the enzyme fluoroacetate dehalogenase, which they could follow by time-resolved serial synchrotron crystallography. Snapshots of the reaction revealed coupled allosteric motions between the two active sites of the dimeric enzyme. Each active site traded the ability to bind substrate and catalyze the reaction, such that only one was engaged at a time. This behavior is common in enzymes but is rarely visualized and still poorly understood. Science , this issue p. 1167"

Saurer et al. provided structural information on the maturation process of the mitochondrial ribosome, or mitoribosome, in the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei (see the Perspective by Karbstein). Cells evolved a dedicated machinery for maturation of the small subunit of the mitoribosome, including the formation of three distinct and well-structured assembly intermediates.

https://openalex.org/W2972594644,"Evolutionary, cognitive, and neural underpinnings of mammalian play are not yet fully elucidated. We played hide-and-seek, an elaborate role-play game, with rats. We did not offer food rewards but engaged in playful interactions after finding or being found. Rats quickly learned the game and learned to alternate between hiding versus seeking roles. They guided seeking by vision and memories of past hiding locations and emitted game event-specific vocalizations. When hiding, rats vocalized infrequently and they preferred opaque over transparent hiding enclosures, a preference not observed during seeking. Neuronal recordings revealed intense prefrontal cortex activity that varied with game events and trial types (""hide"" versus ""seek"") and might instruct role play. The elaborate cognitive capacities for hide-and-seek in rats suggest that this game might be evolutionarily old."

Different methods of measuring H 0 produce results that disagree with each other, which could be a sign of new physics or of systematic errors in the methods.

The precision is not sufficient to resolve the debate but does bypass some of the systematic uncertainties. Observations of more lensing systems will be required to narrow down the value of H 0 .

https://openalex.org/W2972679791,"Background Core outcome sets (COS) have the potential to reduce waste in research by improving the consistency of outcomes measured in trials of the same health condition. However, this reduction in waste will only be realised through the uptake of COS by clinical trialists. Without uptake, the continued development of COS that are not implemented may add to waste in research. Funders of clinical trials have the potential to have an impact on COS uptake by recommending their use to those applying for funding. The aim of our study was to assess the extent to which applicants followed the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) programme’s recommendation to search for a COS to include in their clinical trial. Methods and findings We examined the outcomes section and detailed project descriptions of all 95 researcher-led primary research applications submitted to the NIHR HTA between January 2012, when the recommendation to search for a COS was included in the guidance for applicants, and December 2015 for evidence that a search for a COS had taken place and rationale for outcome choice in the absence of COS. A survey of applicants was conducted to further explore their use of COS and choice of outcomes with a response rate of 49%. Nine out of 95 applicants (10%) stated in their application that they had searched the COMET (Core Outcome Measures for Effectiveness Trials) Initiative database for a COS and another nine referred to searching for a COS using another method, e.g. a review of the literature. Of the 77 (81%) applicants that did not mention COMET or COS in their application, eight stated in the survey that they had searched the COMET database and ten carried out a search using another method. Some applicants who did not search for a COS gave reasons for their choice of outcomes including taking advice from patients and the public and choosing outcomes used in previous trials. Conclusion A funding body can have an impact on COS uptake by encouraging trialists to search for a COS. Funders could take further steps by putting processes in place to prompt applicants to be explicit about searching for COS in their application and notifying the funding board if a search has not taken place. The sources of information used by trialists to make decisions about outcomes in the absence of COS may suggest methods of dissemination for COS."
https://openalex.org/W2972853670,"We show that both supplemental and ambient magnetic fields modulate myogenesis. A lone 10 min exposure of myoblasts to 1.5 mT amplitude supplemental pulsed magnetic fields (PEMFs) accentuated in vitro myogenesis by stimulating transient receptor potential (TRP)-C1-mediated calcium entry and downstream nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-transcriptional and P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF)-epigenetic cascades, whereas depriving myoblasts of ambient magnetic fields slowed myogenesis, reduced TRPC1 expression, and silenced NFAT-transcriptional and PCAF-epigenetic cascades. The expression levels of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor g coactivator 1α, the master regulator of mitochondriogenesis, was also enhanced by brief PEMF exposure. Accordingly, mitochondriogenesis and respiratory capacity were both enhanced with PEMF exposure, paralleling TRPC1 expression and pharmacological sensitivity. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 knockdown of TRPC1 precluded proliferative and mitochondrial responses to supplemental PEMFs, whereas small interfering RNA gene silencing of TRPM7 did not, coinciding with data that magnetoreception did not coincide with the expression or function of other TRP channels. The aminoglycoside antibiotics antagonized and down-regulated TRPC1 expression and, when applied concomitantly with PEMF exposure, attenuated PEMF-stimulated calcium entry, mitochondrial respiration, proliferation, differentiation, and epigenetic directive in myoblasts, elucidating why the developmental potential of magnetic fields may have previously escaped detection. Mitochondrial-based survival adaptations were also activated upon PEMF stimulation. Magnetism thus deploys an authentic myogenic directive that relies on an interplay between mitochondria and TRPC1 to reach fruition.—Yap, J. L. Y., Tai, Y. K., Fröhlich, J., Fong, C. H. H., Yin, J.

https://openalex.org/W2972777558,"Introduction Although numerous activity trackers have been validated in healthy populations, validation is lacking in chronic heart failure patients who normally walk at a slower pace, making it difficult for researchers and clinicians to implement activity monitors during physical activity interventions. Methods Six consumer-level activity monitors were validated in a 3-day field study in patients with chronic heart failure and healthy individuals under free living conditions. Furthermore, the same devices were evaluated in a lab-based study during treadmill walking at speeds of 2.4, 3.0, 3.6, and 4.2 km·h-1. Concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) were used to evaluate the agreement between the activity monitors and the criterion, and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) were calculated to assess differences between each device and the criterion (MAPE <10% was considered as a threshold for validity). Results In the field study of healthy individuals, all but one of the activity monitors showed a substantial correlation (CCC ≥0.95) with the criterion device and MAPE <10%. In patients with heart failure, the correlation of only two activity monitors (Garmin vívofit 3 and Withings Go) was classified as at least moderate (CCC ≥0.90) and none of the devices had MAPE <10%. In the lab-based study at speeds 4.2 and 3.6 km·h-1, all activity monitors showed substantial to almost perfect correlations (CCC ≥0.95) with the criterion and MAPE in the range 1%-3%. However, at slower speeds of 3.0 and 2.4 km·h-1, the accuracy of all devices substantially deteriorated: their correlation with the criterion decreased below 90% and their MAPE increased to 4–8% and 10–45%, respectively. Conclusions Even though none of the tested activity monitors fall within arbitrary thresholds for validity, most of them perform reasonably well enough to be useful tools that clinicians can use to simply motivate chronic heart failure patients to walk more."
https://openalex.org/W2973144511,"The voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 (KV7.1) assembles with the KCNE1 accessory protein to generate the slow delayed rectifier current, IKS, which is critical for membrane repolarization as part of the cardiac action potential. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in KCNQ1 are the most common cause of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), type 1 LQTS, an inherited genetic predisposition to cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. A detailed structural understanding of KCNQ1 is needed to elucidate the molecular basis for KCNQ1 LOF in disease and to enable structure-guided design of new anti-arrhythmic drugs. In this work, advanced structural models of human KCNQ1 in the resting/closed and activated/open states were developed by Rosetta homology modeling guided by newly available experimentally-based templates: X. leavis KCNQ1 and various resting voltage sensor structures. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the capacity of the models to describe experimentally established channel properties including state-dependent voltage sensor gating charge interactions and pore conformations, PIP2 binding sites, and voltage sensor–pore domain interactions were validated. Rosetta energy calculations were applied to assess the utility of each model in interpreting mutation-evoked KCNQ1 dysfunction by predicting the change in protein thermodynamic stability for 50 experimentally characterized KCNQ1 variants with mutations located in the voltage-sensing domain. Energetic destabilization was successfully predicted for folding-defective KCNQ1 LOF mutants whereas wild type-like mutants exhibited no significant energetic frustrations, which supports growing evidence that mutation-induced protein destabilization is an especially common cause of KCNQ1 dysfunction. The new KCNQ1 Rosetta models provide helpful tools in the study of the structural basis for KCNQ1 function and can be used to generate hypotheses to explain KCNQ1 dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2972395829,"Connections between deficient autophagy and insulin resistance have emerged, however, the mechanism through which reduced autophagy impairs insulin-signaling remains unknown. We examined mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Atg16l1 (ATG16L1 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)), an essential autophagy gene, and observed deficient insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling. ATG16L1 KO MEFs displayed reduced protein content of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), pivotal to insulin signaling, whereas IRS1myc overexpression recovered downstream insulin signaling. Endogenous IRS1 protein content and insulin signaling were restored in ATG16L1 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) upon proteasome inhibition. Through proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that Kelch-like proteins KLHL9 and KLHL13, which together form an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex with cullin 3 (CUL3), are novel IRS1 interactors. Expression of Klhl9 and Klhl13 was elevated in ATG16L1 KO MEFs and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Klhl9, Klhl13, or Cul3 recovered IRS1 expression. Moreover, Klhl13 and Cul3 knockdown increased insulin signaling. Notably, adipose tissue of high-fat fed mice displayed lower Atg16l1 mRNA expression and IRS1 protein content, and adipose tissue KLHL13 and CUL3 expression positively correlated to body mass index in humans. We propose that ATG16L1 deficiency evokes insulin resistance through induction of Klhl9 and Klhl13, which, in complex with Cul3, promote proteasomal IRS1 degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2972673722,"Background Some treatments after a disabling stroke increase the likelihood patients will survive longer but with significant disability. Patients and doctors should make collaborative decisions regarding these treatments. However, this can be challenging. To better understand treatment decision-making in acute disabling stroke, we explored the experiences, views and needs of stroke survivors in hospital and six months later. Methods Fifteen patients who had a disabling stroke were interviewed within a week of their diagnosis; eleven were re-interviewed six months later. Data were analysed thematically and longitudinally. Results Patients’ functional abilities prior to their stroke and need for hope of functional recovery appeared to impact on their involvement in decision-making. In the early period post stroke, patients who were functionally independent pre- stroke described being emotionally devastated and ill-prepared for the consequences of stroke. They appeared unaware that treatments offered might extend their life but with significant disability and took all treatments in the hope of functional recovery. Those who were dependent pre-stroke appeared to be more stoic, had considered treatment implications and decided against such treatments. At follow-up, all patients had varying unmet psychological needs which appeared to contribute to poor quality of life. In the early period post stroke, patients looked for various ways to cultivate and maintain hope of functional recovery. While patients continued to look for hope at six months, they also reported wishing they had been given realistic information in the early period after stroke in order to prepare for the consequences. Conclusion Stroke survivors may benefit from psychological support. A collaborative approach towards treatment decision-making may not be realistic in all patients especially when they may be emotionally distressed and looking to maintain a positive outlook. Communication strategies to balance maintaining hope without providing false hope may be appropriate. Patients’ information needs may need reassessed at different time points."
https://openalex.org/W2972759379,"The Palorchestidae are a family of marsupial megafauna occurring across the eastern Australian continent from the late Oligocene through to their extinction in the Late Pleistocene. The group is known for their odd ‘tapir-like’ crania and distinctive clawed forelimbs, but their appendicular anatomy has never been formally described. We provide the first descriptions of the appendicular skeleton and body mass estimates for three palorchestid species, presenting newly-identified, and in some cases associated, material of mid-Miocene Propalorchestes, Plio-Pleistocene Palorchestes parvus and Pleistocene Palorchestes azael alongside detailed comparisons with extant and fossil vombatiform marsupials. We propose postcranial diagnostic characters at the family, genus and species level. Specialisation in the palorchestid appendicular skeleton evidently occurred much later than in the cranium and instead correlates with increasing body size within the lineage. We conclude that palorchestid forelimbs were highly specialised for the manipulation of their environment in the acquisition of browse, and that they may have adopted bipedal postures to feed. Our results indicate palorchestids were bigger than previously thought, with the largest species likely weighing over 1000 kg. Additionally, we show that P. azael exhibits some of the most unusual forelimb morphology of any mammal, with a uniquely fixed humeroulnar joint unlike any of their marsupial kin, living or extinct."

https://openalex.org/W2972357393,"Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine that has various physiological functions, such as roles in energy expenditure, glucose/lipid metabolism, and muscle development. In muscle development, myoblast proliferation is known to be a first step, and recent studies have reported that an increased irisin level is involved in the promotion of cell proliferation in various cell types, including myoblasts. However, the exact mechanism of action by which irisin promotes myoblast proliferation has not been reported. In this study, we aimed to determine the pro-proliferative effect of irisin on C2C12 myoblasts and its mechanism of action. Irisin induced C2C12 cell proliferation and upregulated the mRNA levels of markers of proliferation Pcna, Mki67, and Mcm2. Irisin increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, and U0126, an ERK pathway inhibitor, suppressed irisin-induced C2C12 cell proliferation. Transcriptomic and qRT-PCR analysis showed that Ccl2, Ccl7, Ccl8, and C3 are potential downstream regulators of ERK signaling that promote C2C12 cell proliferation. Knockdown of Ccl7 revealed that irisin upregulates chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 (CCL7) and subsequently promotes C2C12 cell proliferation. These results suggest that irisin promotes C2C12 myoblast proliferation via ERK-dependent CCL7 upregulation and may aid in understanding how irisin contributes to muscle development."
https://openalex.org/W2972697698,"Background Hyperhidrosis is a pathological condition defined by excessive sweating beyond thermoregulatory physiological needs, which can cause substantial psychological impact and impairment of daily activities. Studies regarding its prevalence, however, are scarce and vary widely in their findings. The population of medical students is a particularly interesting subset for its recurring demand of physical contact during patient examination or procedures, and the potential for professional adversity. We aimed at furthering the comprehension of this disease prevalence and characteristics among medical students. Methods Questionnaires inquiring about the presence and characteristics of Primary Hyperhidrosis (PH) were applied through either written or digital means to all eligible medical students enrolled in three Medical Schools in the State of Rio de Janeiro who agreed to take part in the study. Demographic data regarding gender, ethnicity, current age, weight and height was collected in addition to clinical data (sweat site, age of onset, familial history, severity and previous treatments). Severity was evaluated through the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) and a symptoms survey. Findings Our response rate was roughly 1/3 of all eligible students (900/2700). PH prevalence was 20.56% (185/900). It was similar between men and women (23.08% and 19.41%, respectively) and strongly associated with family history of the disease (Prevalence Ratio of 4.27). Regarding ethnicity, of the total sample 73.78% (664/900) self-declared white, among which 19.28% (128/664) had PH. Mixed-race and other ethnicities encompassed 26.22% (236/900) of the sample, among which 24.15% (57/236) had PH. Most positive subjects (64.32%) presented associated forms of PH. Overall involvement of each site (both associated and isolated) was: 63.78% axillary, 50.81% palmar, 43.24% plantar, 20.54% craniofacial, 18.38% facial flushing and 2.16% gustatory sweating. Mean current age was 23.11(±4.04) years for PH patients, and age of onset was ≤18 years in 93.94% of cases. Regarding body mass index (BMI), 71.09% of PH patients had BMI<25kg/m2 and only 4.69% presented BMI≥30kg/m2, none ≥35kg/m2. Some degree of life quality impairment was reported by 89.20% of PH patients, and 23.89% had HDSS 3 or 4 (moderate to severe). Conclusions PH prevalence among Rio de Janeiro medical students was 20.56%, similar between men and women, predominating associated presentations, axillary, palmar and plantar sites, strong familial history, age of onset before 18 years, and some degree of life impairment."

Here we found that the single isoleucine residue I490 in Rj2 is required for induction of symbiotic incompatibility. Furthermore, we investigated the geographical distribution of the Rj2-genotype soybean in a large set of germplasm by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping using a SNP marker for I490. By allelic comparison of 79 accessions in the Japanese soybean mini-core collection, we suggest substitution of a single amino acid residue (R490 to I490) in Rj2 induces symbiotic incompatibility with Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 122. The importance of I490 was verified by complementation of rj2-soybean by the dominant allele encoding the Rj2 protein containing I490 residue. The Rj2 allele was also found in Glycine soja, the wild progenitor of G. max, and their single amino acid polymorphisms were associated with the Rj2-nodulation phenotype. By SNP genotyping against 1583 soybean accessions, we detected the Rj2-genotype in 5.4% of G. max and 7.7% of G. soja accessions. Distribution of the Rj2-genotype soybean plants was relatively concentrated in the temperate Asian region. These results provide important information about the mechanism of host genotype-specific symbiotic incompatibility mediated by host immunity and suggest that the Rj2 gene has been maintained by environmental conditions during the process of soybean domestication."

In addition to its role in allergy and asthma, the role of Crth2 in the resolution of inflammation, to mediate the proresolving functions of endogenous CyPGs, is not well understood. We investigated the regulation of LPS or zymosan-induced inflammatory response by signals from the Crth2 receptor in macrophages that lack Crth2 expression [knockout (KO)]. Increased expression of proinflammatory genes, including Tnf-α, was observed in Crth2 KO cells. Targeting the endogenous biosynthetic pathway of CyPGs with indomethacin or HQL79, which inhibit cyclooxygenases or hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase, respectively, or use of Crth2 antagonists recapitulated the proinflammatory phenotype as in Crth2 KO cells. Ligand-dependent activation of Crth2 by 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin D2 increased Ca2+ influx through store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) accompanied by the up-regulation of stromal interaction molecule 1 and calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1 expression, suggesting that the proresolution effects of CyPG-dependent activation of SOCE could be mediated by Crth2 during inflammation. Interestingly, Crth2 signaling down-regulated the Ca2+-regulated heat stable protein 1 that stabilizes Tnf-α mRNA via the increased expression of microRNA 155 to dampen inflammatory responses triggered through the TNF-α-NF-κB axis. In summary, these studies present a novel regulatory role for Crth2 during inflammatory response in macrophages.-Diwakar, B.

This study evaluated a multi-component school-based intervention (Y-PATH: Youth-Physical Activity Towards Health), focused on halting the age-related decline in physical activity of youth in early adolescence. A cluster randomized controlled trial in 20 post primary schools (10 control, 10 intervention) was conducted. Data were collected from all 20 schools at baseline (2013), and 12 months (2014), and from 10 of these schools (5 intervention) at 24 months (2015). The setting was mixed gender post primary schools residing in the greater area of Dublin, Ireland. Principals from each school were asked to nominate one first year class group attending their school in September 2013 to participate in the study (N = 564). Intervention schools implemented the Y-PATH whole school intervention, comprising teacher component, parent component, and PE component; while control schools continued with usual care. The main outcome measure was accelerometer derived average minutes of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Data were analysed from October 2015 –November 2017. At baseline 490 participants were assessed (mean age 12.78y ± .42). Results of the multilevel regression analysis confirmed that there was a significant time intervention effect, and this was predominantly contributed by the difference between control and intervention groups within females. Findings support the case for national dissemination of the Y-PATH intervention so that the knowledge learned can be translated to routine practice in schools."
https://openalex.org/W2972352366,"In social animals, scent secretions and marking behaviors play critical roles in communication, including intraspecific signals, such as identifying individuals and group membership, as well as interspecific signaling. Anal sacs are an important odor producing organ found across the carnivorans (species in the mammalian Order Carnivora). Secretions from the anal sac may be used as chemical signals by animals for behaviors ranging from defense to species recognition to signaling reproductive status. In addition, a recent study suggests that domestic cats utilize short-chain free fatty acids in anal sac secretions for individual recognition. The fermentation hypothesis is the idea that symbiotic microorganisms living in association with animals contribute to odor profiles used in chemical communication and that variation in these chemical signals reflects variation in the microbial community. Here we examine the fermentation hypothesis by characterizing volatile organic compounds (VOC) and bacteria isolated from anal sac secretions collected from a male Bengal cat (Felis catus × Prionailurus bengalensis), a cross between the domestic cat and the leopard cat. Both left and right anal sacs of a male Bengal cat were manually expressed (emptied) and collected. Half of the material was used to culture bacteria or to extract bacterial DNA and the other half was used for VOC analysis. DNA was extracted from the anal sac secretions and used for a 16S rRNA gene PCR amplification and sequencing based characterization of the microbial community. Additionally, some of the material was plated out in order to isolate bacterial colonies. Three taxa (Bacteroides fragilis, Tessaracoccus, and Finegoldia magna) were relatively abundant in the 16S rRNA gene sequence data and also isolated by culturing. Using Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we tentatively identified 52 compounds from the Bengal cat anal sac secretions and 67 compounds from cultures of the three bacterial isolates chosen for further analysis. Among 67 compounds tentatively identified from bacterial isolates, 51 were also found in the anal sac secretion. We show that the bacterial community in the anal sac consists primarily of only a few abundant taxa and that isolates of these taxa produce numerous volatiles that are found in the combined anal sac volatile profile. Several of these volatiles are found in anal sac secretions from other carnivorans, and are also associated with known bacterial biosynthesis pathways. This is consistent with the fermentation hypothesis and the possibility that the anal sac is maintained at least in part to house bacteria that produce volatiles for the host."
https://openalex.org/W2972375238,"The evidence on the factors associated with childhood bloody diarrhea in developing countries in general and India, in particular, is somewhat limited. Our study, therefore, examines-the prevalence of bloody diarrhea; the magnitude of treatment of bloody diarrhea (use of both oral rehydration and antibiotics (pills, syrups, and injections)); and several other associated factors with bloody diarrhea in the youngest children under five years in the Indian context.We used data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 conducted in 2015-16. We used a multivariable binary logistic regression model to identify the factors associated with bloody diarrhea. We also applied a multinomial logistic regression model to identify associated factors with the treatment of bloody diarrhea amongst the youngest children below five years.The overall prevalence of bloody diarrhea in the youngest children was about 9 percent in the last two weeks preceding the survey. There was a significant difference in the mean age of those children having bloody diarrhea and watery diarrhea during the same period. Children whose stools were disposed of unsafely and those who belonged to households with neither a place nor water for washing hands were more likely to suffer from bloody diarrhea compared to their counterparts with these facilities. About a little less than one-fifth of the youngest children (16%) received adequate treatment of bloody diarrhea. The treatment of bloody diarrhea was associated with the health facility and maternal and children's socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.The study shows that household environmental risk factors are important predictors of bloody diarrhea amongst the youngest children. Still, 28% of those children did not receive any treatment of bloody diarrhea in India. There is also a clear need to promote the practice of safe disposal of children's stools and handwashing among mothers and children. Mothers need to be sensitized about the necessity of an immediate visit to a health facility/center in case of bloody diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W2972387424,"Productive replication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) during the lytic cycle occurs in discrete sites within nuclei, termed replication compartments. We previously proposed that replication compartments consist of two subnuclear domains: ""ongoing replication foci"" and ""BMRF1-cores"". Viral genome replication takes place in ongoing replication foci, which are enriched with viral replication proteins, such as BALF5 and BALF2. Amplified DNA and BMRF1 protein accumulate in BMRF1-cores, which are surrounded by ongoing replication foci. We here determined the locations of procapsid and genome-packaging proteins of EBV via three-dimensional (3D) surface reconstruction and correlative fluorescence microscopy-electron microscopy (FM-EM). The results revealed that viral factors required for DNA packaging, such as BGLF1, BVRF1, and BFLF1 proteins, are located in the innermost subdomains of the BMRF1-cores. In contrast, capsid structural proteins, such as BBRF1, BORF1, BDLF1, and BVRF2, were found both outside and inside the BMRF1-cores. Based on these observations, we propose a model in which viral procapsids are assembled outside the BMRF1-cores and subsequently migrate therein, where viral DNA encapsidation occurs. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing capsid assembly sites in relation to EBV replication compartments."

https://openalex.org/W2972784310,"The mammalian CLOCK:BMAL1 transcription factor complex and its coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 and mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) critically regulate circadian transcription and chromatin modification. Circadian oscillations are regulated by interactions of BMAL1's C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) with the KIX domain of CBP/p300 (activating) and with the clock protein CRY1 (repressing) as well as by the BMAL1 G-region preceding the TAD. Circadian acetylation of Lys537 within the G-region enhances repressive BMAL1-TAD-CRY1 interactions. Here, we characterized the interaction of the CBP-KIX domain with BMAL1 proteins, including the BMAL1-TAD, parts of the G-region, and Lys537 Tethering the small compound 1-10 in the MLL-binding pocket of the CBP-KIX domain weakened BMAL1 binding, and MLL1-bound KIX did not form a ternary complex with BMAL1, indicating that the MLL-binding pocket is important for KIX-BMAL1 interactions. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) models of BMAL1 and BMAL1:KIX complexes revealed that the N-terminal BMAL1 G-region including Lys537 forms elongated extensions emerging from the bulkier BMAL1-TAD:KIX core complex. Fitting high-resolution KIX domain structures into the SAXS-derived envelopes suggested that the G-region emerges near the MLL-binding pocket, further supporting a role of this pocket in BMAL1 binding. Additionally, mutations in the second CREB-pKID/c-Myb-binding pocket of the KIX domain moderately impacted BMAL1 binding. The BMAL1(K537Q) mutation mimicking Lys537 acetylation, however, did not affect the KIX-binding affinity, in contrast to its enhancing effect on CRY1 binding. Our results significantly advance the mechanistic understanding of the protein interaction networks controlling CLOCK:BMAL1- and CBP-dependent gene regulation in the mammalian circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W2972814062,"Does music penetrate cultural differences with its ability to evoke emotion? The ragas of Hindustani music are specific sequences of notes that elicit various emotions: happy, romantic, devotion, calm, angry, longing, tension and sad. They can be presented in two modes, alaap and gat, which differ in rhythm, but match in tonality. Participants from Indian and Non-Indian cultures (N = 144 and 112, respectively) rated twenty-four pieces of Hindustani ragas on eight dimensions of emotion, in a free response task. Of the 192 between-group comparisons, ratings differed in only 9% of the instances, showing universality across multiple musical emotions. Robust regression analyses and machine learning methods revealed tonality best explained emotion ratings for Indian participants whereas rhythm was the primary predictor in Non-Indian listeners. Our results provide compelling evidence for universality in emotions in the auditory domain in the realm of musical emotion, driven by distinct acoustic features that depend on listeners' cultural backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2972746861,"The genus Amphitetranychus Oudemans (Tetranychidae) consists of only three species, A. quercivorus (Ehara & Gotoh), A. savenkoae (Reck) and A. viennensis (Zacher). The original description of A. savenkoae was extremely simple and had no drawing of the aedeagus; however, a subsequent study described only the aedeagus. The present study investigated all three species in detail using a combination of morphological traits, crossbreeding experiments, esterase zymograms and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Morphological differences in the peritremes and male aedeagi were observed among the three species. Complete reproductive isolation was confirmed in the reciprocal crosses between the morphologically similar A. savenkoae and A. quercivorus (no female offspring were produced). Esterase zymograms differed interspecifically, but not intraspecifically (among individuals in a given species). All three species formed clearly separate clades with 100% bootstrap values in the COI tree, and A. savenkoae was more closely related to A. quercivorus than to A. viennensis, which corresponded to the morphological similarity of their aedeagi and setal counts on tarsi IV. A key to Amphitetranychus species is provided."
https://openalex.org/W2972964436,"It has been reported that lateral gene transfer (LGT) events among Mycobacteroides abscessus strains are prevalent. The hsp65 gene, a chronometer gene for bacterial phylogenetic analysis, is resistant to LGT events, particularly among mycobacterial strains, rendering the hsp65-targeting method the most widely used method for mycobacterial detection. To determine the prevalence of M. abscessus strains that are subject to hsp65 LGT, we applied rpoB typing to 100 clinically isolated Korean strains of M. abscessus that had been identified by hsp65 sequence analysis. The analysis indicated the presence of 2 rough strains, showing a discrepancy between the 2 typing methods. MLST analysis based on the partial sequencing of seven housekeeping genes, erm(41) PCR and further hsp65 PCR-restriction enzyme and polymorphism analysis (PRA) were conducted to identify the two strains. The MLST results showed that the two strains belong to M. abscessus subsp. massiliense and not to M. abscessus subsp. abscessus, as indicated by the rpoB-based analysis, suggesting that their hsp65 genes are subject to LGT from M. abscessus subsp. abscessus. Further analysis of these strains using the hsp65 PRA method indicated that these strains possess a PRA pattern identical to that of M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and distinct from that of M. abscessus subsp. massiliense. In conclusion, we identified two M. abscessus subsp. massiliense rough strains from Korean patients with hsp65 genes that might be laterally transferred from M. abscessus subsp. abscessus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of possible LGT events associated with the hsp65 gene in mycobacteria. Our results also suggest that there is the potential for misidentification when the hsp65-based protocol is used for mycobacterial identification."
https://openalex.org/W2972682327,"Frequently, in rugby, players incorporate deceptive motions (e.g., a side-step) in order to pass their opponent. Previous works showed that expert defenders are more efficient in detecting deceptive motions. Performance was shown to be correlated with the evolution of the center of gravity of the attacker, suggesting that experts may rely on global motion cues. This study aims at investigating whether a representation of center of gravity can be useful for training purposes, by using this representation alone or by combining it with the local motion cues given by body parts. We designed an experiment in virtual reality to control the motion cues available to the defenders. Sixteen healthy participants (seven experts and nine novices) acted as defenders while a virtual attacker approached. Participants completed two separate tasks. The first was a time occlusion perception task, occlusion after 100ms, 200ms or 300ms after the initial change in direction, thereafter participants indicated the passing direction of the attacker. The second was a perception-action task, participants were instructed to intercept the oncoming attacker by displacing medio-laterally. The attacker performed either a non-deceptive motion, directly toward the final passing direction or a deceptive motion, initially toward a false direction before quickly reorienting to the true direction. There was a main effect of expertise, appearance, cut off times and motion on correct responses during both tasks. There was an interaction between visual appearance and expertise, and between motion type and expertise during the perception task, however, this interaction was not present during the perception-action task. We observed that experts maintained superiority in the perception of deceptive motion; however when the visual appearance is reduced to global motion alone the difference between novices and experts is reduced. We further explore the interactions and discuss the effects observed for the visual appearance and expertise."
https://openalex.org/W2972847139,"Complexation of microbial polymer in soluble state could impact the solubility, mobility, and bioavailability of heavy metals in the environment. The complexation of a bacterial exopolymer, poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), with Pb2+ was studied using the polarographic method and circular dichroism measurement in soluble state. The number of available binding sites was determined based on the Chau’s method and was found to be 0.04, 1.12, 3.56 and 4.51 mmol/(g dry weight of γ-PGA) at pH 3.4, 4.2, 5.0 and 6.2, respectively. Further, the number of binding sites was determined based on the Ruzic’s method and was found to be 3.60 and 4.41 mmol/(g dry weight of γ-PGA) for pH 5.0 and 6.2, respectively. The constant (expressed as log K) values were 5.8 and 6.0 at pH 5.0 and 6.2. Compared to biopolymers secreted by other microorganisms, such as extracellular polymeric substances extraction from activated sludge, γ-PGA was a more efficient Pb2+ carrier from pH 5.0 to 6.2. The secondary structure of γ-PGA varied significantly when Pb2+ added. Ca2+ or Mg2+ replace a portion of the adsorbed Pb2+. However, the portion of Pb2+ involved in changing the γ-PGA conformation was not easily replaced by Ca2+ and Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W2973190592,"The present study aimed to develop a denoising convolutional neural network metal artifact reduction hybrid reconstruction (DnCNN-MARHR) algorithm for decreasing metal objects in digital tomosynthesis (DT) for arthroplasty by using projection data. For metal artifact reduction (MAR), we implemented a DnCNN-MARHR algorithm based on a training network (mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithm with momentum) to estimate the residual reference (140 keV virtual monochromatic [VM]) and object (70 kV with metal artifacts) images. For this, we used projection data and subtracted the estimated residual images from the object images, involving hybrid and subjectively reconstructed image usage (back projection and maximum likelihood expectation maximization [MLEM]). The DnCNN-MARHR algorithm was compared with the dual-energy material decomposition reconstruction algorithm (DEMDRA), VM, MLEM, established and commonly used filtered back projection (FBP), and a simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique-total variation (SART-TV) with MAR processing. MAR was compared using artifact index (AI) and texture analysis. Artifact spread functions (ASFs) for images that were out-of-plane and in-focus were evaluated using a prosthesis phantom. The overall performance of the DnCNN-MARHR algorithm was adequate with regard to the ASF, and the derived images showed better results, without being influenced by the metal type (AI was almost equal to the best value for the DEMDRA). In the ASF analysis, the DnCNN-MARHR algorithm generated better MAR compared with that obtained employing usual algorithms for reconstruction using MAR processing. In addition, comparison of the difference (mean square error) between DnCNN-MARHR and the conventional algorithm resulted in the smallest VM. The DnCNN-MARHR algorithm showed the best performance with regard to image homogeneity in the texture analysis. The proposed algorithm is particularly useful for reducing artifacts in the longitudinal direction, and it is not affected by tissue misclassification."

Using this method, 2 μg DNA was sufficient for library preparation for whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, the method is simple and makes use of a commercial kit, with additional step of concentrating the captured library by ethanol precipitation. The accuracy of the PCR-free method was found to be equivalent to that of unique molecular identifier-corrected analysis method, which is the commonly used method to detect rare mutations. Thus, the PCR-free whole exome sequencing method is cost-effective as well as efficient in detecting rare mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2973143066,"The size-weight illusion (SWI) pertains to the experience of perceiving the smaller of two equally weighted objects as heavier. Competing theories to explain the illusion can be generally grouped into cognitive and sensory theories, which place more importance on top-down processing of cognitive expectations and bottom-up processing of sensory information about the size and weight of objects, respectively. The current study examined the relative contribution of these two general explanations. This was done by varying the amounts of cognitive load in a dual-task and the quality of somatosensory feedback by wearing or not wearing gloves. Participants placed their hands through a curtain inside a box so they could not see the test objects. Inside the box, they were presented with either a small or large sphere of varying weights, which they explored manually without vision. Participants provided magnitude estimates about each object's weight in four experimental conditions (no-load with gloves, no-load without gloves, low-load without gloves, and high-load without gloves). The dual-task involved the visual presentation of a cross on a computer monitor that changed in both colour and orientation. With foot pedals, the participants responded to a target colour and / or orientation, which varied across conditions, while they hefted an object. Some conditions were designed to be more cognitively taxing than others (high-load > low-load > no-load conditions). The results revealed that the strength of the SWI diminished when participants wore the gloves but did not change as cognitive load increased on the dual-task. We conclude that the illusion is more influenced by bottom-up sensory than top-down cognitive processes."
https://openalex.org/W2972618348,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase (HMGL) is involved in branched-chain amino acid catabolism leading to acetyl-CoA production. Here, using bioinformatics analyses and protein sequence alignments, we found that in Arabidopsis thaliana a single gene encodes two HMGL isoforms differing in size (51 kDa, HMGL51 and 46 kDa, HMGL46). Similar to animal HMGLs, both isoforms comprised a C-terminal type 1 peroxisomal retention motif, and HMGL51 contained a mitochondrial leader peptide. We observed that only a shortened HMGL (35 kDa, HMGL35) is conserved across all kingdoms of life. Most notably, all plant HMGLs also contained a specific N-terminal extension (P100) that is located between the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence TP35 and HMGL35 and is absent in bacteria and other eukaryotes. Interestingly, using HMGL enzyme assays, we found that rather than HMGL46, homodimeric recombinant HMGL35 is the active enzyme catalyzing acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate synthesis when incubated with (S)-HMG-CoA. This suggested that the plant-specific P100 peptide may inactivate HMGL according to specific physiological requirements. Therefore, we investigated whether the P100 peptide in HMGL46 alters its activity, possibly by modifying the HMGL46 structure. We found that induced expression of a cytosolic HMGL35 version in A. thaliana delays germination and leads to rapid wilting and chlorosis in mature plants. Our results suggest that in plants, P100-mediated HMGL inactivation outside of peroxisomes or mitochondria is crucial, protecting against potentially cytotoxic effects of HMGL activity while it transits to these organelles. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase (HMGL) is involved in branched-chain amino acid catabolism leading to acetyl-CoA production.

Particularly in P. mevalonii, HMGL participates in a sequence of catabolic reactions that make the use of mevalonic acid (MVA) as a carbon source possible. In vertebrates, this enzyme is of paramount importance.

It is initiated by β-oxidation of fatty acids that are imported from the blood stream into mitochondria. Generated acetyl-CoA is then converted to HMG-CoA through the action of mitochondrial isoforms of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9) and HMG-CoA synthase (EC 2.3.3.10). Subsequent cleavage of HMG-CoA by HMGL yields acetoacetate, which is used directly or is converted to hydroxybutyrate before exportation again to the blood stream and transport to extrahepatic tissues (29Hegardt F.G.

Thus, alternative functions of HMGL are to be expected. Almost five decades ago, Popják (43Popják G.

It was confirmed that this shunt operates in vertebrates (44Edmond J. Popják G. Transfer of carbon atoms from mevalonate to n-fatty acids.J. Biol.

Under such conditions, produced acetyl-CoA can be reoriented to fatty acid biosynthesis. Hence, there is some strong evidence that this not well-characterized enzyme HMGL has a larger range of functions than just amino acid catabolism.

The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) reports on multiple splice variants in Arabidopsis apparently coding for various isoforms (locus AT2G26800). Here, we show that all corresponding proteins possess, as a component, a domain with unknown function specific to plants when compared with functionally identical enzymes from other organisms. Our study aimed to characterize a plant HMGL and its atypical primary protein structure and provide answers for a raison d’être of this plant distinctiveness. Using an in vitro fluorometric assay, it had already been confirmed that the single A. thaliana gene locus 2039548 (At2g26800) encodes an enzyme producing acetyl-CoA (42Lu Y. Savage L.J.

The molecular masses of these predicted proteins were calculated. Accordingly, a 46,386-Da protein (HMGL46) should be translated from variant 1, a 50,578-Da protein (HMGL51) is produced from variants 2 and 4, a 39,089-Da protein (HMGL39) is translated from variant 3, and finally a 41,393-Da protein (HMGL41) is the product of variant 5. To identify functional HMGL domains, we aligned these putative protein sequences with the well-characterized full-length human HMGL1 (Fig. 1). A highly conserved main core protein (of about 31 kDa) displays strong homologies with the human protein (positions 163–459; Fig. 1). At this stage, it can be hypothesized that this truncated protein corresponds to the active enzyme, which does not seem to be synthesized as such but is rather the product of post-translational proteolytic processing. Alignments show that HMGL39 lacks at the C-terminal part of the protein that play crucial roles in the catalytic activity of the human HMGL (Fig. 1). Thus, only proteins including the C-terminal end “ADASKI” sequence are considered in this study. Moreover, here we focused mainly on two protein variants, HMGL51 and HMGL46, diverging by the length of their nonconserved N termini. Multiple subcellular localization prediction programs were applied to identify possible targeting functions in the plant HMGL (Table S1). HMGL51 contains a putative mitochondrial transit peptide (35 amino acids; PT35) at its N terminus but also has a putative topogenic signal SKL-like motif (SKI) for import into peroxisomes (PTS1; see Ref. 53Hu J. Baker A. Bartel B. Linka N. Mullen R.T. Reumann S. Zolman B.K. Plant peroxisomes: biogenesis and function.Plant Cell. 2012; 24 (22669882): 2279-230310.1105/tpc.112.096586Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) at its C-terminal extremity (Figure 1, Figure 2). HMGL46, the protein product of At2g26800.1, lacks PT35 localized at the N-terminal site of the full-length HMGL51 (Fig. 2). In addition, compared with human HMGL1, HMGL46 comprises a 128-amino-acid N-terminal extension also present in the full-length HMGL51 protein (Figure 1, Figure 2). Further alignments showed a preservation of this extension in all full-length plant HMGL proteins that have been analyzed (Fig. S1). A BLAST data bank search was performed, but no similar sequence or representative of a defined counterpart could be identified. Furthermore, attempts to construct a three-dimensional structural model for HMGL46 or HMGL51 failed to identify any homologous sequence, which would give a clue on the function of this peptide (Fig. S2A).

https://openalex.org/W2972938833,"Cellular DNA is daily exposed to several damaging agents causing a plethora of DNA lesions. As a first aid to restore DNA integrity, several enzymes got specialized in damage recognition and lesion removal during the process called base excision repair (BER). A large number of DNA damage types and several different readers of nucleic acids lesions during BER pathway as well as two sub-pathways were considered in the definition of a model using the Petri net framework. The intuitive graphical representation in combination with precise mathematical analysis methods are the strong advantages of the Petri net-based representation of biological processes and make Petri nets a promising approach for modeling and analysis of human BER. The reported results provide new information that will aid efforts to characterize in silico knockouts as well as help to predict the sensitivity of the cell with inactivated repair proteins to different types of DNA damage. The results can also help in identifying the by-passing pathways that may lead to lack of pronounced phenotypes associated with mutations in some of the proteins. This knowledge is very useful when DNA damage-inducing drugs are introduced for cancer therapy, and lack of DNA repair is desirable for tumor cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2972858054,"Magnetic loops are one of the most popular and used traffic sensors because of their widely extended technology and simple mode of operation. Nevertheless, very simple models have been traditionally used to simulate the effect of the passage of vehicles on these loops. In general, vehicles have been considered simple rectangular metal plates located parallel to the ground plane at a certain height close to the vehicle chassis. However, with such a simple model, it is not possible to carry out a rigorous study to assess the performance of different models of vehicles with the aim of obtaining basic parameters such as the vehicle type, its speed or its direction in traffic. For this reason and because computer simulation and analysis have emerged as a priority in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), this paper aims to present a more complex vehicle model capable of characterizing vehicles as multiple metal plates of different sizes and heights, which will provide better results in virtual simulation environments. This type of modeling will be useful when reproducing the actual behavior of systems installed on roads based on inductive loops and will also facilitate vehicle classification and the extraction of basic traffic parameters."
