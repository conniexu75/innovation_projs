https://openalex.org/W2093723806,"Rho GTPases regulate the transcription factor SRF via their ability to induce actin polymerization. SRF activity responds to G actin, but the mechanism of this has remained unclear. We show that Rho-actin signaling regulates the subcellular localization of the myocardin-related SRF coactivator MAL, rearranged in t(1;22)(p13;q13) AML. The MAL-SRF interaction displays the predicted properties of a Rho-regulated SRF cofactor. MAL is predominantly cytoplasmic in serum-starved cells, but accumulates in the nucleus following serum stimulation. Activation of the Rho-actin signaling pathway is necessary and sufficient to promote MAL nuclear accumulation. MAL N-terminal sequences, including two RPEL motifs, are required for the response to signaling, while other regions mediate its nuclear export (or cytoplasmic retention) and nuclear import. MAL associates with unpolymerized actin through its RPEL motifs. Constitutively cytoplasmic MAL derivatives interfere with MAL redistribution and Rho-actin signaling to SRF. MAL associates with several SRF target promoters regulated via the Rho-actin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2124938253,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a major cellular defense against the carcinogenic effects of ultraviolet light from the sun. Mutational inactivation of NER proteins, like DDB and CSA, leads to hereditary diseases such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS). Here, we show that DDB2 and CSA are each integrated into nearly identical complexes via interaction with DDB1. Both complexes contain cullin 4A and Roc1 and display ubiquitin ligase activity. They also contain the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a known regulator of cullin-based ubiquitin ligases. Strikingly, CSN differentially regulates ubiquitin ligase activity of the DDB2 and CSA complexes in response to UV irradiation. Knockdown of CSN with RNA interference leads to defects in NER. These results suggest that the distinct UV response of the DDB2 and CSA complexes is involved in diverse mechanisms of NER."

https://openalex.org/W2031112533,"During limb development, coordinated expression of several Hoxd genes is required in presumptive digits. We searched for the underlying control sequences upstream from the cluster and found Lunapark (Lnp), a gene which shares limb and CNS expression specificities with both Hoxd genes and Evx2, another gene located nearby. We used a targeted enhancer-trap approach to identify a DNA segment capable of directing reporter gene expression in both digits and CNS, following Lnp, Evx2, and Hoxd-specific patterns. This DNA region showed an unusual interspecies conservation, including with its pufferfish counterpart. It contains a cluster of global enhancers capable of controlling transcription of several genes unrelated in structure or function, thus defining large regulatory domains. These domains were interrupted in the Ulnaless mutation, a balanced inversion that modified the topography of the locus. We discuss the heuristic value of these results in term of locus specific versus gene-specific regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2149351866,"The multi-subunit NADPH oxidase complex plays a crucial role in host defense against microbial infection through the production of reactive oxygen species. Activation of the NADPH oxidase requires the targeting of a cytoplasmic p40-p47-p67(phox) complex to the membrane bound heterodimeric p22-gp91(phox) flavocytochrome. This interaction is prevented in the resting state due to an auto-inhibited conformation of p47(phox). The X-ray structure of the auto-inhibited form of p47(phox) reveals that tandem SH3 domains function together to maintain the cytoplasmic complex in an inactive form. Further structural and biochemical data show that phosphorylation of p47(phox) activates a molecular switch that relieves the inhibitory intramolecular interaction. This permits p47(phox) to interact with the cytoplasmic tail of p22(phox) and initiate formation of the active, membrane bound enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W2060717870,"The p53 tumor suppressor belongs to a family of proteins that sense multiple cellular inputs to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Whether and how these functions of p53 intersect with the activity of extracellular growth factors is not understood. Here, we report that key cellular responses to TGF-β signals rely on p53 family members. During Xenopus embryonic development, p53 promotes the activation of multiple TGF-β target genes. Moreover, mesoderm differentiation is inhibited in p53-depleted embryos. In mammalian cells, the full transcriptional activation of the CDK inhibitor p21WAF1 by TGF-β requires p53. p53-deficient cells display an impaired cytostatic response to TGF-β signals. Smad and p53 protein complexes converge on separate cis binding elements on a target promoter and synergistically activate TGF-β induced transcription. p53 can physically interact in vivo with Smad2 in a TGF-β-dependent fashion. The results unveil a previously unrecognized link between two primary tumor suppressor pathways in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2051343147,"Reactive oxygen species, especially hydrogen peroxide, are important in cellular signal transduction. However, excessive amounts of these species damage tissues and cells by oxidizing virtually all important biomolecules. Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) (also called antioxidant protein 2, or AOP2) is a novel peroxiredoxin family member whose function <i>in vivo</i> is unknown. Through immunohistochemistry, we have determined that the PRDX6 protein was widely expressed in every tissue examined, most abundantly in epithelial cells. It was found in cytosol, but not in membranes, organelles, and nuclei fractions. <i>Prdx6</i> mRNA was also expressed in every tissue examined. The widespread expression of <i>Prdx6</i> suggested that its functions were quite important. To determine these functions, we generated <i>Prdx6</i>-targeted mutant (<i>Prdx6</i><sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup><sup>)</sup> mice, confirmed the gene disruption by Southern blots, PCR, RT-PCR, Western blots, and immunohistochemistry, and compared the effects of paraquat, hydrogen peroxide, and <i>t</i>-butyl hydroperoxide on <i>Prdx6</i><sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> and wild-type (<i>Prdx6</i><sup>+</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>+</sup>) macrophages, and of paraquat on <i>Prdx6</i><sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> and <i>Prdx6</i><sup>+</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>+</sup> mice. <i>Prdx6</i><sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> macrophages had higher hydrogen peroxide levels, and lower survival rates; <i>Prdx6</i><sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> mice had significantly lower survival rates, more severe tissue damage, and higher protein oxidation levels. Additionally, there were no differences in the mRNA expression levels of other peroxiredoxins, glutathione peroxidases, catalase, superoxide dismutases, thioredoxins, and glutaredoxins between normal <i>Prdx6</i><sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> and <i>Prdx6</i><sup>+</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>+</sup> mice and those injected with paraquat. Our study provides <i>in vivo</i> evidence that PRDX6 is a unique non-redundant antioxidant that functions independently of other peroxiredoxins and antioxidant proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1967534538,"Like naturally occurring neuronal cell death, stereotyped pruning of long axon branches to temporary targets is a widespread regressive phenomenon in the developing mammalian brain that helps sculpt the pattern of neuronal connections. The mechanisms controlling stereotyped pruning are, however, poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that semaphorins, activating the Plexin-A3 receptor, function as retraction inducers to trigger-stereotyped pruning of specific hippocampal mossy fiber and pyramidal axon branches. Both pruning events are defective in Plexin-A3 mutants, reflecting a cell-autonomous requirement for Plexin-A3. The distribution of mRNAs for Sema3F and Sema3A makes them candidates for triggering the pruning. In vitro, hippocampal neurons respond to semaphorins by retracting axon branches. These results implicate semaphorins as retraction inducers controlling stereotyped pruning in the mammalian brain."

https://openalex.org/W2062867942,"Specialized gene expression programs are induced by signaling pathways that act on transcription factors. Whether these transcription factors can function in multiple developmental programs through a global switch in promoter selection is not known. We have used genome-wide location analysis to show that the yeast Ste12 transcription factor, which regulates mating and filamentous growth, is bound to distinct program-specific target genes dependent on the developmental condition. This condition-dependent distribution of Ste12 requires concurrent binding of the transcription factor Tec1 during filamentation and is differentially regulated by the MAP kinases Fus3 and Kss1. Program-specific distribution across the genome may be a general mechanism by which transcription factors regulate distinct gene expression programs in response to signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2080106089,"TRPC1, a component of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) channels, is assembled in a complex with caveolin-1 (Cav1) and key Ca2+ signaling proteins. This study examines the role of Cav1 in the function of TRPC1. TRPC1 and Cav1 were colocalized in the plasma membrane region of human submandibular gland and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Full-length Cav1 bound to both the N and C termini of TRPC1. Amino acids 271–349, which includes a Cav1 binding motif (amino acids 322–349), was identified as the Cav1 binding domain in the TRPC1 N terminus. Deletion of amino acids 271–349 or 322–349 prevented plasma membrane localization of TRPC1. Importantly, TRPC1Δ271–349 induced a dominant suppression of SOCE and was associated with wild-type TRPC1. Although the role of the C-terminal Cav1 binding domain is not known, its deletion did not affect localization of TRPC1 (Singh, B. B., Liu, X., and Ambudkar, I. S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 36483–36486). Further, expression of a truncated Cav1 (Cav1Δ51-169), but not full-length Cav1, similarly disrupted plasma membrane localization of endogenously and exogenously expressed TRPC1 in human submandibular gland and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Cav1Δ51–169 also suppressed thapsigarginand carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ influx and increased the detergent solubility of TRPC1, although plasma membrane lipid raft domains were not disrupted. These data demonstrate that plasma membrane localization of TRPC1 depends on an interaction between its N terminus and Cav1.

Although there is considerable evidence to suggest that the signal for the activation of SOCE is the depletion of Ca2+ within the endoplasmic reticulum (1Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism involved in activation or inactivation of SOCE is not yet known. A major drawback in understanding the mechanism of SOCE has been the lack of information regarding the identity and regulation of the SOCE channel. Members of the TRPC protein family have been suggested as molecular components of the SOCE channel (2Minke B. Cook B. Physiol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), TRPC1 and TRPC3 are assembled in signaling complexes that are associated with Cav1 and key Ca2+ signaling proteins such as Gαq/11, inositol trisphosphate receptor, phospholipase Cβ, PMCA (plasma membrane Ca2+ pump), SERCA (sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump), and calmodulin (13Lockwich T.P.

INAD binds to a number of proteins in the complex and determines its localization in the rhabdomeres (4Montell C. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/90/re1)PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li H.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the components of this signalplex appear to be trafficked independently to the plasma membrane, and interaction with INAD is required for their retention at that location. Although several mammalian PDZ domain-containing proteins have been shown to act as scaffolds for receptor-associated signaling complexes in the plasma membrane (16Suh P.-G. Hwang J.-I. Ryu S.H. Donowitz M. Kim J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), little is known about the organization of TRPC channels in mammalian cells (17Venkatachalam K. van Rossaum D.B. Patterson R.L.

However, the C-terminal PDZ domain binding motif found in TRPC4 is absent in TRPC1. Thus, the molecular component(s) involved in the assembly of the TRPC1-associated protein complex is not yet known. In recent years, much evidence has emerged which demonstrates that key molecules involved in Ca2+ signaling are associated with caveolar lipid rafts, thus implicating the importance of caveolae in Ca2+ signaling (13Lockwich T.P.

Lipid rafts are detergent-insoluble membrane domains formed by the dynamic clustering of sphingolipids and cholesterol which have been suggested to function as platforms for protein attachment, trafficking, and signaling (23Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 24Simons K. Ikonen E.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). A specialized subset of lipid rafts, called caveolae, contains the cholesterol-binding protein caveolin, which provides a scaffold onto which molecules can concentrate to form signaling complexes at specific microdomains in the plasma membrane. This membrane specification facilitates coordination of incoming and outgoing cellular messages (26Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Our finding that TRPC1 and TRPC3 form complexes with Ca2+ signaling proteins that are associated with caveolar domains strongly suggests that regulation of SOCE occurs within this complex. Consistent with our results, several recent studies show that TRPC1 (30Trevino C.L. Serrano C.J. Beltran C. Felix R. Darszon A.

In addition, integrity of the caveolar lipid domain is critical for SOCE and TRPC1 function (13Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Our data demonstrate that Cav1 regulates the plasma membrane localization of TRPC1 by binding to a site on its N terminus. Deletion of the Cav1 binding site in TRPC1 disrupts routing of TRPC1 to the plasma membrane and also suppresses SOCE. Together with our previous studies showing that TRPC1 is a component of SOCE channels (9Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Weller R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Reagents—4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), leupeptin, and pepstatin A were from Roche Applied Science, dithiothreitol was from Calbiochem, and aprotinin was from Sigma. Both the peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody used for Western blotting and the high affinity rat anti-HA antibody used for immunofluorescence were from Roche Applied Science. The pEGFP-C3 vector and Living Colors (anti-YFP and anti-GFP) monoclonal antibody (JL-8) were from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). Cholera toxin subunit B, Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). HA-conjugated affinity matrix beads was from Babco (Richmond, CA). Anti-FLAG antibody and affinity-agarose gel were from Sigma. Plasmid Construction—The YFP-Cav1 plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Junji Nishimura (Kyushu University, Fukoka, Japan). The YFP-Cav1Δ51–169 plasmid was constructed from the full-length YFP-Cav1 by PCR. Two oligonucleotides, 5′-GTCCACACCGTCTGTGACCCACTCTT and 5′-GTTGACCAGGTCGATCTCCTTGGTGTG, were used to amplify from the YFP-Cav1 to construct an N-terminal YFPfusion, truncated fragment of Cav1 of about 5.1 kb using Takara Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Panvera, Madison, WI). The 3′-AT overhangs of the fragment were blunt ended using T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and religated using a Rapid Ligation Kit (Roche Applied Science). The original YFP-Cav1 and religated YFP-Cav1Δ51–169 plasmids were subsequently used to transform Escherichia coli, individual clones were selected, and the insert was confirmed by sequencing from both directions prior to transfection of cells. The GFP-Cav1 plasmid was constructed by amplifying the hCav-1 gene using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CTCGAGATGTCTGGGGGCAAATACGTAGACTCG and 5′-GGTACCAATATTTCTTTCTGCAAGTTGATGCGGAC. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and KpnI and cloned in-frame into the pEGFP-C3 vector. The GFP-Cav1 plasmid was used to transform E. coli. Individual clones were selected and sequenced. The two internal deletion TRPC1 plasmids, TRPC1Δ271–349 and TRPC1ΔCΔ271–349 (for details regarding TRPC1ΔC, see Ref. 15Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

The constructs were first amplified separately from two pairs of oligonucleotides: 1) 5′-ATCGATGTTTGGCCAGTCCAGCTCTAATAATG and 2) 5′-CTTCTTACAGGTGGGCTTGCGTCGCCGGGCTAGTTCCTCATAATCATT-CCTGAATTCC; as well as 3) 5′-CGACGCAAGCCCACCTGTAAGAAGATAATG and 4) 5′-GTATACATAAAAAAGAGACGAAGATAACTTAGAAC. The two PCR products, each containing a stretch of overlapping DNA sequence as shown in the above underlined nucleotides, were used as templates for another round of PCR reaction with primers 1 and 4. This last reaction produced a TRPC1 DNA fragment of 0.7 kb with an internal deletion from aa 271 to 349. It was restriction digested with HpaI and Esp3I. The digested fragment was gel cleaned and cloned into either pcDNA3-HA-TRPC1 or pcDNA3-HA-Δtrp1 (15Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

The insert was confirmed by sequencing from both directions prior to transfection of cells.

The two PCR products were manipulated as described above to generate the desired TRPC1 deletion mutant.

Frozen cells were thawed and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, diluted in sucrose buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 0.167 mm pepstatin A, 0.167 mm leupeptin, and centrifuged at 1,600 × g for 15 min to remove the cell debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the lighter cytoplasmic fraction and the heavy membrane fraction. Both fractions were frozen and stored at -80 °C until further use. Where indicated, the cytoplasmic fraction was centrifuged further at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the soluble cytosolic fraction from the light membrane fraction. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay solution. Membranes were solubilized as described earlier (13Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S.

Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting (13Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

All primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1,000 except for the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated HA and FLAG antibodies, which were used at 1:500. Detergent Solubilization of HSG Cell Membranes and Immunoprecipitation—1 mg of membrane fraction was incubated on ice for 20 min with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m KI in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA buffer. The sample was then centrifuged at 4 °C at 125,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of the same buffer as above. Equal amounts of detergent-soluble and -insoluble proteins were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for Western analysis. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with OG + KI solubilized fraction of crude membranes. Antibodies (anti-YFP, anti-HA, and anti-FLAG) were used at 1:200 dilution. Anti-HA- or antiFLAG-conjugated beads were used at a concentration of 50 μl/ml. GST Fusion Protein Pull-down Assay—The N (aa 1–347) and C terminus (649–793) of TRPC1 were cloned into pGEX5.1 (Amersham Biosciences) vector using PCR-based strategy. Two liters each of E. coli (BL-21)-expressing GST-N-TRPC1 and GST-C-TRPC1 were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified as described (11Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). HSG cells expressing YFP-Cav1 or YFP-Cav1Δ51–169, either with or without HA-TRPC1, were harvested as described above. Frozen cells were thawed and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer and sonicated (three times, 10 s each). An equal volume of 2× buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 m KI, 3% OG was added to the cell suspension. Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 145,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. 18 μg of purified GST-N-TRPC1 and 15 μg of GST-C-TRPC1 were incubated for 60 min with 1 mg of OG + KI-solubilized whole cell lysates. Proteins were pulled down with 80 μl of GST beads and washed three times with wash buffer. Proteins were released by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and identified by Western blotting. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—N-TRPC1 (aa 1–347), C-TRPC1 (aa 649–793), and five fragments of the TRPC1 N terminus (ΔN1, aa 1–86; ΔN2, aa 74–153; ΔN3, aa 143–213; ΔN4, aa 204–280; ΔN5, aa 271–349) were cloned into pGBKT7 (GAL4 DNA binding domain; Clontech). Cav1Δ80–169 (with deletion of aa 80–169 of Cav1) was cloned into pGADT7 (GAL4 DNA activation domain; Clontech). Plasmids were used to transform the yeast reporter strain AH 109 (Clontech), which was first grown on minimal synthetic dropout (SD) plates without leucine and tryptophan to select for transformants. Individual clones were further grown on SD plates without leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Clones that grew on SD plates lacking all four amino acids were selected to be positive for protein-protein interaction. A β-galactosidase assay was performed to confirm and quantify the interactions as instructed by the Clontech Matchmaker System. Immunofluorescence—HSG or MDCK cells were plated on coverslips for 1 day. They were then fixed and processed for confocal microscopy as described before (34Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu M.X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For lipid raft labeling, the cholera toxin conjugate was added to cells at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed as described (34Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu M.X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J.

[Ca2+]i Measurements—Fura2 fluorescence in single cells was measured by microfluorometry using a TILL Photonics spectrofluorometer (Polychrome 4, Applied Scientific Instrumentation and TILL Photonics Inc., Eugene, OR) attached to an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope with a Fluor ×40 oil immersion objective. Images were acquired using an enhanced CCD camera (CCD-72, DAGE-MTI) and the MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging Corporation). Analog plots of the fluorescence ratio (340/380) are shown. Interaction of TRPC1 with YFP-Cav1—YFP-Cav1 stably expressed in HSG cells displayed a punctate localization in the plasma membrane (green signal in left panel, Fig. 1A). In contrast, when YFP was expressed alone it was distributed uniformly over the entire cytoplasm (data not shown). Furthermore, the localization of YFP-Cav1 did not change if GFP was fused with the C terminus of Cav1 instead of YFP at the N terminus (data not shown). Localization of endogenous TRPC1 in HSG cells stably expressing YFP-Cav1 was examined using anti-TRPC1 antibody (33Liu X. Singh B.B. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11337-11343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Endogenous TRPC1 was localized in the plasma membrane and subplasma membrane regions (Fig. 1A, middle panel, red signal). Colocalization of YFP-Cav1 and endogenous TRPC1 was seen in the plasma membrane as a punctate yellow signal (Fig. 1A, right panel, yellow signal). Consistent with our results, endogenous TRPC1 has been shown previously to colocalize with Cav1 in the plasma membrane of mouse sperms (30Trevino C.L. Serrano C.J. Beltran C. Felix R. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Control samples showed that there was no contribution of the YFP fluorescence to the red signal (image not shown). Fig. 1B shows the immunolocalization of exogenously expressed HA-TRPC1 in HSG cells stably expressing YFP-Cav1 (Ad-TRPC1 was used to express HA-TRPC1 in YFP-Cav1 cells transiently). Consistent with the localization of YFP-Cav1 (Fig. 1B, upper left panel, green signal), HA-TRPC1 was also primarily detected in the plasma membrane and perinuclear region (Fig. 1B, upper right panel, red signal). Overlay of the HA and YFP signals demonstrated a distinct punctate plasma membrane colocalization of the two proteins (Fig. 1B, lower left panel, yellow signal). This was confirmed further by overlaying this image on a differential interference contrast image (Fig. 1B, lower right panel). The colocalization of TRPC1 and Cav1 was also demonstrated in another epithelial cell line, MDCK. As seen in HSG cells, stably expressed YFP-Cav1 and transiently expressed HA-TRPC1 were colocalized in the plasma membrane region (Fig. 1C). Thus, plasma membrane colocalization of TRPC1 and Cav1 was not restricted to HSG cells. Colocalization of Cav1 and TRPC1 proteins was confirmed further by immunoprecipitation of YFP-Cav1 with HA-TRPC1 (Fig. 1D). Both proteins were detected in the OG + KI-solubilized fraction of crude membranes isolated from cells expressing YFP-Cav1 and HA-TRPC1 (Fig. 1D, lane 1). The proteins were also detected in the immunoprecipitate (immunoprecipitates with anti-YFP antibody; Western blots using either anti-HA or anti-YFP antibodies (Fig. 1D, lane 2; note that these bands are not seen in control immunoprecipitates from nontransfected cells, data not shown). Together with our previous reports showing that endogenous TRPC1 or exogenously expressed TRPC1 is immunoprecipitated with endogenous Cav1 in HSG cells (13Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36483-36486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), these data suggest that TRPC1 and Cav1 interact with each other. To examine this interaction in greater detail, GST fusion proteins of the N or C terminus of TRPC1 were made. Lysates from HSG cells expressing YFP-Cav1 (Fig. 1E, second lane) were passed through columns containing GST-N-TRPC1 or GST-C-TRPC1. YFP-Cav1 interacted with both the N and C terminus of TRPC1, although there was more binding with the C terminus (Fig. 1E, third and fourth lanes). Fig. 1E, first lane, shows that control GST protein does not bind Cav-1. Identification and Functional Characterization of the Cav1 Binding Domain in the N Terminus of TRPC1—The data in Fig. 1 are consistent with our previous suggestion that TRPC1 has putative caveolin binding domains in both the N and C terminus (13Lockwich T.P.

Although further studies will be required to determine the functional consequences of the binding of the C terminus of TRPC1 to Cav1, we have reported previously that C-terminal deletion of TRPC1 does not affect its plasma membrane localization or decrease SOCE (11Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36483-36486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated further the Cav1 binding site on the TRPC1 N terminus. A mutant of Cav1 was constructed, Cav1Δ80–169, which lacked the scaffolding domain, membrane anchoring domain, and the three palmitoylation sites and thus could be used in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interactions between this Cav1 mutant and the N and C terminus of TRPC1 were examined. Cav1Δ80–169 interacted with the TRPC1 N terminus but not the C terminus (Fig. 2A) thus providing us with a useful tool to examine Cav1 interactions with the TRPC1 N terminus. To map the Cav1 binding domain in the TRPC1 N terminus, sequences of TRPC1, shown in Fig. 2B, were cloned into the yeast two-hybrid vectors and screened against Cav1Δ80–169. Significant interaction was seen between Cav1 and ΔN5, aa 271–349 (Fig. 2C). To determine the role of this Cav1 binding domain in TRPC1 function, aa 271–349 were deleted in HA-TRPC1 (HA-TRPC1Δ271–349, Fig. 3A), and the"
https://openalex.org/W2115267975,"Chaperonins use ATPase cycling to promote conformational changes leading to protein folding. The prokaryotic chaperonin GroEL requires a cofactor, GroES, which serves as a ""lid"" enclosing substrates in the central cavity and confers an asymmetry on GroEL required for cooperative transitions driving the reaction. The eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT does not have such a cofactor but appears to have a ""built-in"" lid. Whether this seemingly symmetric chaperonin also operates through an asymmetric cycle is unclear. We show that unlike GroEL, TRiC does not close its lid upon nucleotide binding, but instead responds to the trigonal-bipyramidal transition state of ATP hydrolysis. Further, nucleotide analogs inducing this transition state confer an asymmetric conformation on TRiC. Similar to GroEL, lid closure in TRiC confines the substrates in the cavity and is essential for folding. Understanding the distinct mechanisms governing eukaryotic and bacterial chaperonin function may reveal how TRiC has evolved to fold specific eukaryotic proteins."

However, the precise transcriptional activation mechanism of Sox9 is not fully understood. In addition to sequence-specific binding factors such as Sox9, various co-activators are involved in transcriptional activation (7Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D.

During DNA assembly, DNA wraps twice around the histone octamer to form chromatin (17Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1992-1996PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin is not only a system to package genome but also a key player in regulating gene expression (17Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1992-1996PubMed Google Scholar). It represses transcription by inhibiting the access of the transcriptional machinery to DNA. Specific modifications of chromatin such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which are thought to alter histone-DNA contacts, facilitate gene expression by allowing the recruitment of the transcriptional complex to the promoter (18Tyler J.K.

These data prompted us to examine the possible role of CBP and p300 in accordance with Sox9, which is also critical for the developing skeletal framework. Here we demonstrate that Sox9 utilizes CBP and p300 as transcriptional co-activators. The transcription factor Sox9 binds to CBP/p300 both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, CBP and p300 enhance Sox9-dependent Col2a1 promoter activity, and disrupting the CBP/Sox9 complex inhibits Col2a1 mRNA expression and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation into chondrocyte. These results establish CBP and p300 as important cofactors in chondrocyte-specific gene expression via regulating Sox9 transcriptional activity. Tissue Culture Methods and Transfections—Human chondrosarcoma cell line (1353) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Mediatech, Washington, DC) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). Cells were transfected by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer. The amounts of transfected plasmids for cotransfection assays were as follows. For Sox9-dependent activation, 50 ng of Gal-TK luc reporter, 50 ng of Gal4-Sox9, and 100 ng of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged p300 were used. The Col2a1 promoter (pKN185) (3Tanaka K. Matsumoto Y. Nakatani F. Iwamoto Y. Yamada Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4428-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was assayed by cotransfection assays using 50 ng of plasmid or empty plasmid control per well. Luciferase activity was assayed, and reporter activities were normalized to activity from a cotransfected Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-galactosidase expression plasmid as described previously (23Asahara H. Dutta S. Kao H.Y. Evans R.M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8219-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Comparable expression levels of Gal4-Sox9 and p300 wild type and mutant polypeptides were verified by Western blot assay. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before scraping them off at 4 °C with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and the phosphatase inhibitors P-5726 and P-2850 (Sigma)). Cell extract then was sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were used as crude extracts for immunoprecipitations. Nonspecific binding was reduced by preincubation of extracts with protein G-Sepharose (P-4691; Sigma) for 30 min. Pellets were discarded, and extracts were incubated with immune sera or controls for 2–4 h. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 5 μl of monoclonal anti-HA (Y11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-downs—GST-Sox9 fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and purified (24Asahara H. Tartare-Deckert S. Nakagawa T. Ikehara T. Hirose F. Hunter T. Ito T.

Binding of proteins to glutathione-Sepharose was done in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.05% Tween 20. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—SW1353 cells were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link protein-DNA complexes (25Asahara H. Santoso B. Guzman E. Du K. Cole P.A. Davidson I. Montminy M. Mol. Cell.

Immunoprecipitates were treated with proteinase K for 2 h and then incubated at 65 °C to release cross-links. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA samples were then analyzed with 20 cycles of PCR to amplify human Col2a1 first intron 2151–2305, which contains the Sox9 DNA binging site and was analyzed by 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Different cycle numbers were employed to ensure linearity of amplification. Quantitative PCR—Poly(A)+ RNA and total RNA were extracted from homogenized mice livers using the Fast Track 2.0 (Invitrogen) or the RNeasy (Qiagen) kit. RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Promega), and RNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 500 ng of total RNA using the Superscript II enzyme and oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNAs were amplified using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) and the iCycler iQ Real Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). All mRNA expression data from the quantitative PCR with reverse transcription were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression in the corresponding sample. Adenovirus Infection—Recombinant adenovirus vectors carrying mouse CBP amino acids 1805–1890 with the Gal4 DNA biding domain as a tag or control lacZ gene were constructed in pJM17 as described (26Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) (generous gifts from Dr. Montminy, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Viruses were purified by the CsCl method, and titer was checked as described (26Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The infection efficiency of this adenovirus in SW1353 cells was examined by immunocytochemistry using an anti-Gal antibody, which showed almost 100% infection efficiency with an m.o.i. of 8 (data not shown). MSC Cells Culture and Chondrogenesis—Human mesenchymal stem cells were purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). To induce chondrogenesis, pellet cultures were prepared by gently centrifuging 2.5 × 105 cells at 500 × g in 15-ml polypropylene conical tubes. The culture media was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, low glucose supplemented with ITS Premix (BD Biosciences) consisting of insulin, transferrin, selenic acid, bovine serum albumin, and linoleic acid, Sodium pyruvate (1 mm), ascorbate 2-phosphate (37.5 μg/ml), and transforming growth factor β3 (TGF-β3) (10 ng/ml). The pellet cultures were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells form an essentially spherical aggregate that does not adhere to the walls of the tube. Medium changes were carried out at 2–3 day intervals, and pellets were harvested for analysis at time points up to 4 weeks. The pellets were embedded, fixed, and stained with a type II collagen antibody. Transcriptional Co-activators CBP and p300 Associating with Sox9—To test an interaction between CBP/p300 and Sox9 in intact cells, amino-terminally FLAG-tagged, full-length Sox9 was expressed in SW1353 alone or in the presence of HA-tagged p300 or CBP. Cell extracts were prepared, and immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-HA antibodies followed by Western blotting utilizing anti-FLAG antibodies. In the presence of coexpressed HA-CBP, Sox9 was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1A). Similarly, we detected co-immunoprecipitation of Sox9 with HA-tagged p300 (Fig. 1A). These data show a physical association of Sox9 with the transcriptional co-activators p300 and CBP. Mapping of Interaction Domains of CBP and Sox9 Complex—To determine the Sox9 interaction domain with CBP in SW1353 cells, FLAG-tagged Sox9 truncations were constructed (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, a carboxyl-terminal truncation (FLAG-Sox9 amino acids 1–423 and 1–327) did not bind to p300. However, deletion of Sox9 amino-terminal amino acids (FLAG-Sox9 amino acids182–507 and 328–507) led to the same high degree of interaction with p300 as observed with the full-length protein, indicating that the carboxyl terminus of Sox9 is critical for binding to CBP/p300 (Fig. 1C). To define the CBP/p300 interaction domain within Sox9, an in vitro GST pull-down assay was performed using bacterially expressed GST-Sox9 and in vitro translated CBP fragments. GST-Sox9 specifically interacted with CBP 4 fragment (Fig. 2, A and B), which is known as a binding site of various nuclear proteins, including E1A (28Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), β-catenin (29Miyagishi M. Fujii R. Hatta M. Yoshida E. Araya N. Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. J.

DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Consistent with their considerable size (265 kDa), p300 and CBP contain numerous interaction surfaces. CBP/p300 contain two transcriptional adapter zinc-binding (TAZ) motifs, called cysteine/histidine-rich domains 1 and 3 (CH1 and CH3), that function in protein recognition (34Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To further determine the interaction domain of p300/CBP with Sox9 in intact cells, we transfected truncated p300 constructs with FLAG-Sox9 in SW1353 cells and examined their interaction by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the proceeding GST pull-down assay, p300 ΔCH1 was recovered from co-immunoprecipitate with FLAG-Sox9 as well as wild type p300. In contrast, p300 ΔCH3, which has the 33-amino acid deletion in the CH3 region (25Asahara H. Santoso B. Guzman E. Du K. Cole P.A. Davidson I. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), did not bind to Sox9 as well, suggesting a critical role for CH3 domain in Sox9/p300 interaction (Fig. 2D). p300/CBP Activates Sox9 Transcriptional Activity—We next investigated the functional significance of the interaction between CBP/p300 and Sox9 by transient transfection reporter assays. Using a luciferase reporter plasmid containing Col2a1 promoter elements, including the Sox9 binding domain (pKN185) (3Tanaka K. Matsumoto Y. Nakatani F. Iwamoto Y. Yamada Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4428-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), cotransfection of p300 increased luciferase activity. Compared with wild type p300, p300ΔCH3 (25Asahara H. Santoso B. Guzman E. Du K. Cole P.A. Davidson I. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) functioned as a dominant negative inhibitor of transcription by reducing promoter activity 4-fold. Interestingly, p300ΔCH1 also showed strong dominant negative effect on the Col2a1 promoter, suggesting that the CH1 domain might also play a role in this transcriptional activation (Figs. 2C and 3A). To further verify the CBP/p300 dependence on Sox9-mediated transactivation, we applied the Gal4 fusion system. Sox9 was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Fig. 2A), and its activity was analyzed with a reporter containing five Gal4 binding sites and the TK promoter (Gal4 TK). Transfection with Gal4-Sox9-(182–507) in SW1353 cells led to a 21-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Fig 3B). However, the Gal4-Sox9 construct lacking a C-terminal activation domain, which was identified as a CBP interaction domain, did not show a strong transcription activity (Gal4-Sox9 amino acids 1–423, 1–327). The Gal4-Sox9-(182–507) transcriptional activity was further enhanced by cotransfection of p300 or CBP. We observed that the transfection of p300 in conjunction with Gal4-Sox9-(182–507) in SW1353 cells showed a 13-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with Gal4-Sox9-(182–507) alone. CBP had a synergistic effect similar to that of p300 (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these data support the notion that p300/CBP enhances Sox9 transcription activity. Critical Role of CBP/Sox9 Association for Col2a1 Gene Expression—To determine whether CBP/p300 is bound to the Col2a1 promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using CBP- and p300-specific antibodies (Fig. 4A). PCR amplification products from reactions with human Col2a1 first intron 2151–2305, which contains the Sox9 DNA binging site, were analyzed by 2% agarose gel. The Col2a1 intron DNA was efficiently recovered from immunoprecipitates of CBP but not control immunoglobulin (IgG) (Fig. 4B). Confirming the specificity of these antisera, no PCR product was obtained from CBP immunoprecipitates using 293T cells in which Sox9 is not expressed, and, thus, CBP should not be recruited to the Col2a1 promoter (Fig. 4B). To further examine the role of CBP/p300 and Sox9 interaction for Col2a1 gene expression, we used adenovirus expressing CH3 peptide (mouse CBP, amino acids 1805–1890 with Gal4 DNA binding domain as a tag) to disrupt CBP/p300 and Sox9 complex formation. Because the CH3 domain was determined as the Sox9 binding domain (Fig. 2, B and D), we hypothesized that overexpression of the CH3 peptide may block CBP/p300 and Sox9 interaction and act as a potential dominant negative tool for Sox9-CBP/p300-dependent transactivation (Fig. 5A). The infection efficiency of this adenovirus in SW1353 cells was examined by immunocytochemistry using anti-Gal4 antibodies and shows almost 100% infection efficiency with an m.o.i. of 8 (data not shown). After infection, we examined p300-Sox9 complex formation by co-immunoprecipitation. With an m.o.i. of 8, the adenovirus infection blocked p300/Sox9 interaction, probably by masking the Sox9-p300 binding domain, whereas a control adenovirus carrying the lacZ gene had no effect on complex formation (Fig. 5B). Next, we tested endogenous Col2a1 gene expression. Levels of Col2a1 mRNA were determined by quantitative PCR. Col2a1 mRNA levels were strongly reduced by overexpression of CH3 peptide (about 80% reduction with m.o.i. of 8), whereas there was no effect in control adenovirus infected cells (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results suggest that the association of CBP/p300 with Sox9 regulates Col2a1 gene expression. Critical Role of CBP/Sox9 Association for Chondrogenesis from MSC—To examine the function of p300 in the chondrogenesis, we infected human MSCs with an adenovirus expressing the CH3 domain of CBP and examined the effect of the disrupter peptide on chondrocyte differentiation (35Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17845) Google Scholar, 36Pittenger M.F. Mosca J.D. McIntosh K.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 251: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sekiya I. Vuoristo J.T. Larson B.L. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4397-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). As a control, we used adenovirus expressing the KIX domain of CBP (mouse CBP amino acids 586–672), which is also characterized as a protein interaction domain for several transcription factors, including CREB, c-Jun, and c-Myb (10Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 25Asahara H. Santoso B. Guzman E. Du K. Cole P.A. Davidson I. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Following the infection of the adenovirus, MSC cells were transferred to micromass cultures and incubated in the presence of transforming growth factor β to induce chondrogenesis. More than 95% of MSCs were co-expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker (not shown). Col2a1 expression, a marker for chondrogenesis, was not affected by control GFP or KIX peptide (Fig. 6, A and B). CH3 peptide infection, however, blocked Col2a1 expression (Fig. 6C). Staining with control rabbit serum was negative for each of the samples (data not shown). These results indicate that CBP/p300 also plays a critical role in MSC differentiation into chondrocyte as well as chondrocyte-specific gene expression. Sox9 has been identified as a critical molecule in chondrocyte differentiation (2de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. Bi W. Murakami S. Huang W. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 4Zhao Q. Eberspaecher H. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Expression of Col2a1 shadows Sox9 expression. In the genital ridge, however, Col2a1 is not expressed despite a high level of Sox9 expression (4Zhao Q. Eberspaecher H. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). This suggests the existence of molecular partners of Sox9 that are required for cartilage-specific Col2a1 gene expression. Here we identified the interaction of Sox9 with CBP/p300. The paralogous proteins CBP and p300 were originally identified as interaction partners for CREB (38Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar) and the adenoviral E1A protein (28Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), respectively. Subsequently, a variety of different DNA binding transcription factors and co-activators have been shown to rely on CBP/p300 for their function in transcription activation (39Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). CBP/p300 contains two TAZ motifs, which function as the sites of interaction with numerous transcription factors and viral oncogenes (34Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 40Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The TAZ1 motif corresponds to cysteine/histidine-rich domain 1, i.e. the CH1 domain; the TAZ2 domain and the zinc-binding domain together make up cysteine/histidine-rich domain 3, i.e. the CH3 domain) (34Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In addition to the CH3 domain, which is identified as an interaction domain for Sox9 binding, we observed that the CH1 domain of p300 is also critical for co-activator function. The CH1 domain of CBP/p300 has been shown to interact with transcriptional factor Hif-1 (34Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 40Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). One of the CBP/p300 functions is to recruit RNA polymerase machinery. For example, in the case of CREB transcription, Montminy and co-workers showed that CH3 is critical for its recruitment of RNA polymerase II (41Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 42Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Because the CH3 domain is occupied by Sox9 interaction, the CH1 domain may play a role in recruiting RNA polymerase II or other basic transcriptional machinery in Sox9-dependent transcriptional activation. Recently, mutations in the gene encoding CBP were found to cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (20Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J. Bruening M.H. Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The CBP+/- mice exhibited the clinical features of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, including skeletal abnormalities (21Tanaka Y. Naruse I. Maekawa T. Masuya H. Shiroishi T. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). This phenotype could be, at least in part, explained by our findings that demonstrate the critical role of CBP/p300 in transcriptional activity of Sox9. Sox9 has been shown to plays an important role for developing skeletal framework (5Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 6Bi W. Huang W. Whitworth D.J. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6698-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The absence of CBP may reduce Sox9 activity and, hence, may indirectly affect skeletal development (22Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M.

Research on molecular function of co-activator CBP/p300 in accordance with Sox9 will advance our understanding of skeletal development and has the potential to identify new approaches to the treatment of skeletal and articular joint diseases (43Aigner T.

https://openalex.org/W2091493196,"Two cytochrome P450 (P450) cDNAs involved in the biosynthesis of berberine, an antimicrobial benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, were isolated from cultured Coptis japonica cells and characterized. A sequence analysis showed that one C. japonica P450 (designated CYP719) belonged to a novel P450 family. Further, heterologous expression in yeast confirmed that it had the same activity as a methylenedioxy bridge-forming enzyme (canadine synthase), which catalyzes the conversion of (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine ((S)-THC) to (S)-tetrahydroberberine ((S)-THB, (S)-canadine). The other P450 (designated CYP80B2) showed high homology to California poppy (S)-N-methylcoclaurine-3′-hydroxylase (CYP80B1), which converts (S)-N-methylcoclaurine to (S)-3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine. Recombinant CYP719 showed typical P450 properties as well as high substrate affinity and specificity for (S)-THC. (S)Scoulerine was not a substrate of CYP719, indicating that some other P450, e.g. (S)-cheilanthifoline synthase, is needed in (S)-stylopine biosynthesis. All of the berberine biosynthetic genes, including CYP719 and CYP80B2, were highly expressed in selected cultured C. japonica cells and moderately expressed in root, which suggests coordinated regulation of the expression of biosynthetic genes.

Cells of higher plants produce structurally divergent chemicals such as terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and alkaloids. Although these chemicals have been used as medicines, aromatic chemicals, insecticides, etc., the biochemical potential of plant cells themselves has recently attracted the attention of researchers who hope to use their biocatalytic activities for the conversion and/or production of chemicals. Cytochrome P450 (P450) 1The abbreviations used are: P450, cytochrome P450; (S)-THC, (S)tetrahydrocolumbamine; (S)-THB, (S)-tetrahydroberberine; SMT, S-adenosyl-l-methionine:scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase; 6-OMT, S-adenosyl-l-methionine:norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase; 4′-OMT, S-adenosyl-l-methionine:3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine 4′-O-methyltransferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy; (S)-CHS, (S)-cheilanthifoline synthase. is one of the most studied groups of enzymes because of the large number of compounds represented and their reaction diversity, e.g. hydroxylation, alkene epoxidation, dealkylation, and oxidative deamination (1Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). For example, liver microsomal P450 is well known to exist in multiple forms and to play important roles in the detoxification of xenobiotics (2Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (2124) Google Scholar). Although the reactions in plants that involve P450s have not been well studied because of their low abundance and the difficulty of biochemical characterization, recent studies have shown that many biochemical reactions in plants are catalyzed by P450s (3Chapple C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 311-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In the biosynthesis of antimicrobial benzylisoquinoline (berberine) or benzophenanthridine (sanguinarine) alkaloids, several P450 reactions have been reported (Fig. 1) (4Loeffler S. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3499-3503Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5Pauli H.H. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1998; 13: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Rueffer M. Zenk M.H.

A P450 (CYP80B1) catalyzes hydroxylation, i.e. the conversion of (S)-N-methylcoclaurine to (S)-3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine, and the cDNA has been isolated from California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) (5Pauli H.H. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1998; 13: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Other P450 reactions include methylenedioxy bridge formation (6Rueffer M. Zenk M.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 201-202Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Rueffer M. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 1219-1223Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Bauer W. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2953-2961Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar); e.g. the conversion of (S)tetrahydrocolumbamine ((S)-THC) to (S)-tetrahydroberberine ((S)-THB, (S)-canadine) has been studied in part by using microsomal fractions of Thalictrum tuberosum cells (7Rueffer M. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 1219-1223Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two other methylenedioxy bridge-forming reactions from (S)-scoulerine via (S)-cheilanthifoline to (S)-stylopine have been partially characterized in California poppy (8Bauer W. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2953-2961Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because Coptis japonica cells produce berberine and coptisine, which is the oxidized form of (S)-stylopine, we speculated that the cells of this plant may also exhibit these methylenedioxy bridge-forming reactions along with the CYP80B hydroxylation reaction (Fig. 1). Whereas previous reports have indicated that biosynthetic enzymes involved in berberine/(S)-stylopine biosynthesis have relatively strict substrate specificity (5Pauli H.H. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1998; 13: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7Rueffer M. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 1219-1223Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Bauer W. Zenk M.H.

Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 659-664Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), many P450s, especially those involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, are known to have relatively broad substrate specificity (2Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (2124) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that all of the methylenedioxy bridge-forming reactions in berberine/coptisine biosynthesis in C. japonica might be catalyzed by a single P450, although with different reactivities. To clarify this point, we tried to isolate a methylenedioxy bridge-forming P450 cDNA from cultured C. japonica 156-1 cells. Because cultured C. japonica 156-1 cells produce large amounts of berberine and coptisine (13Sato F. Yamada Y. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 281-285Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we speculated that the desired P450 involved in berberine/coptisine biosynthesis would be highly expressed in these cells. Based on this idea, we amplified cDNA fragments specific to eukaryotic P450s from a cDNA library prepared from cultured C. japonica 156-1 cells. Next, using these cDNA fragments, we isolated full-length cDNAs, determined the primary structures, and produced recombinant proteins in a yeast expression system to identify their biochemical activity. The data indicated that an isolated cDNA encoded a novel P450 that showed methylenedioxy bridge-forming activity to convert (S)-THC to (S)-THB. The kinetic parameters and substrate specificity were determined to clarify whether this P450 may function in other biosynthetic steps and to evaluate the metabolic regulation of berberine biosynthesis by this enzyme. Plant Material—Coptis (C. japonica Makino var. Dissecta (Yatabe) Nakai) plants were obtained from the herbal garden of Takeda Chemical Industries. The original cultured cells were induced from rootlets of C. japonica, and a cell line (156-1) with high berberine productivity was established by small cell aggregate selection and subcultured as described previously (13Sato F. Yamada Y. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 281-285Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Fourteen-day-old cultured cells were harvested and used for the extraction of mRNA. Chemicals—Berberine sulfate was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd. (S)-Coclaurine was a gift from Dr. N. Nagakura of Kobe Women's College of Pharmacy, Japan. (S)-N-Methylcoclaurine was a gift from Dr. Y. Sugimoto of Tottori University, Japan. (S)-Scoulerine, (R,S)-reticuline, (R,S)-norreticuline, and (R,S)-6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline were gifts from Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Ltd. (S)-Tetrahydrocolumbamine was prepared from (S)-scoulerine by using recombinant S-adenosyl-l-methionine:scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase (SMT) expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (14Takeshita N. Fujiwara H. Mimura H. Fitchen J.H. Yamada Y. Sato F. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 29-36PubMed Google Scholar). (R,S)Tetrahydroberberine was prepared from berberine as described previously (15Yamada Y. Okada N. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 63-65Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Columbamine was synthesized and purified from berberine by two-step reactions according to the method of Cava and Reed (16Cava M.P. Reed T.A. J. Org. Chem. 1967; 32: 1640-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Cava M.P. Reed T.A. Beal J.L. Lloydia (Cinci.). 1965; 28: 73-83Google Scholar). Ketoconazole was kindly donated by Dr. Y. Aoyama of Sohka University, Japan. Amplification of Cytochrome P450 cDNA Fragments from a cDNA Library of Cultured C. japonica Cells—A cDNA library of cultured C. japonica cells was prepared with a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit and Gigapack II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (14Takeshita N. Fujiwara H. Mimura H. Fitchen J.H. Yamada Y. Sato F. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 29-36PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA library was used as a template for amplification of P450 cDNA fragments. Two pairs of degenerate primers were designed for the sequences conserved among eukaryotic P450s (18Gotoh O. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ruckpaul K. Rein H. Frontiers in Biotransformation. Vol. 1. Akademie, Berlin1989: 195-243Google Scholar). One pair was the F1 primer (5′-MTIMMITAYITIHVIRYIRTIIKIWAVGA-3′) for the helix K region and the R1 primer (5′-CCIRSRCARMYYCTISKICCIVMICYRAAIGG-3′) for the heme-binding region (where M = A or C, I = inosine, Y = C or T, H = A or T or C, V = A or C or G, R = A or G, K = T or G, W = A or T, S = C or G). The other pair was the F2 primer (5′-GCGAATTCRYIRTIIKIWAVGARIYIYTIMG-3′) for the helix K region and the R2 primer (5′-GCGAATTCAVRAAYCKHWYIGGIIIRAA-3′) for the aromatic region. In the first PCR, the F1 and R1 primers were used for amplification of P450 partial cDNAs under the following PCR conditions: denaturation, 4 min at 94 °C; initial 5 cycles, 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 37 °C, 2 min at 37 °C to 72 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; additional 35 cycles, 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 37 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Amplified PCR products at about 280 bp were used as the template for the second PCR using the F2 and R2 primers under the same PCR conditions as in the first PCR. The resultant PCR products at about 200 bp were subcloned into pBluescript II SK– (Stratagene) and sequenced in a DSQ-1000 automated sequencer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a Thermo Sequenase® fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Sequenced clones showed two different sequences that were obviously homologous to known P450s. Screening of Cytochrome P450 cDNAs from a cDNA Library—The above cDNA library was used to screen full-length cDNAs of P450. The second PCR products at about 200 bp were used as hybridization probes. The first screening of ∼200,000 plaque-forming units yielded 123 positive signals, and the third screening yielded 40 independent phages. PCR with the M13-Rv primer and R1 primer revealed that these phages were mixtures of clones with cDNAs of two different lengths; i.e. about 1.7 and 0.8 kb. These cDNA inserts of the plasmid vector (pBluescript SK–) were excised in vivo with a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit and then used for transformation to E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequences of the inserts were determined as described above. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—A double-stranded cDNA library with an adaptor sequence at both ends was synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA, which was prepared from cultured C. japonica cells, with a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech). 5′-RACE was carried out with an adaptor primer (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and a gene-specific primer (5′-CATGTAGTGGTAGAGGAAGTACTGTCC-3′). The amplified fragments at about 900 bp were subcloned into pT7Blue T-Vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and sequenced as described above. Alignment Analysis—The predicted protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW (19Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55986) Google Scholar, 20Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) and Boxshade (www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). ClustalW was also used to calculate the phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining method (21Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Blot Analysis—RNA was isolated from cultured C. japonica 156-1 cells and C. japonica plant tissues. Cultured C. japonica cells were harvested after 12 days of culture, when biosynthetic activity was high, to extract total RNA. Freshly harvested C. japonica plants were separated into leaves, petioles, rhizomes, and roots and then stored in liquid nitrogen until the extraction of total RNA. Total RNA was prepared as described previously (22Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA was separated on a 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) with 20× SSC (333 mm sodium chloride/sodium citrate) as a transfer buffer according to the standard procedure (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled probes were synthesized by random priming using a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Applied Science). Four types of probes were synthesized, corresponding to the following fragments: 3′-fragment of CYP719 cDNA, 3′-fragment of CYP80B2 cDNA, 5′-fragment of S-adenosyl-l-methionine:norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase (6-OMT) cDNA (11Morishige T. Tsujita T. Yamada Y. Sato F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23398-23405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and 5′-fragment of S-adenosyl-l-methionine:3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine 4′-O-methyltransferase (4′-OMT) cDNA (11Morishige T. Tsujita T. Yamada Y. Sato F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23398-23405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 60 °C with 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA, and the labeled probes. After hybridization, the membrane was washed once for 10 min with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then twice for 30 min with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The hybridization signal was recorded by autoradiography. RNA amounts were standardized by hybridization to an 18 S rRNA probe at 60 °C. Construction of Yeast Expression Vector—The coexpression plasmid pAMR2 for rat CYP1A1 and yeast NADPH-P450 reductase has been constructed previously (24Murakami H. Yabusaki Y. Sakaki T. Shibata M. Ohkawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The coexpression vector pGYR for P450 and yeast NADPH-P450 reductase, constructed in a similar manner, was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Yabusaki of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. The resulting vector contained a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter and terminator (25Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) instead of an alcohol dehydrogenase promoter and terminator without CYP1A1. The cloning site of pGYR was further modified to contain an NcoI site and an XhoI site to construct pGYR-NX. Full-length CYP719 cDNA was amplified by PCR using single-stranded cDNAs synthesized from 1.3 μg of total RNA of cultured C. japonica cells with oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The following primers were used for CYP719: the forward primer (5′-ATATCTGCAGCCATGGAGATGAATCCACTGC-3′) was designed to introduce a PstI site (CTGCAG) and an NcoI site (underlined, CCATGG) at the ATG start codon, and the reverse primer (5′-ATCCAACTCAAACATTTCTACCAGCG-3′) was designed to contain a stop codon (underlined). PCR products for CYP719 were digested with PstI and introduced into pBluescript SK– with PstI and EcoRV sites. The resulting plasmid was then digested with NcoI and XhoI, which produced CYP719 coding fragment. This coding fragment was ligated into the NcoI/XhoI site of pGYR-NX to generate yeast CYP719 expression vector, pGN-CYP719. The resulting construct was completely sequenced to confirm that no changes were introduced by subcloning processes. Heterologous Expression of CYP719 in Yeast—The expression plasmid for CYP719 (pGN-CYP719) was transformed into yeast strain AH22 (26Oeda K. Sakaki T. Ohkawa H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) by the LiCl method (27Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These recombinant yeast cells were cultivated in concentrated SD medium at 30 °C, 220 rpm (28Sakaki T. Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Murakami H. Ohkawa H. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To suppress the expression of endogenous P450s in yeast, cultivation was carried out under aerobic conditions (29Lindenmayer A. Smith L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 93: 445-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Yeast microsomal fractions were prepared as described previously (26Oeda K. Sakaki T. Ohkawa H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) with the following modification: a Dounce glass homogenizer was used to fracture yeasts instead of a sonicator, and the microsomal fractions that were finally obtained were suspended in 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.6), the same buffer as in enzyme assay mixture, instead of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Measurement of P450 Hemoprotein—The reduced CO-difference spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-2200 spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan) as described previously (26Oeda K. Sakaki T. Ohkawa H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The P450 hemoprotein content in the microsomal fraction was determined from the reduced CO-difference spectrum using a difference of 91 mm–1 cm–1 between the extinction coefficients at 446 and 490 nm (30Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assay of Enzymatic Activity—CYP719 activity was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). The standard enzyme reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.6), 500 μm NADPH, 5 μm substrate, and the enzyme preparation. The assay mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, except for the determination of kinetic parameters (for 5–10 min), and then the reaction was terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 2%) and methanol (final concentration 15%). After protein precipitation, the reaction product was determined quantitatively by reversed-phase HPLC with a Shimadzu LC-10A system: column, TSKgel ODS-80TM (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh); solvent system, acetonitrile/H2O/acetic acid (35:64:1); flow rate, 0.8 ml/min; detection, absorbance measurement at 280 nm with a SPD6A photodiode array detector. Product formation was confirmed by LC-MS (LCMS-2010, Shimadzu) under the same conditions as in HPLC analysis except for the flow rate (0.5 ml/min). Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by the nonlinear least-squares iterative method using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Three sets of the kinetic parameters were obtained from three independent experiments and then were simply averaged to yield the final estimates. The final estimates were shown with the standard error for the three sets. Other Methods—The amounts of (S)-THC and (S)-THB were estimated by HPLC analysis using the calibration curve of (S)-scoulerine (mol versus peak area) and the absorption ratio of (S)-scoulerine, (S)THC, and (S)-THB at 280 nm (1.00:0.89:1.20). Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Isolation of Cytochrome P450 cDNAs—Cytochrome P450 (P450) cDNA fragments, amplified from a cDNA library, were prepared from high berberine-producing cultured C. japonica 156-1 cells using degenerated primers designed from the conserved region of eukaryotic P450s (18Gotoh O. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ruckpaul K. Rein H. Frontiers in Biotransformation. Vol. 1. Akademie, Berlin1989: 195-243Google Scholar). After nested PCR, clear PCR products at about 200 bp were obtained. Sequence analysis of the fragments subcloned into pBluescript II SK– showed that these PCR products contained two different cDNA sequences, both of which were homologous to plant P450s. Thus, we used the PCR products as a probe to screen C. japonica P450s from the cDNA library. From ∼200,000 plaque-forming units, 40 positive plaques were isolated, and their cDNAs were subcloned into pBluescript SK– by in vivo excision. PCR amplification of cDNAs in pBluescript SK– revealed that cDNAs consisted of two inserts of different lengths, ∼1.7 and 0.8 kb. Preliminary sequence analysis of the 3′-untranslated region of all cDNAs showed that the ∼1.7-kb and ∼0.8-kb fragments were basically distinguishable, and these were designated CYPCJA and CYPCJB, respectively. Nucleotide Sequences and Predicted Amino Acid Sequences— The two longest cDNA clones, which represented CYPCJA and CYPCJB, were selected and sequenced. A representative CYPCJA clone carried 1,671 nucleotides with an open reading frame that encoded 488 amino acids (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession number AB025030). The predicted amino acid sequence had motifs characteristic of eukaryotic P450s and was sufficient to encode a full-length of P450 (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the sequenced CYPCJB had only 806 nucleotides and encoded a partial 3′-fragment of P450 cDNA. To isolate a full-length clone of CYPCJB, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end was conducted. Based on the sequence of the 5′-end obtained, full-length cDNA was amplified, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. Full-length CYPCJB contained 1,658 nucleotides with an open reading frame for 492 amino acids, which encoded a characteristic plant P450, indicating that it encoded a full-length cDNA of P450 (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession number AB026122) (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequence of CYPCJA is quite similar (68.4% identity) to that of CYP80B1, (S)-N-methylcoclaurine-3′-hydroxylase in reticuline biosynthesis, from the California poppy, E. californica (5Pauli H.H. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1998; 13: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is an ortholog of C. japonica (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the amino acid sequence of full-length CYPCJB is not particularly similar to any known P450, suggesting that it may belong in a novel P450 family (Fig. 3). These predicted amino acid sequences were classified by the P450 nomenclature committee, 2c/o Dr. D. R. Nelson, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN 38163. and CYPCJA and CYPCJB were named CYP80B2 and CYP719, respectively. Although the identity between the amino acid sequences of CYP80B2 and CYP719 was rather low (23.5%), they had conserved eukaryotic P450 regions: a helix K region, an aromatic region, and a heme-binding region at the C-terminal end (Fig. 2). In addition, their N-terminal regions contained hydrophobic domains corresponding to the membrane anchor sequences of microsomal P450 species, suggesting that CYP80B2 and CYP719 are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. On the other hand, CYP719 did not have a conserved threonine (corresponding to Thr-252 of P450cam), which plays a significant role in oxygen-activation (32Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), but had serine instead (Ser-296). This substitution is not seen in most P450s but is found in a few species such as Zea mays CYP88A1 (GenBank™ accession number U32579) and Nicotiana tabacum CYP92A2 (GenBank™ accession number X95342). Expression of CYP719 Gene in Cultured C. japonica Cells and Plant Tissues of C. japonica—Because the biochemical activity of CYP719 was unknown, we determined the expression of CYP719 in cultured C. japonica cells and C. japonica plant tissues (Fig. 4). A previous study of SMT expression indicated that cultured C. japonica cells with high berberine productivity showed a high expression of SMT, and moderate expression was seen in the root, which is the primary biosynthetic organ in C. japonica (33Fujiwara H. Takeshita N. Terano Y. Fitchen J.H. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y. Sato F. Yamada Y. Phytochemistry. 1993; 34: 949-954Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When the cDNA expression for CYP719 was compared with three biosynthetic genes (CYP80B2, 6-OMT, and 4′-OMT), all four genes showed similar expression profiles: very high expression in cultured cells, moderate expression in root, and scarce expression in other tissues. This result indicated that CYP719 is likely involved in berberine biosynthesis. Heterologous Expression of CYP719 in Yeast and Its Activity—To confirm the function of CYP719, it was expressed heterologously in yeast. Yeast expression plasmid for CYP719 was constructed and transformed to yeast AH22. Because CYP719 had a putative endoplasmic reticulum-localizing signal, microsomal fractions were prepared from recombinant yeast cells, and its enzymatic activity was determined using LC-MS analysis. Microsomal fractions of CYP719-expressing yeast showed canadine synthase activity, i.e. the formation of (S)-THB from (S)-THC was detected (Fig. 5). This result clearly indicated that CYP719 was a methylenedioxy bridge-forming enzyme, which produces (S)-THB from (S)-THC in berberine biosynthesis. Because the enzymologic properties of CYP719 were not clear, we used this recombinant CYP719 for further analysis. Enzymatic Characterization of CYP719 —First, the P450 nature of CYP719 was confirmed using reduced CO-difference spectra (Fig. 6). A clear peak at 446 nm showed that CYP719 was expressed as an active P450. This spectrum also showed that a recombinant microsomal fraction contained CYP719 at 48.8 pmol/mg of protein. CYP719 activity was also dependent on NADPH and oxygen; the absence of NADPH or the removal of O2 by the glucose/glucoseoxidase/catalase system (8Bauer W. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2953-2961Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) clearly inactivated the CYP719 activity for (S)-THC (Table I). A synthetic fungicide, ketoconazole, which is a typical P450 inhibitor that interacts with the prosthetic heme group (34Muto N. Inouye K. Inada A. Nakanishi T. Tan L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), also inhibited methylenedioxy bridge-forming activity (Table II).Table IMethylenedioxy bridge-forming activity of CYP719 toward (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine without NADPH or oxygenAdditionRelative activity%None100-NADPH040 mM glucose + 5 U glucose0oxidase + 10 U catalase40 mM glucose + boiled glucose84oxidase + 10 U catalase Open table in a new tab Table IIEffects of inhibitors on CYP719InhibitorConcentrationRelative activityμM%None100Ketoconazole1470Ketoconazole3536(S)-Scoulerine1096(S)-Scoulerine4069Columbamine1096Columbamine4066 Open table in a new tab Substrate Specificity and Affinity of CYP719 —To examine the possibility of whether CYP719 could catalyze three different steps in berberine/coptisine biosynthesis, the substrate specificity of CYP719 was examined using LC-MS analysis in comparison with (S)-THC as a reference substrate. When seven structurally related substrates were used as the substrate (Fig. 7), none was converted by CYP719 to the corresponding products with a methylenedioxy bridge, indicating that CYP719 had high substrate specificity. Next, the substrate affinity of CYP719 was determined using HPLC analysis with (S)-THC as the substrate. When the substrate concentration was varied, the reaction followed Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics. The kinetic parameters Km and V max values were estimated at 0.269 ± 0.003 μm and 1.86 ± 0.10 pmol of product/min/pmol of P450, respectively (Fig. 8). Inhibition of CYP719 Activity by Structurally Related Isoquinoline Alkaloids—To understand the regulation of berberine biosynthesis, the effects of various structurally related isoquinoline alkaloids on CYP719 activity were examined. Interestingly, (S)-scoulerine, a precursor of (S)-THC, inhibited the methylenedioxy bridge-forming activity of CYP719 in a competitive manner with a Ki value of 12.1 ± 2.2 μm, whereas it was not a substrate for CYP719 (data not shown). Further, columbamine, an oxidized form of (S)-THC, also inhibited CYP719 activity and was not a substrate for CYP719 (Table II). Berberine, the end product of the berberine biosynthetic pathway, did not inhibit the methylenedioxy bridge-forming activity of CYP719. In this study, we isolated two full-length cytochrome P450 cDNAs (CYP80B2 and CYP719) from high berberine-producing cultured C. japonica cells. Structural analysis and heterologous expression in yeast (data not shown) showed that CYP80B2 was an ortholog of CYP80B1, which is (S)-N-methylcoclaurine-3′-hydroxylase isolated from the California poppy (Fig. 2) (5Pauli H.H. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1998; 13: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CYP719 was placed in a new P450 family and showed methylenedioxy bridge-forming activity for (S)THC as a substrate, i.e. canadine synthase activity, which converts (S)-THC to (S)-THB (Fig. 5). CYP719 is the first P450 to be identified as a methylenedioxy bridge-forming enzyme. Methylenedioxy bridge formation, which is the cyclization of an ortho-methoxyphenol, is commonly found in many secondary metabolites, including lignans. This reaction is difficult to mimic in organic chemistry. A previous study showed that the formation of two methylenedioxy bridges in (S)-stylopine biosynthesis in California poppy was catalyzed by P450s (8Bauer W. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2953-2961Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These P450s ((S)-cheilanthifoline synthase ((S)-CHS) and (S)stylopine synthase catalyze the reaction of (S)-scoulerine via (S)-cheilanthifoline to (S)-stylopine. These two steps are also found in C. japonica cells to produce coptisine (Fig. 1). Whereas we had speculated that a methylenedioxy bridge-forming enzyme would catalyze all conversions from (S)-scoulerine to (S)stylopine as well as from (S)-THC to (S)-THB, recombinant C. japonica CYP719 did not convert (S)-scoulerine to (S)-cheilanthifoline, indicating that there are likely other methylenedioxy bridge-forming enzyme(s) in coptisine biosynthesis. On the other hand, CYP719 might function as (S)-stylopine synthase. When (S)-cheilanthifoline or (S)-CHS is available, we will examine this possibility regarding CYP719. Analysis of the substrate specificity of CYP719 indicated that berberine was produced from (S)-THC via (S)-THB and not via columbamine in C. japonica. Interestingly, columbamine slightly inhibited the methylenedioxy bridge-forming reaction of CYP719. Our study as well as a previous report showed that methylenedioxy bridge-forming enzymes such as CYP719, (S)CHS, and (S)-stylopine synthase have low Km values (0.269, 0.9, and 0.4 μm, respectively) for their corresponding substrates and high substrate specificities (8Bauer W. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2953-2961Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), indicating that their substrate recognition is very strict and controls the biosynthetic pathway. (S)-Scoulerine was not used as a substrate but showed inhibitory activity for CYP719 with a Ki value of 12.1 μm. The SMT reaction has been shown to be inhibited by the endproduct, berberine (12Sato F. Takeshita N. Fitchen J.H. Fujiwara H. Yamada Y. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 659-664Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Modification of the berberine/coptisine ratio by the ectopic expression of SMT in C. japonica cells suggested that the balance of SMT and (S)-CHS regulates metabolic flow (35Sato F. Hashimoto T. Hachiya A. Tamura K. Choi K.B. Morishige T. Fujimoto H. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The accumulation of (S)-scoulerine induced by berberine may inhibit CYP719 activity and regulate the flow of substrate to coptisine in vivo. Along with the dynamic regulation of secondary metabolism, the evolution of these divergent P450s is an interesting subject. (S)-CHS catalyzes the cyclization of an ortho-methoxyphenol of (S)-scoulerine in ring D (9,10-position), but not in ring A (2,3-position) (8Bauer W. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2953-2961Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CYP719 catalyzes the cyclization of an ortho-methoxyphenol of (S)-THC in ring A (2,3-position) but not ring D (9,10-position). Despite this difference, CYP719 and (S)-CHS recognize their own substrates based solely on whether or not (S)-THC has a 9-methoxy moiety. It is interesting that (S)-scoulerine was inhibitory for CYP719, whereas the Ki value (12.1 μm) was about 45 times higher than the Km value (0.269 μm) for (S)-THC. CYP719 and (S)-CHS might have a similar ancestral origin. Isolation of the remaining methylenedioxy bridge-forming enzyme cDNAs in coptisine biosynthesis will promote our understanding of P450 evolution in the isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthetic pathway. Recently, we isolated the cDNA of S-adenosyl-l-methionine:columbamine O-methyltransferase using an expressed sequence tag library prepared from cultured C. japonica cells (36Morishige T. Dubouzet E. Choi K.B. Yazaki K. Sato F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas the biosynthetic activities of palmatine and other berberine-related alkaloids were relatively low in our cultured C. japonica cells. This success suggests that our expressed sequence tag library could be useful for isolating other isoquinoline biosynthetic enzymes including methylenedioxy bridge-forming P450(s) in coptisine biosynthesis. Further characterization has identified some expressed sequence tag clones, which showed some sequence similarity to plant P450 cDNA sequences different from those for CYP719 and CYP80B2. The isolation of full-length P450 cDNAs and their further characterization should add to our understanding of the structure/function relationship and evolution of P450s in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2024752922,"Aleuria aurantia lectin is a fungal protein composed of two identical 312-amino acid subunits that specifically recognizes fucosylated glycans. The crystal structure of the lectin complexed with fucose reveals that each monomer consists of a six-bladed β-propeller fold and of a small antiparallel two-stranded β-sheet that plays a role in dimerization. Five fucose residues were located in binding pockets between the adjacent propeller blades. Due to repeats in the amino acid sequence, there are strong similarities between the sites. Oxygen atoms O-3, O-4, and O-5 of fucose are involved in hydrogen bonds with side chains of amino acids conserved in all repeats, whereas O-1 and O-2 interact with a large number of water molecules. The nonpolar face of each fucose residue is stacked against the aromatic ring of a Trp or Tyr amino acid, and the methyl group is located in a highly hydrophobic pocket. Depending on the precise binding site geometry, the α- or β-anomer of the fucose ligand is observed bound in the crystal. Surface plasmon resonance experiments conducted on a series of oligosaccharides confirm the broad specificity of the lectin, with a slight preference for αFuc1–2Gal disaccharide. This multivalent carbohydrate recognition fold is a new prototype of lectins that is proposed to be involved in the host recognition strategy of several pathogenic organisms including not only the fungi Aspergillus but also the phytopathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum.

This multivalent carbohydrate recognition fold is a new prototype of lectins that is proposed to be involved in the host recognition strategy of several pathogenic organisms including not only the fungi Aspergillus but also the phytopathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum. Lectins are carbohydrate-specific proteins that are key players in many recognition events at the molecular or cellular level (1Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). Fungi, either mushrooms or filamentous fungi, often depend on host association (symbiosis or parasitism) and appear to use lectins for host recognition and/or adhesion. One of the first examples of a lectin-mediated interaction between a fungus and its host was discovered in the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora (2Nordbring-Hertz B. Mattiasson B. Nature. 1979; 281: 477-479Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In higher fungi, lectins are involved in molecular recognition during the early stage of mycorrhization. An example is their role in the high specificity of the Lactaria mushroom/tree symbiotic association (3Giollant M. Guillot J. Damez M. Dusser M. Didier P. Didier E. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A role of lectins in mycoparasitism has been proposed for a number of human pathogens such as Candida albicans (4Brassart D. Woltz A. Golliard M. Neeser J.R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the agent causing oral candidosis, and Aspergillus fumigatus (5Bouchara J.P. Sanchez M. Chevailler A. Marot-Leblond A. Lissitzky J.C.

Richardson M. Verweij P.E. Meis J.F. Med. Mycol. 2000; 38: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Lectin-mediated recognition is also involved in plant mycoparasitism (7Elad Y. Barak R.

Microbiology. 1994; 140: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Due to the importance of their biological role, there is increasing interest in fungal lectins. However, there is only limited information about them, and although several crystals have been obtained, including the lectins from Flammulina veltipes (9Hirano S. Matsuura Y. Kusunoki M. Kitagawa Y.

Furukawa K. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2841-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Later, the primary sequence was determined and demonstrated the presence of six internal repeats of about 50 amino acids (16Fukumori F. Takeuchi N. Hagiwara T. Ohbayashi H. Endo T. Kochibe N. Nagata Y. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cloning of the gene allowed production of the recombinant lectin in Escherichia coli (17Fukumori F. Takeuchi N. Hagiwara T. Ito K. Kochibe N. Kobata A. Nagata Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the lectin specificity demonstrated that all fucose-containing disaccharides present on glycoconjugates (αFuc1–2Gal, αFuc1–3GlcNAc, αFuc1–4GlcNAc, and αFuc1–6GlcNAc) displayed similar binding to the lectin, higher than that shown for highly branched oligosaccharides such as the determinants of Lewis histo-blood groups (15Kochibe N. Furukawa K. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2841-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Debray H. Montreuil J. Carbohydr.

Since AAL is the only available lectin with high affinity for the αFuc1–6GlcNAc present in the core of complex N-glycans, it is widely used in the fractionation of glycoproteins.l-Fucose, as a component of cell surface complex oligosaccharides, is a key participant for cell surface recognition. Nevertheless, until very recently, no characterization of any fucoselectin crystal structure was attained. In the last year, the structure of fucose binding lectins from legume plant Ulex europaeus (lectin I) (20Audette G.F. Olson D.J.H. Ross A.R.S. Quail J.W. Delbaere L.T. Can. J.

Interestingly, these three different proteins display different binding modes toward the same monosaccharide.The crystal structure of AAL-fucose complex reported here has no similarity to any other described fucose-binding lectin. It represents a new fold present in a lectin family common to several pathogenic bacteria and fungi.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—AAL was purchased form from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). The sample was dissolved in water, and salts were removed by ultracentrifugation using Nanosep 3K Omega (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) with washing by water. Lewis a (α-l-Fuc-(1→4)[β-d-Gal-(1→3)]-d-GlcNAc), Lewis X (α-l-Fuc-(1→3)[β-d-Gal-(1→4)]-d-Glc-NAc), blood group A (α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-[β-d-GalNac-(1→3)]-d-Gal), blood group B (α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-[β-d-Gal-(1→3)]-d-Gal), and blood group H type II (α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-β-d-Gal-(1→4)-d-GlcNAc) trisaccharides were purchased from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK). l-fucose, p-nitrophenyl-α-l-fucoside, p-nitrophenyl-β-l-fucoside, α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-d-Gal, and α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-β-d-Gal-(1→4)-d-Glc were purchased from Sigma.Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization trials were performed with Hampton crystallization screens I and II (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA) using the hanging drop technique. Crystals were obtained using the following conditions: 2 μl of precipitant (0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.2 m magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, 20% polyethylene glycol 8000) mixed with a solution of 2 μl of AAL at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and l-fucose at a concentration of 137 μg/ml. The drops were allowed to equilibrate over a reservoir of 1 ml of the precipitating solution at 20 °C. Crystals grew as platelets to maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.05 mm3 after 1 week. They belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 45.97 Å, b = 86.41 Å, c = 77.85 Å, and β = 90.62° at 100 K. The asymmetric unit accommodates two monomers, corresponding to a V m of 2.20 Å3 Da–1 and a solvent content of 46% solvent. A mercury derivative was prepared by soaking a crystal in 1 mm sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate (thimerosal) (Hampton Research) for 24 h.Crystals were cryo-cooled at 100 K after soaking them in either paraffin oil or 30% (v/v) glycerol in precipitant solution for the native and mercury derivative, respectively. All data images were recorded on an ADSC Q4R CCD detector (Quantum Corp.) on the fixed energy beamline ID14–1 at the ESRF (Grenoble, France). Single wavelength highly redundant anomalous diffraction data to 2.0-Å resolution were collected from the thimerosal-soaked crystal and native data to 1.5-Å resolution. Measurements were made at a single x-ray wavelength of 0.934 Å. Diffraction images were processed using MOSFLM (23Leslie A.G.W.

Harker sections of the anomalous difference Patterson map showed two peaks corresponding to one mercury per monomer in the asymmetric unit. Initial mercury site coordinates, phasing, and solvent flattening were carried out with autoSHARP (25de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G.

Bricogne, manuscript in preparation. which located the two mercury sites. autoSHARP was also directed to search for noncrystallographic symmetry, and the resulting matrix was further refined, together with averaging and phase extension, using DM (27Cowtan K.D. Zhang K.Y. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) to give an electron density map of excellent quality. An initial structure was built automatically using ARP/wARP (28Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar), and side chains were docked to give 474 residues out of a total of 624 for the asymmetric unit cell. Manual building using O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) gave a more complete model, which was then used as a search probe for AMORE (30Navaza J. Acta Crystallog. Sect.

Phase extension, averaging, and solvent flattening with DM generated new phases and figures of merit for the native data, which was followed by a complete automatic construction, side chain docking, and an initial water molecule construction with ARP/wARP, which gave a model of 588 residues out of 624 with an Rcrys of 20.3% R and Rfree of 23.7%. The remainder of the residues and the fucose molecules clearly defined in density were positioned manually using O. Further refinement cycles with REF-MAC, including automatic water molecule placement using ARP/wARP, manual rebuilding with O, and construction of alternative conformations, where necessary (with occupancies estimated from the refined relative B-factors of the conformations), resulted in a final model of all 624 residues with 10 fucose molecules (5 bound per monomer) and 1166 water molecules with an Rcrys of 14.4% and Rfree of 17.9% to 1.5-Å resolution.

Open table in a new tab Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—All surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed with a Biacore 3000 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C using HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Measurements were carried out simultaneously on all four measuring channels using three different concentrations of immobilized AAL, whereas the fourth channel was used as the control flow cell. A research grade CM5 sensor chip was activated with a 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide solution for 10 min, and 50 μl of AAL in 5 mm maleate buffer, pH 7.0, at concentrations of 50, 10, and 2 μg/ml respectively, was injected to a particular flow cell. The unreacted species on the sensor surface were blocked by 1 m ethanolamine. The blank channel was treated identically except for the lectin injection.30 μl of carbohydrate solutions (concentrations between 0.39 and 200 μm) in running buffer were injected into the flow cells using the kinject mode. The equilibrium response (after subtraction from the response of the reference surface) of each experiment was used to create curves of analyte binding, which were fitted to a 1:1 steady-state affinity model using Origin version 6.1 software (OriginLab Corp.).RESULTSAAL Overall Fold—The six tandem repeats of the AAL amino acid sequence are organized around a six-fold pseudoaxis of symmetry (Fig. 1A). Each repeat consists of a twisted four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, and the overall arrangement corresponds to the fold previously described as a six-bladed β-propeller (31Fulop V. Jones D.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 32Paoli M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 76: 103-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The global shape is a short cylinder, or tore, with an approximate diameter of 45 Å and a height of 35 Å. In the β-propeller fold, each consecutive β-sheet has its first strand (number 1) lining the central cavity of the protein and the last one (number 4) most exposed to solvent at the cylinder surface. Loops connecting the strands within each module are rather short, with the exception of blade III (amino acids 108–162) that displays longer loops (Fig. 1D). The consecutive blades are connected by long segments that run from the outside of the protein to the central tunnel. Superposition of the main chain β-strand repeats gives r.m.s. values between 1.3 and 1.4 Å, indicative of their high spatial similarity.Several amino acids at the N and C termini of the peptide chains protrude from the base of the β-propeller cylinder, associating in a small antiparallel two-stranded β-sheet that forms a separated domain.The inner cavity of AAL has a tunnel shape with a diameter of about 8 Å in its middle part and almost closed off on the N terminus side of the first inner β-strands (Fig. 1B). This cavity has a strong hydrophobic character, being formed mostly by the conserved alanine residues of the first strands of each propeller blade. The core is filled with a set of about 50 water molecules forming a well ordered hydrogen bond network (average B-factor value of 12.5).Oligomeric State—AAL has been described as a dimer in solution (15Kochibe N. Furukawa K. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2841-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and is also observed as a dimer in the crystal structure. The two monomers are very similar, and superimposition of their backbones gives an r.m.s. value of 0.26 Å. A pseudo-2-fold axis of symmetry generates this dimer in the crystal (Fig. 1C). The small domain created by the antiparallel association of the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides plays a key role in the dimerization, additional contact being mediated by four loops (those interconnecting blades I and II and blades II and III and the loops between strands β2-I and β3-I and between strands β2-II and β3-II). Hydrophobic contacts involve the C terminus Trp312 from each monomer with Lys83 from the other. In addition, one tyrosine residue, Tyr6, interacts via aromatic ring stacking with its counterpart on the other monomer through the 2-fold axis. Four main hydrogen bonds are also established between the side chains of Asp263 and Ser283 and between the Trp312 nitrogen side chain and backbone carbonyl backbone of Leu59.This dimerization mode creates a “back to back” association of the two cylinder-shaped monomers. It closes the internal cavities on the N terminus side of the inner strand but leaves the other side of the cavity (i.e. the most open one) accessible to solvent. The fucose binding sites are exposed on each side of the dimer, at distances ranging from 50 to 70 Å from each other.Fucose Binding Sites—The crystal structure of the complex between AAL and fucose reveals five fucose residues bound per monomer (Fig. 1, A and B). These are located between consecutive blades, in binding sites consisting of pockets at the external face of the cylinder (Fig. 1E). For simplicity, the site located between blades I and II will be named site I, and the following ones will be named consecutively. The site between blades VI and I, which would have been referred as site VI, does not contain any electron density corresponding to a bound fucose molecule.

Hydrogen bonds are displayed as dashed lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The five fucose binding sites are not equivalent, but they have the same architecture and present invariant features. They are made up in the crevasse between two adjacent blades, and it is mostly amino acids of the four strands (rather than the loops) in each blade that participate in binding. As displayed in the alignment of sequence repeats in Fig. 1D, amino acids of blade i can therefore participate in site i or site i – 1. Conserved features of the binding sites consist of five hydrogen bonds between fucose and protein (Fig. 2); for fucose in site i, they involve the side chain of three highly conserved residues, Arg of strand β2 – i, Glu of strand β3 – i and Trp of strand β4 – (i + 1). These five hydrogen bonds make a compact network, the geometry of which is strictly conserved in the five binding sites. In addition to NH2 of Arg donating a hydrogen bond to the fucose ring oxygen, two cooperative sets of bonds are created; NE1 of the site Trp gives a hydrogen bond to O-3 that in turn donates a hydrogen bond to one acidic oxygen of the site Glu, whereas NE of Arg is bridged to the other oxygen of Glu via OH-4 of the fucose.The second part of the binding site is characterized by a hydrophobic region. The closer and most conserved hydrophobic contact involves a Trp/Tyr residue at the extremity of β4 – (i + 1). The aromatic ring stacks against the flat nonpolar face of fucose, with contacts with the methine and methyl groups at C-4, C-5, and C-6. The conserved isoleucine residue of strand β2 – (i + 1) establishes additional hydrophobic contact with the methyl group at C-6 of fucose. Longer distance contact involves the conserved Trp of strand β1 – i.The interactions described above leave hydroxyl groups O-1 and O-2 exposed to solvent. In all sites, fucose interacts with a number of water molecules that varies between two and five. The mean hydration number of fucose is four, which is an unusually high value for a monosaccharide in a protein binding site. Analysis of the water molecules hydrogen-bound to the sugar indicates that they are not randomly scattered but can be clustered in different sites. Fig. 3 illustrates the seven sites that have been identified. W4 occupies roughly the position of backbone NH in the sites where the connecting loop between blades does not come into contact with the fucose. Interestingly, almost none of these water molecules establish hydrogen bond directly to the protein but are rather in contact with other water molecules from the solvent. The only exception, W7, stabilizes the α-anomer in site IV (see below), by bridging the O-1a to the OH of Tyr241 in both A and B monomers.Fig. 3Superposition of all 10 binding sites, with only one fucose represented. The seven clusters of water molecules have been indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since the six β-propeller blades are not identical, there are some differences between the five binding sites (Fig. 2). First, fucose is not bound in the same configuration in the different sites. In both monomers, the sugar in binding sites I, III, and V adopts the β-configuration (equatorial O-1), whereas it is bound in the α-configuration (axial O-1) in binding site IV. In binding site II, both anomers can be identified in the electron density with an α/β population of 35/65 and 55/45 in monomers A and B, respectively. This selection of anomeric configuration can be correlated to differences in the architecture of the binding sites. The number of hydrogen bonds between fucose and protein varies from five to seven: five in sites I, III, and V; six in site IV; and seven in site II. When looking at the differences between individual binding sites, it appears that I, III, and V are very similar. In these three sites, hydroxyl groups O-1 and O-2 of the fucose ligand are exposed to the solvent and do not participate in binding to the protein. On the other hand, in binding sites II and IV, the outermost external β-strand of the blade is oriented slightly differentially, and the beginning of the interblade connecting loops is in contact with fucose. This results in hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group at O-2 and the backbone amide nitrogen of Gln101 and Gly203 in sites II and IV, respectively. In"

In this study we characterize the cytotoxic effect of phenoxodiol, a synthetic anticancer drug analog of genestein, and demonstrate the mechanism of action by which phenoxodiol affects the components of the Fas apoptotic pathway on ovarian cancer cells. Primary ovarian cancer cells, isolated from ascitic fluids of ovarian cancer patients, resistant to conventional chemotherapy, undergo apoptosis following phenoxodiol treatment. This effect is dependent upon the activation of the caspase system, inhibiting XIAP, an inhibitor of apoptosis, and disrupting FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP) expression through the Akt signal transduction pathway. We suggest that phenoxodiol is an efficient inducer of cell death in ovarian cancer cells and sensitizes the cancer cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. We identified FLIP and XIAP signalling pathways as key factors regulating the survival of ovarian cancer cells. These findings demonstrate a novel nontoxic drug that controls FLIP/XIAP function and has the potential to eliminate tumor cells through Fas-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2032407233,"Transfer RNA (tRNA) canonically has the clover-leaf secondary structure with the acceptor, D, anticodon, and T arms, which are folded into the L-shaped tertiary structure. To strengthen the L form, posttranscriptional modifications occur on nucleotides buried within the core, but the modification enzymes are paradoxically inaccessible to them in the L form. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of tRNA bound with archaeosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylase, which modifies G15 of the D arm in the core. The bound tRNA assumes an alternative conformation (“λ form”) drastically different from the L form. All of the D-arm secondary base pairs and the canonical tertiary interactions are disrupted. Furthermore, a helical structure is reorganized, while the rest of the D arm is single stranded and protruded. Consequently, the enzyme precisely locates the exposed G15 in the active site, by counting the nucleotide number from G1 to G15 in the λ form."

A total of 61 significantly up- or downregulated (2.0-fold) genes were identified and further validated by RT-PCR analysis as well as microarray comparisons with a spontaneously ERBB2- overexpressing breast cancer cell line and ERBB2-positive primary breast tumors. The expression and clinical relevance of proteins predicted to be associated with ERBB2 overexpression in breast cancers were analysed together with their clinical relevance by antibody screening using a tissue array. Differentially regulated genes include those involved in cell-matrix interactions including proline 4-hydroxylase (P4HA2), galectin 1 (LGALS1) and galectin 3 (LGALS3), fibronectin 1 (FN1) and p-cadherin (CDH3), and cell proliferation (CRIP1, IGFBP3) and transformation (S100P, S100A4). A number of genes associated with MYC signalling were also differentially expressed, including NDRG1, USF2 and the epithelial membrane proteins 1 and 3 (EMP1, EMP3). These data represent profiles of the transcriptional changes associated with ERBB2-related pathways in the breast, and identify novel and potentially useful targets for prognosis and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2015249201,"Exonic sequence variations may induce exon inclusion or exclusion from the mature mRNA by disrupting exonic regulatory elements and/or by affecting a nuclear reading frame scanning mechanism. We have carried out a systematic study of the effect on cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator exon 9 splicing of natural and site-directed sequence mutations. We have observed that changes in the splicing pattern were not related to the creation of premature termination codons, a fact that indicates the lack of a significant nuclear check of the reading frame in this system. In addition, the splice pattern could not be predicted by available Ser/Arg protein matrices score analysis. An extensive site-directed mutagenesis of the 3' portion of the exon has identified two juxtaposed splicing enhancer and silencer elements. The study of double mutants at these regulatory elements showed a complex regulatory activity. For example, one natural mutation (146C) enhances exon inclusion and overrides all of the downstream silencing mutations except for a C to G transversion (155G). This unusual effect is explained by the creation of a specific binding site for the inhibitory splicing factor hnRNPH. In fact, on the double mutant 146C-155G, the silencing effect is dominant. These results indicate a strict dependence between the two juxtaposed enhancer and silencer sequences and show that many point mutations in these elements cause changes in splicing efficiency by different mechanisms."

Such a process occurs during tissue injury when the composition and integrity of the ECM are altered in several significant ways (3Davis G.E. Bayless K.J. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). A central component of the ECM, which regulates adhesion-dependent survival signaling, is the adhesive glycoprotein fibronectin (FN) (4Sechler J.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol.

FN binds to cell-surface matrix receptors, primarily the α5β1 integrins, through the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) cell-binding site within the Type III10 domain. The importance of the RGD cell-binding domain in adhesion-mediated cell survival has been demonstrated by employing synthetic peptides containing the RGD motif, which induce apoptosis in many cell types, by acting as competitive inhibitors of FN-integrin interaction and activators of caspase 3 (5Hadden H.L.

A comparable scenario may occur in wounding and inflammatory conditions, whereby fragmentation of FN can lead to detachment-induced apoptosis (5Hadden H.L. Henke C.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

However, the RGD cell-binding domain of FN is not sufficient in isolation to regulate cell survival, which must be sustained by other critical FN domains such as the C-terminal heparin-binding domain (HepII) (7Jeong J.

Evidence is also accumulating to suggest that changes in the molecular structure and composition of the FN matrix may provide new signals to regulate cell shape, migration, and proliferation. Alterations to the conformation of FN either by multimerization (10Aeschlimann D. Thomazy V. Connect. Tissue Res. 2000; 41: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) or heterotypic association with other matrix molecules (11Pereira M Rybarczyk B.J. Odrljin T.M. Hocking D.C. Sottile J.

Modulation of the FN matrix may therefore also be fundamental in the regulation of adhesion-related apoptosis. One protein that binds with high affinity specialized FN domains and modulates the function of FN is tissue-type transglutaminase (tTG, TG-2) (10Aeschlimann D. Thomazy V. Connect.

In the current study we have explored the involvement of tTG in FN-mediated cell survival, starting with the hypothesis that the ECM function of tTG is strictly dependent on its association with FN, and that tTG and FN reciprocally modulate each others functions following complex formation. We report that FN-bound tTG supports a novel RGD-independent cell adhesion process, which is mediated by the direct binding of tTG to the cell surface through a mechanism that is critically dependent on cell-surface heparan sulfate and activation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα). We describe that FN-bound tTG, but not FN, can rescue tTG-deficient mouse dermal fibroblasts from apoptosis induced by inhibition of RGD-dependent cell adhesion (anoikis), with maintenance of cell viability. Our findings suggest that matrix FN with bound tTG is functionally distinct from either protein acting in isolation and suggest a novel RGD-independent pathway that may be important in cell survival under conditions of cell damage/stress. Reagents and Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies included anti-integrin β1 (JB1A) and α5 (PID6) (Chemicon); vinculin and tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich); and tTG (Cub74) (NeoMarkers). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies included anti-human fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-human Tyr(p)397-FAK (Upstate Biotechnology). The tTG inhibitor R283 (19Balklava Z. Verderio E. Collighan R. Gross S. Adams J. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16567-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was synthesized by R. Saint and I. Coutts, Nottingham Trent University. Purified guinea pig liver tTG was either obtained by Sigma-Aldrich or purified according to Leblanc et al. (29Leblanc A. Day N. Menard A. Keillor J.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Human plasma FN and FN proteolytic fragments, GTPγ-S, and synthetic RGD-specific peptides (GRGDTP and GRGDSP) were from Sigma-Aldrich and control RAD peptide (GRADSP) was from Calbiochem. Heparitinase (EC4.2.2.8) was from Sigma-Aldrich, and chondroitinase ABC (protease-free) from Seikagaku Corporation. The PKCα inhibitor GO6976 was from Calbiochem. Cell Lines—Primary human osteoblasts (HOB) were provided by S. Downes (University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) as we previously described (30Verderio E. Coombes A. Jones R.A. Li X. Heath D. Downes S. Griffin M. J. Biomed. Mat. Res. 2000; 54: 294-304Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Swiss 3T3 albino fibroblasts were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). Transfected Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, displaying inducible expression of tTG (clone TG3), were cultured and induced as described by Verderio et al. (22Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Primary mouse dermal fibroblasts (MDF) were isolated from the skin of tTG-deficient (MDF-TG-/-) and wild type (MDF-TG+/+) 9-months-old mice and maintained as described by De Laurenzi and Melino (31De Laurenzi V. Melino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Immobilization of TG on FN and Amino-terminal FN Fragments—96-well plates were coated with human plasma FN (5 μg/ml) or with the 70 kDa (42 μg/ml), 45 kDa (54 μg/ml), and 30 kDa (54 μg/ml) proteolytic fragments of FN in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 μl/well, by incubation at 4 °C for ∼15 h. Concentrations of FN and FN fragments were optimal to saturate tissue culture plastic (TCP), as measured by an ELISA-based assay with polyclonal anti-FN antibody (1/5000) followed by peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1/5000). FN fragments were in a 30-, 60-, and 90-fold stoichiometric excess, respectively, of control FN. For tTG immobilization, the FN solution was removed, the wells were washed once in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then incubated with purified guinea pig liver tTG (20 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mm EDTA, 100 μl/well. After 1 h at 37 °C, the tTG solution was removed and wells were washed once in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and once in serum-free culture medium before cell seeding. In some experiments FN-coated plates were blocked with 3% (w/v) lipid milk protein (Marvel) in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, prior to tTG immobilization. The presence of tTG immobilized on FN was confirmed by an ELISA-type assay using Cub74 as we previously described (26Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transamidating activity of the immobilized tTG was determined by the incorporation of biotinylated cadaverine into FN as previously described (26Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and compared with the activity of free tTG standard. Data are expressed as absorbance 450 nm with 5 mm Ca2+ in the reaction buffer minus background absorbance values with 5 mm EDTA. Cell Adhesion Assay—Exponentially growing cells were detached using 0.25% (w/v) trypsin in 5 mm EDTA, collected into medium containing a ∼7% (v/v) fetal calf serum, washed twice with medium without fetal calf serum, and then plated onto 96-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well), coated with FN or FN fragments, with and without immobilized tTG. After a maximum of 20 min incubation (to minimize the secretion of any endogenous protein) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, cells were fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with May Grunwald and Giemsa stain (26Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases cells were pre-treated for 15 h with 1 mm cycloheximide before plating, to rule out any effects of endogenous secreted adhesion molecules. Digital images of 3 non-overlapping fields covering the central portion of each well were captured using a video digital camera (Olympus DP10) and examined using the Image Analysis program Scion Image (National Institute of Health). At least 9 images of separate fields per sample were examined for a total of at least 400 cells in the FN control. The number of attached cell particles in each field was measured by “thresholding” and “particle analysis” and the spread cells by “density slicing.” Cytoskeletal Staining—Actin stress fibers were visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled phalloidin and focal adhesions by staining for vinculin. Cells were seeded in 0.79-cm2-wells of chamber slides (8 × 104 cells/well) previously coated with FN and tTG-FN and allowed to adhere for ∼20 min. Cells were fixed using 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. For actin stress fibers, cells were then blocked in PBS buffer supplemented with 5% (w/v) dry milk and then incubated with FITC-labeled phalloidin (20 μg/ml) in blocking buffer. For localization of vinculin, cells were blocked in PBS buffer containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (1:100) in blocking buffer. Bound antibody was revealed by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:100) (Dako) in blocking buffer. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield mountant containing propidium iodide (Vector Laboratories) and examined by laser confocal microscopy using a Leica TCSNT system (Leica Lasertechnik). Consecutive scanning sections (∼2 μm) from the upper to the lower attachment site of cells were overlaid as an extended focus image, and imaged cells (from at least 8 random fields, at least 100 cells in FN control) were scored for actin stress fiber formation with the aid of the Leica TCSNT (version 1.5-451) image processing menu. Inhibition of Integrin-mediated Cell Adhesion—Cells in suspension (2 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with GRGDTP synthetic peptide (32Dedhar S. Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (50 μg/ml, ∼75 μm, 100 μg/ml ∼150 μm, or 200 μg/ml ∼300 μm). Some experiments were reproduced using the FN-prototype GRGDSP peptide. Alternatively, cells in suspension (2 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with function blocking anti-integrin antibodies (JB1A, 40 μg/ml; and P1D6, 30 μg/ml). All incubations were performed in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 10 min. Afterwards cells were seeded in the presence of either the competitive RGD peptides or the anti-integrin antibodies. Cell Treatment with C3 Exotranferase—Clostridium botulinum C3 exotransferase (Biomol) (20 μg/ml) was incubated with LipofectAMINE (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) in DMEM at 22 °C for 1 h. After that the complex was diluted 10 times in DMEM and added to duplicate 18-h-old cell monolayers (∼80% confluent) in serum-free medium. After 2 h the medium was removed, cells were allowed to recover for ∼30 min in serum-containing DMEM, and then were seeded in 0.79-cm2-wells of chamber slides (45 × 103 cells/well). Quantification of Anoikis and Measurement of Cell Viability—For fluorochrome labeling of DNA strand breaks, 6 × 105 cells were seeded in duplicate in 9.6-cm2-wells pre-coated with FN or tTG-FN in the presence or absence of RGD peptide. After 15 h incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, all cells (adhered and non-adhered) were collected, washed twice in PBS, resuspended at the final concentration of 1.2 × 107 cells/ml, and fixed in suspension by addition of one volume of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate buffer for 2 min on ice (to minimize loss of fragmented DNA). Cells were labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and FITC-dUTP, using a TUNEL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). The fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry using a Beckman Coulter EPICS XL. Cells were collected and data stored and analyzed using the software SYSTEM II and WinMDI2.8. DNA fragmentation was also detected by in situ analysis of nuclei following TUNEL, by confocal fluorescent microscopy. Cells found in suspension were fixed and labeled in triplicate on 0.79-cm2-wells of glass slides (∼5 × 104 cells/well). For quantification, the Leica confocal software was used to acquire 3 random images per well for a total of 9 images per experimental sample using a fixed protocol (with constant photo-multiplier tube and section-depth setting). Data are expressed as mean number of apoptotic cells per well. Cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric assay based on the metabolism of the tetrazolium salt XTT (Roche), after an incubation period of 4 h with XTT. Data are expressed as absorbance values at 492 nm after subtraction of values at 690 nm. Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. and represent one of at least 3 separate experiments undertaken in triplicate, unless stated otherwise. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student's t test (two-tailed distribution, two-sample equal variance). Differences described as significant in the text correspond to p < 0.05. Tissue Transglutaminase Bound to FN Supports RGD-independent Cell Adhesion of Different Cell Types—Previous work using fluorescent microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated a close association of tTG with FN at the cell surface/pericellular matrix (20Gaudry C.A. Verderio E. Aeschlimann D. Cox A. Smith C. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30707-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), consistent with the in vitro-specific binding of the enzyme with human plasma FN (13Radek J.T. Jeong J.M.

Murthy S.N. Lorand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7880-7885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate how tTG in complex with FN affects FN cell adhesion, we first bound purified guinea pig liver tTG to human plasma FN coated onto tissue culture plastic (TCP). EDTA was included in the reaction to inhibit tTG transamidating activity. Measurement of binding by an ELISA-type assay showed that FN, immobilized at the saturating concentration of 5 μg/ml, bound a saturating amount of tTG when incubated with 20 μg/ml free tTG (Fig. 1A). Using this initial matrix model of immobilized FN with bound tTG (tTG-FN), the contribution tTG to FN cell adhesion was examined by inhibiting integrin-mediated RGD-dependent cell adhesion with competitive concentrations of soluble RGD peptides. HOBs were selected as the initial cell model because they preferentially adhere on FN in vitro, demonstrate an enhanced spread morphology on biomaterials coated with tTG-FN (33Heath D.J. Christian P. Griffin M. Biomaterials. 2002; 23: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and are characterized by a well defined pattern of integrin cell-surface receptors, consisting mainly of RGD-binding β1 subunit paired with α1, α2, α3, α5, and αV subunits (34Gronthos S. Stewart K. Graves S.E. Hay S. Simmons P.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the absence of RGD peptide, attachment to tTG-FN was comparable with FN (Fig. 1B, upper panel), although cell spreading appeared to be enhanced on tTG-FN (Fig. 1B, lower panel). At 50 and 100 μg/ml RGD peptide, attachment on FN was significantly reduced (typically to 30-50% of control values on FN) (Fig. 1B, upper panel), but attachment to tTG-FN was not significantly inhibited at these same RGD peptide concentrations. Cell attachment to tTG-FN in the presence of 100 μg/ml RGD peptide was 85-95% of control cell attachment to FN without RGD peptide. Only at 200 μg/ml was cell attachment to tTG-FN significantly lower in comparison to control FN without RGD peptide. At this higher concentration, the RGD peptide may in part act nonspecifically, because the control RAD peptide also led to a small reduction in cell attachment at 200 μg/ml (Fig. 1B, upper inset). Incubation of cells with RGD peptide significantly reduced cell spreading on FN (Fig. 1B, lower panel), typically to 10-50% of control value at 100 μg/ml RGD peptide, but as for cell attachment, cell spreading was only partially reduced on tTG-FN at 50 and 100 μg/ml RGD peptide (usually to 65-85% of control values on FN). Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts displayed a comparable response to HOB cells on the tTG-FN complex. Attachment (Fig. 1C, upper panel) and spreading (Fig. 1C, lower panel) of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts to FN was significantly decreased with excess RGD peptide, in a more sensitive way than in osteoblasts (typically to 25-35% of control at 100 μg/ml RGD peptide), but was restored to control levels when cells were seeded onto tTG-FN at 50 and 100 μg/ml RGD peptide. An epithelial-like cell line (ECV304) also adhered more efficiently on tTG-FN than FN in the presence of excess RGD peptide (Fig. Suppl. 1). When cells were seeded onto TCP coated with tTG without prior immobilization of FN, cell attachment was found to be negligible at concentrations ranging from 20 to 50 μg/ml of tTG, in the absence or presence of competitive RGD peptide (Fig. 1C). Plates were coated with saturating amounts of FN, and blocking of FN-coated wells with 3% nonfat milk protein prior to tTG immobilization did not affect RGD-independent cell attachment and spreading supported by the tTG-FN matrix formed in the absence of blocking (data not shown). These findings clearly indicate that the complex of tTG bound to FN is the essential component for the RGD-independent cell adhesion to occur.

https://openalex.org/W2085707729,"Signaling proteins from the same family can have markedly different roles in a given cellular context. Here, we show that expression of one hundred constitutively active human small GTPases induced cell morphologies that fell into nine distinct classes. We developed an algorithm for pairs of classes that predicted amino acid positions that can be exchanged to create mutants with switched functionality. The algorithm was validated by creating switch-of-function mutants for Rac1, CDC42, H-Ras, RalA, Rap2B, and R-Ras3. Contrary to expectations, the relevant residues were mostly outside known interaction surfaces and were structurally far apart from each other. Our study shows that specificity in protein families can be explored by combining genome-wide experimental functional classification with the creation of switch-of-function mutants."

Recombinant IIGP1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Here we present a detailed biochemical characterization of IIGP1 using various biochemical and biophysical methods. IIGP1 binds to GTP and GDP with dissociation constants in the micromolar range with at least 10 times higher affinity for GDP than for GTP. IIGP1 hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, and the GTPase activity is concentration-dependent with a GTP turnover rate of 2 min–1 under saturating protein concentrations.

The higher relative affinity for GDP and the relatively low GTPase activity distinguish IIGP1, but this study clearly adds IIGP1 and thus the p47 GTPases to the small group of cooperative GTPase families that appear to characterize the development of intracellular resistance during the interferon response to infection.

The present analysis provides essential parameters to understand the molecular mechanism by which IIGP1 participates in this complex resistance program. Interferons are immunomodulatory cytokines induced either directly by virus infection or by immune and inflammatory stimuli. Type I interferons are secreted by virus-infected tissue cells and by certain activated immune cells such as dendritic cells. Type II or γ-interferon is secreted largely by activated effectors of the innate and adaptive immune systems (natural killer cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes). Interferons stimulate the transcription of several hundred genes belonging to partially overlapping sets (1Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). This complex cellular response resolves into a series of programs contributing in different ways to mechanisms of organismal and cellular resistance to pathogens, and this generalization holds for three described families of interferon-inducible GTPases. The antiviral Mx proteins induced exclusively by type I interferons were the first to be characterized (2Haller O. Kochs G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). More recently, members of two further families, the p65 (guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GBP, guanylate-binding protein; mant, 2′,3′-O-N-methylanthraniloyl; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; mGTPγS, mant-GTPγS; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)-triphosphate; mGpp(NH)p, mant-Gpp(NH)p; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; mGDP, mant-GDP; GST, glutathione S-transferase.) and the p47 GTPases (3Boehm U.

Presently, with the possible exception of MxA (2Haller O. Kochs G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), no explanation is available to connect the biochemical activity of these GTPases with their adaptive function in pathogen resistance. A member of the p65 GTPases from human cells, hGBP1, has been shown to block viral replication and endothelial cell proliferation (4Anderson S.L. Carton J.M. Lou J. Xing L. Rubin B.Y.

Nature. 2000; 403: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). hGBP1 binds to GTP, GDP and GMP with equal affinity and hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and GMP. The GTPase activity of hGBP1 is stimulated at higher protein concentrations, and the presence of GTP or Gpp(NH)p favors the formation of oligomers. The nucleotide-free and the Gpp(NH)p-bound structures reveal many similarities and differences from other GTP-binding proteins. The high intrinsic GTPase activity, the cooperative hydrolytic behavior, and structural properties have suggested that hGBP1, representing the p65 GTPases, may be a functional and possibly also structural model for the family of large GTPases including Mx and dynamin (2Haller O. Kochs G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 14Danino D. Hinshaw J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition to cooperative GTPase activity, all of these GTPase families share the property of self-assembly into oligomers and higher order multimers, sometimes on specific templates such as lipid membranes in the case of dynamins (15Eccleston J.F.

The binding of GTP to these structures causes conformational changes that have been correlated with function and favors further self-assembly under some conditions (15Eccleston J.F. Binns D.D.

A critical and still unresolved issue with respect to dynamins is whether they function as conventional regulatory GTPases or as mechanochemical enzymes (20Song B.D. Schmid S.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In view of the proposed structural relationship between the protein families, the resolution of this issue will probably have implications not only for the function of dynamin but also for the mode of action of its interferon-inducible relatives, Mx and the p65 GBPs. The data that follow now add the p47 GTPases to this list. IIGP1, with which this study is concerned, is a member of the p47 γ-interferon-inducible GTPase family. The mouse p47 GTPases so far described form a distinct family with no sequence homology to other GTPases outside the GTP-binding region (3Boehm U. Guethlein L. Klamp T. Ozbek K. Schaub A. Futterer A.

The p47 GTPases have all three GTP-binding motifs GXXXXGKS (P-loop), DXXG, and (N/T)KXD clearly marked, unlike the p65 GTPase, hGBP1, where the base specificity-related (N/T)KXD motif is functionally replaced by a different structure (11Praefcke G.J. Geyer M. Schwemmle M. Robert K.H. Herrmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Four members of the p47 GTPase family have been shown to mediate specific resistance to intracellular pathogens. Fibroblasts stably expressing the p47 GTPase TGTP have reduced susceptibility to cytopathic effects of vesicular stomatitis virus but not of herpes simplex virus (5Carlow D.A. Teh S.J. Teh H.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2348-2355PubMed Google Scholar). Mice with targeted disruptions of other p47 GTPases like IGTP, IRG-47, or LRG-47 are all strikingly susceptible to Toxoplasma gondii infection; in addition, the last also shows susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes infection (6Collazo C.M.

In anticipation of a structural analysis of IIGP1, we here present a quantitative analysis of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by the purified recombinant protein. IIGP1 is stable in the absence of nucleotides and has a relatively low affinity for guanine nucleotides in the micromolar range. The protein has higher affinity for GDP than for GTP, reflecting a higher dissociation rate for GTP. IIGP1 has low basal GTPase activity that is elevated at higher concentrations of the protein, suggesting cooperative behavior. When nucleotide-free or in the presence of GDP, IIGP1 behaves as a monomer, but it oligomerizes in the presence of GTP or with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p. In summary, these properties place IIGP1 in the same functional category as Mx and GBP, the other large interferon-inducible GTPases. However, the distinctive properties of IIGP1 could serve as a key to understand the mechanism of action of this novel GTPase and its function in cell-autonomous pathogen resistance. A 1.2-kilobase restriction fragment of IIGP1 containing the complete coding sequence and artificial SalI linkers was ligated into SalI-digested 4.9-kilobase pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.4, and IIGP1 was expressed as a GST fusion protein upon overnight induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at 23 °C. The cells were harvested and resuspended with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm EDTA, 200 μm Pefabloc (Roth) and were lysed using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp.) at a pressure of 600 kilopascals. The soluble fraction was purified in a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer 1 (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mm dithioerythritol). The GST domain was cleaved by overnight incubation of the protein with thrombin (10 units/ml from Serva) on the resin at 4 °C. The free IIGP1 was eluted with buffer 1 and was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The protein was further subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer 2 (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithioerythritol). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing IIGP1 were concentrated to 50 mg/ml by a centrifugal concentrator (Vivascience) with a 10-kDa cut-off filter. Aliquots were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The concentration of IIGP1 was determined by UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm with the calculated molar absorption coefficient of 35,230 m–1 cm–1, based on the number of tyrosine, tryptophan, and cysteine residues (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Three versions of the IIGP1 protein are described in this paper, which differ at the C terminus, as shown in Table I. All three proteins were prepared and released from the glutathione affinity matrix by digestion of the GST fusion with thrombin as described above and carry the extension GSPGIPGSTT at the N terminus. The IIGP1-m protein originated from a cloning artifact; it differs from the wild-type by a 2-residue C-terminal truncation followed by the addition of 11 extra C-terminal residues. IIGP1-his has 6 histidine residues originally introduced as a C-terminal epitope tag.Table IDescription of the IIGP1 constructsN terminusC terminusIIGP1-wtGSPGIPGSTT-MGQ etc.-CLRNIIGP1-mGSPGIPGSTT-MGQ etc.-CL-KLGRLERPHRDIIGP1-hisGSPGIPGSTT-MGQ etc.-CLRN-HHHHHH Open table in a new tab Three independent approaches were taken to measure the nucleotide binding properties of IIGP1. Two of these relied on the use of 2′,3′-O-N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-modified nucleotides. Mant nucleotides were used as fluorescent probes, since they exhibit protein-binding properties similar to those of natural nucleotides. The increase in mant fluorescence upon binding of the nucleotides to proteins has been extensively used for the study of nucleotide binding interactions with GTPases. The mant nucleotides used in our study (mGDP, mGTP, and the nonhydrolyzable analogues mGTPγS and mGpp(NH)p) were synthesized and subsequently purified by ion exchange chromatography as described in Ref. 22Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7420-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar. The purity of the nucleotides was analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography. The concentration of the nucleotides was determined by using molar absorption coefficients as described above. Aluminum fluoride solutions were prepared by the addition of 300 μm aluminum chloride and 10 mm sodium fluoride. The formation of AlF3 and AlF4- complexes is a pH-dependent process, therefore denoted here as AlFx (23Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All experiments were done with buffer 2 at 20 °C unless specified. Stopped Flow—In stopped-flow experiments, at least a 5:1 ratio of protein to nucleotide concentrations were mixed together, providing conditions for pseudo-first-order binding kinetics. The time course of the increase in mant fluorescence upon binding of the protein to the mant nucleotides was recorded (SM-17; Applied Photophysics). Mant fluorescence was excited at 360 nm and monitored through a 405-nm cut-off filter. In each case, a single exponential function could be fitted to the data, yielding the observed rate constant k obs. A linear fit of the plot of k obs versus protein concentration was obtained, the slope of the curve denoting the association rate constant (k on) and the intercept showing the dissociation rate constant (k off). The K d values are calculated from the ratio of k off and k on. Equilibrium Measurements—IIGP1 protein was titrated against mant nucleotides. The mant nucleotides (0.5 μm) were excited at 360 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored at 430 nm (Fluoromax 2; Spex Industries). The increase in fluorescence upon the stepwise addition of the protein was measured, and at each step the values were averaged over 1 min. The equilibrium dissociation constants, K d, were obtained by fitting a quadratic function to the data as described in Ref. 24Herrmann C. Nassar N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (Microcal Inc.) was used to measure the binding of nonlabeled nucleotides to IIGP1. The heat of binding was detected upon the stepwise addition of nucleotide into a cell containing the protein. The data were fitted using the manufacturer's software, yielding the enthalpy of the reaction, the dissociation constant (K d), and the stoichiometry factor (N) as described in Ref. 25Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar. Different concentrations of GTP and protein were mixed and incubated at 37 °C in buffer 2. At different time points, aliquots were removed and subjected to reverse-phase HPLC analysis for GTP and GDP. Samples were run under isocratic conditions on a C18 column (0.4 × 25 cm filled with 5-μm ODS Hypersil; Bischoff, Leonberg, Germany) with a C18 prefilter (10 × 4.6 mm with 5-μm ODS Hypersil) in 7.5% acetonitrile in buffer 3 (10 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide, 100 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 6.5), 0.2 mm NaN3) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Nucleotides were detected at 252 nm in a UV absorption detector (Beckman System Gold 166). The concentration-dependent GTPase activity of the three forms of IIGP1 protein (Table I) was measured at a GTP concentration of 700 μm and at a range of protein concentrations. Dynamic light scattering was performed using a DynaPro molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions) equipped with a temperature control unit. The sample was filtered through a microsampler syringe, where 50 μl of the sample was passed through a filtering device using a 0.02-μm filter into a 12-μl Quartz cuvette. The sample (either protein alone or protein with different nucleotides) in buffer 2 was illuminated by a 25-milliwatt, 750-nm wavelength solid state laser. The time scale of scattered light intensity fluctuation for each measurement was evaluated by autocorrelation, from which the translational diffusion coefficient (D T) was calculated. The M r was estimated from the hydrodynamic radius Rh, which was derived from D T using the Stokes-Einstein equation and the sample temperature (T = 4 °C) using the standard curve of M r versus Rh for globular proteins. The data was analyzed by Dynamics 4.0 and Dyna LS software. A qualitative measurement to show oligomerization was also done in a conventional fluorescence spectrometer, where the sample (50 μm IIGP1-wt and 1 mm nucleotide) was excited at 350 nm and monitored at the same wavelength. IIGP1-wt, IIGP1-m, and IIGP1-His (see Table I) were expressed as N-terminal GST fusion proteins in E. coli BL-21 cells. Fig. 1 shows the purification of IIGP1-m. The incubation conditions were adjusted to maximize the yield of soluble proteins by varying the concentration of IPTG, temperature, time of induction, and cell density. A large fraction of the expressed protein was insoluble even under the best conditions, as shown in Fig. 1 (lane 2). However, a significant portion was soluble (lane 1) and was purified as described (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the GST domain of the fusion protein was cleaved by incubation with thrombin on the resin (lane 4). The eluted protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (lane 6). The purified protein was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC and found to be nucleotide-free. Equilibrium Titrations—The binding parameters of IIGP1-m for guanine nucleotides were determined at equilibrium in titrations of protein against constant mant nucleotides. Fig. 2a shows the titration curve for the increase in fluorescence upon the binding of mant-GDP (mGDP) to IIGP1-m. IIGP1-m was added from a 600 μm stock solution, and at each step the values for the increase in fluorescence were averaged over a period of 1 min. Dissociation constants were calculated from curves fitted to the data following Ref. 24Herrmann C. Nassar N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. The K d value for nucleotide binding is in the micromolar range, and mGDP shows higher affinity than mGTPγS (Table II). mGpp(NH)p, another nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, shows weak binding in comparison with the other nucleotides (K d of ∼130 μm). Interestingly, we could not detect any increase in fluorescence upon the addition of aluminum fluoride (AlFx) to IIGP1.mGDP solution (data not shown), and in confirmation, no decrease in the dissociation rate of mGDP could be detected by stopped flow in the presence of AlFx. Thus, monomeric IIGP1 in free solution in the presence of GDP appears not to be able to stabilize the transition state of GTP hydrolysis through binding of AlFx.Table IIK d value (μ m) for the binding of fluorescent and nonfluorescent nucleotides and GTP analogues to IIGP1-m by different methodsNucleotidesEquilibrium titrationsCalorimetric titrationsStopped flowGDP2.45mGDP0.900.97mGTP16.1mGTPγS5.2015.7mGppNHp130GTPγS8.0 Open table in a new tab The interactions of unlabeled GDP and GTPγS with IIGP1-m were additionally measured by isothermal titration calorimetry in order to investigate possible interference of the mant group in the fluorescence-based binding assay. Fig. 2b (upper lane) shows the raw data for binding upon the stepwise addition of GDP to IIGP1-m. The exothermic process is reflected in a negative power pulse from which the heat of the reaction is calculated by integration. The enthalpy of the reaction normalized to the concentration of injected GDP was plotted against the molar ratio of GDP and IIGP1-m as shown in the lower panel. The parameters defining the theoretical curve yielded a K d for this interaction of 2.5 μm and an enthalpy of association of –15 kcal/mol. In addition, 1:1 stoichiometry is evident from the data. The results from Table II suggest that the mant modification does not significantly influence the binding affinity of GDP and GTPγS for IIGP1. Dynamics of Nucleotide Binding—The dynamics of mant nucleotide binding to IIGP1 were determined by stopped flow. mGTPγS was used to control for potential complications in the measurement of GTP binding caused by hydrolysis. No significant difference was seen (Tables II and III), no doubt due to the slow turnover of GTP by IIGP1 (see below). The IIGP1 protein was used in a large molar excess over the nucleotide in order to obtain pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics (shown for IIGP1-m in Fig. 3). A single exponential function was fitted to the data, where the resulting time constant corresponds to the inverse observed rate constant k obs (Fig. 3, upper inset). The observed rate constants for the binding of mGDP were plotted against IIGP1-m concentration. The slope of the straight line denotes the association rate constant (k on), and the intercept shows the dissociation rate constant (k off). k off was also measured in a displacement experiment by the addition of excess unlabeled nucleotide to IIGP1-mGDP preformed complex. This leads to a quasi-irreversible dissociation of mGDP and therefore to a single exponential decrease of fluorescence as shown in the lower inset in Fig. 3.Table IIIAssociation and dissociation rate constants and K d values for the binding of fluorescent nucleotides and non hydrolyzable analogues to IIGP1-wt/IIGP1-m/IIGP1-hisNucleotideskonk off (displacement)Kdμ m-1 s-1s-1μ mmGDPIIGP1-wt1.550.990.64IIGP1-m1.651.60.97IIGP1-his1.310.700.53mGTPIIGP1-wt0.9821.622IIGP1-m1.302116.1IIGP1-his14.2812.9mGTPγSIIGP1-m4.206615.7 Open table in a new tab The K d values of different nucleotides to IIGP1-m using equilibrium methods are compared with K d from stopped-flow experiments in Table II. The three different methods gave comparable results. The nucleotide binding affinities determined by stopped flow for the native IIGP1 protein and for the two forms varying at the C terminus (Table I) are shown in Table III. It is apparent that the K d values and the rate constants are similar for all three proteins, suggesting that the C terminus is not involved in nucleotide interaction with IIGP1 (see below). The association rate constants are similar for the different nucleotides, but the dissociation rate constants vary significantly. The smaller k off for mGDP accounts for the higher affinity compared with mGTP and mGTPγS, as observed in the equilibrium titrations described above (Table II). To summarize the results from three different methods and from the three C-terminal versions of IIGP1, the dissociation constant for GDP is ∼1 μm, whereas for GTP it is ∼15 μm. In all GTPases, the identity of the nucleotide bound to the protein and the rate of conversion of GTP to GDP by hydrolysis are crucial factors determining their functional regulation (26Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). We therefore document a detailed analysis of the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis by IIGP1. The rate of hydrolysis and product formation was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. The activity of the three forms of IIGP1 (IIGP1-wt, IIGP1-m, and IIGP1-his) at 2–100 μm was analyzed over GTP concentrations from 0.05 to 2 mm. ATP was not hydrolyzed, confirming nucleotide specificity and indicating that our preparations were free of phosphatases (data not shown). IIGP1 hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and not to GMP. A representative curve for the time course of GTP hydrolysis by IIGP1-wt is shown in Fig. 4a. The complete hydrolysis of 700 μm GTP to GDP with 50 μm IIGP1 at 37 °C is documented. The rate constant for GTP hydrolysis was obtained from the initial rates, since later values are affected by product inhibition. Magnesium ions were found to be essential for the GTPase reaction; severely impaired GTPase activity was observed in the presence of 10 mm EDTA (Fig. 4b). Surprisingly, in view of the results reported above, where GDP binding to IIGP1 could not be directly stabilized by AlFx, the hydrolysis of GTP by IIGP1 was greatly inhibited by the addition of AlFx, suggesting that there are conditions under which AlFx can stabilize the GDP-bound state and inhibit nucleotide exchange (Fig. 4b). The catalytic activity of IIGP1 at different protein and nucleotide concentrations was determined, as shown in Fig. 4c. The Michaelis-Menten equation was applied to a plot of specific activity (at a range of protein concentration) versus substrate concentration. Intriguingly, a small increase in K m was observed with increased protein concentration, suggesting functional cooperativity between IIGP1 molecules. In order to investigate the cooperativity effect more precisely, the dependence of the specific GTPase activity on IIGP1 concentration was measured at a fixed GTP concentration of 700 μm as shown in Fig. 4d (closed circles, IIGP1-m; open circles, IIGP1-wt). The maximum specific rate of GTP hydrolysis by IIGP1 was close to 2 min–1 (see Fig. 4c, where 50 μm IIGP1-m and 2 mm GTP was used). The increase in activity of the protein with an increase in protein concentration observed in the case of IIGP1-wt and IIGP1-m demonstrates a coop"

Wnt ligands bind to cell-surface Frizzled receptors, initiating a cytoplasmic signaling cascade that results in β-catenin stabilization, cytosolic accumulation, and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, β-catenin classically complexes with a member of the T-cell factor (TCF) family of transcription factors to activate target-gene transcription (34Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). However, recent studies indicate that β-catenin can interact directly with a variety of coregulator proteins and transcription factors, including CRE-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), the SMAD family of proteins, and the nuclear androgen receptor (AR) to enhance both TCF-dependent (35Takemaru K.I.

In situ hybridization has demonstrated that Wnt-4, Wnt-11, and Wnt-2b are all expressed in the adrenal cortex. Wnt 11 localizes to the definitive zone, while Wnt-2b localizes exquisitely to the subcapsular cells beneath the adrenal capsule (32Lako M. Strachan T. Bullen P. Wilson D.I. Robson S.C. Lindsay S.

Wnt-4 knockout mice die within 24 h postpartum due to severe urogenital abnormalities including kidney failure secondary to a failure of nephrogenesis (40Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Female Wnt-4 knockout mice demonstrated surprising masculinization of urogenital ridge structures due to the aberrant up-regulation of the SF-1 target genes Müllerian inhibitory substance and P450c17, and the resultant excess testosterone biosynthesis (29Vainio S. Heikkila M. Kispert A. Chin N. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1999; 397: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of the SF-1 target gene, P450c21 (critical for corticosterone biosynthesis) was observed in the gonads of Wnt-4-null mice. An increase in plasma corticosterone was also observed in Wnt-4-null mice. On the contrary, P450-aldosterone synthase and P450c17 (females only) expression were decreased in the embryonic adrenal of Wnt-4 knockout mice, supporting a role of Wnt-4 in the development of the organs arising from the urogenital ridge (31Heikkila M.

Recently, a patient with adrenal hypoplasia and male to female sex-reversal was shown to have a duplication of chromosomal locus 1p32-36, which contains the Wnt-4 gene. Up-regulation of the SF-1 target gene Dax-1 in cells from this patient suggests an interaction between SF-1 and Wnt signaling on the Dax-1 promoter (41Jordan B.K. Mohammed M. Ching S.T. Delot E.

Because knockout of the SF-1 target gene, α-inhibin results in a syndrome of gonadal and adrenal sex steroid excess similar to the Wnt-4-null mice, and transcription of α-inhibin, like Dax-1 (43Kawabe K.

In this article we have specifically explored the activation of SF-1-dependent transcription of the α-inhibin gene by β-catenin in the adrenal cortex. Cell Culture—JEG3 placental carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of JEG3 cells was performed using calcium phosphate coprecipitation (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ) according to the manufacturer's directions. Y1 adrenocortical carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% horse serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum.

Inhibin-Luc-ΔSF-1-RE was generated by introducing a point mutation in to the SF-1 binding site using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotides used to generate the ΔSF-1-RE mutant were: 5′-GTGGGAGATAAGGCTCAGTTCCACAGACATCTGCG-3′ and 5′-CAGGGCCACAGACATCTGTATCAGAGATAGGAGGTC-3′ (46Ito M. Park Y. Weck J. Mayo K.E. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 66-81PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—JEG3 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well into 12-well plates. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipitation (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ). Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection, and a luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was performed in triplicate on a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Luciferase assays were normalized for transfection efficiency by co-transfecting CMV-myc-LacZ and subsequent determination of β-galactosidase activity (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Nontransgenic virgin female mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 150 mm NaCl or 150 mm LiCl with an injection volume of 20 ml/kg (53Swank M. NeuroReport. 1999; 10: 3685-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At either two or three hours post-injection, adrenals were harvested and either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (for subsequent RNA isolation) or stored in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Adrenals from six to nine mice were pooled and minced by hand. The minced adrenals were collected into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by spinning at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Cell membranes were disrupted for 30 min at 4 °C using 400 μl of a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 at pH 7.6. Nuclei were isolated from cytoplasmic protein by spinning at 2500 rpm for 1 min. Nuclear proteins were extracted for 60 min at 4 °C using 500 μl of a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 350 mm NaCl. Insoluble proteins were removed by spinning at maximum speed for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Two hundred micrograms of total nuclear lysate for each condition were precleared with 10 μl (bed volume) of protein A/G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. Precleared nuclear extract was incubated with either rabbit polyclonal α-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit polyclonal α-SF-1 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 16 h at 4 °C with rotation. Subsequently, 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose was added to samples and incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 60 min. The samples were then washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Tris-HCl, 50 mm, pH 7.4; Nonidet P-40, 1%; sodium deoxycholate, 0.25%; NaCl, 150 mm; EDTA, 1 mm; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm; leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 μg/ml each; NaF, 1 mm). Immunoprecipates were resolved on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal α-β-catenin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the minor modification that isolated nuclei were used as starting material instead of whole cells. Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected into phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. Crude nuclei were isolated using the protocol described for co-immunoprecipitation assays. Nuclei were prepared in the SDS lysis buffer provided in the kit. Lysates were sonicated at 30% power, 5 × 10 s using a Sonic Dismembrator model 300 (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) to shear genomic DNA. The following antibodies were used to perform immunoprecipitations, polyclonal α-SF-1 (Upstate Biotechnology), polyclonal α-β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and polyclonal rabbit IgG antibodies (Pierce). PCR amplification of the proximal α-inhibin promoter region spanning the SF-1 response element was performed using the following primers: 5′-GGGGTGGTGCATTCTGTCCT-3′ and 5′-GCTGCCCTGTGCCCTTTCTGT-3′. 5 μl of extracted DNA and 35 rounds of amplification were used. PCR amplification of the distal α-inhibin promoter (–7.5 to –7 kb) was performed using the following primers: 5′-GGACCCCCACCAAGCCAACAGAC-3′ and 5′-TCAGCCCTACACCAGCACGCAGAC-3′. RNA Isolation and Quantitative PCR—Snap frozen adrenals from NaCl- or LiCl-injected mice (see “Co-Immunoprecipitation Assay” above) were manually disrupted using a mortar and pestle. Total cellular RNA was isolated using an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). One microgram of total cellular RNA was reverse-transcribed using the iScript Reverse Transcription Kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Quantitative PCR for α-inhibin transcript was performed on an Opticon Thermocycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen). The sequence of primers targeted against the α-inhibin cDNA were 5′-AAGACATGCCGTTGGGGGTTTCA-3′ and 5′-CTATTGGCGGCTGCTGTGCTCTTC-3′. 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as an internal standard using commercially available primers (Ambion, Austin, TX). SF-1 and β-Catenin Synergistically Activate the α-Inhibin Promoter—Based upon previous data suggesting a relationship between Wnt-dependent signaling pathways and SF-1-mediated transcription in adrenocortical and gonadal development, we examined the potential for Wnt-dependent signaling to participate in the regulation of SF-1-mediated transcription of the α-inhibin gene. It has previously been shown that SF-1 is capable of transcriptionally activating the rat α-inhibin promoter (46Ito M. Park Y. Weck J. Mayo K.E. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 66-81PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfection assays were performed to determine the ability of β-catenin, the downstream effector of Wnt signaling, to synergize with SF-1 in transcriptional activation of the α-inhibin gene. An α-inhibin-luciferase (Inh-luc) construct containing 2021 bp of the rat α-inhibin promoter driving luciferase was used in co-transfection assays. JEG3 placental carcinoma cells were co-transfected with the reporter plasmid and increasing doses of a constitutively active β-catenin mutant (S33Y) that cannot be phosphorylated by GSK-3β (54Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3465) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of SF-1. In the presence of SF-1, a dose-dependent increase in the activation of the reporter construct was observed (Fig. 1A). At maximal concentrations of S33Y tested, a 9-fold increase in activation was observed when compared with SF-1 alone. However, in the absence of SF-1, S33Y was unable to activate transcription of the Inh-luc reporter construct, demonstrating an absolute requirement of SF-1 for the transcriptional activation of the α-inhibin promoter by β-catenin. A Proximal 165-bp Cis-acting Element Is Sufficient for β-Catenin Transactivation of α-Inhibin—In order to determine the mechanism of activation of the α-inhibin promoter by β-catenin, we systematically analyzed this promoter in an attempt to identify putative TCF binding sites. A panel of serial deletions of the α-inhibin promoter fused to a luciferase reporter was utilized to locate the region of the promoter required for functional synergy between SF-1 and β-catenin. Co-transfection of each reporter construct in the presence or absence of SF-1 expression plasmid was performed with or without a maximal dose of β-catenin. These experiments demonstrated that β-catenin was capable of synergizing with SF-1 on all deletion constructs tested (Fig. 1B). In addition, β-catenin activated the –165-bp construct 6.5-fold over SF-1-stimulated activation, similar to both the –1641 bp construct and the full-length construct described in Fig. 1A. To further characterize this synergy, JEG3 cells were co-transfected with increasing amounts of S33Y and –165 Inh-luc in the presence or absence of SF-1. A dose-dependent increase in SF-1-mediated transcriptional activation, up to ∼4.5-fold, was observed in response to increasing quantities of S33Y (Fig. 1C). Similar to results obtained with full-length α-inhibin-luc, S33Y was barely able to activate transcription of the reporter plasmid in the absence of SF-1, confirming that the cis-acting element required for β-catenin synergy with SF-1 is located within the proximal 165 bp of the α-inhibin promoter and that SF-1 is required for β-catenin transcriptional activation of the α-inhibin promoter. The SF-1 RE Is Necessary and Sufficient for the Synergistic Activation of the α-Inhibin Promoter by β-Catenin and SF-1— Since the SF-1 response element (RE) resides within the proximal 165 bp of the α-inhibin promoter, we tested whether the SF-1 RE was an absolute requirement for the synergistic effects of β-catenin on the α-inhibin promoter. Previously, mutation of the SF-1 RE has been shown to result in loss of binding of SF-1 (46Ito M. Park Y. Weck J. Mayo K.E. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 66-81PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore introduced identical point mutations in this binding site in the context of the full-length reporter. As expected, disruption of the SF-1 RE resulted in the complete loss of SF-1-dependent activation of the reporter construct (Fig. 2A). In addition, S33Y was unable to transactivate the mutated promoter in either the absence or presence of SF-1, indicating that sequences between –165 and +1 are sufficient, and the SF-1 RE within this promoter region is necessary for the synergistic activation of the α-inhibin promoter by β-catenin and SF-1. In order to test whether the SF-1 RE was sufficient for synergy between SF-1 and β-catenin, we utilized a reporter construct containing 5 tandem copies of a consensus SF-1 RE driving the luciferase gene reporter (p-65-luc). β-catenin was able to transcriptionally synergize with SF-1 on this reporter construct in a dose-dependent manner, showing a 9-fold activation over SF-1 levels (Fig. 2B). As expected, β-catenin was unable to activate this reporter in the absence of SF-1. These data demonstrate that the SF-1 RE is a necessary and sufficient DNA promoter element for transcription synergy between SF-1 and β-catenin. TCF/Lef Is Not Required for the Synergy between SF-1 and β-Catenin on the α-Inhibin Promoter—Since β-catenin transactivation is classically propagated through TCF/Lef (lymphoid enhancer factor), we evaluated the potential role of TCF/Lef in the synergy between SF-1 and β-catenin. However, sequence analysis of the proximal 165 bases of the α-inhibin promoter did not reveal a strong consensus TCF/Lef binding site, and the sufficiency of the SF-1 RE for the synergy between SF-1 and β-catenin predicts a potential TCF-independent mechanism of β-catenin synergy. Using TOPFLASH, an artificial promoter containing three tandem consensus TCF binding sites as a positive control for TCF/Lef-mediated transcriptional response, co-transfection assays were performed. JEG3 cells were co-transfected with either (a) TOPFLASH, S33Y, and increasing quantities of TCF-4 or (b) Inh-luc, SF-1, S33Y, and increasi"

Physical and functional interactions among the Arp2/3 complex, VCA (a functional domain of N-WASP), and cortactin were examined under conditions that were with or without actin polymerization. In the absence of actin, cortactin binds significantly weaker to the Arp2/3 complex than VCA. At concentrations of VCA 20-fold lower than cortactin, the association of cortactin with the Arp2/3 complex was nearly abolished. Analysis of the cells infected with Shigella demonstrated that N-WASP located at the tip of the bacterium, whereas cortactin accumulated in the comet tail. Interestingly, cortactin promotes Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization and actin branching in the presence of VCA at a saturating concentration, and cortactin acquired 20 nm affinity for the Arp2/3 complex during actin polymerization. The interaction of VCA with the Arp2/3 complex was reduced in the presence of both cortactin and actin. Moreover, VCA reduced its affinity for Arp2/3 complex at branching sites that were stabilized by phalloidin.

Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 12Bailly M. Macaluso F. Cammer M. Chan A. Segall J.E. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The formation of branched actin filaments is presumably the result of actin assembly at an Arp2/3 complex that binds to an existing actin filament (9Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 13Amann K.J. Pollard T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the intrinsic actin nucleation activity of Arp2/3 complex is normally weak (9Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) and requires activation by binding to other cellular factors (6Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

All Arp2/3 activators have been reported to bind to actin as well. The Arp2/3 activators can be categorized into two distinct classes based on their actin binding properties. Members of the first group bind to the monomeric form of actin (G-actin), and include the WASP family proteins (WASP, Ref. 14Yarar D. To W. Abo A. Welch M.D. Curr.

Science. 1998; 281: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). These proteins are able to activate the Arp2/3 complex by recruiting G-actin to the proximity of Arp2 and Arp3 subunits, resulting in a heterogeneous nucleation site for actin assembly (7Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Members of the second group bind to filamentous actin (F-actin), and include the cortactin family proteins (cortactin, Refs. 21Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat.

The ability of these proteins to promote actin assembly, however, appears to be modest compared with the WASP-related proteins, and the significance of such modest activations remains unclear. Cortactin contains an N-terminal acidic domain that binds to the Arp2/3 complex and a central repeat domain consisting of 6.5 tandem repeats of unique 37 amino acids that binds to F-actin (21Uruno T.

Its C-terminal region contains a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain that associates with a variety of cellular proteins including CortBP1 (30Boeckers T.M. Kreutz M.R. Winter C. Zuschratter W. Smalla K.H.

Cortactin-like proteins have been also found in sea urchin, sponge, fruit fly, frog, chicken (35Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), mouse (36Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), indicating an established function of cortactin at a very early stage of evolution. In contrast, no myosin I- or Abp1-like proteins that contain the acidic motif required for Arp2/3 binding have been found in mammalian cells (38Machesky L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The only cortactin-related protein is HS1, a hematopoietic cell-specific protein, which also contains a similar N-terminal region, the repeat, and the C-terminal SH3 domains. The major difference between HS1 and cortactin is that HS1 has only 3.5 tandem repeats (23Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 34Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Taniuchi I. Akagi K. Yamamura K. Watanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

While WASP proteins potentiate strongly the actin nucleation activity of the Arp2/3 complex, the branched filaments formed by WASP and the Arp2/3 complex are unstable and quickly undergo debranching by a mechanism that is still not clear (10Blanchoin L. Amann K.J. Higgs H.N. Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 39Pantaloni D. Boujemaa R. Didry D. Gounon P. Carlier M.F. Nat.

Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11390-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cortactin has a modest activity for actin nucleation, but promotes significantly the formation of stable actin branches (22Weaver A.M. Karginov A.V. Kinley A.W. Weed S.A. Li Y. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 370-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 23Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, WASP and cortactin bind to the Arp2/3 complex through a similar structural domain consisting of multiple acidic residues and a single tryptophan (7Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 21Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). A recent study has reported that although both N-WASP and cortactin bind to the Arp3 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex (41Weaver A.M. Heuser J.E. Karginov A.V. Lee W.L. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1270-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), N-WASP binds to Arp2 and p41 subunits as well (41Weaver A.M. Heuser J.E. Karginov A.V. Lee W.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3468-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a cortactin fragment containing only the Arp2/3 binding domain competes poorly with N-WASP for the Arp2/3 complex even at a concentration 1000-fold higher than N-WASP (21Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 41Weaver A.M. Heuser J.E. Karginov A.V. Lee W.L. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1270-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, it has been suggested that a ternary complex of N-WASP, cortactin, and Arp2/3 might exist in the presence of excess amounts of cortactin, and the activities of WASP and cortactin might be synergistic for actin assembly under this condition (41Weaver A.M.

Indeed, both proteins have been implicated in the same actin-dependent cellular processes such as membrane ruffling (33McNiven M.A. Kim L. Krueger E.W. Orth J.D. Cao H. Wong T.W. J.

However, there is evidence suggesting that cortactin may interact with the Arp2/3 complex in a mechanism distinct from N-WASP. For example, both cortactin and N-WASP are abundant proteins, and their cellular concentrations are in micromolar ranges (21Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 50Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). It is also known that the majority of cortactin proteins are intimately associated with the Arp2/3 complex within cells (21Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Thus, the precise role of cortactin and N-WASP and the nature of their functional relationship in actin assembly remain to be defined. Here, we report that although the affinity of VCA, a constitutively active N-WASP peptide, for the Arp2/3 complex is much higher than that of cortactin in the absence of actin, such affinity is significantly reduced once actin polymerization is initiated. The release of VCA from the Arp2/3 complex is further promoted by the presence of cortactin, which apparently has increased its affinity for the activated Arp2/3 complex. Our data suggest that while N-WASP interacts primarily with the free form of the Arp2/3 complex, the more likely target for cortactin is the complex of Arp2/3 and F-actin at a branching site. Thus, we propose that the rapid formation of actin filaments requires a sequential event involving an initial activation of the Arp2/3 complex by N-WASP and a subsequent interaction between activated Arp2/3 complex and cortactin at the branching point. Proteins—Murine cortactin tagged with 6× His at its C terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (21Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Human N-WASP-derived VCA peptide tagged by GST was expressed and purified from E. coli as described (16Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and further purified by Mono Q chromatography. For some experiments, GST-VCA was digested with thrombin at room temperature overnight, and the released tag-free VCA was further purified by Mono Q chromatography. GST-cort-(1–80), comprising the acidic domain and a region before the central repeat domain, and GST-cort-(1–375), containing both the acidic and the repeat domains, were expressed in E. coli and prepared as described (21Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Bovine Arp2/3 complex was purified by a three-step procedure involving Q Sepharose ion-exchange, GST-VCA affinity chromatography and additional Q Sepharose chromatography (23Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The protein in the flow-through fraction of the final Q Sepharose was concentrated by a Centricon 30 (Amicon), and the buffer of the sample was changed to 1× Ca2+-free polymerization buffer (50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm ATP, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.3, 3 mm NaN3, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as the standard. GST Pull-down Assay—To measure the effect of VCA on the binding of cortactin to the Arp2/3 complex, 10 nm Arp2/3 complex was mixed with GST-cort-(1–80) or GST-cort-(1–375), and untagged VCA at different concentrations in a total 200-μl volume of 1× polymerization buffer. After a 15-min incubation at 22 °C, the reaction mixture was supplemented with BSA (1 mg/ml) and transferred to a 1.5-ml vial containing 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads, and then incubated for 30 min with gentle rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 1 min and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-Arp3 polyclonal antibody (21Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The blot was digitalized by film scanning and quantified by Scion Image software. The result was normalized based on five control samples of the Arp2/3 complex with different amounts on the same gel. To measure the binding of VCA to the Arp2/3 complex during actin assembly, polymerization of 1.5 μm actin was initiated in the presence of 10 nm Arp2/3 complex, 100 nm GST-VCA, and cortactin at concentrations from 0 to 400 nm in 200 μl of 1× polymerization buffer for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then supplemented with BSA (1 mg/ml), and mixed with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated for 30 min with gentle rotation. The beads were sedimented at 300 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube. 50 μl of the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. 16 μl of the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%) followed by transferring to a nitrocellulose membrane. Arp2/3 complex was detected by immunoblot analysis using Arp3 antibody. Actin Polymerization—Polymerization of G-actin (10% pyrene-labeled, rabbit skeletal muscle actin from Cytoskeleton Inc.) was performed as described previously (21Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) with a modification. Briefly, Ca2+-ATP-G-actin in G-actin buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm DTT) was mixed with one-tenth volume of 10× exchange buffer (2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) for 3 min at 22 °C to convert to Mg2+-ATP-G-actin. Polymerization was initiated by adding 60 μl of Mg2+-ATP-G-actin (7.5 μm) to 240 μl of 1.25× polymerization buffer (62.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm imidazole, pH 7.3, 1.25 mm EGTA, 0.125 mm CaCl2, 0.625 mm DTT, 0.3125 mm ATP, and 3.75 mm NaN3) containing Arp2/3 complex, GST-VCA, and cortactin at concentrations as indicated. The kinetics of actin polymerization was monitored by measuring the increase in pyrene fluorescence detected by an LS50B spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with filters for excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm. Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis of Branched Actin Filaments—The analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (10Blanchoin L. Amann K.J. Higgs H.N. Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 13Amann K.J. Pollard T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The specific conditions of actin polymerization for each experiment were described in the corresponding legends. Rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was added at the times indicated to actin polymerization reactions at a molar concentration equivalent to actin. After 5 min of incubation, the mixture was diluted 400-fold in fresh fluorescence buffer (100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm DTT, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.3, 0.5% methylcellulose, 20 μg/ml catalase, 100 μg/ml glucose oxidase, and 3 mg/ml glucose). The diluted samples (2.4 μl) were applied onto cover slips precoated with 0.1% nitrocellulose in n-amyl acetate, and examined under an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope using a ×100 objective lens with numerical aperture (NA) of 1.35. Images were captured by a charge-coupled device camera, and further processed on Adobe Photoshop to generate monochromatic images. The length of filaments and the number of branch points were measured by Scion Image software, and the degree of branching was calculated as the number of branches per micrometer of filament. Immunofluorescence Analysis of Shigella-infected MDA-MB-231 Cells—Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 epithelial cells expressing GFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) alone, GFP-N-WASP, or cortactin-GFP were prepared by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer according to the protocol described previously (51Li Y. Liu J. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37187-37193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Infection with Shigella flexneri M90T strain (a kind gift of C. Egile) was carried out according to the method described (52Goldberg M.B. Barzu O. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2189-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight culture of the bacteria was diluted in trypticase soy broth (BD Biosciences) at 1:100 and grown for 2 h at 37 °C to an OD600 = 0.2–0.3. Bacteria (100 bacteria/1 cell) were centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 4 min, rinsed twice with the cell growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum), and resuspended with the growth medium (2 ml/well). Cells, seeded on fibronectin-coated cover slips in a 6-well plate a day before infection, were washed once with the growth medium, overlaid with the bacterial suspension, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 20 °C. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to allow bacterial entry, then washed three times with the growth medium, and incubated in the medium containing 50 μg/ml of gentamicin for an additional 1–2 h at 37 °C before inspection. Cells were fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 3.7% paraformaldehyde, incubated for 10 min in PBS-50 mm NH4Cl twice to quench the fixative, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 2% BSA, incubated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:100), and anti-cortactin antibody (4F11; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 1:100) for 1 h in PBS containing 0.2% BSA. After three washes with PBS, the cells were further incubated with FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:50) and rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:50) in PBS containing 0.2% BSA for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with diamidine-2-phenyl indole (DAPI) (10 μg/ml) for 5 min and washed three times with PBS. The stained cover slips were mounted on a glass slide with 20 μl of Prolong Antifade preservative (Molecular Probes) and sealed with nail polish. The cells were examined under an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope using a ×60, NA = 1.25 objective lens. N-WASP-VCA Inhibits the Association of Cortactin with Arp2/3 Complex in the Absence of Actin—In an effort to understand the relationship of N-WASP and cortactin during actin assembly, we examined whether the two types of Arp2/3 activators could bind simultaneously to the Arp2/3 complex. As a result, the interaction of cortactin and Arp2/3 complex was examined in the presence of a VCA peptide derived from human N-WASP (16Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D.

As shown in Fig. 1, GST-cort-(1–375) was able to pull-down 41% of 10 nm Arp2/3 complex at 1.5 μm, and 52% at 5 μm, in the absence of VCA. However, this ability to pull-down the Arp2/3 complex was dramatically inhibited by VCA in a dose-dependent manner and nearly abolished by VCA at concentrations significantly lower than GST-cort-(1–375). (200 nm VCA abolished the association of Arp2/3 complex with 1.5 μm cortactin protein, and 600 nm VCA abolished that with 5 μm cortactin.) Binding of GST-cort-(1–80) to the Arp2/3 complex was also inhibited by VCA in a similar manner (Fig. 1). With either of the cortactin proteins, VCA inhibited 50% of cortactin binding to the Arp2/3 complex at ∼50 nm. This result is consistent with the previously reported relative affinities of VCA and cortactin for the Arp2/3 complex: VCA has a K d value from 0.1 to 0.2 μm (16Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R.

https://openalex.org/W2151497845,"Dander from the domestic cat (Felis domesticus) is one of the most common causes of IgE-mediated allergy. Attempts to produce tetrameric folded major allergen Fel d 1 by recombinant methods with structural features similar to the natural allergen have been only partially successful. In this study, a recombinant folded Fel d 1 with molecular and biological properties similar to the natural counterpart was produced. A synthetic gene coding for direct fusion of the Fel d 1 chain 2 N-terminally to chain 1 was constructed by overlapping oligonucleotides in PCR. Escherichia coli expression resulted in a non-covalently associated homodimer with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa defined by size exclusion chromatography. Furthermore, each 19,177-Da subunit displayed a disulfide pattern identical to that found in the natural Fel d 1, i.e. Cys3(1) Cys73(2), Cys44(1)-Cys48(2), Cys70(1)-Cys7(2), as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry after tryptic digestion. Circular dichroism analysis showed identical folds of natural and recombinant Fel d 1. Furthermore, recombinant Fel d l reacted specifically with serum IgE, inducing expression of CD203c on basophils and lymphoproliferative responses in cat-allergic patients. The results show that the overall fold and immunological properties of the recombinant Fel d 1 are very similar to those of natural Fel d 1. Moreover, the recombinant Fel d 1 construct provides a tool for defining the three-dimensional structure of Fel d 1 and represents a reagent for diagnosis and allergen-specific immunotherapy of cat allergy.

In this study, experiments were performed to find out if a protein derived from a direct fusion of the genes coding for the two polypeptide chains constituting Fel d 1 can be folded to mimic the structure and allergenic activity of natural Fel d 1. Synthetic genes coding for the two Fel d 1 chains were produced and joined in PCR by overlapping oligonucleotides and expressed as refolded His-tagged proteins in E. coli. Two constructs were produced, one with chain 1 and the other with chain 2 in the N-terminal position. Both constructs were purified to homogeneity and analyzed for intramolecular disulfide bonds and homodimer formation using size exclusion chromatography, mass spectrometry, and surface plasmon resonance. The 2 + 1 construct revealed greater capacity to inhibit IgE antibodies to Fel d 1 from sensitized individuals and was, therefore, studied further. The structure of the purified recombinant Fel d 1(2 + 1) fusion molecule was compared with that of natural Fel d 1 by CD spectroscopy, and the analysis of IgE antibody responses in direct and competition ELISA assays using sera from individuals sensitized to cat were carried out. The biological activity was demonstrated by the induction of CD203c on basophils and T cell proliferation in cat-allergic patients. Based on the findings that the recombinant Fel d 1(2 + 1) fusion molecule exhibits the same disulfide bonding pattern and homodimer formation and reveals an almost identical CD spectrum, similar immunoreactivity, and comparable biological activity as does the natural Fel d 1, we suggest that the recombinant allergen is suitable for structural analysis and development of diagnostics and specific immunotherapy of allergy to cat.

PCR reactions (10 μl) containing 1 pmol of each primer, primers 1-4 for chain 1 and 5-10 for chain 2, using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), were used. The reactions proceeded for 1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 65 °C, and 2 min at 68 °C for 30 cycles. The PCR products were ligated into pT7Blue Blunt vector and transformed into Nova Blue Single Competent cells using the Perfectly Blunt cloning kit (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). Single colonies were grown in 2.5-ml LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and plasmids were purified (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and cut with the restriction enzymes NdeI and XhoI followed by electrophoretic analysis in 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide in 1% agarose gels. Clones with the right sized insert (210 and 276 bp for chains 1 and 2, respectively) were sequenced (ABI PRISM® 377 DNA sequencer, Applied Biosystems). Verified plasmids were used as templates to join chains 2 and 1, using primers 4, 5, and 11 as described for the single chains. After sequencing, the fusion constructs were subcloned into pET 20b (Novagen) using the NdeI/XhoI restriction sites and transformed into E. coli strain BL-21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Clones were selected on LB agar plates with ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and chloramphenicol (30 mg/liter) and grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. pET 20b inserts of chain 1, chain 2, and rFel d 1(2 + 1) were sequence-verified (Applied Biosystems). Expression of protein was induced for 3 h in mid-log phase using 0.4 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside. The cells were pelleted using a J2-21 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA) at 1000 × g for 10 min and stored at -20 °C. Natural Fel d 1 (>90% pure) from Indoor Biotechnologies (Charlottesville, VA) was used for comparison of immunoreactivity and biological activity between samples.Table IOverlapping primers used for the construction of rFel d 1(2 + 1)Primer no.Sequence1 (F)5′ -gtacatatgg aaatctgccc ggctgttaaa cgtgacgttg acctgttcct gaccggtacc ccggacgaat acgttgaaca ggttg-3′2 (R)5′ -ggcagagctt tgtactgagc aacctgttca acgtattcgt ccgggtgagc aacctgttca acgtattc - 3′3 (F)5′ -tgctcagtac aaagctctgc cggttgttct ggaaaacgct cgtatcctga aaaactgcgt tgacgctaaa atgacc - 3′4 (R)5′ -cctctcgagg cacagcgggg aggtgtagat tttgtccagc agggacagag cgttttcttt gtcttcttcg gtcattttag cgtcaacgc - 3′5 (F)5′ -gtacatatgg ttaaaatggc tgaaacctgc ccgatcttct acgacgtttt cttcgctgtt gctaacggta acgaac - 3′6 (R)5′ -ggtacgttcc ggttcggtag cgttaacttt ggtcagggac aggtccagca gcagttcgtt accgttagca acagc - 3′7 (F)5′ -ctaccgaacc ggaacgtacc gctatgaaaa aaatccagga ctgctacgtt gaaaacggtc tgatctcccg tgttctggac - 3′8 (R)5′ -gcttcaccca tgcagtcttt ggaggaggag atggtggtca taaccagacc gtccagaaca cgggagatca g - 3′9 (F)5′ -caaagactgc atgggtgaag ctgttcagaa caccgttgaa gacctgaaac tgaacaccct gggtcgctcg agagg - 3′10 (R)5′ -cctctcgaga cgacccaggg tg - 3′11 (linker)5′ -cgtttaacag ccgggcagat ttcacgaccc agggtgttca gtttc - 3′ Open table in a new tab Purification and Characterization of Recombinant Fel d 1—Protein purification was performed using fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The same purification protocol was used for all recombinant constructs. The E. coli pellets containing the expressed recombinant construct were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and disrupted via 8 × 10 s sonication bursts on ice (Soniprep 150 ultrasonic disintegrator, Sanyo Gallenkamp, Uxbridge, UK) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 25 min (Beckman Instruments). This procedure was repeated twice, after which the pelleted inclusion body preparation was solubilized in 6 m guanidine-HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a 5-ml Ni2+-HiTrap affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) operated at 5 ml/min. The column buffer was changed to 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and a linear gradient was formed to reach 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, after 12 column volumes. The protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.5 m imidazole, pH 8.0. The enriched rFel d 1 preparation was purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (HiLoad® 16/60 Superdex 200 pg, Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in PBS, and in PBS with 0.1% SDS at 1 ml/min. Molecular weight calibration of the column was carried out using 67-kDa bovine serum albumin, 43-kDa ovalbumin, 25-kDa chymotrypsinogen A, and 13.7-kDa ribonuclease A (Amersham Biosciences) dissolved in PBS or PBS with 0.1% SDS. The relative elution of reference proteins and rFel d 1(2 + 1) was calculated according to the formula K av = V e - V o/V t - V o (36Scopes R.K. Cantor C.R. Protein Purification, Principles, and Practice. 3rd Ed. Springer-Verlag, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar). Purified proteins were stored at -80 °C until use. The protein concentration of rFel d 1(2 + 1) was analyzed by amino acid analysis using a Biochrom 20 Plus ninhydrin-based analyzer (Amersham Biosciences) after hydrolysis at 110 °C for 24 h in evacuated tubes with 6 m HCl containing 0.5% (w/v) phenol. The BCA protein assay (Pierce) was sometimes used to estimate the protein concentration. Purity was judged by SDS-PAGE using 15% homogeneous gels and low molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were denatured at 98 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol (35Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Stuhl K Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Electrospray Mass Spectrometry and Determination of Disulfide Bonds—For mass determination of rFel d 1(2 + 1), the folded protein was dissolved at 27 pmol/μl in 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.3) and applied to electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (see below) via direct infusion using a syringe pump at 2-5 μl/min (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). To localize disulfide bonds, 2.7 nmol of the folded rFel d 1(2 + 1) was dissolved in 10 μl of 9 m urea and incubated for 30 min under vortex at 45 °C, after which 10 μl of water was added. Modified trypsin (5 μg; Promega) and 10 μl of 0.5 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) were added, followed by water to yield a final volume of 100 μl. Digestion proceeded overnight under vortex at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding 1 μl of neat trifluoroacetic acid to the sample which was stored at -20 °C until analyzed. Before mass spectrometry, aliquots of the tryptic digest (10 μl) were desalted on μ-C18 ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and eluted in 60% acetonitrile containing 1% acetic acid for nano-ESI mass spectrometry. To make sure that no free sulfhydryl groups existed in rFel d 1(2 + 1), alkylation was carried out on the non-reduced recombinant preparation (5.4 nmol) using iodoacetamide (Sigma) at 5.5 mm in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) for 15 min at room temperature followed by desalting on μ-C4 ZipTips and nano-ESI mass spectrometry. Mass spectra were recorded using a quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer, Q-TOF (Micromass, Altrincham, UK). The instrument was equipped with an orthogonal sampling ESI-interface (Z-spray, Micromass). Metal-coated nano-ESI needles (Protana, Odense, Denmark) were used and manually opened on the stage of a light microscope to give a spraying orifice of about 5 μm. This resulted in a flow of ∼20-50 nl/min when a capillary voltage of 0.8-1.2 kV was applied. A nitrogen counter-current drying gas facilitated desolvation. The cone voltage was set at 40 V. Homodimer Dissociation Constant Analysis—A BIACORE®2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was employed to investigate homodimer formation of rFel d 1(2 + 1) by evaluation of the decrease in response relative to maximum binding to the chip surface and the associated dissociation constant. rFel d 1(2 + 1) and, for control purposes, a monomer protein, BB (39Nygren P.A. Eliasson M. Abrahmsen L. Uhlen M. Palmcrantz E. J. Mol. Recognit. 1988; 1: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), were immobilized onto the surface of CM-5 chips (research grade) via amine coupling to a carboxylated dextran layer using NHS/EDC chemistry according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The time intervals between surface activation (240-660 s, 35 μl), protein immobilization (900-1140 s, 20 μl), dissociation phase (1140-1940 s, 67 μl), and surface deactivation (1940-2060 s, 10 μl) were kept constant. In the immobilization step, 20 μl of a protein solution containing 0.05 μg/μl in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) was injected over the NHS/EDC-activated surface. After the dissociation phase, the surface was deactivated by injection of 10 μl of ethanolamine. The decrease in the percentage of protein initially attached to the chip surface was calculated as follows: (response units (RU) after protein immobilization at 1230 s - RU after deactivation/RU after protein immobilization) × 100. All experiments were performed at 25 °C and 5 μl/min. The running buffer was 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.15m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P20. The dissociation constant analyzed at 1230-1235 s was based on the equilibrium responses and calculated using the 3.0 software. CD Measurements—CD measurements of the natural and recombinant Fel d 1 were performed in MilliQ water with protein concentrations of 1.56 × 10-5m (here determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay). The investigations were carried out on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (JASCO Labor-und-Datentechnik GmbH, Gross-Umstadt, Germany) using a 0.1-cm pathlength cell equilibrated at 20 °C. Spectra were recorded with 0.5-nm resolution at a scan speed of 100 nm/min and resulted from averaging three scans. The final spectra were baseline-corrected by subtracting the corresponding MilliQ spectra obtained under identical conditions. Results were expressed as the molar mean residue ellipticity (θ) at a given wavelength. The data were fitted with the secondary structure estimation programs Dicroprot (37Deleage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar) and J-700 (JASCO) using miscellaneous data deconvolution algorithms. ELISA Analysis—Serum specimens from 15 individuals were selected on the basis of positive IgE responses to cat dander (range 0.45-38 kilounits of allergen (kUA)/liter using the Pharmacia CAP System (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden)). For control purposes, a pool of 20 non-cat-allergic patients was used. The serum samples were analyzed in duplicates by ELISA for IgE antibody binding to rFel d 1(2 + 1), nFel d 1, or a mix of rFel d 1 chain 1 and chain 2. The assay was performed as a sequential, solid phase adsorption of allergens, serum sample, primary antibody, antibody conjugate, and finally substrate, and included rinsing four times with 250 μl of PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) between incubations. Unless stated otherwise, all steps were performed at room temperature. Microtiter plates (96 wells; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 100 μl of rFel d 1(2 + 1) solution and, for comparison, also nFel d 1 and an equimolar mixture of chains 1 and 2 to final concentrations of 5 μg/ml in 0.1 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. After overnight adsorption at 4 °C, the plates were emptied, and the remaining protein binding sites were blocked with 200 μl of PBS-T containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 2.5 h at room temperature (20-22 °C). Each serum sample (100 μl) was diluted 1:1 in PBS (duplicates) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, after which 100 μl of rabbit anti-human IgE (Miab, Uppsala, Sweden, diluted 1:2000 (v/v)) was added, and incubation was continued for 2 h. Finally, 100 μl of goat anti-rabbit (Dako, Denmark, diluted 1:2000 (v/v)) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was added, and incubation continued for 1 h. Alkaline phosphatase substrate tablets (Sigma 104® Diagnostics) were used, and the color reaction monitored at 405 nm was registered in an automated ELISA reader (Multiskan RC, Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). A competition assay of serum IgE was performed using pooled sera from individuals sensitized to cat with a >10 kUA/liter response to cat dander (mean concentration, 23 kUA/liter) (Pharmacia CAP System). Microtiter plates (96 wells) were coated with 100 μl, 5 μg/ml nFel d 1. 3-fold serial dilutions in PBS-T of rFel d 1(2 + 1), nFel d 1, and an equimolar mixture of chains 1 and 2 were incubated at a 1:1 volume ratio with the serum pool diluted 1:2 (v/v) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and thereafter added to the wells. The subsequent steps were as described for the direct ELISA. CD203c Assay—The expression of CD203c was performed as described (38Hauswirth A.W. Natter S. Ghannadan M. Majlesi Y. Schernthaner G.H. Sperr W.R. Buhring H.J. Valenta R. Valent P. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 110: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, heparinized blood samples were taken from two cat-allergic patients. Blood aliquots (100 μl) were incubated with dilutions of recombinant and natural Fel d 1 (1 and 10 μg/ml), anti-IgE antibody (1 μg/ml), or PBS for 15 min (37 °C). After incubation, cells were washed in PBS/EDTA and then incubated with 10 μl of phycoerythrin-labeled CD203c monoclonal antibody 97A6 (Immunotech, Marseille, France) for 15 min at room temperature. Thereafter, samples were subjected to erythrocyte lysis with 2 ml of FACS™ lysing solution (BD Biosciences). Cells were then washed, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by two-color flow cytometry on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Lymphoproliferation Assay—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from cat-allergic patients by Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs (2 × 105) were cultured in triplicate in 96-well Nunclone plates (Nunc) in 200 μl of serum-free Ultra Culture medium (BioWhittaker, Rockland, ME) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 0.1 mg gentamicin per milliliter (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were stimulated with different concentrations (5, 2.5, 1.25, and 0.6 μg per well) of rFel d 1, nFel d 1, and, for control purposes, recombinant birch pollen allergen Bet v 1, 4 units of interleukin-2 (IL-2) per well (Roche Applied Science), and"

https://openalex.org/W1984347910,"The phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 by the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-activated receptor kinases and their subsequent heterodimerization with Smad4 and translocation to the nucleus form the basis for a model how Smad proteins work to transmit TGF-β signals. The transcriptional activity of Smad2-Smad4 or Smad3-Smad4 complexes can be limited by the corepressor Ski, which is believed to interact with Smad complexes on TGF-β-responsive promoters and represses their ability to activate TGF-β target genes by assembling on DNA a repressor complex containing histone deacetylase. Here we show that Ski can block TGF-β signaling by interfering with the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 by the activated TGF-β type I receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of Ski induces the assembly of Smad2-Smad4 and Smad3-Smad4 complexes independent of TGF-β signaling. The ability of Ski to engage Smad proteins in nonproductive complexes provides new insights into the molecular mechanism used by Ski for disabling TGF-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2006557354,"Major histocompatibility complex class I molecules can be expressed as single polypeptides wherein the antigenic peptide, β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin, and heavy chain are attached by flexible linkers. These molecules, single-chain trimers (SCTs), are remarkably stable at the cell surface compared with native (noncovalently attached) class I molecules. In this study, we used a structure-based approach to engineer an F pocket variant SCT of the murine class I molecule K<sup>b</sup> that presents the SIINFEKL epitope of ovalbumin. Mutation of heavy chain residue Tyr<sup>84</sup> (Y84A) in the SCT resulted in enhanced serological and cytolytic CD8 T cell recognition of the covalently linked peptide due to better accommodation of the linker extending from the C terminus of the peptide. These SCTs exhibit significant cell-surface stability, which we hypothesize is rendered by their ability to continuously and efficiently rebind the covalently attached peptide. In addition, we demonstrate that SCT technology can be applied to tetramer construction using recombinant SCTs expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. SCT-based tetramers could have applications for the enumeration of T and natural killer cells that recognize peptide·class I complexes prone to dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W2018046696,"Biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor involves the initial formation of precursor Z, its subsequent conversion to molybdopterin (MPT) by MPT synthase, and attachment of molybdenum to the dithiolene moiety of MPT. The sulfur used for the formation of the dithiolene group of MPT exists in the form of a thiocarboxylate group at the C terminus of the smaller subunit of MPT synthase. Human MPT synthase contains the MOCS2A and MOCS2B proteins that display homology to the Escherichia coli proteins MoaD and MoaE, respectively. MOCS2A and MOCS2B were purified after heterologous expression in E. coli, and the separately purified subunits readily assemble into a functional MPT synthase tetramer. The rate of conversion of precursor Z to MPT by the human enzyme is slower than that of the eubacterial homologue. To obtain insights into the molecular mechanism leading to human molybdenum cofactor deficiency, site-specific mutations identified in patients showing symptoms of molybdenum cofactor deficiency were generated. Characterization of a V7F substitution in MOCS2A, identified in a patient with an unusual mild form of the disease, showed that the mutation weakens the interaction between MOCS2A and MOCS2B, whereas a MOCS2B-E168K mutation identified in a severely affected patient attenuates binding of precursor Z.

Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) 1The abbreviations used are: Moco, molybdenum cofactor; MPT, molybdopterin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MOCS2A-SH, thiocarboxylated MOCS2A; MOCS2A-OH, carboxylated MOCS2A. biosynthesis is an ancient, ubiquitous, and highly conserved pathway leading to the biochemical activation of molybdenum (1Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moco is essential for the activity of sulfite oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidase in humans (2Reiss J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Human Moco deficiency leads to the pleiotropic loss of all three of these molybdoenzymes and usually progresses to death at an early age (3Johnson J.L. Wadman S.K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2271-2283Google Scholar). Isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency is a related disease in which molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is normal, but sulfite oxidase activity is altered (4Johnson J.L. Duran M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3163-3177Google Scholar). The clinical symptoms of molybdenum cofactor deficiency are indistinguishable from those of isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency with the notable exception that xanthinuria is absent in the latter (4Johnson J.L. Duran M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3163-3177Google Scholar). In both cases, affected neonates show feeding difficulties, neurological abnormalities such as attenuated brain growth, untreatable seizures, dislocated ocular lenses in most cases, and death in early childhood. Although milder symptoms are occasionally observed, none of the treatments tested to date have produced consistent improvement of the clinical status (4Johnson J.L. Duran M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3163-3177Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified the human genes involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (2Reiss J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The MOCS1 locus encodes two proteins homologous to Escherichia coli MoaA and MoaC that are needed for the formation of precursor Z, which were shown to have an unusual bicistronic structure with open reading frames for both MOCS1A and MOCS1B in a single transcript (5Gray T.A. Nicholls R.D. RNA. 2000; 6: 928-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Hänzelmann P. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18303-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly, the MOCS2 locus encodes the two subunits of MPT synthase and has been shown to be bicistronic with overlapping reading frames encoding MOCS2A and MOCS2B, the congeners of E. coli MoaD and MoaE (7Stallmeyer B. Drugeon G. Reiss J. Haenni A.L. Mendel R.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 698-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the last step of Moco biosynthesis in humans, molybdenum is incorporated into MPT by the two-domain protein gephyrin (8Feng G. Tintrup H. Kirsch J. Nichol M.C. Kuhse J. Betz H. Sanes J.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 9Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch J. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Based on the presence or absence of precursor Z in clinical samples, Moco deficiency was originally divided into two complementation groups. Group A patients have a defect at the MOCS1 locus and therefore do not produce precursor Z, whereas group B patients have a defect at the MOCS2 locus and are characterized by the accumulation of precursor Z (10Johnson J.L. Wuebbens M.M. Mandell R. Shih V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently a third group has been identified with genetic defects in gephyrin (11Reiss J. Gross-Hardt S. Christensen E. Schmidt P. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 208-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because human MPT synthase shows significant homologies to E. coli MPT synthase (see Fig. 1, A and B), the mechanism of sulfur transfer to precursor Z is expected to be similar. The reaction mechanism of E. coli MPT synthase has been described in detail (12Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). E. coli MPT synthase is activated by formation of a thiocarboxylate group at the second glycine of its C-terminal Gly-Gly motif that serves as the direct sulfur donor for the formation of the dithiolene group in MPT (12Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The high resolution crystal structure of E. coli MPT synthase has been solved and showed a heterotetrameric structure for the enzyme (14Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 15Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Turque O. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). MoaD, the small subunit of E. coli MPT synthase, shows a three-dimensional fold similar to ubiquitin and interacts via its C terminus with the large subunit, MoaE, thereby forming two hypothetical active sites in the heterotetramer (14Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 15Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Turque O. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Prior to the formation of the MoaD C-terminal thiocarboxylate group, the protein is activated by adenylation of the C-terminal carboxylate, a reaction carried out by the E. coli MoeB protein (16Lake M.W. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40211-40217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Leimkühler S. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34695-34701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the MoaD thiocarboxylate group is formed by the action of a NifS-like protein using l-cysteine as the ultimate sulfur source (18Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Human MOCS3 exhibits homologies to E. coli MoeB and is presumed to activate MOCS2A in a similar manner. Here we describe the purification and characterization of human MPT synthase encoded by MOCS2A and MOCS2B. After separate purification, MOCS2A and MOCS2B were assembled in vitro to generate MPT synthase. The catalytic activity of this human MPT synthase was compared with in vitro assembled E. coli MPT synthase and with chimeric proteins assembled from mixtures of human and E. coli large or small subunits. A number of mutations in the MOCS2 proteins have been identified in group B patients. Whereas one patient described with an amino acid exchange in MOCS2A showed a particularly mild form of molybdenum cofactor deficiency, two patients with mutations identified in MOCS2B were severely affected (19Johnson J.L. Coyne K.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Van Hove J.L.K. Mackay M. Pitt J. Boneh A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 104: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To analyze differences in symptoms of Moco deficiency based on varying MPT synthase activities, corresponding mutants in MOCS2A and MOCS2B have been generated and characterized. Bacterial Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The E. coli moaD(DE3) and moaE (RK5204) mutant strains used in this study were described previously (20Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and pET15b were obtained from Novagen. E. coli strain ER2566(DE3), plasmid pTYB2, and chitin affinity resin were obtained from New England Biolabs. Cell strains containing expression plasmids were grown aerobically at either 30 °C (pET15b) or 16 °C (pTYB2) in LB medium in the presence of 150 μg/ml ampicillin or 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Sephadex 200 and Superose 12 matrix were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of MOCS2A and MOCS2B— The genes encoding MOCS2A and MOCS2B were amplified by PCR from a human cDNA library (8Feng G. Tintrup H. Kirsch J. Nichol M.C. Kuhse J. Betz H. Sanes J.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For expression of MOCS2A, the gene was cloned into the NdeI and KpnI sites of pTYB2. For expression of MOCS2B, PCR primers were designed to allow cloning into the XbaI and BamHI sites of the multiple cloning site of pET15b, resulting in plasmid pSL173. The amino acid substitutions V7F and S15R in MOCS2A and E168K and A150Δ in MOCS2B were introduced using the Transformer kit from Clontech. To create the Δ1–43 N-terminal deletion of MOCS2B, a PCR primer was designed that exchanged serine 43 for a methionine, allowing direct cloning into the XbaI site of pET15b. For expression of all MOCS2A variants, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli ER2566(DE3) cells. The cells were grown at 37 °C in 6-liter cultures, and expression was induced at A 600 = 0.5 with 300 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Growth was continued for 18 h at 16 °C, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell lysis was achieved by several passages through a French pressure cell. After centrifugation, the supernatant was combined with 20 ml of chitin affinity resin equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, and stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was then poured into a column and washed with 100 ml of equilibration buffer without Triton X-100. For intein cleavage, the resin was incubated for 18 h with 20 ml of 250 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, containing 50 mm ammonium sulfide (MOCS2A-SH) or 50 mm dithiothreitol (MOCS2A-OH). Released MOCS2A was eluted with 30 ml of 250 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, and concentrated. Both proteins were exchanged into 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, prior to use. For purification of MOCS2B, the protein was coexpressed with a plasmid containing the molecular chaperones GroES/EL. The groES/EL genes were first cloned into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET15b before subcloning into the SphI and HindIII sites of pLysS (Novagen) to generate pPH67. Six-liter cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells cotransformed with pSL173 and pPH67 were induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.1 mm when the cultures had attained A 600 = 0.6. Following 5–6 h of growth at 30 °C, the cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Cell lysis was achieved by several passages through a French pressure cell. After centrifugation, the supernatant volume was increased to 150 ml with buffer prior to the addition of 16.5 ml of 20% (w/v) streptomycin sulfate. After centrifugation, MOCS2B was precipitated by the addition of 176 g/liter of ammonium sulfate. Precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and dialyzed against the same buffer. Final purification of MOCS2B was achieved by chromatography on a Superose 12 gel filtration column equilibrated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. All of the protein concentrations were determined using their calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm. MOCS2A expression constructs for genetic complementation of the E. coli moaD mutant were cloned into pTrc-His (22Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed to allow cloning of MOCS2A or MocS2B into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the multiple cloning region of pTrc-His to generate pSL203 and pSL173, respectively. For coexpression of MOCS2A and MOCS2B, MOCS2B was PCR-amplified with primers that allowed cloning into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pSL203, resulting in pSL204. To facilitate coexpression of MOCS2A and MOCS2B, the E. coli Shine-Dalgarno sequence was attached to the 5′ end of MOCS2B. For coexpression of MOCS2A, MOCS2B, and MOCS3, MOCS3 was PCR-amplified with primers that allowed cloning into the HindIII site of pSL204, resulting in pSL206. To ensure coexpression of MOCS3 with MOCS2A and MOCS2B, the E. coli Shine-Dalgarno sequence was also attached to the 5′ end of MOCS3. The orientation of MOCS3 after cloning into pSL204 was checked by restriction analysis. Nitrate Reductase Overlay Assay—For genetic complementation of E. coli moaD and moaE mutants, plasmids pSL173, pSL203, pSL204, and pSL206 and the mutated versions pSL173-E168K, pSL173-A150Δ, and pSL173-Δ1–43 were transformed into these strains. Nitrate reductase activity was analyzed by a colony overlay assay (23Glaser J.H. DeMoss J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 116: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed at room temperature using a Sephadex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. Small and large MPT synthase subunits were mixed in a volume of 0.2–1.0 ml and immediately injected into the column without preincubation. MPT Synthase Reactions—Precursor Z was purified from an E. coli moaD mutant and quantitated as previously described (24Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Routine MPT synthase reactions were performed at room temperature in a total volume of 400 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Small and large MPT synthase subunits were combined, and the reaction was started by precursor Z addition. At specified times, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of acidic iodine to convert precursor Z to compound Z and MPT to form A (25Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both products are stable fluorescent compounds that can be readily quantitated by HPLC analysis using a fluorescent detector. Following incubation at room temperature for 14 h, excess iodine was removed by the addition of 55 μl of 1% ascorbic acid, and the sample was adjusted with 1 m Tris to pH 8.3. The phosphate monoester of form A was cleaved by the addition of 40 mm MgCl2 and 1 unit of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. Form A and compound Z obtained by this method were further purified on diethyl(2-hydroxypropyl)aminoethyl(diethyl(2-hydroxypropyl)aminoethyl) Sephadex A-25 columns with a 500 μl bed volume. Form A was eluted from these columns in a volume of 2 ml of 10 mm acetic acid, and compound Z was eluted in a volume of 5 ml of 100 mm HCl. The reactions were analyzed by subsequent injection (100 μl for form A and 200 μl for compound Z) onto a C-18 reversed phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm; ODS-Hypersil; particle size, 5 μm) equilibrated with 50 mm ammonium acetate containing 10% methanol for form A or 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 3.0, with 1% methanol for compound Z analysis (flow rate, 1 ml/min). In-line fluorescence was monitored by an Agilent 1100 series detector with excitation at 370 nm and emission at 450 nm. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was performed with purified proteins in 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. The spectra were recorded on a J-800 CD-spectrometer (Jasco) at 20 nm/min scan speed with seven repetitions. Cloning of MOCS2A and MOCS2B and Test of Functional Complementation of E. coli moaD and moaE Mutants— MOCS2A and MOCS2B, the genes for human MPT synthase, are arranged in a bicistronic transcript with two overlapping reading frames (7Stallmeyer B. Drugeon G. Reiss J. Haenni A.L. Mendel R.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 698-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In vitro translation and mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that MOCS2A and MOCS2B are translated independently, leading to the synthesis of the 9.8-kDa MOCS2A protein and the 20.8-kDa MOCS2B protein (7Stallmeyer B. Drugeon G. Reiss J. Haenni A.L. Mendel R.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 698-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although MOCS2A shows an identity of 27.5% to the E. coli MoaD protein (Fig. 1A), MOCS2B contains an N-terminal extension of ∼40 amino acids not found in any of the eubacterial homologues. The remainder of MOCS2B shows an identity of 29.3% to E. coli MoaE (Fig. 1B). For functional complementation studies of E. coli moaD and moaE mutants, MOCS2A and MOCS2B were cloned together or separately into E. coli expression vectors as shown in Fig. 1C. These were subsequently transformed into the mutant E. coli strains. Complementation of the strains by the human proteins would result in the production of active nitrate reductase, a Moco-containing enzyme, the activity of which is dependent on the ability of cells to synthesize Moco. Complementation can be scored on plates using an overlay assay for formate-dependent nitrate reductase activity (23Glaser J.H. DeMoss J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 116: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, although the E. coli moaE - cells were functionally complemented with MOCS2B, the E. coli moaD - cells were not complemented by either MOCS2A or by coexpression of MOCS2A with MOCS2B. To explore the possibility that MOCS2A is not activated by E. coli MoeB, a construct that coexpresses MOCS2A, MOCS2B, and MOCS3, the human equivalent of E. coli MoeB (Fig. 1C), was tested for its ability to complement the moaD - strain. As shown in Fig. 1D, coexpression of all three human proteins resulted in partial complementation of the E. coli moaD mutant, suggesting that MOCS2A cannot be activated by endogeneous E. coli MoeB. This failure could be due either to the inability of the two proteins to favorably interact or to slight differences between the mechanism of sulfur transfer in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Expression and Purification of Separate MOCS2A and MOCS2B Subunits in E. coli—For purification of MOCS2A and MOCS2B, the proteins were cloned into separate expression vectors for heterologous expression in E. coli. To synthesize MOCS2A with either a carboxylate or a thiocarboxylate group at the C-terminal glycine residue, MOCS2A was cloned into the E. coli expression vector, pTYB2, resulting in a fusion protein containing both a C-terminal intein tag and a chitin-binding domain for affinity purification. Taking advantage of the intein-catalyzed self-cleavage reaction and the resulting transes-terification, cleavage of the product with dithiothreitol results in the carboxylated form of MOCS2A, whereas cleavage with ammonium sulfide results in the thiocarboxylated form of MOCS2A. This method was originally described for the purification of ThiS variants (26Kinsland C. Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and adapted for the purification of carboxylated and thiocarboxylated E. coli MoaD by Gutzke et al. (12Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Wuebbens and Rajagopalan (13Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). MOCS2A was purified from E. coli ER2566(DE3) cells resulting in 3 mg of carboxylated or 1.5 mg of thiocarboxylated protein/liter of culture. Both purified proteins exhibited an approximate monomeric mass of 10 kDa on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2A), which is in close correspondence to the calculated molecular mass of 9.8 kDa for MOCS2A. For purification of MOCS2B, the expression plasmid pSL173 was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. To promote proper folding of MOCS2B, the cells were cotransformed with a plasmid expressing the E. coli heat shock chaperones GroES/EL under the control of the T7 promotor. MOCS2B was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a Superose 12 column as shown in Fig. 2B. This procedure yielded ∼10 mg of MOCS2B/liter of E. coli culture. The protein exhibited an apparent monomeric mass of 21 kDa on Coomassie-stained SDS gels that corresponded closely to the calculated molecular mass of 20.8 kDa for MOCS2B. Assembly of MOCS2A and MOCS2B from Single Subunits—It has been demonstrated that both the carboxylated and thiocarboxylated forms of MoaD readily associate with MoaE in vitro to form the heterotetrameric MPT synthase complex but that only the complex containing thiocarboxylated MoaD is active (12Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine whether human MPT synthase can also readily be assembled from its separately purified subunits, MOCS2A and MOCS2B were mixed and analyzed for the generation of the MPT synthase tetramer by size exclusion chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2C, in the presence of excess MOCS2A, all of the MOCS2B was converted to the MPT synthase complex. The observed elution positions of the synthase complex and MOCS2B showed that MOCS2A and MOCS2B associate to form a heterotetrameric MPT synthase complex and that MOCS2B exists as a dimer in solution. The elution position of MOCS2A from the size exclusion column revealed that MOCS2A also forms a dimer in solution, unlike E. coli MoaD, which exists as a monomer in solution (12Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that MOCS2A has an anomalous elution behavior from the size exclusion column as was shown for E. coli MoaE (13Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), mimicking the behavior of a dimer. No differences were observed between the carboxylated or thiocarboxylated form of MOCS2A to assemble with MOCS2B. Analysis of the Activity of Assembled MPT Synthase Complexes—Using purified thiocarboxylated MOCS2A and MoaD, the ability of assembled human MPT synthase to convert purified precursor Z to MPT in vitro was compared with that of E. coli MPT synthase. In addition to homogeneous E. coli and human MPT synthase, chimeric MOCS2A/MoaE and MoaD/MOCS2B mixtures were also analyzed. MPT produced was quantitated by conversion to its fluorescent derivative form A. The time courses of the MPT synthase reactions are shown in Fig. 3. All of the MPT synthase combinations were able to form MPT from precursor Z in vitro but with varying efficiency. The reaction mixture containing E. coli MoaD/MoaE with precursor Z reached its end point after 30 s. The mixture of human MOCS2A/MOCS2B with precursor Z reached its maximum after 8 min of incubation. Bigger differences in reaction time were observed with chimeric MPT synthases (Fig. 3). Although the reaction of MOCS2A/MoaE MPT synthase reached its end point after 2 min, the mixture of MoaD/MOCS2B was significantly slower, and maximum MPT formation was reached after an incubation time of 60 min (data not shown). To see whether the differences in MPT synthase reaction rates could be explained by differences in affinity for the substrate, precursor Z binding to the proteins was examined. The MOCS2B and MoaE subunits in addition to mixtures of inactive MOCS2A/MOCS2B and MoaD/MoaE were incubated with excess precursor Z and subjected to gel filtration to remove unbound precursor Z from the mixture. Precursor Z bound to the excluded fraction was quantitated by conversion to its oxidized fluorescent derivative, compound Z. As shown in Fig. 4, although some precursor Z coeluted with MOCS2B (Fig. 4A), no precursor Z remained bound to MoaE after gel filtration (Fig. 4B). In contrast, identical amounts of precursor Z remained protein-bound in mixtures of inactive carboxylated MOCS2A or MoaD with MOCS2B and MoaE, respectively (Fig. 4). Generation of Mutations in MOCS2A and MOCS2B Based on Group B Patients—To date, about 100 patients have been diagnosed worldwide for Moco deficiency. Among these patients, the majority are in group A and only a few of the mutations identified in the patients have been located in the genes for either MOCS2A or MOCS2B (2Reiss J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has been reported that most group B patients are very severely affected (2Reiss J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); however, one patient identified with an unusually mild form of the disease was heterozygous for two single-base substitutions in MOCS2A (19Johnson J.L. Coyne K.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Van Hove J.L.K. Mackay M. Pitt J. Boneh A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 104: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mutation in one allele introduced a stop codon in place of a glutamine (Q6X), and the mutation in the second allele resulted in substitution of a valine for a phenylalanine (V7F). It was speculated that a low level of residual activity from the V7F allele might be responsible for the milder clinical symptoms of this patient (19Johnson J.L. Coyne K.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Van Hove J.L.K. Mackay M. Pitt J. Boneh A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 104: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To analyze the molecular basis of base pair exchanges leading to molybdenum cofactor deficiency in group B patients, these mutations were introduced in either MOCS2A or MOCS2B by site-directed mutagenesis. Amino acid exchanges V7F and S15R were introduced into MOCS2A (Refs. 2Reiss J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 19Johnson J.L. Coyne K.E. Rajagopalan K.V.

https://openalex.org/W1977838445,"The superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins has expanded dramatically in recent years. The Ras family has long been associated with signaling pathways contributing to normal and aberrant cell growth, while Rho-related protein function is to integrate extracellular signals with specific targets regulating cell morphology, cell aggregation, tissue polarity, cell motility and cytokinesis. Recent findings suggest that certain Rho proteins, including RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, can also play a role in signal transduction to the nucleus and cell growth control. However, the nature of the genes regulated by Ras and Rho GTPases, as well as their contribution to their numerous biological effects is still largely unknown. To approach these questions, we investigated the global gene expression pattern induced by activated forms of H-Ras, RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 using cDNA microarrays comprising 19 117 unique elements. Using this approach, we identified 1184 genes that were up- or downregulated by at least twofold. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed the existence of patterns of gene regulation both unique and common to H-Ras V12, RhoA QL, Rac1 QL and Cdc42 QL activation. For example, H-Ras V12 upregulated osteopontin and Akt 1, and H-Ras and RhoA stimulated cyclin G1, cyclin-dependent kinase 8, cyclin A2 and HMGI-C, while Rac1 QL and Cdc42 QL upregulated extracellular matrix and cell adhesion proteins such as alpha-actinin 4, procollagen type I and V and neuropilin. Furthermore, H-Ras V12 downregulated by >eightfold 52 genes compared to only three genes by RhoA QL, Rac1 QL and Cdc42 QL. These results provide key information to begin unraveling the complexity of the molecular mechanisms underlying the transforming potential of Ras and Rho proteins, as well as the numerous morphological and cell cycle effects induced by these small GTPases.64"
https://openalex.org/W2065410511,"Uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles requires the J-domain protein auxilin for targeting hsc70 to the clathrin coats and for stimulating the hsc70 ATPase activity. This results in the release of hsc70-complexed clathrin triskelia and concomitant dissociation of the coat. To understand the complex role of auxilin in uncoating and clathrin assembly in more detail, we analyzed the molecular organization of its clathrin-binding domain (amino acids 547–813). CD spectroscopy of auxilin fragments revealed that the clathrin-binding domain is almost completely disordered in solution. By systematic mapping using synthetic peptides and by site-directed mutagenesis, we identified short peptide sequences involved in clathrin heavy chain and AP-2 binding and evaluated their significance for the function of auxilin. Some of the binding determinants, including those containing sequences 674DPF and 636WDW, showed dual specificity for both clathrin and AP-2. In contrast, the two DLL motifs within the clathrin-binding domain were exclusively involved in clathrin binding. Surprisingly, they interacted not only with the N-terminal domain of the heavy chain, but also with the distal domain. Moreover, both DLL peptides proved to be essential for clathrin assembly and uncoating. In addition, we found that the motif 726NWQ is required for efficient clathrin assembly activity. Auxilin shares a number of protein-protein interaction motifs with other endocytic proteins, including AP180. We demonstrate that AP180 and auxilin compete for binding to the α-ear domain of AP-2. Like AP180, auxilin also directly interacts with the ear domain of β-adaptin. On the basis of our data, we propose a refined model for the uncoating mechanism of clathrin-coated vesicles.

Like AP180, auxilin also directly interacts with the ear domain of β-adaptin. On the basis of our data, we propose a refined model for the uncoating mechanism of clathrin-coated vesicles. Clathrin-coated vesicles are involved in numerous membrane transport processes. After their formation, they rapidly shed their protein coats to allow fusion of the vesicle membranes with endosomes and to recycle the coat components. The disassembly of the clathrin coat is mediated by the molecular chaperone hsc70 and requires a cofactor of the DnaJ protein family known as auxilin (1Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Auxilin is a neuron-specific protein involved in the removal of the clathrin coat from endocytosed synaptic vesicle membranes and thus in the recycling of synaptic vesicles (1Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 2Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 3Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Jin S. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. Neuron. 2001; 32: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas the homolog auxilin-2, also referred to as cyclin G-associated kinase, is more broadly distributed (4Umeda A. Meyerholz A. Ungewickell E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Greener T. Zhao X. Nojima H. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1365-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Both proteins contain a C-terminal J-domain preceded by a centrally located clathrin-binding domain and an N-terminal phosphatase- and tensin-like domain with unknown function. In addition to these domains, auxilin-2 also possesses an N-terminal Ark-type kinase domain that has been shown to autophosphorylate auxilin-2 and to phosphorylate the μ-subunit of the adaptor protein complexes AP-1 and AP-2 (4Umeda A. Meyerholz A. Ungewickell E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). According to the current model for the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, it is believed that auxilin first binds to clathrin coats and then recruits hsc70 in an ATP-dependent reaction via its J-domain. The interaction with the J-domain stimulates the ATPase activity of hsc70, thereby stabilizing the binding of hsc70 to clathrin. hsc70 interacts stoichiometrically with the legs of the clathrin triskelia, whereas auxilin functions catalytically in this process. The association of hsc70 with clathrin results in the release of clathrin triskelia by disrupting clathrin-clathrin interactions. Apart from guiding hsc70 to its clathrin substrate, the clathrin-binding domain of auxilin (amino acids 547–813) functions as a clathrin assembly protein in vitro when added in stoichiometric amounts to the heavy chain (2Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Like numerous other endocytic proteins, auxilin directly interacts with both clathrin and AP-2. The clathrin-binding domain contains three DPF sequences. This motif has previously been shown for other endocytic proteins to play a role in the interaction with AP-2 (6Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, auxilin lacks typical clathrin box-binding sequences, which mediate the interaction of a number of endocytic proteins with the N-terminal domain of clathrin (clathrin-TD). 1The abbreviations used are: clathrin-TD, clathrin N-terminal domain; Trx, thioredoxin; Aux, auxilin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: clathrin-TD, clathrin N-terminal domain; Trx, thioredoxin; Aux, auxilin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. Two types of clathrin box motifs have been described so far. The clathrin box I motif follows the consensus sequence L(L/I)(D/E/N)(L/F)(D/E) (7Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), whereas the clathrin box II motif is defined by the motifs WDPW and LMDLA (8Drake M.T. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28700-28709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Instead, two DLL sequences that have previously been implicated in the clathrin assembly function of AP180 (9Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Hao W. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8667-8676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are present in the clathrin-binding domain of auxilin. These motifs are tandemly arranged within this region with the putative AP-2-binding DPF sequences. The affinity for the ear domain of α-adaptin seems to be correlated with the number of DP(F/W) peptides, which often occur in multiple copies in the sequence of many accessory proteins (6Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). An alternative binding motif for the α-ear domain was recently defined by the consensus sequence FXDXF (10Mishra S.K. Agostinelli N.R. Brett T.J. Mizukami I. Ross T.S. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46230-46236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the case of AP180 and amphiphysin, the FXDXF motifs seem to contribute to the binding of the α-ear domain more than the DPF sequences (11Hao W. Luo Z. Zheng L. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22785-22794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17583-17589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, this motif is not present in auxilin. The α-ear domain of AP-2 consists of a β-sandwich structure and a C-terminal platform domain that are both engaged in protein-protein interactions. The binding sites of the DPF and FXDXF peptides overlap on the α-ear platform, with the latter motif covering an extended site on this subdomain (13Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure. 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Despite the low sequence identity, the respective ear domains of the α- and β-subunits of AP-2 display a high structural similarity. A subset of DP(F/W) motif-containing proteins, e.g. AP180, epsin-1 and eps15, binds not only to the α-ear domain, but also to the β-ear domain of AP-2 (14Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The clathrin heavy chain is organized into a globular N-terminal domain, rod-like distal and proximal domains, and a trimerization region near the C terminus. The N-terminal domain is connected to the distal domain by a flexible linker and can be cleaved off from assembled clathrin by digestion with trypsin without destabilizing the cages. Because auxilin is able to stimulate the hsc70-dependent dissociation of such truncated clathrin cages, it has been suggested that the interaction of auxilin with the proximal or distal domain of clathrin is sufficient for its cofactor activity (1Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, we previously found that auxilin also interacts with clathrin-TD. The clathrin-binding domain of auxilin (amino acids 547–813) is bipartite and consists of two subdomains comprising either predominantly clathrin N-terminal or distal domain interaction sites (15Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, Ma et al. (16Ma Y. Greener T. Pacold M.E. Kaushal S. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) constructed a chimeric protein from a C-terminal fragment of murine AP180 (residues 325–915) and the J-domain of auxilin. With this chimera, they were able to demonstrate that binding of a J-domain protein to the N-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain is sufficient to recruit hsc70 and to facilitate the dissociation of clathrin cages to a certain degree. To characterize the overall structural organization of the clathrin-binding domain, we employed CD spectroscopy, which showed that this segment of auxilin is intrinsically disordered. This finding formed the basis for further dissections of the clathrin-binding domain and for defined mutations within putative protein-protein interaction motifs. We found that the two short sequences 636WDW and 674DPF are utilized for the interaction with the α-ear domain of AP-2 and clathrin-TD. Moreover the 674DPF peptide can also interact with the clathrin distal domain. The 726NWQ sequence was recognized as important for efficient clathrin assembly by auxilin. Antibodies—The primary antibodies used in this study were the monoclonal antibody 100/4 (2Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which is directed against auxilin, and a monoclonal antibody recognizing the His6 epitope (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (ICN, Aurora, OH) using Renaissance Enhanced luminol substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Alternatively, we detected thioredoxin (Trx)/His6 tags coded by pET32 series vectors (Merck Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein S (Merck Biosciences). DNA Constructs—All auxilin constructs used in this study were generated from the DNA of auxilin (Aux)-(547–910) cloned into the pGEX-4T2 vector (17Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment of Aux-(547–715) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the BamHI and SacI sites of pQE-31 (QIAGEN). Cloning of Aux-(715–902) into the pET32a vector was described previously in (15Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, for this work we transferred the insert DNA from pET32a into pQE-30 by restriction digestion with NcoI and SalI and ligation between the BamHI and SalI sites of the pQE-30 vector after blunting the NcoI and BamHI overhangs with Klenow polymerase. The construct of Aux-(715–902) in pET32a was used to create Aux-(715–776) and Aux-(778–902). The latter fragment was excised with PvuII and EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRV and EcoRI sites of pET32a, whereas Aux-(715–776) was obtained by digestion with NcoI and PvuII and ligated between the NcoI and filled-in EcoRI sites of the pET32a vector. To generate Aux-(715–813), the DNA of Aux-(715–902) was cleaved with BamHI and introduced into the pQE-30 vector that was linearized with the same enzyme. Aux-(547–618) was excised from Aux-(547–715) in pET32a using SphI and NcoI and inserted into the NcoI- and EcoRV-cleaved pET32b vector. The resulting SphI overhangs were blunted with mung bean nuclease. The Aux-(619–738) fragment was obtained with SphI, subcloned into pUC57 (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Roth, Germany), excised with SalI and HindIII, and inserted into the same restriction enzyme sites of the pQE-31 vector. This plasmid was then digested with SalI and StuI, treated with Klenow polymerase, and religated. Constructs of auxilin mutants were obtained with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) utilizing Aux-(547–910), Aux-(547–715), Aux-(715–902), and Aux-(619–738) as templates. Mutagenic primers were used to convert the DPF and DLL sequences into APA and ALA, respectively. 636WDW, 726NWQ, and 753FS were mutated into alanine residues. To generate the auxilin peptide 674DPFADLG, the oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCGATCCTTTCGCTGACCTGGGACGTTAAC and TCGAGTTAACGTCCCAAGGTCAGCGAAAGGATCG-3′ were melted at 95 °C for 2 min, annealed at 75 °C for 5 min, and cooled down to 4 °C at a rate of 0.6 °C/min. The double-stranded DNA was ligated with the pET32a expression vector that was linearized with BamHI and SalI. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were obtained from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany), New England Biolabs Inc. (Frankfurt, Germany), or MBI Fermentas. Verification of the engineered plasmids was performed through DNA sequencing. The point mutation T562A was detected for Aux-(547–715) and mutant constructs derived from this fragment. The recombinant clathrin fragments used in this work and the construct for His6-AP180-(328–896) were described previously (15Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Kalthoff C. Alves J. Urbanke C. Knorr R. Ungewickell E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8209-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The DNAs for the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs of clathrin-TD and the α-ear domain of AP-2 were kindly provided by Jim Keen (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) and Richard Anderson (University of Texas, Dallas, TX). Expression and Protein Purification—All recombinant proteins cloned into the pET32 vector series were transformed into BL21(DE3) bacteria (Merck Biosciences). Protein expression of pQE vector-derived auxilin fragments was performed in M15 bacteria (QIAGEN). The expression and purification protocol was described previously (15Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Aux-(547–715) mutant with 579DPF replaced with APA or with 591DLL replaced with ALA was extracted from inclusion bodies according to the recommendations given by QIAGEN. The auxilin fragments Aux-(547–715), Aux-(715–813), and Aux-(715–902) were further purified by ion exchange chromatography in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) using a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) that retained the contaminations quantitatively while the desired proteins were collected in the flow-through fraction. GST fusion proteins were thrombin (ICN)-digested to remove the GST moiety. hsc70 was prepared from porcine brains according to the protocol for bovine hsc70 (19Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Clathrin was extracted from pig brain clathrin-coated vesicles (20Lindner R. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1994: 525-530Google Scholar) using 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). After centrifugation for 20 min at 266,000 × g in a TLA100.4 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA), the supernatant was loaded onto a preparative Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) at 4 °C. Clathrin fractions without assembly proteins were concentrated overnight by ammonium sulfate precipitation in the presence of 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) on ice and pelleted at 72,000 × g for 20 min. To remove any residual ammonium sulfate, the purified clathrin was dialyzed against 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and assembly into cages was induced by dialysis against buffer A (100 mm MES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 6.4)). Limited Trypsin Digestion of Clathrin Cages—To remove the N-terminal domains from the clathrin heavy chains, clathrin cages (1.5 mg/ml) were mildly digested with a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml trypsin (Worthington) in a reaction volume of 515 μl in buffer A containing 1 mm CaCl2. After incubation for 15 min on ice and for 50 min at 10 °C, the reaction was terminated with 1.3 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor/mg of protease. Trypsin-digested cages were separated by ultracentrifugation for 20 min at 126,000 × g from the released N-terminal domains and the trypsin. The cages were washed once with buffer A, pelleted by ultracentrifugation, and finally resuspended in 90 μl of buffer B (25 mm HEPES, 12.5 mm potassium acetate, and 5 mm magnesium acetate (pH 7.1)) containing the inhibitor at ∼0.2 mg/ml. Limited Trypsin Digestion of Clathrin-coated Vesicles—Pig brain clathrin-coated vesicles were mildly digested with trypsin to deplete endogenous auxilin. 20 μl of clathrin-coated vesicles prepared as described (20Lindner R. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1994: 525-530Google Scholar) were incubated with 2 μg/ml trypsin for 30 min on ice in a total volume of 500 μl. To inactivate the trypsin, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to the reaction mixture. The vesicles were pelleted by ultracentrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 1.9 mm KH2PO4, and 8.2 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0)), and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer B containing the inhibitor at 5 μg/ml. This treatment quantitatively inactivated the associated auxilin, whereas many other components of clathrin-coated vesicles such as AP180 and clathrin heavy and light chains were not affected. Only the α-subunit of AP-2 was sensitive to degradation, but at least 20% of the starting material remained completely intact under the digestion conditions used. Cage Binding—1.4 × 10–10 mol of the recombinant auxilin fragments were incubated for 30 min on ice with 6.8 × 10–11 mol of clathrin assembled into cages in a total volume of 50 μl of buffer B. After centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 30 min, the clathrin pellets were resuspended in 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) in a final volume that corresponded to that of the supernatants. In all subsequent experiments, pellet and supernatant fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE were directly comparable to each other. Protein bands were quantified from digitalized images using NIH Image Version 1.62 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Clathrin Assembly—Assembly experiments were performed as described previously (15Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Uncoating Assay—The cofactor function of recombinant auxilin fragments was tested in an uncoating reaction that was carried out for 15 min at 25 °C with auxilin-depleted clathrin-coated vesicles (∼0.9 μm clathrin); 3.2 μm hsc70; and an ATP-regenerating system containing 2 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 units/ml creatine kinase in a total volume of 50 μl of buffer B. hsc70 was preincubated for 20 min on ice with the ATP-regenerating mixture and added to the vesicles and increasing substoichiometric concentrations of auxilin fragments. The released clathrin was separated from intact cages by ultracentrifugation. Trypsin-digested clathrin cages were dissociated under the same conditions as clathrin-coated vesicles using 1.4 μm clathrin and 68 nm recombinant auxilin fragments. Pull-down Experiments—Binding and competition experiments were performed as described (15Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. GST-αear domain and GST-TD fusion proteins precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated for1honiceina reaction volume of 50 μl of buffer B with 2 × 10–10 mol of the recombinant auxilin fragments. For competition experiments, the beads were diluted 1:3 with Sepharose CL-4B, and 1.5 × 10–10 mol of the recombinant auxilin fragments were mixed with an equimolar amount or a 2-, 5-, or 10-fold molar excess of either His6-AP180-(328–896) or the distal domain of clathrin. Overlay Assay with an Auxilin Peptide Array—Auxilin-derived peptide fragments 15 amino acids in length were chemically synthesized in situ on a cellulose membrane as described previously (21Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 22Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of each peptide overlapped with that of the following one by 12 residues spanning amino acids 570–789. In an overlay assay, biotinylated recombinant proteins of the α-ear domain of AP-2 and clathrin-TD were bound to the auxilin peptide array. Biotinylation was performed with 37.5 μg of EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce)/mg of protein according to the manufacturer's protocol. The peptide array was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the biotinylated proteins at 1 μg/ml in buffer B containing 3% bovine serum albumin and washed with ice-cold buffer B. Bound protein was detected after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) by chemiluminescence. Signals were visualized on ECL films (Amersham Biosciences), digitalized, and quantified using NIH Image Version 1.62 software. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were obtained using a Jobin Yvon Dichrograph III with a bandwidth of 2 nm, a scanning rate of 0.03 nm/s, and a time constant of 2 s. All measurements were conducted at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline with protein concentrations of 0.5–0.9 mg/ml isolated auxilin fragments, 0.25 mg/ml for experiments with 50% trifluoroethanol, or 1.3 mg/ml of a 1:1 molar ratio of auxilin fragments and clathrin-TD. The spectra were evaluated with CDPro software using the expanded reference set of protein spectra as described previously (23Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). Heat Denaturation—The susceptibility of auxilin fragments to irreversible denaturation was tested by heating the proteins in a boiling water bath and shock-cooling them afterward according to the protocol given by Kalthoff et al. (18Kalthoff C. Alves J. Urbanke C. Knorr R. Ungewickell E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8209-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Secondary Structure Analysis by CD Spectroscopy—We had shown previously that the clathrin-binding domain of auxilin contains several independent interaction sites for clathrin and AP-2 (15Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This finding raised the question of whether these sites can engage their ligands simultaneously and how the clathrin-binding region of auxilin is structurally organized. So far, only the fold of the C-terminal segment of auxilin (amino acids 737–910) encompassing the J-domain and a short stretch of the clathrin-binding region was determined by NMR analysis (24Han C.J. Gruschus J.M. Greener T. Greene L.E. Ferretti J. Eisenberg E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 281-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). That study revealed that the J-domain consists of five short α-helical strands, whereas the preceding ∼70 amino acids are largely flexible. In fact, computer-based primary structure analysis also predicts very little secondary structure for the entire clathrin-binding domain of auxilin. This lack of organized structure seems reminiscent of the disordered clathrin-binding domains of epsin-1 and AP180, two accessory proteins involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (13Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure. 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18Kalthoff C. Alves J. Urbanke C. Knorr R. Ungewickell E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8209-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To experimentally address the question about the secondary structure of the clathrin-binding domain of auxilin, we recombinantly expressed three fragments and analyzed them by far-UV CD spectroscopy (an overview of all auxilin fragments used in this study is shown in Fig. 1). The spectra revealed that both fragments His6-Aux-(547–715) and His6-Aux-(715–813) are almost completely unstructured (Fig. 2A and Table I). As expected, only the His6-Aux-(715–902) fragment, which includes the J-domain, contains a significant amount of α-helix. We therefore concluded that the clathrin-binding region of auxilin is highly flexible. However, there are numerous examples of intrinsically disordered proteins that gain structure upon interaction with their binding partners (for an overview, see Ref. 25Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). For instance, the isolated clathrin light chains are natively unfolded, but become largely α-helical upon interaction with the clathrin heavy chains (26Chen C.Y. Reese M.L. Hwang P.K. Ota N. Agard D. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6072-6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To test whether the unstructured fragments of auxilin would principally be capable of forming secondary structure in a suitable environment, we repeated the measurements with His6-Aux-(547–715) and His6-Aux-(715–813) in the presence and absence of trifluoroethanol, an organic cosolvent known to induce helicity in numerous peptides and proteins. Upon addition of trifluoroethanol, both fragments showed an increased content of α-helix, roughly corresponding to the formation of two short helical stretches with a length of ∼8 amino acids (Fig. 2, B and C). This suggests that at least parts of the disordered region of auxilin are generally capable of undergoing a conformational change to α-helices. However, when the fragments were combined in a 1:1 molar ratio with recombinantly expressed clathrin-TD and analyzed by CD spectroscopy, no difference was found between the spectra of the mixtures and the combined spectra of the individual components (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, auxilin apparently does not gain structure upon interaction with clathrin-TD. Similar observations were previously obtained for the interaction between the DPW domain of epsin-1 and the α-ear domain of AP-2 (13Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure. 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Howe"
https://openalex.org/W2053329213,"Arginine kinase is a member of the phosphagen kinase family that includes creatine kinase and likely shares a common reaction mechanism in catalyzing the buffering of cellular ATP energy levels. Abstraction of a proton from the substrate guanidinium by a catalytic base has long been thought to be an early mechanistic step. The structure of arginine kinase as a transition state analog complex (Zhou, G., Somasundaram, T., Blanc, E., Parthasarathy, G., Ellington, W. R., and Chapman, M. S. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 8449–8454) showed that Glu-225 and Glu-314 were the only potential catalytic residues contacting the phosphorylated nitrogen. In the present study, these residues were changed to Asp, Gln, and Val or Ala in several single and multisite mutant enzymes. These mutations had little impact on the substrate binding constants. The effect upon activity varied with reductions in k cat between 3000-fold and less than 2-fold. The retention of significant activity in some mutants contrasts with published studies of homologues and suggests that acid-base catalysis by these residues may enhance the rate but is not absolutely essential. Crystal structures of mutant enzymes E314D at 1.9 Å and E225Q at 2.8 Å resolution showed that the precise alignment of substrates is subtly distorted. Thus, pre-ordering of substrates might be just as important as acid-base chemistry, electrostatics, or other potential effects in the modest impact of these residues upon catalysis.

Thus, pre-ordering of substrates might be just as important as acid-base chemistry, electrostatics, or other potential effects in the modest impact of these residues upon catalysis. Phosphagens and their corresponding phosphagen kinases play a central role in energy homeostasis in cells with highly variable rates of ATP turnover (1Schlattner U. Eder M. Dolder M. Khuchua Z.A. Strauss A.W. Wallimann T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Ellington W.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 289-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Phosphagen kinases are a conserved family of phosphoryl transfer enzymes that includes creatine, arginine, glycocyamine, lombricine, taurocyamine, and hypotaurocyamine kinases. All are thought to share a common mechanism by which one of the guanidinyl nitrogens becomes phosphorylated. Arginine kinase is widespread in invertebrates and may be the primordial enzyme because of its widely available substrate, monomeric structure, and presence in protozoa (2Ellington W.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 289-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The reversible reaction catalyzed by arginine kinase is: phosphoarginine + Mg-ADP ⇄ arginine + Mg-ATP. Phosphagen kinases are among the most intensively studied by classic enzymology (3Stroud R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and constitute paradigms for the fundamentals of catalysis of multisubstrate reactions. Pre-ordering and alignment of substrates likely contribute more to the catalysis of bimolecular reactions than the better characterized unimolecular reactions, but there is little consensus on its importance relative to acid-base chemistry, strain, and other catalytic effects (4Wolfenden R. Snider M. Ridgway C. Miller B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7419-7420Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Bruice T.C. Benkovic S.J.

One challenge was a lack of high resolution structures of multisubstrate enzyme complexes in which the alignment of two substrates could be viewed without perturbation or constraint, an obstacle overcome first with the structure of arginine kinase (7Zhou G. Somasundaram T. Blanc E. Parthasarathy G. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8449-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Several phosphagen kinase structures have become available recently, including creatine kinases from chicken muscle mitochondria (8Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), rabbit muscle (9Rao J.K. Bujacz G. Wlodawer A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), chicken brain (10Eder M. Schlattner U. Becker A. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Fritz-Wolf K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), human mitochondria (ubiquitous) (11Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and arginine kinase from horseshoe crab (12Yousef M.S. Clark S. Pruett P.S. Somasundaram T. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), all structures determined in the open, inactive configuration. The structure of arginine kinase was also determined as a transition state complex (TSAC 1The abbreviations used are: TSAC, transition state analog complex; AKorig, original clone of arginine kinase containing four PCR amplification coding errors; AKrev, clone with native sequence restored through mutagenesis; TSA, transition state analog.; Mg2+-ADP, nitrate, arginine) (7Zhou G. Somasundaram T. Blanc E. Parthasarathy G. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8449-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) in a closed conformation with ordered active site loops. This structure prompted re-examination of the catalytic mechanism here and elsewhere (see below). The recent structure of creatine kinase from Torpedo californica revealed one subunit in a binary Mg-ADP complex, the other as TSAC, confirming that the transition state structures of creatine and arginine kinases were very similar (13Lahiri S.D. Wang P.F. Babbitt P.C. McLeish M.J. Kenyon G.L. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13861-13867Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Prior to these structures, biochemical kinetics, chemical modification, and site-directed mutagenesis led to a proposed mechanism of in-line phosphoryl transfer involving abstraction of a guanidinyl proton as an early step, catalyzed, it was long thought, by a histidine (14Cook P.F. Kenyon G.L. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The arginine kinase TSA structure, in fact, showed only two residues, Glu-225 and Glu-314, in contact with the phosphorylated guanidinium nitrogen (Fig. 1). If the pKs of the glutamates were matched to the reactant arginine for efficient isoergonic proton transfer, then it implied that proton abstraction would not be initial but subsequent to or coincident with addition of the new N—P bond when the nitrogen would have lower pK (7Zhou G. Somasundaram T. Blanc E. Parthasarathy G. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8449-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the glutamates were positioned for interactions favoring a tetrahedral reactive nitrogen. The TSAC structure, now refined to 1.2 Å resolution (15Yousef M.S. Fabiola F. Gattis J. Somasundaram T. Chapman M.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 2009-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggested another potential role of the glutamates. The reactants were all aligned precisely within 3° of optimal for in-line transfer. This raised interesting questions about the relative roles of acid-base chemistry and substrate pre-ordering in the catalysis of this multisubstrate reaction and the roles in each played by these two glutamates. Glu-225 is highly conserved, and mutagenesis soon suggested that the corresponding residues in creatine kinase were critical for (acid-base) catalysis: Glu-227 and Glu-232, respectively, in the human mitochondrial and muscle enzymes (16Eder M. Stolz M. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cantwell J.S. Novak W.R. Wang P.F. McLeish M.J. Kenyon G.L. Babbitt P.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Glu-314 of arginine kinase is in a poorly conserved region, aligned with a valine in most alignments to creatine kinase sequences (18Strong S.J. Ellington W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, prior to the recent T. californica creatine kinase structure (13Lahiri S.D. Wang P.F. Babbitt P.C. McLeish M.J. Kenyon G.L. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13861-13867Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), it could also be aligned with a neighboring aspartate, conserving a carboxylate throughout the family (7Zhou G. Somasundaram T. Blanc E. Parthasarathy G. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8449-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Asp-326 in human muscle creatine kinase indicated an essential role, perhaps in substrate alignment (17Cantwell J.S. Novak W.R. Wang P.F. McLeish M.J. Kenyon G.L. Babbitt P.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we report mutagenesis and structural studies that suggest a different interpretation of catalysis and the roles of these amino acids.

Original Clone—Two variants of an arginine kinase expression system were used, both derived from a pET 22b (Novagen) plasmid clone (19Strong S.J. Ellington W.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 113: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that contains a selectable ampicillin resistance gene. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was transformed for expression of protein, whereas strain DH5α was used to produce plasmid DNA for mutagenesis. The first expression system was the same as used in the original structure determination (7Zhou G. Somasundaram T. Blanc E. Parthasarathy G. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8449-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Zhou G. Parthasarathy G. Somasundaram T. Ables A. Roy L. Strong S.J. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and is termed AKorig. Sequencing, prompted by the structure, revealed PCR-generated nucleotide misin-corporations leading to four amino acid changes, E103Q, D112G, G116A, and K351R. These were reverted back to the native sequence using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) consecutively, in the order G112D, Q103E, A116G, R351K, using plasmid from the prior round of mutagenesis as the template for the next round. Sequences were confirmed using an ABI model 3100 DNA sequencer. The final native clone has been designated as reverted wild type AKrev. Mutagenesis was carried out using both AKorig and AKrev templates and the QuikChange kit. Sequences of constructs were confirmed by sequencing from both ends of the gene and with internal primers. Expression and Protein Purification from AK orig —Small cultures of E. coli containing the plasmid were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. One-liter cultures were inoculated with 20 ml of this overnight culture, grown to mid log phase (optical density A 600 = 0.5), and protein expression was induced with a final concentration of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested at 5–6 h postinduction and lysed in a French pressure cell. Protein was expressed as inclusion bodies, unfolded in 8 m urea, and refolded by sequential dialysis against decreasing concentrations of urea. Enzyme from this system was purified by previously reported chromatographic methods (20Zhou G. Parthasarathy G. Somasundaram T. Ables A. Roy L. Strong S.J. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Expression and Protein Purification from Wild Type AK rev —The same procedures were used for E. coli culture and induction. However, protein was mostly in the soluble fraction after lysis. The properly folded and active protein was put directly onto a DEAE anion exchange column after dialysis against running buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3) and eluted with a 0–200 mm KCl gradient. This was followed by size exclusion chromatography on a S100 Sephacryl column. Chromatography was carried out using an ÄKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). Concentration—Protein was concentrated for crystallization using Centricon-10 microconcentrators or an Amicon cell with 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff YM-10 membranes. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at A 280, using an extinction coefficient of 0.76 ml·mg–1·cm–1. For enzyme dialyzed against TSA components, the concentration was measured with the BioRad protein reagent microassay and uncomplexed arginine kinase as a standard. Enzyme Kinetics—Phosphoryl transfer was assayed in the reverse direction by measurement of the increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to production of NADPH resulting from linkage of ATP production to the hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reactions (21Rosalki S.B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1967; 69: 696-705PubMed Google Scholar). Note, in contrast to creatine kinase, the substrate binding constants for arginine and Mg-ATP for the forward reaction are similar to those for the reverse direction (phosphoarginine and Mg-ADP) (22Blethen S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Doumen C. Ellington W.R. J. Comp. Physiol. 1990; B160: 459-468Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Kinetics assays were set up in a 6 × 6 matrix of ADP versus phosphoarginine concentrations, with phosphoarginine between 0.2 and 3.2 mm and ADP between 0.03 and 0.96 mm. Concentrations of ADP in assay stocks were verified by UV absorbance, whereas phosphoarginine concentrations were determined by a spectrophotometric enzymatic assay using highly purified arginine kinase. Assays were conducted in triplicate at 25 °C using a Varian Cary 3E UV-VIS spectrophotometer. Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot (SPSS, Inc.). Crystallization—AKorig protein at 10–20 mg/ml was dialyzed against transition state analog components (7Zhou G. Somasundaram T. Blanc E. Parthasarathy G. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8449-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and crystallized by vapor diffusion at 4 °C. Crystals of E314D measuring ∼1.0 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3 were obtained through both macro-seeding (24Stura E.A. Wilson I.A. Methods. 1990; 1: 38-49Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and de novo set-ups. For seeding, a 10-μl drop comprised of 5 μl of 20 mg/ml protein plus 5 μl of 26% PEG6000, 0.025 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.05 m MgCl2 was aliquoted onto a coverslip and then seeded with a piece of an AKorig crystal (grown under the same conditions). The drop was then equilibrated by vapor diffusion against 26% PEG6000. For de novo crystallization of E314D, the drop contained 5 μl of 20 mg/ml protein plus 5 μl of 32% PEG6000, 0.025 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.05 m MgCl2 for a drop concentration of 16% PEG6000. It was equilibrated by vapor diffusion against 28% PEG6000. The same conditions were used for de novo crystallization of E225Q, except that drops were made from 2 μl of ∼24 mg/ml protein solution plus 2 μl of 26% PEG6000. De novo crystals of E225Q were not of sufficient quality but were used for microseeding (24Stura E.A. Wilson I.A. Methods. 1990; 1: 38-49Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) identical conditions. Data Collection—Diffraction data were collected with an R-Axis II image plate detector (Rigaku/Molecular Structure Corporation) and a rotating anode x-ray source at our in-house facility. E314D/TSA and E225Q/TSA data were collected at 100 K using 25% PEG6000 + 20% glycerol as the cryoprotectant. Structure Determination—The Denzo/Scalepack/HKL suite (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography; Crystallography of Biological Molecules. Vol. F. International Union of Crystallography, Dortrecht, The, Netherlands2001: 226-235Google Scholar) was used for data processing. Rotation and translation searches were carried out with GLRF (26Tong L. Rossmann M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 594-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), using TSAC arginine kinase as a model. Manual rebuilding using the program “O” (27Kleywegt G.J. Jones A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was alternated with atomic refinement using the CNS package (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Gross-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kurzewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar). Expression and Crystallization—Conversion of the original arginine kinase construct (AKorig) to the wild type construct (AKrev) unexpectedly increased the solubility of the expressed enzyme. AKorig, found predominantly in inclusion bodies, had to be unfolded and refolded before purification (20Zhou G. Parthasarathy G. Somasundaram T. Ables A. Roy L. Strong S.J. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), resulting in final yields of 10–30 mg/liter of E. coli culture. The conversion of AKorig to AKrev (actually the change G112D) resulted in more enzyme in the soluble fraction. Each 1-liter culture of E. coli provided 100–200 mg of protein, yielding 80–100 mg after purification. The recombinant enzymes from AKorig and AKrev, as well as that isolated from horseshoe crab muscle, had indistinguishable kinetic parameters (data not shown). However, high quality crystals have only been obtained for AKorig. Extensive efforts to crystallize the four conservative single-site mutant proteins led to diffraction grade crystals for two, E225Q and E314D. Kinetics—Kinetic values from the 6 × 6 matrix assay yielded K m, K S, V max, and k cat values for the wild type mutants (Table I). Here, K m is defined as the ternary steady-state constant (a measure of binding the second substrate in this random-order rapid equilibrium reaction (22Blethen S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)), whereas K S, denoted as K iA by some authors, is the “initial” binary steady-state constant. Kinetic plots for the wild type mutants were consistent with the random order bi-bi mechanism (data not shown). Individual mutations to Asp and Gln at positions E225 and E314 and the double mutation E225Q/E314Q had little impact on the K m and K S values for ADP and phosphoarginine yet reduced the catalytic activity 60–500-fold (Table I). Substrate binding synergy, one substrate facilitating the binding of the second and characterized by α = K m/K S < 1, is similar to that of chicken cardiac mitochondrial and rabbit muscle creatine kinases (29Maggio E.T. Kenyon G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1202-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Furter R. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). There is a partial loss of synergy with mutation at Glu-225, but the change is not always experimentally significant and involves different effects upon K m and K S for different mutants. Overall, catalytic activity is affected much more than substrate binding.Table IKinetic analysis of the wild type and seven mutants in the reverse direction (phosphoarginine → ATP)Wild typeE225DE225QE225AE314DE314QR312G/E314V/H315D/E317A/E319VE225Q/E314QK s (ADP) mM0.28 ± 0.060.30 ± 0.170.21 ± 0.04NDaThe percentage rate shown for E225A is based on specific activity, which was too low for measurement of bimolecular steady state kinetic parameters.0.29 ± 0.090.26 ± 0.020.13 ± 0.060.21 ± 0.02Km (ADP) mM0.12 ± 0.010.26 ± 0.110.16 ± 0.06NDaThe percentage rate shown for E225A is based on specific activity, which was too low for measurement of bimolecular steady state kinetic parameters.0.16 ± .0030.14 ± .0040.08 ± .0080.16 ± 0.04K s (Phosphoarginine) nM1.4 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.2NDaThe percentage rate shown for E225A is based on specific activity, which was too low for measurement of bimolecular steady state kinetic parameters.1.8 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.51.7 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.2Km (Phosphoarginine) mM0.63 ± 0.060.72 ± 0.160.88 ± 0.25NDaThe percentage rate shown for E225A is based on specific activity, which was too low for measurement of bimolecular steady state kinetic parameters.0.98 ± 0.250.68 ± 0.180.92 ± 0.21.45 ± 0.39α0.45 ± 0.110.88 ± 0.110.77 ± 0.36NDaThe percentage rate shown for E225A is based on specific activity, which was too low for measurement of bimolecular steady state kinetic parameters.0.57 ± 0.190.53 ± 0.050.59 ± 0.060.77 ± 0.12k cat (s-1) (%wt)140 ± 8 (100%)0.34 ± 0.30 (0.24%)0.45 ± 0.02 (0.3%)0.03%aThe percentage rate shown for E225A is based on specific activity, which was too low for measurement of bimolecular steady state kinetic parameters.2.17 ± 0.60 (1.7%)0.37 ± 0.20 (0.3%)116 ± 4 (83%)0.27 ± 0.01 (0.2%)a The percentage rate shown for E225A is based on specific activity, which was too low for measurement of bimolecular steady state kinetic parameters. Open table in a new tab The most surprising result came from a multisite mutant that included the non-conservative mutation E314V. This chimeric construct, containing several substitutions of creatine kinase residues into arginine kinase, was part of an on-going study of substrate specificity. It became relevant to this study with the unexpected finding of only 2-fold loss of activity despite a non-conservative change at one of the putative catalytic bases. The non-conservative mutation at the other glutamate, E225A, showed 3,000-fold reduction in activity relative to wild type, precluding full kinetic analysis but confirming that this residue also is not absolutely essential for catalysis. E314D/TSA Structure—The crystal of E314D was nearly isomorphous with wild type (Table II), and its structure was solved by molecular replacement using the CNS package (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Gross-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kurzewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The final model includes an ADP molecule, a nitrate, one Mg2+, a substrate arginine, and 395 water molecules. It has R/R free of 0.18/0.24 and only 0.6% of φ, ψ angles in the generously allowed region of a Ramachandran plot (none disallowed) (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Overall, the E314D mutant structure is similar to wild type, with an overall root mean square difference between the Cα atoms of the two structures of 0.39 Å. Localized differences near the loop containing 314 include (Fig. 1C): (i) movement of the side chain carboxylate of E314D by 0.7 Å so that separate O ∈1 and O ∈2 interactions with substrate arginine N ∈ and N η2 are replaced by a single bridging interaction of O δ2 to both the N ∈ and N η2 (Fig. 1D); (ii) movement of the loop near 314 by up to 0.9 Å (Fig. 1C); (iii) small changes in the alignment of the substrate analogs (Fig. 1E and Table III), due to movements of the ADP phosphates, Mg2+, NO3–, and arginine by up to 0.25 Å (detailed below); and (iv) a movement of His-315 away from the active site, 1.5 Å at the Cγ atom (Fig. 1C). The movement of His-315 and the 180° flipping of its χ2 side chain torsion angle establishes a possible 2.6-Å salt bridge interaction with the terminal carboxyl group of the substrate arginine that is not present in wild type (Fig. 1D). It also disrupts a water-mediated interaction to the backbone carbonyl of residue 62, on the other flexible loop, reducing the distance from 5.9 to 3.7 Å, too short for an intervening water but too long for a direct hydrogen bond. However, this has little impact on the backbone structure near residue 62.Table IIIGeometrical parameters of phosphoryl transfer for the E314D and E225Q mutations compared to wild-typeInteraction typeFromAtToWild typeE225QE314DOptimal in-line transfer (7Zhou G.

https://openalex.org/W2147041011,"The targeted disruption of cartilage link protein gene (Crtl1) in homozygous mice resulted in a severe chondrodysplasia and perinatal lethality. This raised the question of whether the abnormalities seen in Crtl1 null mice are all caused by the absence of link protein in cartilage or whether the deficiency of the protein in other tissues and organs contributed to the phenotype. To address this question we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing cartilage link protein under the control of a cartilage-specific promoter, and then these transgenic mice were used for a genetic rescue of abnormalities in Crtl1 null mice. While the overexpression of cartilage link protein resulted in no abnormal phenotype, the cartilage-specific transgene expression of link protein could completely prevent the perinatal mortality of link protein-deficient mice and, depending on the level of the link protein expression, rescue skeletal abnormalities. Although link protein was originally isolated from cartilage, we found and determined Crtl1 transcripts and corresponding proteins in every organ tested from mouse embryos to aging animals. We also identified three additional members of the link protein family, all co-localized with hyaluronic acid-binding proteoglycans in the mouse genome. The ubiquitous presence of link protein suggests a general and systemic function of link protein in the organization of extracellular matrix in a number of tissues, possibly interacting with other proteoglycans, such as versican, brevican, and neurocan.

A highly specific macromolecular organization of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; Crtl1/CRTL1, cartilage link protein; HA, hyaluronic acid; LP, link protein; DMMB, dimethyl-methylene-blue; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; QT, quantitative; RT, reverse trascription. is required for chondrogenesis, chondrocyte differentiation, endochondral ossification, and for the maintenance of the weight-bearing function of articular cartilage. The major macromolecular components of this ECM are the proteoglycan aggrecan, hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan, HA), link protein (LP) and type II collagen. Hundreds of aggrecan molecules associate with a single HA filament to form large proteoglycan aggregates. The link protein, a glycoprotein, binding simultaneously to both HA and aggrecan, stabilizes the aggregate structure (1Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and the aggregates are entrapped within the mesh-like network of type II collagen fibrils (2Neame P.J. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. J.

This wide distribution of LP suggests that it may have a similar function in various organs to that described for cartilage by stabilizing the interactions between HA-versican in connective tissues (17Yamauchi S.

In addition, recent findings indicate that LP, or at least its N-terminal domain, may function as a growth factor up-regulating the synthesis of aggrecan and type II collagen in cartilage (21Martin H. Dean M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22McKenna L.A. Liu H.X. Sansom P.A. Dean M.F.

Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although mutation(s) in the cartilage LP gene (CRTL1) was excluded in several human hereditable chondrodysplasias (25Loughlin J. Irven C. Sykes B. Hum. Genet. 1994; 94: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 26Hecht J.T. Blanton S.H. Wang Y. Daiger S.P. Horton W.A. Rhodes C. Yamada Y. Francomano C.A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 44: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), a recent study of mice with targeted mutation in the Crtl1 gene clearly showed a prominent function of LP in chondrocyte differentiation, cartilage ECM organization, and skeletal development (27Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The lack of LP in homozygous mice was perinatal lethal, accompanied by severe skeletal abnormalities (27Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether all the abnormalities and the perinatal lethality are caused by the LP deficiency in cartilage, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing cartilage LP under the control of a cartilage-specific promoter, and then these transgenic mice were used for genetic rescue of the phenotype in Crtl1 null mice. We isolated and sequenced the mouse cartilage LP cDNA (Crtl1), which then was inserted into a cartilage-specific expression vector. While the overexpression of cartilage LP has resulted in no abnormal phenotype, the cartilage-specific transgene expression of LP could completely prevent the perinatal mortality of LP-deficient mice and rescue skeletal abnormalities depending on the level of the LP expression. Isolation and Cloning of the Murine LP Gene—Cartilage from articular joints of neonatal (2-5-days old) BALB/c mice were dissected, total RNA isolated, and reverse transcribed (RT) as described previously (28Cs-Szabó G. Melching L.I. Roughley P.J. Glant T.T. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Fülöp C. Kamath R.V. Li Y. Otto J.M. Salustri A. Olsen B.R. Glant T.T. Hascall V.C. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 202: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Prior to reverse transcription, samples were digested with DNase I (Invitrogen) to eliminate residual genomic DNA from the RNA sample. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA primed by oligo(dT) using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described previously (28Cs-Szabó G. Melching L.I. Roughley P.J. Glant T.T. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The strategy for identification of the mouse LP gene was based upon RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), first using primers homologous in various species and then using mouse specific primers. PCR products were directly cloned into the TA-vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced from both directions. Overlapping clones from the 5′ and 3′ ends were generated, using a 5′-RACE system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and 5′ and 3′ Genome Walker systems (Clontech), and cloned into the pT-ADV vector. To identify the 5′ transcription start site, primer extension was employed. A reverse primer in exon 1 (LP1) was end-labeled and used to both reverse transcribe mRNA from mouse chondrocytes and sequence a PCR product of genomic DNA corresponding to the LP promoter region. Both the [33P]ATP-labeled RT product and the sequencing reaction were run in parallel on a 7% Long Ranger sequencing gel (FMC, Rockland, ME). For determination of intron-exon structure, the Genome Walker kit was employed using gene-specific nested primers located in the neighboring exons (not shown; primer sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request). The resulting PCR products were sequenced, and sequence alignments and analysis were performed using the Omiga™ 2.0 computer package (Oxford Molecular Group, Hunt Valley, MD) or the NIH BLAST Server. Whenever it was possible, a long range PCR using genomic DNA template from BALB/c mice was used to determine the size of introns. To determine tissue distribution of Crtl1, total RNA was isolated from various organs and tissues, and reverse transcribed as described above. To identify reverse transcribed LP mRNA in various organs, RT-PCR was employed using LP2 and LP3 or LP4 and LP5 primers (Table I). The same PCR primers (LP4 and LP5) were used to detect the presence of transgene in genomic DNA samples. PCR products were separated in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Representative PCR products were isolated from gels (Quiaex II gel extraction kit, Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and sequenced using an ABI 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For quantitative analysis, real-time PCR was used. For Northern dot-blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from 20.5-day-old embryos (E20.5) and mRNA purified using Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen Inc). Two μg of this oligo(dT)-purified mRNA in 2 μl of final volume was dotted on GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), baked at 80 °C in a vacuum oven, prehybridized (30Roebuck K.A. Vermes C. Carpenter L.R. Fritz E.A. Ramesh N. Glant T.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and then hybridized with a [32P]dCTP-labeled 775-bp-long PCR product generated by primers LP6 and LP7 (Table I).Table IPrimers used for cartilage LP cloning and analysisPrimerSequence 5′ to 3′DirectionLocationPCR product sizePCR conditionsbpLP1GAGTGCGGTGTGGGTGTGRevExon 1Primer extensionPrimers for RT-PCR and genotyping transgenic miceLP2CCTTTCAGACAGCTACACTCCForExon 2292ALP3AAACACTCGACCTTGATAGCCRevExon 3LP4AGGAATCCACAAAATCCForExon 3540BLP5CAGAAAACGTCATATCTGCRevExon 4LP6CTTACCCTGGAGGATTATGGForExon 3775CLP7TTGCATGAGTTTCATATTAAARevExon 5LP8GTGCAGTACCCAATCACCAAACForExon 4319DLP9GTCGAGAAATAGGATAGCGGACGRevExon 5Primers for real-time PCRLP10TGCAGTACCCAATCACCAAACCForExon 487ELP11CTTGTCCCAAAACCCGTAGTTCCRevExon 4GP1CTACATGTTCCAGTATGACTCCACTCACGForGAPDH79FGP2GTTGATGACAAGCTTCCCATTCTCGRevGAPDHPrimers for knockout genotypingLP12TAATGACCTTTCCTGTCTCTCCForIntron 3283 or 1883DLP13CCCAAAACCCGTAGTTCCRevExon 4PNeo1GGATCGGCCATTGAACAAGForNeomycin600BPNeo2CACCATGATATTCGGCAAGCRevNeomycinLP14GTCGGGCAGAGGCAGAGCATTTTGAGForIntron 32200GPNeo3GCTACCGGTGGATGTGGAATGTGTGCRevNeomycin Open table in a new tab Real-time Quantitative PCR (QT-PCR)—Crtl1 gene expression in different organs of newborn wild type mice and in cartilage of newborn mice with different genotypes, was quantified by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using the Smart Cycler system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), and detection was carried out by measuring the binding of fluorescent SYBR Green-I to double-stranded DNA. The PCR reactions were carried out in microtubes in 25-μl volume. cDNA template (1 μl) of RT-PCR product was added to a PCR reaction mixture which contained final concentrations of 0.5 μm Crtl1 specific forward (LP10) and reverse (LP11) primers (Table I), 1:50,000 dilution of SYBR Green-I stock solution (BioWhitaker Molecular Applications Cambrex, Rockland, ME), 200 μm dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). For normalization, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was amplified with forward (GP1) and reverse (GP2) primers (Table I). The fluorescence emitted by the reporter dye was detected online in real-time, and the threshold cycle (Ct) of each sample was recorded as a quantitative measure of the amount of PCR product in the sample. The Ct is the cycle number at which the fluorescence exceeds a fixed level above baseline. The Crtl1 signal was normalized against the quantity of GAPDH and expressed as ΔCt = (Ct Crtl1 - Ct GAPDH). The differences in Crtl1 signal were expressed as ΔΔCt = ΔCt organs - ΔCt cartilage in the interorgan comparison of Crtl1 expression, and as ΔΔCt = ΔCt other genotypes - ΔCt wild type in the Crtl1 expression comparison between different genotypes. Relative gene expressions were than calculated as 2-ΔΔCt. The real-time PCR assay included two independent reverse transcribed RNA samples isolated from three embryos or organs and tissues of three animals. Crtl1-deficient and Transgenic Mice with Tissue-specific Overexpression of LP in Cartilage—The Crtl1-deficient founder male was received from the National Institutes of Health/NIDCR. Gene targeting was performed by disrupting exon 4 of the Crtl1 gene at the BsgI site upstream of the HA-binding “link modules” by the pGK-neor-poly(A) cassette in the pPNT vector (27Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To generate transgenic mice that overexpress LP in cartilage, we designed a cartilage-specific transgenic expression vector (31Glant T.T. Kamath R.V. Bárdos T. Gál I. Szánto S. Murad Y.M. Sandy J.D. Mort J.S. Roughley P.J. Mikecz K. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2207-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). To generate transgenic mice that overexpress the murine cartilage LP mRNA, a 1758-bp-long cDNA fragment containing the entire coding sequence was blunt-end ligated into the polylinker site of the transgenic vector pSP/44-3 (Fig. 1A). After linearization and gel purification, the transgenic construct was used for microinjection (DNX Technologies, Princeton, NJ). Initially, 10 founder mice were identified to harbor the transgene. From these mice, four independent transgenic lines were established and then two, a low (Crtl1 TgA) and a high (Crtl1 TgC), transgene and protein-expressing lines were used for rescue experiments. While transgenic products were dominantly expressed in cartilaginous tissues in embryonic life, we were able to detect transcripts eventually in all organs of Crtl1-null embryos and newborn mice carrying the LP transgene (Fig. 1E), but only in the skeletal tissues of adult animals (data not shown). This indicates that, despite the cartilage-specific type II collagen-driven promoter, pSP/44-3 expression vector, at least in the embryonic life or at the perinatal age, was leaking. Mice were genotyped by PCR using gene or neomycin (Neo)-specific primers with genomic DNA templates (Table I and Fig. 1D). Genomic DNA was isolated from tails by a standard method (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), and a primer pair of LP4 and LP5 was used to identify the presence of the transgene (Fig. 1D). Crtl1 heterozygosity was demonstrated by the presence of two PCR products (283 bp without and 1.88 kbp with neo, Fig. 1D, lane 3) using gene-specific LP12 forward and LP13 reverse primers (Table I). In addition, homozygosity of the Crtl1 deficiency was confirmed by the presence of (i) Neo-specific (PNeo1 and PNeo2), and (ii) gene- (LP14) and Neo-specific (PNeo3) primer-generated PCR products, and (iii) the absence of the 283-bp PCR product by LP12 and LP13 (Table I). Rescue of Perinatal Lethality Due to Crtl1 Deficiency—For rescue experiments, we generated Crtl1 -/- animals that also carried the Crtl1 transgene. Initially, homozygous transgenic females of lines A and C (Crtl1 TgA and Crtl1 TgC; F9-F10 generations) were mated with heterozygous LP-null males (Crtl1 +/-), first to generate heterozygous Crtl1 +/- Crtl1 Tg+ offspring. Progeny (N1 generation) was genotyped by PCR, and Crtl1 +/- mice carrying the transgene (Crtl1 TgA+ or Crtl1 TgC+) were selected for further breeding. Mice heterozygous for both endogenous and transgene Crtl1 were intercrossed to generate Crtl1 -/- Crtl1 TgA+ or Crtl1 -/- Crtl1 TgC+ genotypes. Generation of Polyclonal Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were generated against murine LP by immunizing rabbits with synthetic link protein peptides (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Peptides were designed as LPro1 (142VIEGLEDDTGV) and LPro2 (341KKHKLYGVYCFRAYN) based upon their hydrophilic character (33Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) and predicted antigenicity (34Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar) using methods incorporated in the Omiga 2.0 software package. Peptides were coupled to keyhole Limpet hemocyanin (35Pierschbacher M. Hayman E.G. Ruoshlati E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1224-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), dissolved in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) and emulsified in 1 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant. Three rabbits were immunized intramuscularly (3-5 mg/injection) with each peptide conjugate. Boosters were given every 2-3 weeks with peptide conjugates emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Sera from immunized rabbits were collected weekly after the fifth injection. Antibodies from rabbit sera were purified on corresponding peptides bound to sulfolink columns (36Roughley P.J. White R.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). While all antibodies detected LP, polyclonal antibodies LPro1-R11 and LPro2-R18 were the most specific, showing essentially no background in Western blotting. Based upon the synthetic peptide sequence (LPro2) used for immunization, the polyclonal antibody LPro2-R18 was not only murine LP specific, but also cross-reacted with LP from human cartilage. Indeed, when LPro2-R18 was first preincubated with the synthetic peptide LPro2, or pre-absorbed with either mouse LP or human cartilage extract, it was no longer able to cross-react with either mouse or human cartilages. LPro1-R11 did not react with human cartilage, but could be also neutralized with either synthetic peptide LPro1 or purified mouse LP. These two antibodies were used for both Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry in this study. Tissue Extraction, Protein Purification, and Western Blot Analysis—For quantitative analysis, cartilage samples from 4-day-old newborn mice were pulverized under liquid nitrogen and then extracted with 4 m guanidinium chloride in the presence of protease inhibitors as described (37Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Roughley P.J. Buzás E. Poole A.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Extracts were dialyzed against water, freeze-dried, and normalized for protein content by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) and for sulfated glycosaminoglycan content by dimethyl-methylene-blue (DMMB) assay (38Muller G. Hanschke M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 33: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Crude extracts from various organs of 40 adult mice were prepared in 4 m guanidinium chloride containing protease inhibitors as described above, except that tissue samples were homogenized. As the Crtl1 transcript was detected in many organs, but the translation product was detected only in crude extracts from cartilaginous tissues, subsequent purification was performed. Approximately 600 mg of lyophilized tissue/organ extracts were rehydrated in 60 ml of 0.4 m guanidinium chloride in 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.8, with enzyme inhibitors. Then 2 mg/ml HA (Sigma) and 2 mg/ml highly purified rat chondrosarcoma aggrecan (D1D1) (37Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Roughley P.J. Buzás E. Poole A.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), free of LP, were added to each sample. Samples were gently stirred for 24 h at 4 °C. The density of each sample was adjusted to 1.5 g/ml by cesium chloride and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 48 h at 10 °C (37Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Roughley P.J. Buzás E. Poole A.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Guanidine concentration of the bottom 1/3 fraction was increased to 4 m, stirred overnight at 4 °C, and the density adjusted to 1.5 g/ml. Samples were spun as above for 60 h. The top ⅙ fraction of this dissociative gradient (A1A1D6) was collected (39Hascall V.C. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4232-4241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Baker J.R. Caterson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2387-2393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dialyzed against water and lyophilized. This procedure resulted in 2-8 mg of lyophilized material from the 600 mg of tissue extracts, which was used to detect LP in different organs. Crude extracts from skeletal tissue of wild type, transgenic, and rescued newborn mice were rehydrated in Tris acetate (0.1 m, pH 7.2) buffer containing 0.15 m sodium chloride. Samples normalized to either protein or DMMB content were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels under reducing conditions. Gels were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and stained with rabbit antibodies to mouse LP (LPro1-R11 or LPro2-R18) (0.05 μg/ml diluted in 1% milk/PBS) followed by affinity-purified and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY) (28Cs-Szabó G. Melching L.I. Roughley P.J. Glant T.T. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Enhanced chemiluminesence (Amersham Biosciences) at a serial time range was used to detect immune reaction, which was then quantified using a Protein Database Inc. (Huntington Station, NY) gel scanner and an integrated software package program. Relative amounts of antibody-stained proteins were identified on the membrane expressed as pixel densities and normalized to mouse LP (A1A1D6) purified from newborn mouse cartilage by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation as described above. Macroscopic and Histological Staining of Skeletal Tissues—Bones and cartilage of newborn mice were stained with alizarin red and alcian blue in 70% ethanol as described elsewhere (41Kimmel C.A. Trammell C. Stain Technol. 1981; 56: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), with the modification that the staining step was extended to 3 days for newborn mice and 4 days for 4-day-old mice. Specimens for histology were fixed with 10% buffered formalin, decalcified for 1-2 weeks, and then embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (6 μm) were trichrome-stained with safranin O, fast green, and iron hematoxylin. For immunohistochemistry, mouse organs/tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetec, Torrance, CA), and 6-8-μm-thick frozen sections on 3-aminopropyltriethoxi-silane-coated (Sigma) slides were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 5 min. Sections were washed with PBS and pretreated with protease-free chondroitinase ABC (0.5 unit/ml; Seikagaku, Japan) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by incubation with 10% normal goat serum in PBS. Sections were immunostained with LPro1-R11 polyclonal antibody (1:100) diluted in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum for 1 h. All immunostainings were carried out in room temperature. After washing, sections were treated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:100 in PBS for 1 h. The slides were washed, mounted in Fluoromount (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), and analyzed using a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope or Eclipse TE 200 confocal microscope (Nikon, Garden City, NJ).

Subsequently, 3′- and 5′-RACE systems were used to determine the 2780-bp murine LP sequence, which has been deposited into GeneBank™/EBI (accession number AF098460). The coding region contained a single open reading frame of 1065 nucleotides encoding a protein of 355 amino acid residues, which is one residue (His) shorter than described by Deák et al. (47Deák F. Mates L. Krysan K. Liu Z. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Beier D.R. Kiss I. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 87: 75-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

We have previously shown that copper ions are required to nitrosylate thiol groups in the core protein of glypican-1, a heparan sulfate-substituted proteoglycan. When S-nitrosylated glypican-1 is then exposed to an appropriate reducing agent, such as ascorbate, nitric oxide is released and autocatalyzes deaminative cleavage of the glypican-1 heparan sulfate side chains at sites where the glucosamines are N-unsubstituted. These processes take place in a stepwise manner, whereas glypican-1 recycles via a caveolin-1-associated pathway where copper ions could be provided by the prion protein. Here we show, by using both biochemical and microscopic techniques, that (a) the glypican-1 core protein binds copper(II) ions, reduces them to copper(I) when the thiols are nitrosylated and reoxidizes copper(I) to copper(II) when ascorbate releases nitric oxide; (b) maximally S-nitrosylated glypican-1 can cleave its own heparan sulfate chains at all available sites in a nitroxyl ion-dependent reaction; (c) free zinc(II) ions, which are redox inert, also support autocleavage of glypican-1 heparan sulfate, probably via transnitrosation, whereas they inhibit copper(II)-supported degradation; and (d) copper(II)-loaded but not zinc(II)-loaded prion protein or amyloid β peptide support heparan sulfate degradation. As glypican-1 in prion null cells is poorly S-nitrosylated and as ectopic expression of cellular prion protein restores S-nitrosylation of glypican-1 in these cells, we propose that one function of the cellular prion protein is to deliver copper(II) for the S-nitrosylation of recycling glypican-1.

The proteins forming the aggregates are Cu- and Zn-binding proteins, and metal ions have also been implicated in the disease process (for review, see Refs. 6Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HS does not occur normally as free glycan chains but is linked covalently to proteins forming proteoglycans (PG). How HS is released, from which PG it is derived, and how it binds to the aggregating proteins have not been clarified. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cellular prion protein (PrPC) binds Cu(II) ions to five sites and Zn(II) ions to one or two sites in the N-terminal domain (6Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl.

PrPC also binds to HS, which interacts with the Cu(II)-containing domain in PrPC and weakens the affinity for Cu(II) (12Brimacombe D.B. Bennett A.D. Wusteman F.S. Gill A.C. Dann J.C. Bostock C.J.

The amyloid β protein precursor as well as the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) generated from it can also bind both Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions (16Bush A.I. Pettingell J.R. de Paradis M. Tanzi R.E. Wasco W. J.

In this case, Cu(II) can be reduced to Cu(I) and remain bound, whereas the Zn(II)-binding motifs appear to constitute the HS-binding sites (16Bush A.I. Pettingell J.R. de Paradis M. Tanzi R.E.

During recycling via caveolae-dependent internalization, PrPC can be converted to the abnormal, aggregation-prone scrapie isoform (PrPSc) facilitated by the presence of a protein X (6Prusiner S.B.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although HS can inhibit conversion in a cell-free system, in the context of endocytosis, there appears to be stimulation. In contrast, aggregation of the Aβ is induced by Zn(II) ions (7Bush A.I. Tanzi R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7317-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Muira T. Suzuki K. Kohata N. Takeuchi H.

Checler F. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 469-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We have previously studied a recycling, HS-substituted, GPI-linked PG named glypican-1 (Gpc-1) (24Mani K.

They are common in the brain and many other tissues and are present mainly at the cell surface, probably in rafts and caveolae (for reviews, see Refs. 29Filmus J. Selleck S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 30Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 31Fransson L.Å. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Gpc-type PG have a characteristic pattern of 14 conserved cysteine residues in the central domain. The attachment sites for 2-4 HS-chains are located near the GPI anchor. The HS chains consist of a repeating disaccharide backbone of glucosamine and hexuronic acid that is regionally and variably modified by epimerization of the hexuronic acid and by different types of sulfations on both sugars, creating a variety of binding sites for polycationic molecules, such as polyamines and basic peptide growth factors. Gpc-1, which recycles via caveolin-1-positive endosomes, is thus a potential membrane receptor for the transport of cargo into and through cells (24Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol.

Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The S-nitroso groups (SNO) of Gpc-1 appear to remain stable until Gpc-1 is exposed to a suitable reducing environment where nitric oxide (NO) is released and cleaves the intrinsic HS chains at glucosamine units lacking N-substitution (GlcNH3+) (25Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At steady state, there are both Gpc-1 molecules with truncated HS chains and free HS oligosaccharides inside the cells (24Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NO-dependent autocleavage of recycling Gpc-1 is necessary for uptake and delivery of polyamines, small basic molecules that are essential for cell growth and survival (26Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44431-44439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosylation of Gpc-1 and subsequent NO release are dependent on a Cu(II)-Cu(I) redox cycle (27Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have postulated (Fig. 1) that when the Gpc-1 core protein is S-nitrosylated, Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I). NO release from the S-nitroso groups can be induced by ascorbate. Nitroxyl anion (NO-) could then be formed from NO, whereas Cu(I) is oxidized to Cu(II). In the present study, we have investigated copper binding to Gpc-1 and the nature of the HS-cleaving NO species. We demonstrate that both Cu(II)-loaded PrPC and Aβ can deliver copper ions to Gpc-1 to support S-nitrosylation, which is a prerequisite for nitroxyl ion-dependent HS-degradation. Free Zn(II) ions, which are redox inert, also indirectly support HS degradation but by a different mechanism.

David, University of Leuven, Belgium. Embryonic fibroblasts from prion null mice (PRNP0/0) and an expression plasmid encoding mouse PrPC and green fluorescent protein separated by an internal ribosome entry sequence were generous gifts from Prof. A. Aguzzi, University of Zurich, Switzerland. Recombinant mouse PrPC and monoclonal antibody 6H4 against PrPC were from Prionics, Zurich, Switzerland, Aβ (human, 1-40) from Calbiochem, and reduced glutathione from Sigma. [3H]Glucosamine-labeled Gpc-1 was obtained from DFMO- and BFA-treated T24 cells as described (27Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The DFMO treatment was used to increase the content of GlcNH3+ units and was carried out while cells grew to confluence, which usually took 1-2 days. Hence, the GlcNH3+ content of HS derived from DFMO-treated cells varied slightly between different preparations. HiTrap chelating HP and Thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, UK. Cleavage of HS in Gpc-1—The high molecular weight Gpc-1 precursor (∼1 ng/μl) was exposed to metal ions and NO donor and triggered by ascorbate to autodegrade its own HS chains, all in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. This was monitored by Superose 6 gel chromatography of the various HS fragments and alkali-released stubs as described previously (27Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1 and its legend). Control degradation of GlcNH3+ units by nitrite at pH 3.9 was carried out as described (24Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol.

Confocal Laser Scanning Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The various procedures including seeding of cells, fixation, the use of primary and secondary antibodies, generation of images, and data processing were the same as those used previously (27Ding K.

Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44431-44439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies used were either goat anti-mouse total Ig (when the primary antibody was a monoclonal) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (when the primary antibody was polyclonal). They were tagged with either fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red and combined appropriately for colocalization studies. The Mechanism of Copper-supported Autocleavage of HS in Gpc-1—We demonstrated previously that Cu(II) ions, NO donor, and ascorbate are all needed to sustain autocleavage of HS in purified Gpc-1 (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 27Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Preloading of Gpc-1 with Cu(II) ions followed by dialysis did not affect its ability to become S-nitrosylated, suggesting the presence of copper-binding sites in the Gpc-1 protein core. Furthermore, S-nitrosylated Gpc-1 was quite stable in the absence of reducing agents in accordance with the presence of SNO-containing Gpc-1 molecules in unperturbed T24 cells (28Cheng F. Mani K. van den Born J. Ding K. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44431-44439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Upon ascorbate treatment of SNO-containing, immunopurified Gpc-1, NO was rapidly released, and the HS chains were cleaved at the GlcNH3+ units, suggesting that NO- could be the reactive species (27Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The number of GlcNH3+ units in the HS chains of Gpc-1 can be increased by inhibiting both recycling and endogenous polyamine synthesis (26Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Most of the GlcNH3+ units of HS derived from recycling Gpc-1 of unperturbed cells are located close to the linkage to protein (25Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas those units that are generated upon BFA arrest and polyamine deprivation are also located at multiple sites along the chain (26Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The presence of GlcNH3+ units can be demonstrated by cleavage with nitrite at pH 3.9 followed by gel chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2A (filled circles), HS from Gpc-1 arrested at the precursor stage by treating cells with BFA was degraded by nitrite under these conditions. Corresponding HS from cells treated with both BFA and DFMO was more degraded (Fig. 2D, filled circles). According to previous estimates (25Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), this degradation should correspond to an average size reduction from ∼100 kDa to 50 kDa (Fig. 2A) and 30 kDa (Fig. 2D), respectively. NO release requires a reducing agent. We have previously used ascorbate (27Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we also tested glutathione, an abundant intracellular reducing agent. However, 1 mm glutathione was unable to initiate HS degradation (Fig. 2B, open diamonds), whereas 1 mm ascorbate generated cleavage at nearly all of the GlcNH3+ units as monitored by gel chromatography (cf. Fig. 2, A and B, filled symbols). The capacity to generate NO for HS degradation should be dependent on the level of S-nitrosylation. This, in turn, depends on the number of available thiol groups. Human Gpc-1 contains 17 Cys residues (32David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Fourteen of these are conserved between various glypicans (29Filmus J. Selleck S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 30Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 31Fransson L.Å. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The number of Cys residues involved in disulfide bonding has never been elucidated. The reduction of disulfides to thiols should increase the number of available nitrosylation sites. We tested this by treating purified Gpc-1 with dithiothreitol prior to S-nitrosylation. Subsequent treatment with ascorbate induced a very extensive degradation of some of the HS chains (Fig. 2C). According to previous estimates (25Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) this should correspond to a size reduction from ∼100 to 20 kDa, i.e. cleavage at four sites/HS chain on average. S-Nitrosylation of Gpc-1 requires Cu(II) ions (27Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Hence, the number of SNOs in Gpc-1 should also be regulated by the availability of copper ions. We therefore exposed purified Gpc-1 to increasing concentrations of Cu(II) ions prior to treatment with NO donor and ascorbate (Fig. 2E). When exposure to copper ion was omitted, there was no degradation (Fig. 2E, open circles). With exposure to increasing concentrations of Cu(II) ions, there was an increased degradation of HS (Fig. 2E, filled symbols). Preincubation with an excess of Cu(II) ions caused the greatest degradation (Fig. 2E, filled diamonds). This degradation should also correspond to ∼4 cleavages/chain. When the capacity for S-nitrosylation was increased either by the generation of more thiols (Fig. 2C) or by providing an excess of Cu(II) ions (Fig. 2E), the extent of HS degradation appeared to slightly exceed that obtained by cleavage only at the GlcNH3+ units (cf. Fig. 2, A and D, filled symbols). To test whether there was additional cleavage at N-sulfated glucosamine, a [3H]glucosamine- and [35S]sulfate-labeled Gpc-1 preparation was S-nitrosylated in the presence of excess Cu(II) ion and then exposed to ascorbate (Fig. 2F). A peak in the expected position of free sulfate was seen (open squares). There are three different NO species: the positively charged nitrosonium ion (NO+), the uncharged NO radical (NO·), and the negatively charged nitroxyl anion (NO-) (for review, see Ref. 33Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). The proportions depend on the redox state of the environment. NO- should be attracted by the GlcNH3+ residues and could therefore be the reactive species in HS degradation. As cysteine is known to react with NO- (34Hughes M.B. Cammack R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we performed the NO release reaction with ascorbate in the presence of an excess of cysteine (Fig. 2G). Degradation of HS in SNO-containing and ascorbate-exposed Gpc-1 was markedly reduced in the presence of cysteine, confirming that NO- was the major reactive species. The Gpc-1 core protein contains several His residues that could form Cu(II)-binding sites (32David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cys residues could form Cu(I)-binding sites. To investigate copper binding to Gpc-1 we used affinity chromatography (Fig. 3). As a control we applied 125I-labeled PrPC to a Cu(II)-loaded HiTrap chelating matrix. As expected, PrPC bound and could be displaced by elution with 50 mm iminoacetate (Fig. 3A). No binding occurred to unloaded HiTrap, and binding to Cu(II)-loaded HiTrap diminished when PrPC was applied in the presence of 1 mM CuCl2. We then tested Gpc-1 binding to a Cu(I)-loaded matrix. As shown in the model (Fig. 3B), binding should not be inhibited by Cu(II) ions, but when NO donor is provided, binding should be diminished, if Cu(II) bound to Gpc-1 is reduced to Cu(I) during S-nitrosylation of Gpc-1 (27Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Binding should then be restored when ascorbate is added, because this should result in NO release and reoxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II). As shown in Fig. 3C, this is precisely what happened. It should be added that the thiol-containing Cu(I)-loaded matrix binds insignificant amounts of PrPC (< 5%). The Mechanism of Zinc-supported Autocleavage of HS in Gpc-1—Purified Gpc-1 was exposed to Zn(II) ions and NO donor in an attempt to generate S-nitrosylated Gpc-1 (Fig. 4A). The Gpc-1 preparation that was exposed to Zn ion and NO donor simultaneously and then recovered after dialysis was poorly degraded upon the addition of ascorbate (cf. open and filled circles in Fig. 4A). However, in a Gpc-1 preparation that was first exposed to Zn(II) ions, then dialyzed, and subsequently treated with NO donor and ascorbate simultaneously, there was a partial HS degradation (Fig. 4B, filled circles). The omission of ascorbate precluded HS degradation (Fig. 4C). In the case of Cu(II)-supported HS degradation (Fig. 2), prior reduction of disulfides greatly increased the capacity for HS degradation (Fig. 2C). This was not the case with Zn(II)-supported HS degradation (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the mechanism might be different. However, the reactive NO form appeared to be NO-, because cysteine inhibited Zn(II)-supported HS degradation (Fig. 4E). We also used an especially GlcNH3+-rich Gpc-1 preparation obtained from cells that were treated with both BFA and DFMO. As shown in Fig. 4F (filled circles), Zn(II)-supported HS degradation in this preparation was quite ex"

Recent NMR methods permit direct detection of hydrogen bonds through measurements of scalar couplings that traverse hydrogen bonds (transhydrogen bond couplings). We have applied this approach to screen a series of five single site mutants of the sweet protein brazzein with altered sweetness for possible changes in backbone hydrogen bonding with respect to wild-type. Long range, three-dimensional data correlating connectivities among backbone 1HN, 15N, and 13C′ atoms were collected from the six brazzein proteins labeled uniformly with carbon-13 and nitrogen-15. In wild-type brazzein, this approach identified 17 backbone hydrogen bonds. In the mutants, altered magnitudes of the couplings identified hydrogen bonds that were strengthened or weakened; missing couplings identified hydrogen bonds that were broken, and new couplings indicated the presence of new hydrogen bonds. Within the series of brazzein mutants investigated, a pattern was observed between sweetness and the integrity of particular hydrogen bonds. All three “sweet” variants exhibited the same pattern of hydrogen bonds, whereas all three “non-sweet” variants lacked one hydrogen bond at the middle of the α-helix, where it is kinked, and one hydrogen bond in the middle of β-strands II and III, where they are twisted. Two of the non-sweet variants lack the hydrogen bond connecting the N and C termini. These variants showed greater mobility in the N- and C-terminal regions than wild-type brazzein.

Two of the non-sweet variants lack the hydrogen bond connecting the N and C termini. These variants showed greater mobility in the N- and C-terminal regions than wild-type brazzein. All known sweet proteins are derived from fruits native to Africa or South Asia. Of these, brazzein is the smallest and most stable (1Ming D. Hellekant G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 2Caldwell J.E. Markley J.L. J. Chem. Soc. Pakistan. 1999; 21: 268-280Google Scholar). Brazzein is found in nature in the fruit of the African plant Pentadiplandra brazzeana Baillon (1Ming D. Hellekant G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Brazzein contains no carbohydrate, and its structure (3Caldwell J.E. Abildgaard F. Dzakula Z. Ming D. Hellekant G. Markley J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) bears no structural resemblance to sucrose, small molecule chemical sweeteners, or the two other sweet tasting proteins of known structure: monellin (4Somoza J.R. Jiang F. Tong L. Kang C.-H. Cho J.-M. Kim S.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 390-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and thaumatin (5Ko T.-P. Day J. Greenwood A. McPherson A. Acta Crystallogr.

Biol. 1992; 228: 893-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, members of the class of sweet proteins contain no conserved stretches of amino acids. Recently, the human sweet taste receptor has been identified (7Li X. Staszewski L. Xu H. Durick K. Zoller M. Adler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4692-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 8Nelson G. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Zhang Y. Ryba N.J. Zuker C.S.

It is a heterodimeric form of a typical seven-transmembrane helix G-coupled receptor with an unusually large ectodomain (7Li X. Staszewski L. Xu H. Durick K. Zoller M. Adler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4692-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 8Nelson G. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Zhang Y. Ryba N.J. Zuker C.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Different sweet proteins presumably interact with and activate the same heterodimeric (T1R2/T1R3) receptor in somewhat different ways. Tentative models for such interactions have been presented (9Temussi P.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The characteristics that make a compound taste sweet to humans are not well understood, despite considerable interest and effort in the study of high potency and low calorie sweeteners. Brazzein is an ideal system for investigating the chemical and structural requirements for extracellular triggering of a sweet response in humans and Old World monkeys, the only species known to perceive the protein as sweet (10Hellekant G.

Brazzein is small, stable, and easily investigated in solution by NMR spectroscopy. We earlier designed a synthetic gene coding for brazzein and developed an efficient bacterial production system (a fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli) (13Assadi-Porter F.M. Aceti D.J. Cheng H. Markley J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and have used this approach to discover mutants with altered sweetness (14Assadi-Porter F.M. Aceti D.J. Markley J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This system also has allowed us to produce rapidly stable isotope-labeled brazzein variants for structural evaluation by NMR spectroscopy. Although all members of the set of brazzein variants analyzed previously exhibited one-dimensional NMR spectra characteristic of folded protein, subtle conformational rearrangements could not be ruled out. The present investigation was undertaken to use direct NMR detection of hydrogen bonds to examine this question. Although trans-hydrogen bond 15N-13C NMR scalar coupling constants are very small (|3h J NC′| < 1 Hz), methods have been developed recently (15Cordier F. Grzesiek S. J. Am. Chem.

These methods employ constant time, long range, two- or three-dimensional NMR correlation experiment that identifies connectivities among backbone 1HN, 15N, and 13C′ atoms (HNCO) 1The abbreviations used are: HNCO, NMR correlation experiment that identifies connectivities among backbone 1HN, 15N, and 13C′ atoms; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; CS, cysteine-stabilized; DSS, 2,2-di-methyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOE, {1H}-15N steady-state heteronuclear NOE; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; SE, sensitivity enhanced; HNCA, NMR correlation experiment that identifies connectivities among backbone 1HN, 15N, and 13Cα atoms; HCCH, NMR correlation experiment that identifies connectivities among protons attached to 13C through 13C-13C correlations; HN(CO)CA, NMR correlation experiment that identifies connectivities among backbone 1Hα, 13Cα, and 13C′ atoms of the same residue. pulse sequences, either without or with the application of the transverse optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) technique (19Pervushin K.

Identification of hydrogen bonds by detection of trans-hydrogen bond couplings has been used to investigate protein secondary structure (20Bonvin A.M.J.J. Houben K. Guenneugues K. Kaptein R.

The three-dimensional ribbon diagram in Fig. 1 shows the backbone of wild-type 2According to nomenclature used previously (13Assadi-Porter F.M. Aceti D.J. Cheng H. Markley J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), recombinant wild-type or des-pGlu1-brazzein is defined as the protein identical to the minor form of brazzein isolated from P. brazzeana Baillon. The minor form, which is about twice as sweet as the major form (51Izawa H. Ota M. Kohmura M. Ariyoshi Y. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 95-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), differs from the major form only by the lack of an N-terminal pyroglutamate (pGlu) residue. Thus recombinant wild-type brazzein is called des-pGlu-brazzein, and all mutant studies here are relative to this background. The relative amounts of the two forms in fruit brazzein depend on the preparation but generally are about 90:10 by weight. brazzein and the positions of the five mutations investigated here. Four of the sites of mutation (Ala2 insertion, H31A, R33A, and D50A) are spatially close to one another. Two of the mutants (Ala2 insertion and H31A) have about twice the sweetness of wild-type brazzein; the other three mutants (R33A, R43A, and D50A) have greatly reduced sweetness (Table I) (14Assadi-Porter F.M. Aceti D.J. Markley J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). R43A is essentially tasteless; it is only slightly sweet in powder form.Table ISweetness of brazzein variantsBrazzein proteinSweetness thresholdaSweetness threshold as reported in the earlier paper (14) is the minimum protein concentration in a 100-μl sample which was perceived as sweet by a taste panel.Sweetness intensitybReported in comparison with sucrose on a per-molecule basis.μ mWild-type recombinant3.119,000Ala2 insertion1.538,000H31A1.538,000R33A311,900R43A>93<600D50A153,800a Sweetness threshold as reported in the earlier paper (14Assadi-Porter F.M.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of the hydrogen bonds in these brazzein variants through measurements of trans-hydrogen bond couplings has shown that single site mutations can give rise to subtle structural changes. Wild-type brazzein and two variants with sweetness equal to or greater than wild-type had similar patterns of hydrogen bonds, whereas all three variants with reduced sweetness exhibited changes in hydrogen bonding and local mobility. Sample Preparation—Recombinant brazzein and its variants were prepared as described previously (13Assadi-Porter F.M. Aceti D.J. Cheng H. Markley J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Brazzein samples were labeled with 15N or 15N and 13C by including in each liter of minimal growth medium 1 g of 15NH4Cl (Isotec, Miamisburg, OH) and for double labeling2gof[13C]glucose (Isotec). Cells were induced for3hbythe addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The efficiency of labeling was >96%. The purification of brazzein from inclusion bodies followed our published protocol, which uses 6 m guanidinium chloride containing 10 mm EDTA and 100 mm dithiothreitol (13Assadi-Porter F.M. Aceti D.J. Cheng H. Markley J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Brazzein was refolded easily with regeneration of its four disulfide bridges; refolding and product purity were checked by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (14Assadi-Porter F.M. Aceti D.J. Markley J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). NMR samples consisted of 3–6 mg of pure lyophilized protein dissolved in 250–500 μl of 90% H2O and 10% D2O; the pH was adjusted to 5.2. NMR Data Collection—Unless otherwise noted, all NMR spectra were recorded at 37 °C. Data were collected on Bruker DMX500, DMX600, and DMX750 spectrometers, each equipped with a triple resonance (1H/13C/15N) probe with three axis pulsed field gradient capability or on a DMX500 equipped with a triple resonance CryoProbe™ with a z gradient. Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was obtained with the States TPPI method (23Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). Water suppression was achieved with a Watergate sequence containing a 3-9-19 selective inversion pulse (24Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC (25Mori S. Chitrananada A. Johnson A.O. Van Zijl P.C.M. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 109: 94-98Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar) data sets were collected from U-15N variants to screen for chemical shift changes relative to wild-type brazzein in the amide “fingerprint” region. Three-dimensional 15N TOCSY-HSQC (26Talluri S. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC-SE (27Kay L.E. Xu G.-Y. Yamazaki T. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1994; 109: 129-133Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar) data sets were collected from the same samples and used to determine sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments. Three of the brazzein variants investigated here (R33A, R43A, and D50A) showed chemical shift changes in regions distant from the site of mutation; these changes necessitated extensive peak assignments. For these variants and for wild-type recombinant brazzein as a control, the following data sets were acquired from U-15N,U-13C-labeled samples dissolved in 90% H2O and 10% D2O (for a total experimental time of 1 week/mutant): three-dimensional SE-HNCA (27Kay L.E.

NMR data were processed with Felix98 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego). Time-domain data were apodized in each dimension with a squared sine bell function; then the data were zero filled to the final matrix size, Fourier transformed, and phase corrected. The initial value for the incremented delay was set in a manner that allowed predictable phasing in each dimension and minimized roll and offset of the base line (32Bax A. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Zhu G. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 91: 174-178Google Scholar). All 1H dimensions were referenced directly to internal DSS. The other nuclei (13C and 15N) were referenced indirectly to DSS as described in the IUPAC recommendations (33Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wüthrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Processed NMR data were analyzed by using either Felix98 or XEASY (34Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) software packages. Backbone assignments were determined for R33A, R43A, and D50A on the basis of the following three-dimensional triple resonance experiments: HNCA, H(CA)CO, HNCO, 15N TOCSY-HSQC, and 15N NOESY-HSQC. The two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectrum was used as a reference to correlate each cross-peak to its corresponding amide 1HN and 15N in each three-dimensional spectrum. The sequential connections obtained mainly from HNCA and H(CA)CO experiments were confirmed by the analysis of NOE patterns from 15N NOESY-HSQC spectra. The HCCH-COSY and side chain H(CA)CO experiments provided assignments for aliphatic 13C resonances. Aliphatic side chain 1H assignments were obtained from 15N TOCSY-HSQC and HCCH-COSY experiments. The quantitative J correlation scheme was used to detect transhydrogen bond 15N-13C′ scalar couplings (3h J NC′) (18Wang Y.X. Jacob J. Cordier F. Wingfield P. Stahl S.J. Lee-Huang S. Torchia D. Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 14: 181-184Google Scholar), which served to identify hydrogen bonds in the protein. The constant time, long range HNCO pulse sequence of Cordier and Grzesiek (15Cordier F. Grzesiek S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1601-1602Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar) was used on the Bruker 750 MHz spectrometer with a conventional probe and on the Bruker 500-MHz spectrometer with a CryoProbe™. In each case, two data sets were collected. The first was a long range HNCO experiment with the evolution time (66.6 ms) set for the detection of trans-hydrogen bond couplings (15Cordier F. Grzesiek S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1601-1602Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The long range HNCO data set consisted of 2048 × 80 × 64 complex points each with 32 transients. The second was a reference HNCO experiment, with delay time between the two 13C′ inversion pulses set for 16.6 ms to maximize the one bond coupling 1 J NC′ evolution (15Cordier F. Grzesiek S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1601-1602Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). For the reference data, 4 transients were coadded for each of the 2048 × 80 × 64 complex points. The reference spectrum was used as a control to distinguish couplings through hydrogen bonds from those through covalent bonds and to determine whether the signal from a potential hydrogen bond might be missing as the result of relaxation effects. For the detection and analysis of hydrogen bonds involving backbone NH groups, the long range HNCO data were collected at spectral widths of 20, 15, and 30 ppm for the 1H, 13C, and 15N dimensions, respectively. The carrier frequencies for 1H, 13C, and 15N were placed at 4.7, 175, and 119 ppm, respectively. Selective carbonyl 13C pulses were given with G3 and G4 shapes (35Cole A.M. Ganz T.L.A.M. Burdick M.D. Liu L. Strieter R.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Linear prediction was used to achieve a total number of 2048 × 120 × 128 points prior to final data processing and analysis. To evaluate hydrogen exchange rates, a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of wild-type and mutant brazzeins were collected as a function of the time after dissolving a sample previously lyophilized from H2Oin D2O. {1H}-15N steady-state heteronuclear NOE (NOE) data (36Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) were collected on a 600-MHz NMR spectrometer for wild-type brazzein and the mutants R33A, R43A, and D50A. Spectra were collected with and without a 4 s 1H saturation delay (37Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Data Processing and Analysis—The software package Felix98 running on a 10-processor SGI Onyx (SGI, Mountain View, CA) was used to process the data. The XEASY program was used for peak picking and spectral analysis. The program CHIFIT (38Chylla R.A. Markley J.L. J. Biomol.

Sequence-specific Assignments—Extensive 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments were determined for the wild-type, R33A, R43A, and D50A proteins. Only 1H and 15N assignments were obtained for the Ala2 insertion and H31A mutants. These assignments have been deposited in BioMagResBank. Chemical Shift Comparisons—To characterize the effect of mutations on the structure, 15N-labeled samples of each of the five proteins were investigated by NMR. 1H-15N HSQC data were collected for each under identical conditions of pH and temperature. Discounting changes near the site of mutation, only two of the five proteins showed 1H-15N HSQC patterns closely similar to that of wild-type recombinant brazzein; these were the two sweeter proteins, Ala2 insertion and H31A (Fig. 2). The three proteins with reduced sweetness exhibited large backbone chemical shift differences from wild-type. These shift differences are projected onto the structure of brazzein in Fig. 3. For R33A (Fig. 3A), the largest chemical shift changes are in the loop that contains the mutated residue and in the C terminus. Because the side chains of Arg33 and Asp50 in wild-type brazzein are less than 5 Å apart (Fig. 4), these dual changes are not unexpected. Regions of R33A which showed smaller chemical shift differences include the middle of the α-helix and the N-terminal end of β-strand II.Fig. 4Representation of the local three-dimensional structure of brazzein surrounding Asp50 (3Caldwell J.E.

D50A exhibited more global chemical shift differences from wild-type than the other mutants (Fig. 3C). These included large chemical shift changes in the loop 33 region and in the residues near the N terminus and smaller chemical shift changes in the three β-strands, α-helix, and in residues 12–19 of the disordered loop.

https://openalex.org/W2053604214,"Thapsigargin (TG), by inducing perturbations in cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, can induce apoptosis, but the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. We have recently reported that TG-induced apoptosis appears to involve the DR5-dependent apoptotic pathway that cross talks with the mitochondrial pathway via TG-induced Bid cleavage. In this study, we have utilized Bax-proficient and -deficient HCT116 human colon cancer cells to investigate the effect of Bax deficiency on TG-induced apoptosis and TG regulation of the DR5 and mitochondrial pathways. Our results indicate that Bax-deficient cells are less sensitive to undergo apoptosis following TG treatment. Our results further demonstrate that TG-induced apoptosis is coupled with DR5 upregulation and caspases 8 and 3 activation, as well as Bid cleavage in both Bax-proficient and -deficient cells, although caspase 3 activation was reduced in Bax-deficient cells. TG also promoted the release of cytochrome c into cytosol and caspase 9 activation in Bax-proficient cells but not in Bax-deficient cells. These findings suggest that although Bax is not absolutely required for death receptor (DR)-dependent signals, it appears to be a key molecule in TG-regulated mitochondrial events. Bax-deficient cells were relatively more resistant to Apo2L/TRAIL than the Bax-proficient counterparts. However, the combination of Apo2L/TRAIL and TG was more effective in mediating apoptosis in both Bax-proficient and -deficient cells and that was coupled with activation of caspases 8 and 3. Although both agents in combination also induced cytochrome c release into cytosol and caspase 9 activation in Bax-proficient cells, these events were abrogated in Bax-deficient cells. Our results thus suggest that the combination of Apo2L/TRAIL and TG appears to bypass the Bax deficiency-induced defects in the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway by engaging the DR5-dependent apoptotic signals (extrinsic pathway)."

Keratan sulfate (KS) 1The abbreviations used are: KS, keratan sulfate; CSC, chondroitin 6-sulfate; Gal(6S), 6-O-sulfogalactose; GlcNAc(6S), 6-O-sulfo-N-acetylglucosamine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GPC, gel permeation chromatography; CE, capillary electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; SLH, surface layer homology. is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) whose main structure comprises β1–3 repeats of the galactosyl β1–4GlcNAc disaccharide unit and is classified into three types based on linkage structure as follows: KS-I, KS-II, and KS-III (1Funderburgh J.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). KS-I is N-linked at the reducing end of GlcNAc to Asn residues in proteins. This type of KS is a major component of cornea and contributes to its transparency. KS-II is mainly localized in cartilage and is O-linked at the reducing end of GlcNAc to Ser/Thr in proteins, a link susceptible to alkaline treatment, compared with the N-link of KS-I. KS-III is localized in the brain and is O-linked to Ser/Thr via mannose. In addition to the linkage region, KS chains differ in sulfate content and the proportions of minor sugar components including sialic acid, fucose, and N-acetylgalactosamine. Thus, KS represents a variety of forms in tissues. Recent studies have revealed various in vivo functions of KS chains in embryogenesis, cancer invasion, immune responses, and cartilage metabolism. The KS chain is expressed in various tissues in the embryo and regulates organogenesis by affecting filtration and differentiation in the kidney (2Hemming F.J. Saxod R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), migration of primary germ cells in the gonads or of neural crest cells in the heart and gut (3Oakley R.A. Tosney K.W. Dev.

Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A sialylated KS proteoglycan serves as a specific marker for human embryonal carcinoma, which may regulate the biological behavior of the tumor (4Badcock G. Pigott C. Goepel J. Andrews P.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4715-4719PubMed Google Scholar). 6-Sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine has been identified as an epitope of dendritic cell-specific monoclonal antibodies, M-DC8, DD1, and DD2, suggesting an important role for this saccharide structure in T cell stimulation by dendritic cells (5Schakel K. Kannagi R. Kniep B. Goto Y. Mitsuoka C. Zwirner J. Soruri A. von Kietzell M. Rieber E. Immunity. 2002; 17: 289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). KS is known to be important for aggrecan degradation by aggrecanase-1, a key enzyme in cartilage metabolism (6Pratta M.A. Tortorella M.D. Arner E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39096-39102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Many KS-containing proteoglycans, including lumican, keratocan, mimecan, fibromodulin, and phosphacan, have been identified and their in vivo roles studied by using knockout mice (7Jepsen K.J. Wu F. Peragallo J.H. Paul J. Roberts L. Ezura Y. Oldberg A. Birk D.E. Chakravarti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35532-35540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8Ameye L. Aria D. Jepsen K. Oldberg A. Xu T. Young M.F. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As these proteoglycans function not only via their core protein but also via their GAG chains, detailed characterization of KS chains is necessary to define the structure for their specific functions. Any fingerprinting method for analyzing the structure of KS requires both fragmentation usually with KS-degrading enzymes and subsequent separation. At present, the various KS-degrading enzymes are classified into three groups based on their cleavage sites and substrate specificity. The first are the endo-β-galactosidases identified in Escherichia freundii (9Fukuda M.N. Matsumura G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6218-6225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Coccobacterium sp. (10Hirano S. Meyer K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Flavobacterium keratolyticus (11Kitamikado M. Ito M. Li Y.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3906-3909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Bacteroides fragilis (12Scudder P. Uemura K. Dolby J. Fukuda M.N. Feizi T. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which hydrolyze the internal nonsulfated galactosidic bonds of KS. The second is the keratanase identified in Pseudomonas sp. IFO-13309 (13Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 912-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme also cleaves internal β1–4 galactosidic linkages in KS but differs in substrate specificity from the endo-β-galactosidase. It requires at least one N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate residue and does not hydrolyze the desulfated KS polymer. The third group is the keratanase II identified in Bacillus sp. Ks36, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (14Nakazawa K. Ito M. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Greiling H. Scott J.E. Keratan Sulfate. The Biochemical Society, London1989: 99-110Google Scholar), which cleaves N-acetylglucosamine linkages of the KS chain, releasing Galβ1–4GlcNAc disaccharides with mono- or di-sulfates, or tetrasaccharides of Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc, both of which contain an N-acetyllactosamine structure. At present, keratanase II is defined as a KS-degrading endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Fucose residues on adjacent N-acetylglucosamines interfere with digestion of KS by keratanase, resulting in a larger number of oligosaccharides. In contrast, keratanase II of Bacillus sp. efficiently digests KS chains even with fucose residues and therefore is usually used for structural analyses of KS. However, keratanase II of Bacillus sp. Ks36 is not thermostable and may contain β-galactosidase activity as suggested recently (15Plaas A.H. West L.A. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the search for other KS-degrading enzymes useful for KS analysis, we screened numerous microorganisms isolated from soil samples and identified a highly thermostable keratanase II, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, in Bacillus circulans. The purified enzyme designated as Bc keratanase II digested KS to disaccharides or tetrasaccharides at an optimal temperature of 55 °C. Based on partial amino acid sequences of the enzyme, we further performed molecular cloning. The recombinant enzyme showed activity comparable with the native keratanase II. These results will provide us with another tool for the structural analysis of KS and preparation of sulfated N-acetyllactosamine. Enzymes, Substrates, and Chromatographic Materials—Bovine cornea keratan sulfate (KS), heparan sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, hyaluronan, N-acetyllactosamine, GlcNAc, β-galactosidase from Streptococcus sp., β-N-acetylhexosaminidase from Penicillium oxalicum, chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris, keratanase from Pseudomonas sp., and keratanase II from Bacillus sp. were purchased from Seikagaku Corp.

A protein marker kit and Bio-Gel P-2 were obtained from Bio-Rad. Muromac anion exchanger was obtained from Muromachi Technos (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals used in this study were of the highest grade commercially available. Preparation of KS and KS Oligosaccharides—Shark cartilage keratan sulfate (KS) and KS oligosaccharides were prepared as reported previously (16Brown G.M. Nieduszynski I.A. Morris H.G. Abram B.L. Huckerby T.N. Block J.A. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, shark cartilage KS (1 g) was dissolved in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, and digested with Bacillus sp. keratanase II (5 units) at 37 °C for 24 h. After addition of 2 volumes of absolute ethanol, the sample was kept at 25 °C overnight and was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness. The crude oligosaccharides dissolved in water (2 ml) were applied to a Bio-Gel P-2 column (3.6 × 134 cm) and eluted in water. The eluate, as measured by absorbance at 210 nm, was then applied to a Muromac anion exchanger column (4.3 × 35 cm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–3 m NaCl. Peak fractions of individual oligosaccharides were collected. After desalting, these oligosaccharides were characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry (data not shown).

Five hundred milligrams of shark cartilage KS or KS disaccharide pyridinium salt was dissolved in 5 ml of N-methyl-N- (trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide and 50 ml of pyridine. For the preparation of desulfated KS, the mixture was incubated at 110 °C for 2 h. After cooling down on ice, an equal volume of water was added to the mixture. The sample was then evaporated, dissolved in water, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. For preparation of desulfated KS disaccharide, the mixture was heated at 80 °C for 2 h, and an equal volume of 20% methanol was added to the reaction mixture, evaporated, and dissolved in water. The solution was applied to a charcoal-Celite column to remove salts. After the column had been washed with 5 volumes of water, the desulfated KS disaccharide was eluted with 30% methanol, evaporated, and lyophilized. Culture of B. circulans—B. circulans KsT202 was maintained on brain heart infusion slant medium (20% calf brain infusion, 25% beef heart infusion, 1% protease peptone, 0.5% NaCl, 0.25% Na2HPO4, and 1.5% agar, pH 7.2) supplemented with 0.2% shark cartilage KS. After inoculation into a 500-ml flask containing 100 ml of seed medium (0.75% peptone, 0.5% Brewery's yeast extract, 0.5% KH2PO4, 0.02% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1% NaCl, and 0.2% shark cartilage KS, pH 7.0), the bacteria were cultured at 37 °C for 14 h in a shaker at 120 rpm. Then 90 ml of the culture was transferred into a 5-liter jar fermentor containing 3 liters of medium P (1.0% peptone, 0.5% Brewery's yeast extract, 0.25% fish extract, 0.5% KH2PO4, 0.02% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1% NaCl, 150 ppm Adecanol LG-109, and 0.5% shark cartilage KS, pH 7.5) and further cultured at 37 °C and 200 rpm with an air flow for 8 h. Keratanase Assay—The keratanase assay was carried out according to the method of Park and Johnson (18Park J.T. Johnson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 181: 149-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic reaction was performed in 200 μl of 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 100 μg of KS. After incubating for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of the carbonate/KCN solution (50 mm Na2CO3 and 10 mm KCN) and 200 μl of K3Fe(CN)6 solution (1.8 mm) and boiled for 10 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was mixed with 1 ml of Alum solution (3.1 mm Fe(NH4SO4)2·12H2O, 0.05 m H2SO4, and 0.1% SDS), mixed, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then the amount of reducing sugar was determined from the increase in absorbance at 690 nm. A heat-inactivated sample was used as a control. One unit of the enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that released 1 μmol of reducing sugars (as galactose) per min under the assay conditions. Purification and Partial Peptide Sequencing of Bc Keratanase II— B. circulans keratanase II (Bc keratanase II) was purified either from bacterial pellets or culture media of cells grown in the presence of shark cartilage KS as follows. All isolation and purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Thirty grams of frozen bacteria pellets obtained from 3 liters of culture was resuspended in 150 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and treated with both lysozyme (100 μg/ml) and DNase I (26 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, and the pellet was extracted twice. By stepwise addition of ammonium sulfate, the KS-degrading activity was recovered in the fraction between 35 and 60% saturation. The sample fraction precipitated at 60% saturation was dissolved in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, dialyzed against the same buffer, and applied to a DE52 column (2.4 × 14 cm, Whatman) equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme fraction was eluted using a gradient of up to 0.3 m NaCl. After the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 4 m, the enzyme fraction was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (1.5 × 14 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 4 m NaCl. The enzyme fraction was eluted using a decreasing gradient of NaCl concentrations in the fraction from 2.3 to 2.1 m NaCl. By using 20 liters of conditioned medium kept at 45 °C for 24 h, the protein was precipitated through 70% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the solution was subjected to stepwise precipitation with ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was precipitated with a 0.35–0.55 saturation. The enzyme fraction was applied to a DE52 column (5.2 × 24 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and was eluted using a gradient of NaCl to 0.3 m. The protein was precipitated with 0.55 saturation of ammonium sulfate, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column (2.2 × 101 cm). The fraction containing enzyme activity was again applied to a DE52 column (5.2 × 10 cm), similarly eluted, and then concentrated using a Centricon ultrafiltration spin column. The concentrated enzyme fraction was again applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column, and the enzyme fraction was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.6 × 15 cm) and eluted as described above. Capillary Electrophoretic Analysis of KS Oligosaccharides—Capillary electrophoretic analysis of KS oligosaccharides was performed by the method of Yoshida. 2K. Yoshida, personal communication. The experiments were performed on a CE system P/ACE 2100 (Beckman Instruments) equipped with a fixed wavelength ultraviolet detector (UV at 214 nm). The CE system was operated in normal polarity by applying the sample at the cathode. The running buffer was 50 mm sodium tetraborate, pH 9.0. The sample was separated and analyzed using a fused silica capillary tube (75 μm × 60 cm, Beckman Instruments). Each experiment was performed at a constant voltage of 15 kV. The system operation and data handling were fully controlled, and chromatograms were integrated using System Gold chromatography-automated software (version 4) from Beckman Instruments running on a Compaq personal computer. The migration times of Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S), Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S)β1–3Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S), and NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc(6S)β1–3Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S) are 19.7, 23.0, and 17.7 min, respectively (Table I). HPLC Analysis of KS Oligosaccharides and Neutral Sugars—The average molecular weight and yield of KS oligosaccharides were estimated by gel permeation chromatography-high performance liquid chromatography (GPC-HPLC) with serially combined columns of TSK-gel PWXL-4000, PWXL-3000, and PWXL-2500 under a constant flow (0.6 ml/min) of 200 mm NaCl at 40 °C. Ten mg of KS was digested with 10 milliunits of the enzyme in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 37 °C for 24 h. After centrifugation at 6,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min, aliquots of the supernatant were used as the samples. The injection volume was 5 μl (19Arai M. Yada T. Suzuki S. Kimata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Detection was performed with a refractive index. The retention times of Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S), Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S)β1–3Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S), and NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc(6S)β1–3Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S) are indicated in Table I. The amount of N-acetylated amino sugars was determined by HPLC with a Shodex NH2-P50 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Showa Denko, Tokyo, Japan) under a constant flow (0.6 ml/min) of 75% acetonitrile solution at 40 °C. Injection was carried out at 5 μl. The eluate was monitored from the absorbance at 214 nm (N-acetyl group). The retention times of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetyllactosamine were 10.2 and 15.2 min, respectively (Fig. 6). Determination of Amino Acid Sequences—Purified enzyme was subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 4% gel. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, a homogeneous protein in the gel was excised, extracted using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS, and digested with lysyl endopeptidase (0.4 μg). The digest was applied to a reverse phase column (ODS80Ts 2 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetate. The resulting peptides were separated with a linear gradient of 70% acetonitrile and 0.08% trifluoroacetate at a flow rate of 180 μl/min. Amino acid sequences of the resulting peptides were determined with a protein sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, model 473A). Molecular Cloning of the Bc Keratanase II Gene—A degenerative PCR was performed using the sense primer 5′-GCIGAYCCICCIGTIACIGARCC-3′ (based on the amino acid sequence of peptide 3) and antisense primer 5′-ATIGTIGGIATIARIGCIGGYTG-3′ (based on the amino acid sequence of peptide 2) and genomic DNA of the bacteria as the template, with a program of denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR product, which corresponded to a partial genomic sequence of the enzyme gene, was subcloned into a pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen). The 5′- and 3′-ends of the DNA were extended by inverse PCR. Appropriate restriction sites, BglII, PstI, and HindIII, were chosen for inverse PCR, using genomic Southern blot analysis with the PCR product as a probe. Inverse PCR1 was performed using the sense primer 5′-GATCTAGGGCCCAGTGTCGGGGGCGCGATGAATC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TCGTAAGGGCCCTGCAGCGTCTTGCTGTAGTTAG-3′ and the self-ligate of the BglII-digested genomic DNA as the template with a program of denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min. Inverse PCR2 was performed using the sense primer 5′-AACGTACTGGTGCATCACAATGAA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-AACCTTTGCCATAAAGCTGATCT-3′ and self-ligate of the PstI-digested genomic DNA as the template with the same program. Inverse PCR3 was performed using the sense primer 5′-CAATTCGAGCCGCAAGCGCGGATC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GATGTAGTAAATCCCCACCTGCTC-3′ and self-ligate of the HindIII-digested genomic DNA as the template. Inverse PCR4 was performed using the sense primer 5′-TACGACTTTGACGTTCACCGCACA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GTATCGTGGTTCTTCACCCCGAAT-3′ and self-ligate of the BglII-digested genomic DNA as the template. The PCR products were subcloned into pCR4-TOPO. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method, using an ABI Prism 310 DNA sequencer. Conserved domain search was performed using Pfam HMM (pfam.wustl.edu/hmmsearch.shtml) and NCBI conserved domain search (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Expression of Recombinant Bc Keratanase II and Its Domains—A DNA fragment that encodes a full-length enzyme protein was amplified by PCR using as primers 5′-ATGGATCCTTCCATTCGTCAAGATCCGAC-3′ and 5′-GCGAATTCGCCTTCAACAGCATGTTAAA-3′ and genomic DNA of the bacteria as template and ligated into the expression vector pET-22b (Novagen), using BamHI and EcoRI sites. For expression of the enzyme without an SLH domain, the primers 5′-ATGGATCCTTCCATTCGTCAAGATCCGAC-3′ and 5′-CAGAATTCAGCTCTCCAGGCTTGACGATGA-3′ were used. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the recombinant gene and cultured at 37 °C in 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and the protein expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the culture medium. After 3 h, the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and suspended in 4 ml of the lysis buffer containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After 30 min, the cell suspension was sonicated on ice. The supernatant containing the soluble enzyme was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and purified by chromatography on columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). Purification and Characterization of Bc Keratanase II— B. circulans keratanase II was purified from either a bacterial pellet or conditioned medium. A representative purification profile obtained from the pellet is summarized in Table II. From the pellet, the enzyme was purified by 63-fold to homogeneity with 58% recovery by a two-step chromatography using DE52 and phenyl-Sepharose. Typical chromatograms of DE52 and phenyl-Sepharose are shown in Fig. 1. Digestion of the bacterial suspension with lysozyme resulted in a higher extraction efficiency than sonication or repeated freeze-thawing. Furthermore, treatment with DNase I achieved a 2.4-fold extraction efficiency (data not shown). From 30 g of bacterial pellet, 80 units with a specific activity of 1.27 units/mg was obtained. Similarly, from the conditioned medium, the enzyme was purified by 180-fold with 12.5% recovery by a five-step column chromatography using DE52, Sephacryl S-300, DE52, Sephacryl S-300, and phenyl-Sepharose. From 20 liters of conditioned medium, 29 units of the enzyme with a specific activity of 2.1 units/mg was obtained. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme by either method indicated a single band corresponding to a M r of 200,000 under reducing (Fig. 2) and nonreducing (data not shown) conditions, suggesting that the single subunit protein has no significant intramolecular disulfide bridging.Table IIPurification of Bc keratanase IIPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%Cell extraction75001500.020100Salting out45001300.02987DEAE-cellulose DE527201080.15072Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B68.5871.27058 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2SDS-PAGE of Bc keratanase II.

The enzyme was stable at temperatures up to 45 °C and retained 65% activity at 50 °C after incubating for 1 h in 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 6.0 (Fig. 3A). The optimal temperature for the enzyme reaction was 55 °C. The enzyme exhibited 80 and 79% activity at 50 and 60 °C, respectively (Fig. 3B). The pH stability profile of the keratanase II disclosed that the enzyme is stable at pH 6.0–7.0 (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3D, the enzyme activity was maximal at pH 5.0 in the same buffer. Effects of metal ions on the activity were examined under the keratanase assay conditions. Na+, K+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ had no significant effect on the enzyme when tested as chloride salts at 1 mm. SH inhibitors such as p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and chelating agents such as EDTA showed no inhibitory effect (data not shown). Then we examined the substrate specificity of this enzyme by using various GAG chains including bovine cornea KS and shark cartilage KS. Although both KS chains were digested, cartilage KS was hydrolyzed 1.7-fold that of cornea KS. In contrast, all the other GAG chains including hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin were resistant (Table III), demonstrating a specificity to KS chains. Interestingly, no activity was observed toward de-sulfated KS chains, indicating an absolute requirement of the presence of a sulfated residue for digestion.Table IIISubstrate specificity of Bc keratanase IISubstrateRelative activity%Cartilage KS100Cornea KS57.5Desulfated KS0Hyaluronic acid0Chondroitin sulfate C0Heparan sulfate0Heparin0 Open table in a new tab Next, we determined the kinetics of the enzyme (Fig. 3E). The keratanase assay was performed at various concentrations of cornea KS and cartilage KS at 37 °C, pH 6.0. The K m and V max values were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots, supposing that most cartilage KS was decomposed to KS disaccharides and tetrasaccharides. The K m for cornea KS and cartilage KS was 143 and 54 μg/ml, respectively, and the V max was 39.1 and 57.7 μmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Analysis of KS Digests—We analyzed digests of shark cartilage KS and bovine cornea KS (2 mg/ml) by this enzyme, using a GPC-HPLC. Most of the cartilage KS was digested to KS disaccharide (57.5%) and tetrasaccharide (34.1%), whereas KS oligosaccharides over pentasaccharides (27.9%) remained in the cornea KS digest (Fig. 4). Monosaccharides such as GlcNAc(6S) and Gal(6S) were not detected in both digests. Similar digestion profiles were obtained when these KS samples were digested with keratanase II of Bacillus sp. Ks36 (endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase) (data not shown). These results indicate that this enzyme is an endoglycosidase. Next we determined the cleavage site of the enzyme. As the CE profiles of the digests by the enzyme agreed well with those by keratanase II of Bacillus sp. Ks36, we compared the structure of the major disaccharide fraction of shark cartilage KS digests by the purified enzyme (peak 2 in Fig. 4) and its 6-O-sulfate-specific desulfated form with vario"
https://openalex.org/W2003349643,"The structures of RsrI DNA methyltransferase (M.RsrI) bound to the substrate S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), the product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy), the inhibitor sinefungin, as well as a mutant apo-enzyme have been determined by x-ray crystallography. Two distinct binding configurations were observed for the three ligands. The substrate AdoMet adopts a bent shape that directs the activated methyl group toward the active site near the catalytic DPPY motif. The product AdoHcy and the competitive inhibitor sinefungin bind with a straight conformation in which the amino acid moiety occupies a position near the activated methyl group in the AdoMet complex. Analysis of ligand binding in comparison with other DNA methyltransferases reveals a small, common subset of available conformations for the ligand. The structures of M.RsrI with the non-substrate ligands contained a bound chloride ion in the AdoMet carboxylate-binding pocket, explaining its inhibition by chloride salts. The L72P mutant of M.RsrI is the first DNA methyltransferase structure without bound ligand. With respect to the wild-type protein, it had a larger ligand-binding pocket and displayed movement of a loop (223–227) that is responsible for binding the ligand, which may account for the weaker affinity of the L72P mutant for AdoMet. These studies show the subtle changes in the tight specific interactions of substrate, product, and an inhibitor with M.RsrI and help explain how each displays its unique effect on the activity of the enzyme.

Biological DNA methylation is ubiquitous and important in many cellular mechanisms including genetic imprinting, immunity, cancer, and gene regulation (1Paulsen M. Ferguson-Smith A. J. Pathol. 2001; 195: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Low D. Weyand N. Mahan D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7197-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 3Jeltsch A. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria, DNA methylation protects the host from foreign DNA through the action of restriction modification systems composed of a restriction endonuclease and a DNA modification methyltransferase (MTase). 1The abbreviations used are: MTase, methyltransferase; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; M.RsrI, RsrI DNA methyltransferase; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s.d., root-mean-squared deviations; 5′-MTA, 5′-methylthioadenosine; TRD, target recognition domain.1The abbreviations used are: MTase, methyltransferase; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; M.RsrI, RsrI DNA methyltransferase; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s.d., root-mean-squared deviations; 5′-MTA, 5′-methylthioadenosine; TRD, target recognition domain. Both enzymes recognize a specific DNA sequence that is usually palindromic. The endonuclease cleaves the DNA unless the MTase has added a methyl group to a base in the recognition sequence. Restriction modification systems are classified by their subunit composition and cofactor requirements (4Bujnicki J.M. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 969-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The most studied of these classes, type II restriction modification systems, usually have a dimeric endonuclease and a monomeric MTase that requires only the methyl-donating cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) for activity. Type II DNA MTases share a conserved catalytic core structure (5Roberts R.J. Belfort M. Bestor T. Bhagwat A.S. Bickle T.A. Bitinaite J. Blumenthal R.M. Degtyarev S.K. Dryden D.T.F. Dybvig K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), composed of a seven-β-stranded sheet flanked by three α-helices on each side, that contains the ligand-binding pockets and active site (6Gong W. O'Gara M. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2702-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the MTases are not as well conserved as their structures, but they share nine conserved sequence motifs (7Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). On the basis of these motifs, the MTases are subdivided into C5 MTases, which methylate cytosine at C5, and α, β, and γ subclasses of amino MTases, which methylate either adenine at the N6 position (N6A) or cytosine at the N4 position (N4C) (7Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Of the conserved motifs, the catalytic motif IV, which contains a conserved PC for the C5 MTases (8Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a conserved (D/N/S)PP(Y/F) for the amino MTases (7Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), is implicated in catalysis (9Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). RsrI MTase (M.RsrI) is a β-class N6A enzyme that recognizes the palindromic duplex DNA sequence GAATTC and methylates the internal adenine on each strand (10Kaszubska W. Aiken C. O'Connor C.D. Gumport R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10403-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Kaszubska W. Webb H.K. Gumport R.I. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is an isoenzyme of EcoRI MTase, a γ-class MTase, with which it shares very little sequence homology (16% identity (10Kaszubska W. Aiken C. O'Connor C.D. Gumport R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10403-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). M.RsrI is most homologous in structure and sequence identity (28%) to the N4C MTase PvuII (6Gong W. O'Gara M. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2702-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Previous work partially characterized kinetic and binding properties of M.RsrI with AdoMet, as well as the product of the methylation reaction S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and the specific inhibitor sinefungin (12Szegedi S.S. Reich N.O. Gumport R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3962-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of M.RsrI revealed a breakdown product of AdoMet, 5′-methylthioadenosine (5′-MTA) (13Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4444-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) in the ligand-binding site (14Scavetta R.D. Thomas C.B. Walsh M.A. Szegedi S. Joachimiak A. Gumport R.I. Churchill M.E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present the structures of RsrI MTase bound to the ligands AdoMet, AdoHcy, or sinefungin. The structures illustrate the similarities and key differences in ligand binding and explain some observed biochemical properties. We also present the structure of the catalytically impaired L72P mutant of M.RsrI (15Szegedi S.S. Gumport R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3972-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is the first DNA MTase structure to be determined without bound ligand. This structure offers a unique opportunity to examine directly the structural changes of DNA MTases that occur upon ligand binding. Generating the L72P Histidine-tagged Mutant—The M.RsrI-L72P mutation was originally isolated in a genetic screen (15Szegedi S.S. Gumport R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3972-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The histidine-tagged construct used in the initial structure study was mutated by previously described methods (14Scavetta R.D. Thomas C.B. Walsh M.A. Szegedi S. Joachimiak A. Gumport R.I. Churchill M.E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Szegedi S.S. Gumport R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3972-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole plasmid PCR with mutagenic primers containing the desired mutation was used to introduce the L72P mutation into the plasmid DNA. The mutation also introduced an R.NgoMIV site, which was used to screen for plasmids containing the desired mutation. The presence of the desired mutation and the absence of unintended changes were verified by DNA sequencing. Co-crystallization and Crystal Soaking—The M.RsrI and M.RsrI-L72P proteins were expressed from pET28a+::rsrIM (14Scavetta R.D. Thomas C.B. Walsh M.A. Szegedi S. Joachimiak A. Gumport R.I. Churchill M.E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the mutant rsrIM gene, respectively, and purified as described (12Szegedi S.S. Reich N.O. Gumport R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3962-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Scavetta R.D. Thomas C.B. Walsh M.A. Szegedi S. Joachimiak A. Gumport R.I. Churchill M.E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AdoMet was obtained from New England Biolabs, AdoHcy was obtained from Sigma, and sinefungin was a gift from Margaret Neidenthal (Eli Lilly Laboratories). All three were used without further purification, and concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of 15,600 m-1cm-1 at 260 nm. M.RsrI (2.0 mg/ml) was co-crystallized by the addition of AdoMet, AdoHcy, or sinefungin at final concentrations between 1 and 20 mm in a crystallization buffer of 100 mm HEPES, pH = 7.4, 1.5 m Li2SO4. Co-crystals appeared under the same crystallization conditions as did the native protein and had nearly identical morphology (chunky plates of dimensions 400 × 400 × 50 μm) (14Scavetta R.D. Thomas C.B. Walsh M.A. Szegedi S. Joachimiak A. Gumport R.I. Churchill M.E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-crystals of the M.RsrI-AdoHcy complex were soaked for 6 h in the well solution described above plus 450 mm KBr to produce bromide-substituted crystals for anomalous scattering experiments. M.RsrI-L72P crystals were crystallized using the same conditions but without the addition of ligand, and this resulted in crystals of similar morphology. Data Collection and Structure Determination—A single crystal of each complex was used to collect diffraction data using Molecular Structure Corporation R-Axis IV and R-Axis IV++ detectors in-house and at Rigaku-MSC (The Woodlands, TX). The L72P data and anomalous diffraction data for the bromide-soaked M.RsrI-AdoHcy complex at a wavelength of 0.9184 Å were collected on beamlines 19-ID and 19-BM (Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory), respectively. In all cases, cryoprotection was achieved by drawing the crystals through paraffin oil before freezing in liquid nitrogen, and data were collected at -180 °C.

Coordinate Deposition—Atomic coordinates of the structures reported were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the following accession numbers: M.RsrI-AdoMet, 1NW5; M.RsrI-AdoHcy, 1NW7; M.RsrI-sinefungin, 1NW6; M.RsrI-L72P, 1NW8. To understand better the structure-function relationships of RsrI MTase, we co-crystallized M.RsrI with the substrate AdoMet, the product AdoHcy, or the inhibitor sinefungin. The crystals diffracted beyond 2.3 Å, and the structures were solved directly by molecular replacement using the previously determined native structure (14Scavetta R.D. Thomas C.B. Walsh M.A. Szegedi S. Joachimiak A. Gumport R.I. Churchill M.E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because no electron density for the N-terminal 35 amino acids and the C-terminal 5 amino acids was observed, the final models included amino acids 36–287 and 297–314 for the enzyme-AdoMet complex and amino acids 36–288 and 297–314 for the AdoHcy or sinefungin complexes. The electron density for each ligand was well resolved (see Fig. 2). Overall, the protein structures are similar to each other and to the native structure as indicated by the small r.m.s.d. of the backbone and side chain atoms (Table II). However, distinct differences were observed between the bound ligand structures when compared with either each other or to the previously reported structure of M.RsrI bound to the AdoMet degradation product 5′-MTA (native structure) (14Scavetta R.D.

In the AdoMet complex, the methionine tail had a C4′-C5′-SD-CG torsion angle (Fig. 1) of -70°, which twists the carbon chain toward the opposite side of the ribose from the adenine ring. This “bent” conformation oriented the activated methyl group so that it pointed toward the catalytic DPPY (65–68) and the active site of the enzyme (see Fig. 3). The C4′-C5′-SD-CG torsion angles were -169° and -143° for AdoHcy and sinefungin, respectively. These angles placed the tail portion of the ligand (homocysteine for AdoHcy or ornithine for sinefungin) in the same plane as the ribose (Fig. 2). This “extended” conformation permits direct interaction of the tail α-amino and α-carbonyl groups with the catalytic DPPY motif, an interaction that is not observed in the AdoMet complex. In the extended conformation, the ϵ-amino group of sinefungin, corresponding to the activated methyl group in AdoMet, was oriented toward the exterior of the protein and formed part of the solvent-exposed surface, unlike the methyl group of AdoMet (Fig. 3A). The binding pocket contains water molecules, and a chloride ion sits at the position occupied by a carboxylate oxygen atom of the methionine tail (Fig. 2). A second chloride forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Leu137 and to the side chains of Asn136 and Asn206 near the putative target recognition domain (TRD) of the protein (residues 165–210). Using anomalous scattering from bromide-soaked M.RsrI-AdoHcy co-crystals, we observed substitution of the second chloride by bromide, confirming that this site binds negative ions. The chloride ion in the ligand-binding pocket did not exchange with bromide, but it is likely that access to this site was restricted by the bound AdoHcy.Fig. 1Ligands of DNA methyltransferases. Shown are AdoMet; AdoHcy, sinefungin, and 5′-MTA. The tails attached to the C-5′ of the adenosine moiety (R) are shown individually, with atom labels shown for AdoMet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to differences in tail orientations of the AdoHcy and sinefungin complexes, the ribose conformations differed from those of AdoMet. Both AdoHcy and sinefungin had C2′-endo sugar puckers when compared with C1′-exo for AdoMet and 5′-MTA. Since all of the ribose atoms formed the same hydrogen bonds (Table III and Fig. 3A), and the only positional differences in the adenine and ribose moieties were the C4′ and C5′ atoms, which are directly connected to the tail moiety, these differences in sugar conformations appeared to be caused by the differences in the tail orientations. The formation of a hydrogen bond, or lack thereof (AdoHcy), to the charged sulfur (AdoMet) or nitrogen (sinefungin) by Thr225 (Table III) may contribute to the different sugar conformations because these charged atoms occupy different positions in the liganded M.RsrI structures (the nitrogen in sinefungin corresponds to the carbon of the activated methyl group in sinefungin). The adenine rings of AdoMet and sinefungin occupied nearly identical positions, whereas that of AdoHcy was twisted slightly away from the ribose relative to the other two. The nearly identical binding of the nucleoside moiety of the three ligands by M.RsrI contrasts with the ligands bound to M.TaqI, as shown in Fig. 3B, where the ligand nucleoside moiety positions are shifted slightly from one another (20Schluckebier G. Kozak M. Bleimling N. Weinhold E. Saenger W. J. Mol.

AdoMet, with the exception of the M.TaqI-AdoMet structure, assumes a sugar pucker of C1′-exo in all of the crystal structures, which may be due to the common bent tail conformation and the required orientation of the methyl being donated. With the exception of M.PvuII, all the AdoMet structures have a bent tail conformation, whereas the AdoHcy and sinefungin structures adopt an extended conformation. In the case of M.PvuII, the bound AdoHcy assumes a bent conformation similar to that of AdoMet. However, AdoHcy appears in the PDB file for the PvuII structure only because of weak methyl group density as the crystals were grown in the presence of AdoMet and the structure was discussed as though AdoMet were bound (6Gong W. O'Gara M. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2702-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). 2X. Cheng, personal communication. Our analysis of ligand binding orientations supports the assignment of AdoMet as the ligand bound to M.PvuII as AdoMet is the only ligand that binds with a bent tail conformation in all of the other MTase structures.Table IVLigand torsion angles in methyltransferase structuresStructureTail torsion anglesaSee Fig. 1 for atom designationsSugar configurationsAdoMetO4′-C1′-N9-C4O4′-C4′-C5′-SDC4′-C5′-SD-CGC5′-SD-CG-CBSD-CG-CB-CACG-CB-CA-CCB-CA-C-O1M.RsrI-99176-70168177160-53C1′ exoM.TaqI-AbM.TaqI crystallized with two proteins in the asymmetric unit and each protein was analyzed independently-79158-82103169-7288C1′ exoM.TaqI-BbM.TaqI crystallized with two proteins in the asymmetric unit and each protein was analyzed independently-83154-68109168-86-62C2′ exoM.DpnII2-97178-66-171179162-87C1′ exoM.HhaI-123171-37-13617083139C1′ exo/C2′ endoSinefunginO4′-C1′-N9-C4O4′-C4′-C5′-CDC4′-C5′-CD-CGC5′-CD-CG-CBCD-CG-CB-CACG-CB-CA-CCB-CA-C-O1M.RsrI-100173-143-178154-8286C2′ endoM.TaqI-AbM.TaqI crystallized with two proteins in the asymmetric unit and each protein was analyzed independently-1023417355169176-94C3′ endoM.TaqI-BbM.TaqI crystallized with two proteins in the asymmetric unit and each protein was analyzed independently-10016-177157-16177-94C4′ exo/C3′ endoAdoHcyO4′-C1′-N9-C4O4′-C4′-C5′-SDC4′-C5′-SD-CGC5′-SD-CG-CBSD-CG-CB-CACG-CB-CA-CCB-CA-C-O1M.RsrI-95172-169157-178-66114C2′ endo/C1′ exoM.TaqI-AbM.TaqI crystallized with two proteins in the asymmetric unit and each protein was analyzed independently-10583175-127-179-61-85C3′ endoM.TaqI-BbM.TaqI crystallized with two proteins in the asymmetric unit and each protein was analyzed independently-10672162146-17776-56C2′ endoM.PvuII-10315953127170140-93O4′ endoa See Fig. 1 for atom designationsb M.TaqI crystallized with two proteins in the asymmetric unit and each protein was analyzed independently Open table in a new tab In addition to differences in ligand configurations, M.RsrI amino acid side chains surrounding the ligands changed position and structure (Fig. 4, A and B). Table III lists the ligand-enzyme contacts and shows that the most noticeable side chain difference is Lys227, which, in the AdoHcy and sinefungin structures, had shifted into the position occupied previously by the amino group of the AdoMet tail (Fig. 2). The side chain orientation of Lys227 in the AdoMet structure is most likely due to repulsion by the α-amino group of the AdoMet tail. M.RsrI in the AdoHcy complex differed (r.m.s.d. for all atoms) from both the AdoMet- and sinefungin-bound structures at residues Trp84 and Cys45 by 0.6 and 0.7 Å, respectively. Both of these amino acids adjoined the adenine ring of the ligand, and their change in position reflects the slightly different orientation of the adenine ring in the AdoHcy structure.

https://openalex.org/W2063990647,"Therapeutic modalities that overcome the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2 that is often overexpressed in cancer cells are expected to be a novel strategy for cancer treatment. We previously reported that the leukemic cell death induced by an N-terminally truncated Bax (deltaN Bax: corresponding to amino acid 112-192 of full-length Bax) was not blocked by Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) owing to the lack of the BH3 domain needed to interact with the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family molecules. In this study, we used the Cre-loxP system that allowed us to propagate adenoviruses expressing deltaN Bax, and investigated the effects of the deltaN Bax gene transfer into A549 and NCI-H1299 nonsmall cell lung cancer cell lines. deltaN Bax showed more cell-death-inducing activity in both cells than did the full-length Bax in vitro. It was found that the deltaN Bax-induced cell death was not inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that deltaN Bax induces cell death through a caspase-independent mechanism. Intratumoral injection of adenoviruses expressing deltaN Bax into A549 tumors in Balb/c nude mice showed a significantly stronger suppression of tumor growth (74%) than full-length Bax (25%) compared to the control. Our results suggest that deltaN Bax may provide a better alternative than currently used cytotoxic genes in cancer gene therapy trials."
