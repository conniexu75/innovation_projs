https://openalex.org/W2085797277,"Normal cells in culture invariably undergo senescence, whereby they cease proliferation after a finite number of doublings. Irreversible changes in gene expression occurred in senescent human fetal lung fibroblasts: a non-cell cycle-regulated mRNA was partially repressed; an unusual polyadenylated histone mRNA was expressed; although serum induced c-H-ras, c-myc, and ornithine decarboxylase mRNA normally, ornithine decarboxylase activity was deficient; and serum did not induce mRNA for a replication-dependent histone and for the c-fos proto-oncogene. The loss of c-fos inducibility was the result of a specific, transcriptional block. The results suggest that senescent fibroblasts were unable to proliferate because of, at least in part, selective repression of c-fos; moreover, the multiple changes in gene expression support the view that cellular senescence is a process of terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1558812914,"Progesterone and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (but not other steroids such as testosterone, corticosterone, beta-estradiol, estrone, dehydroepiandrosterone, 20 alpha-hydroxypregnen-3-one, androstenedione, and pregnenolone) were shown to cause an immediate increase, in free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) in both capacitated and noncapacitated human sperm, using the fluorescent indicator fura 2. Significant increases in [Ca2+]i were observed with 10 ng/ml progesterone, while maximum effects were seen with 1 microgram/ml progesterone. Two other steroids 11 beta-hydroxyprogesterone and 5 alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione exhibited significant activity to increase [Ca2+]i. This increase in [Ca2+]i elicited by progesterone was entirely due to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium since the increase in [Ca2+]i was blocked by the Ca2+ chelator EGTA (2.5 mM) and the Ca2+ channel antagonist La3+ (0.25 mM) when added to the medium containing 2.5 mM Ca2+. Progesterone also stimulated the uptake of Mn2+ into sperm as measured by the quenching of fura 2 fluorescence. Progesterone has been found in human follicular fluid at levels capable of stimulating increases in [Ca2+]i. The similarities in responses induced by human follicular fluid and progesterone an increase in [Ca2+]i, and hence the acrosome reaction, is progesterone and/or 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. Progesterone (1 microgram/ml) did not increase [Ca2+]i in somatic cells such as adipocytes, hepatocytes, Balb/c 3T3 cells, normal rat kidney, or DDT1 MF-2 cells. The effects of these progestins to increase [Ca2+]i, by activating a receptor-operated calcium channel, is the first report of such an activity in sperm. This phenomena possibly opens up a new field of steroid action in the area of sterility, fertility, and contraception at the level of the sperm."
https://openalex.org/W1561963135,"Based on the partial amino acid sequence, the cDNA encoding UDP-GalNAc:Fuc alpha 1----2Gal alpha 1----3GalNAc transferase, the specific primary gene product of histo-blood group A gene (A transferase), was cloned and sequenced. Poly(A)+ RNA from human stomach cancer cell line MKN45, expressing high levels of A antigen, was used for construction of a lambda gt10 cDNA library. Degenerate synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were used for polymerase chain reactions to detect the presence of the sequence of interest in cDNA (presence test) and to identify the correct clones (identification test) after screening the library with a radiolabeled polymerase chain reaction amplified fragment. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a coding region of 1062 base pairs encoding a protein of 41 kDa. Hydrophobicity plot analysis shows the existence of three domains: N-terminal short stretch, transmembranous hydrophobic region, and a long C-terminal domain (a feature common to all glycosyltransferases cloned so far). Southern hybridization analysis has shown that this DNA does not represent a multigene family. No restriction fragment length polymorphism was found to correlate with ABO blood group type. Bands were detected in Northern hybridization of mRNAs from cell lines expressing A, B, AB, or H antigens. These results suggest that sequences of ABO genes are essentially very similar (with minimal differences), and the inability of the O gene to encode A or B transferases is probably due to structural differences rather than A or B transferase expression failure."
https://openalex.org/W1520264805,"Recently, we have shown that ionophore activation of human leukocytes results in leukotriene synthesis and a translocation of 5-lipoxygenase from the cytosol to cellular membrane. This membrane translocation was postulated to be an important early activation step for the enzyme. 3-[1-(p-Chlorobenzyl)-5-(isopropyl)-3-tert-butylthioindol-2-yl]-2, 2- dimethylpropanoic acid (MK886) is a potent and specific inhibitor of leukotriene biosynthesis in vivo and in intact cells, but has no direct effect on 5-lipoxygenase activity in cell-free systems. In this report, we show that MK886 can both prevent and reverse the membrane translocation of 5-lipoxygenase, in conjunction with the inhibition of leukotriene synthesis. Similar compounds of the indole class could also inhibit the membrane translocation of 5-lipoxygenase in a rank order of potency that correlated with their potencies for leukotriene synthesis inhibition. In contrast L-656,224, a direct 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, had no effect on the translocation of the enzyme. Attempts to demonstrate the effects of MK886 on the association of 5-lipoxygenase with membrane in cell-free preparations failed due to a nonspecific Ca2+-dependent sedimentation of the enzyme. The mechanism of action of MK-886 is therefore to block translocation, prevent subsequent activation of 5-lipoxygenase, and hence block cellular leukotriene biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2143071207,"The role of the cytoplasmic loops and C-terminal region of bovine rhodopsin (Rho) in binding and activating rhodopsin kinase was investigated. The ability of various enzymatically truncated forms of photolyzed rhodopsin (Rho*) to stimulate rhodopsin kinase activity was quantified. Following endopeptidase Asp-N cleavage of all phosphorylation sites on the C-terminal, the resulting truncated Rho* (329G-Rho*) was not phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase. This suggests that rhodopsin kinase only phosphorylates C-terminal sites of Rho*. However 329G-Rho* could bind rhodopsin kinase and stimulate phosphorylation of exogenous peptide. Kinase stimulation was investigated for other truncated forms of Rho* in which the C-terminal region was either partially or completely eliminated, and the V-VI loop was either cleaved or left intact (339K-Rho*, 341E239E-Rho*, 329G239E-Rho*, 327P240S-Rho*). Results suggest that the V-VI loop is crucial for kinase binding (similar to the binding of GT). Mastoparan, a model peptide for G-protein-coupled receptors, was found to stimulate rhodopsin kinase in a mechanism similar to that of truncated Rho*. We conclude that rhodopsin kinase binds to the cytoplasmic loops of Rho* to cause a stimulation of its catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1565928898,"The purpose of this study was to simultaneously isolate skeletal muscle plasma and microsomal membranes from the hind limbs of male Sprague-Dawley rats perfused either in the absence or presence of 20 milliunits/ml insulin and to determine the effect of insulin on the number and distribution of glucose transporters in these membrane fractions. Insulin increased hind limb glucose uptake greater than 3-fold (2.4 +/- 0.7 versus 9.2 +/- 1.0 mumol/g x h, p less than 0.001). Plasma membrane glucose transporter number, measured by cytochalasin B binding, increased 2-fold (9.1 +/- 1.0 to 20.4 +/- 3.1 pmol/mg protein, p less than 0.005) in insulin-stimulated muscle while microsomal membrane transporters decreased significantly (14.8 +/- 1.6 to 9.8 +/- 1.4 pmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05). No change in the dissociation constant (Kd approximately 120 nm) was observed. K+-stimulated-p-nitrophenol phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, and galactosyltransferase specific activity, enrichment, and recovery in the plasma and microsomal membrane fractions were not altered by insulin treatment. Western blot analysis using the monoclonal antibody mAb 1F8 (specific for the insulin-regulatable glucose transporter) demonstrated increased glucose transporter densities in plasma membranes from insulin-treated hind limb skeletal muscle compared with untreated tissues, while microsomal membranes from the insulin-treated hind limb skeletal muscle had a concomitant decrease in transporter density. We conclude that the increase in plasma membrane glucose transporters explains, at least in part, the increase in glucose uptake associated with insulin stimulation of hind limb skeletal muscle. Our data further suggest that these recruited transporters originate from an intracellular microsomal pool, consistent with the translocation hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1660611080,"MRP-8 and MRP-14 are calcium-binding proteins belonging to the S-100 protein family which have been shown to be associated with specific stages of myeloic/monocytic cell differentiation. Members of this protein family are shown to form homo- and heterodimers. Complex formation has also been observed in preliminary experiments for MRP-8 and MRP-14. To evaluate the in vivo relevance of the MRP complex formation and the stoichiometric ratio of individual components complexes were isolated from granulocytes and monocytes by immunoaffinity chromatography using monospecific antibodies. The purified fraction of the MRPs was found to contain monomers and dimers as shown on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by silver staining and immunoblotting. Similar results were obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of crude cell extracts. The existence of the MRP complexes in vivo was demonstrated by chemical cross-linking and subsequent isolation of complexes by immunoaffinity chromatography. Two new, highly abundant complexes were found in addition to the heterodimer, but neither monomers nor homodimers were detected. The two larger protein complexes (35.0 and 48.5 kDa) were identified as [MRP-8)2.(MRP-14] trimer and [MRP-8)2.(MRP-14)2) tetramer, respectively. All complexes could be shown to be noncovalently associated in vivo. Furthermore, the association of MRPs was shown to be Ca2+ dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2107615045,"One of the responses of platelets to stimulation is activation of intracellular calpain (the Ca(2+)-dependent protease). Previously, we have shown that activation of calpain in platelets is involved in the generation of platelet procoagulant activity. Because procoagulant activity is present on the microvesicles that are shed from activated platelets, in this study we examined whether calpain is involved in the shedding of microvesicles. Platelets were incubated with the physiological agonists collagen or thrombin. The extent of activation of calpain correlated positively with the amount of procoagulant-containing microvesicles that formed, and the shedding of procoagulant-containing microvesicles was inhibited by calpeptin, MDL, and EST (E-64-d), three membrane-penetrating inhibitors of calpain. The protein composition of the microvesicles shed from aggregating platelets was similar to that of microvesicles shed by platelets in which the association of the membrane skeleton with the plasma membrane had been disrupted by incubation of platelets with dibucaine or ionophore A23187. Furthermore, like microvesicles shed from dibucaine- or ionophore A23187-treated platelets, those shed from the aggregating platelets possessed procoagulant activity. These results are consistent with the possibility that activation of calpain in aggregating platelets causes the shedding of procoagulant-containing microvesicles. We suggest that the shedding of microvesicles results from the calpain-induced hydrolysis of the platelet membrane skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1517947547,"Participation of cytoskeletal elements in regulation of hormonal response and responsiveness has been suggested by several laboratories. Addition of dimeric tubulin to rat cerebral cortex synaptic membranes causes stable inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and the molecular basis for this effect appears to require a direct interaction between tubulin and G proteins. To test whether such tubulin-G protein interaction occurred, several purified G proteins were bound to nitrocellulose, and 125I-tubulin overlay studies were performed. 125I-Tubulin bound to the alpha subunits of Gs and Gil with high specificity and an apparent Kd of approximately 130 nM. Other G protein alpha subunits (alpha i2, alpha i3, alpha 0, and transducin) displayed a much lower affinity for tubulin, despite the much closer relationship of those proteins to alpha il than to alpha s. Association of beta gamma subunits with alpha il or alpha s did not alter the binding of tubulin to these G protein heterotrimers, and the binding of a hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog to the alpha subunits was similarly without effect. These results suggest that tubulin forms complexes with specific G proteins and these complexes might provide a locus for the interaction of cytoskeletal components and signal transduction cascades. These results also provide evidence of a functional distinction among the closely related alpha i subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W2154610968,"To study the activation of human 72-kDa gelatinase, and its relation to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2), we purified human 72-kDa progelatinase both as a complex with TIMP-2 and as a free proteinase. Activation of progelatinase-TIMP-2 complexes with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate yielded gelatinolytically active enzyme migrating at 62 kDa. TIMP-2 remained bound to the active enzyme. Removal of TIMP-2 from progelatinase by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, followed by complete dialysis in neutral pH buffer, resulted in multiple fragments. These fragments were formed as a result of the cleavage of 72-kDa progelatinase at several locations. Cleavage at the amino terminus was restricted to the removal of the propeptide, except in the case of degradation leading to inactive fragments. Two active species autocatalytically evolved upon removal of TIMP-2 from progelatinase. The 62 kDa-activated gelatinase lacked the amino-terminal propeptide, which is known to be removed upon treatment with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. In addition, an active 42.5-kDa fragment lacking both the propeptide and a portion of the carboxyl terminus was formed. This low-molecular-weight active form of 72-kDa progelatinase retained its ability to bind and degrade gelatin. Self-activation and degradation of 72-kDa progelatinase can be prevented by agents that inhibit metalloproteinases, including 1,10-phenanthroline. Evidence presented here suggests that TIMP-2 binds to a stabilization site that is independent of the active site. This stabilization site does not bind TIMP-1 (TIMP). Occupation of this site by TIMP-2 prevents autocatalytic activation and degradation but does not prevent gelatinolysis by the enzyme-inhibitor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1590061014,"The binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to the platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex is a key event in hemostasis and may participate in the development of thrombotic vascular occlusion. We present here evidence that residues Ser251-Tyr279 in the GP Ib alpha-chain participate in this function. Initial studies suggested that the modality of vWF interaction with GP Ib depended on the conditions used for induction of binding, either in the presence of ristocetin, or botrocetin, or with asialo-vWF. In fact, only the 45-kDa amino-terminal fragment of GP Ib alpha inhibited the vWF-GP Ib interaction under all conditions tested, while the 84-kDa macroglycopeptide was significantly effective only in the presence of ristocetin. Moreover, the 45-kDa fragment with reduced disulfide bonds still inhibited ristocetin-induced binding but had no effect, at the concentrations tested, on botrocetin-mediated or direct asialo-vWF binding. In order to localize in more detail the functional site, the entire sequence of the 45-kDa fragment was reproduced in 27 overlapping synthetic peptides that were then used in inhibition of binding assays. This led to the identification of a linear GP Ib alpha sequence (residues Ser251-Tyr279) that effectively inhibited platelet interaction with vWF mediated by ristocetin and, at higher concentration, also by botrocetin. A shorter peptide overlapping with the longer one (residues Gly271-Glu285) was the second most active inhibitory species. This region of the molecule contains several residues with a high surface probability index, as expected for a site involved in ligand binding. Thus, while native conformation of GP Ib alpha appears to be important for optimal interaction with vWF, the results obtained with short synthetic peptides may help in defining the amino acid residues participating in this essential function."
https://openalex.org/W1745001432,"Factor VIII, a protein cofactor involved in blood coagulation, functions in vitro on a phospholipid membrane surface to greatly increase the rate of factor X activation by factor IXa. Using gel filtration, rapid sedimentation, and resonance energy transfer we have studied the interaction of recombinant-derived human factor VIII with small and large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine. Resonance energy transfer, from intrinsic fluorophores in factor VIII to dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine incorporated into vesicles, has been adapted for quantitative equilibrium measurements. Factor VIII binds rapidly and reversibly to small and large vesicles. At 8 degrees C the interaction of factor VIII with small vesicles fits a simple bimolecular model with a KD of 2 nM and a phospholipid binding site defined by 180 phospholipid monomers. At 25 degrees C the binding of factor VIII to small vesicles containing 20% phosphatidylserine can be described by an apparent KD of 4 nM; the phospholipid/protein ratio at saturation was 170. Binding to large vesicles was demonstrated with a KD of 2 nM and a phospholipid/protein ratio at saturation of 385. Binding was dependent upon the phosphatidylserine mole fraction and was nonlinear from 0 to 30% phosphatidylserine content. A direct comparison of factor VIII and factor V binding indicated that the affinity of factor V to phospholipid vesicles was equivalent to that of factor VIII and that the phosphatidylserine requirement was lower. A model is proposed to explain the nonlinear phosphatidylserine dependence of binding for factor VIII."
https://openalex.org/W1490964055,"Uptake of the thioether S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione (DNPSG) in canalicular plasma membrane vesicles from rat liver is enhanced in the presence of ATP and exhibits an overshoot with a transient 5.5-fold accumulation of DNPSG. Stimulation by ATP is not caused by the generation of a membrane potential, based on responses of the indicator dye oxonol V. ATP-dependent uptake has an apparent Km of 71 microM for DNPSG and a Vmax of 0.34 nmol.min-1.mg of vesicle protein-1. Protein thiol groups are essential for transport activity as indicated by the sensitivity of DNPSG transport to sulfhydryl reagents. There is competitive inhibition with other thioethers, S-hexylglutathione (Ki = 66 microM), the photoaffinity label S-(4-azidophenacyl)glutathione (Ki = 56 microM), as well as with glutathione disulfide (Ki = 0.44 mM) and with the bile acid taurocholate (Ki = 0.61 mM). GSH (2 mM) or cholate (0.4 mM) does not inhibit. Both glutathione disulfide and taurocholate show ATP-dependent transport in the canalicular membrane vesicles which is inhibited by DNPSG. No ATP-dependent transport is found for GSH. Transport of DNPSG is also inhibited competitively by alpha-naphthyl-beta-D-glucuronide (Ki = 0.42 mM) but not by alpha-naphthylsulfate (2 mM), and there is substantial inhibition with the glucuronides from ebselen and p-nitrophenol. The results indicate that the canalicular transport system for DNPSG is directly driven by ATP and that the biliary transport of other classes of compounds may also proceed via this system."
https://openalex.org/W1573776124,"The soluble histo-blood group A glycosyltransferase (Fuc alpha 1----Gal alpha 1----3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) was purified approximately 600,000-fold to homogeneity from human lung tissue. The enzyme was solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, partially purified by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B, and eluted with UDP. Final purification was obtained by twice repeated fast protein liquid chromatography ion exchange (Mono STM) with NaCl gradient elution and reverse-phase chromatography (proRPC) with acetonitrile gradient elution. Identity of the purified protein was established by (i) demonstration of the putative A transferase protein only in affinity-purified extracts of A but not O individuals, and (ii) specific immunoprecipitation of enzyme activity and putative protein with monoclonal antibodies. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis revealed a single protein band with apparent Mr of approximately 40,000 under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Digestion with N-glycanase yielded a reduction in Mr of approximately 6,000 (estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), suggesting that the A transferase is a glycoprotein with N-linked carbohydrate chains. Amino acid composition and N-terminal amino acid sequence of the intact transferase, as well as of peptides released by endolysyl peptidase digest or cyanogen bromide cleavage, are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1488916767,"We cloned and sequenced the gene coding for the polypeptide of a halorhodopsin in Natronobacterium pharaonis (named here pharaonis halorhodopsin). Peptide sequencing of cyanogen bromide fragments, and immunoreactions of the protein and synthetic peptides derived from the COOH-terminal gene sequence, confirmed that the open reading frame is the structural gene for the pharaonis halorhodopsin polypeptide. The flanking DNA sequences, as well as those for other bacterial rhodopsins, were compared to previously proposed archaebacterial consensus sequences. In pairwise comparisons of the open reading frame with DNA sequences for bacterio-opsin and halo-opsin from Halobacterium halobium, silent divergences (mutations/nucleotide at codon positions which do not result in amino acid changes) were calculated. These indicate very considerable evolutionary distance between each pair of genes. In spite of this, the three protein sequences show extensive similarities, indicating strong selective pressures. Conserved and conservatively replaced amino acid residues in all three proteins identify general features essential for ion-motive bacterial rhodopsins, responsible for overall structure and chromophore properties. Comparison of the bacteriorhodopsin sequence with those of the two halorhodopsins, on the other hand, identifies features involved in their specific (proton and chloride ion) transport functions."
https://openalex.org/W2043025348,"It has been proposed that dithiol-disulfide interchange and oxidation-reduction reactions may play a role in hormone-induced receptor activation. Inspection of the sequences of the gonadotropic hormones revealed a homologous tetrapeptide (Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys) between the beta subunit of lutropin (LH) and the active site of thioredoxin (TD). The beta subunit of follitropin (FSH) has a similar sequence (Cys-Gly-Lys-Cys). Thioredoxin is a ubiquitous protein serving as an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase, but it also exhibits disulfide isomerase activity. The catalytic activity of TD was assayed by its ability to reactivate reduced and denatured ribonuclease. In this assay, the purified ovine FSH and bovine LH preparations tested were approximately 60 and approximately 300 times, respectively, as active as TD on a molar basis. This heretofore unsuspected catalytic property of FSH and LH may be important in understanding their mechanism of receptor activation and signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1606363663,"Pharaonis halorhodopsin is a light-driven transport system for chloride, similarly to the previously described halorhodopsin, but we find that it transports nitrate as effectively as chloride. We studied the photoreactions of the purified, detergent-solubilized pharaonis pigment with a gated multichannel analyzer. At a physiological salt concentration (4 M NaCl), the absorption spectra and rate constants of rise and decay for intermediates of the photocycle were similar to those for halorhodopsin. In buffer containing nitrate, halorhodopsin exhibits a second, truncated photocycle; this difference in the photoreaction of the pigment occurs when an anion is bound in such a way as to preclude transport. As expected from the lack of anion specificity in the transport, the photocycle of pharaonis halorhodopsin was nearly unaffected by replacement of chloride with nitrate. All presumed buried positively charged residues, which might play a role in anion binding, are conserved in the two pigments. At the extracellular end of the presumed helix C, however, an arginine residue is found in halorhodopsin, but not in pharaonis halorhodopsin, and an arginine-rich segment between the presumed helices A and B in halorhodopsin is replaced by a less positively charged sequence in pharaonis halorhodopsin (Lanyi, J. K., Duschl, A., Hatfield, G. W., May, K., and Oesterhelt, D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1253-1260). One or both of these alterations may explain the difference in the anion selectivity of the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1608651134,"A lipoxygenase has been found in the reticulocytes of all mammalian species tested so far (rabbit, rat, mouse, monkey, and humans); evidence from in vitro studies suggests that the lipid-peroxidizing effects of this enzyme could render the mitochondrion and other intracellular organelles prone to the proteolytic degradation which is a natural step in development of the reticulocyte to the mature red cell. In this study we sought evidence of an active lipoxygenase in vivo. A bleeding anemia was induced in rabbits, and in the course of the subsequent reticulocytosis the red cell membranes were examined for the presence of the characteristic lipoxygenase products of linoleic and arachidonic acids. Erythrocyte membranes from control collections contained only small amounts of hydroxy fatty acids (0.03-0.08% of the polyenoic fatty acids). In contrast, reticulocyte-enriched red cells contained up to 3.3% of the polyenoic acids as hydroxylated derivatives. The main hydroxy fatty acid in reticulocyte membranes was identified as 13-L(S)-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid. Small amounts of other hydroxy derivatives including 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-(Z,Z,Z,E)eicosatetraenoic acid were also detected. These products appeared about 3 days after development of reticulocytosis. The precise structures of the hydroxylated polyenoic fatty acids and the time course of their appearance strongly suggest that their formation is due to the intracellular action of the cell-specific reticulocyte lipoxygenase. These findings are the first evidence for an activity of this enzyme in vivo, and the results support the hypothesis that enzymic peroxidation of reticulocyte intracellular membranes is a step in preparation of the intracellular organelles for proteolytic degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1565629087,"Two isozymes (E1 and E2) of human aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) were purified to homogeneity 13 years ago and a third isozyme (E3) with a low Km for gamma-aminobutyraldehyde only recently. Comparison with a variety of substrates demonstrates that substrate specificity of all three isozymes is broad and similar. With straight chain aliphatic aldehydes (C1-C6) the Km values of the E3 isozyme are identical with those of the E1 isozyme. All isozymes dehydrogenate naturally occurring aldehydes, 5-imidazoleacetaldehyde (histamine metabolite) and acrolein (product of beta-elimination of oxidized polyamines) with similar catalytic efficiency. Differences between the isozymes are in the Km values for aminoaldehydes. Although all isozymes can dehydrogenate gamma-aminobutyraldehyde, the Km value of the E3 isozyme is much lower: the same appears to apply to aldehyde metabolites of cadaverine, agmatine, spermidine, and spermine for which Km values range between 2-18 microM and kcat values between 0.8-1.9 mumol/min/mg. Thus, the E3 isozyme has properties which make it suitable for the metabolism of aminoaldehydes. The physiological role of E1 and E2 isozymes could be in dehydrogenation of aldehyde metabolites of monoamines such as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde or 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde; the catalytic efficiency with these substrates is better with E1 and E2 isozymes than with E3 isozyme. Isoelectric focusing of liver homogenates followed by development with various physiological substrates together with substrate specificity data suggest that aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) is the only enzyme in the human liver capable of catalyzing dehydrogenation of aldehydes arising via monoamine, diamine, and plasma amine oxidases. Although the enzyme is generally considered to function in detoxication, our data suggest an additional function in metabolism of biogenic amines."
https://openalex.org/W1486425970,"A thermostable, acid proteolytic activity has been found to be associated with the cells and in the culture medium of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, an archaebacterium. This acid protease, which has been named thermopsin, was purified to homogeneity from the culture medium by a five-step procedure including column chromatographies on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, Sephadex G-100, monoQ (fast protein liquid chromatography), and gel filtration (high pressure liquid chromatography). The purified thermopsin produced a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the proteolytic activity was associated with the band. Thermopsin is a single-chain protein as indicated by gel electrophoresis and by a single NH2-terminal sequence. It has maximal proteolytic activity at pH 2 and 90 degrees C. A genomic library of S. acidocaldarius was prepared and screened by an oligonucleotide probe designed from the NH2-terminal sequence of thermopsin. Five positive clones were isolated. From these clones the thermopsin gene was mapped and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence showed that the thermopsin structure is encoded in 1020 bases. In the deduced protein sequence, there are 41 amino acid residues (including the initiation Met) preceding the NH2-terminal position of thermopsin. Most of these residues appear to be characteristic of a leader sequence. However, the presence in this region of a short pro sequence cannot be ruled out. Thermopsin contains a single cysteine at residue 237 that is not essential for activity (Fusek, M., Lin, X.-L., Tang, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1496-1501. Thermopsin has no apparent sequence similarity to aspartic proteases of the pepsin family nor to pepstatin-insensitive acid protease (Maita, T., Nagata, S., Matsuda, G., Murata, S., Oda, K., Murao, S., and Tsura, D. (1984) J. Biochem. 95, 465-475) and thus may represent a new class of acid proteases. Also absent is the characteristic active site aspartyl sequence of aspartic proteases. There are 11 potential N-glycosylation sites on each thermopsin molecule. The molecular weight estimated from gel filtration (45,000) is larger than that calculated from the sequence (32,651), suggesting that thermopsin is the sequence (32,651), suggesting that thermopsin is glycosylated at at least some of these 11 sites."
https://openalex.org/W1953476296,"Translocation of phosphatidylinositol, which is synthesized on the outer aspect of the outer membrane of isolated yeast mitochondria, to the inner membrane is linked to phosphatidylinositol synthesis and is therefore a vectorial process. Phosphatidylinositol once integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane is not transferred back to the mitochondrial surface. Phosphatidylserine is also translocated from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is decarboxylated to phosphatidylethanolamine. We made use of this metabolic modification to characterize the intramitochondrial transfer of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Intramitochondrial phosphatidylserine transfer is insensitive to the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and to valinomycin and is thus independent of an electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane. Transfer of phosphatidylserine from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane occurs not only in intact mitochondria but also in mitoplasts which are devoid of intermembrane space proteins but have the outer membrane still adherent to the inner membrane. This result suggests that specific contact sites are involved in the intramitochondrial translocation of phospholipids. 3H-Labeled phosphatidylethanolamine synthesized from [3H]serine in isolated mitochondria is readily exported from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane without prior mixing with the pool of phosphatidylethanolamine of the inner membrane."

The USCE occurs between (TC)n tracts adjacent to alternating purine-pyrimidine tracts. We have investigated the capacity of both the donor regions and the recombinant product involved in this event to adopt left-handed Z-DNA and intramolecular triplexes. The results of chemical probing with diethylpyrocarbonate and osmium tetroxide at the base pair level demonstrate that under the influence of negative supercoiling the alternating purine-pyrimidine regions of these plasmids can adopt Z-DNA at neutral pH, and the oligopurine.oligopyrimidine (pur.pyr) regions of these regions can adopt intramolecular triplexes at low pH (less than or equal to pH 6.0). At intermediate pH values, mixtures of both structures are present. Increasing the negative superhelical density of the plasmid does not increase the amount of triplex present at neutral pH indicating that the presence of long Z-DNA segments adjacent to pur.pyr tract prevents intramolecular triplex formation. In summary, we conclude that the sequences involved in the USCE can form either an intramolecular triplex in the (TC)n tract or Z-DNA in the alternating purine-pyrimidine tract and that Z-DNA will predominate under physiological conditions. The presence of segments which adopt Z-DNA at a site of USCE suggests that formation of this structure may enhance recombination between adjacent pur.pyr tracts."
https://openalex.org/W1486372651,"p-Aminobenzoate, a component of the vitamin folate, is one of seven compounds derived from the aromatic precursor chorismate in Escherichia coli. Historically the gene products of pabA and pabB were assumed to be sufficient for de novo p-aminobenzoate biosynthesis. Recent studies, however, have shown that these proteins, as nonidentical subunits of a single enzyme, act on chorismate to form a diffusible intermediate, most likely 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate. This intermediate is then converted to p-aminodeoxychorismate lyase (Nichols, B. P., Seibold, A. S., and Doktor, S. Z. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8597-8601). Here we describe partial characterization of the intermediate and the purification of aminodeoxychorismate lyase 4100-fold to near homogeneity. Further purification of this enzyme by high pressure liquid chromatography permitted isolation of a pure sample that yielded N-terminal sequence. A 64-fold redundant oligonucleotide probe was used to identify a lambda clone containing the gene encoding aminodeoxychorismate lyase. The aminodeoxychorismate lyase gene, designated pabC, was mapped to 25 min on the E. coli chromosome and lies on a 7.5-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment. A strain harboring a pACYC184 recombinant containing pabC overproduced aminodeoxychorismate lyase activity 77-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1514449664,"In this study we report a kinetic model for the alpha-thrombin-catalyzed production of fibrin I and fibrin II at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C, gamma/2 0.17. The fibrin is produced by the action of human alpha-thrombin on plasma levels of human fibrinogen in the presence of the major inhibitor of alpha-thrombin in plasma, antithrombin III (AT). This model quantitatively accounts for the time dependence of alpha-thrombin-catalyzed release of fibrinopeptides A and B concurrent with the inactivation of alpha-thrombin by AT and delineates the concerted interactions of alpha-thrombin, fibrin(ogen), and AT during the production of a fibrin clot. The model also provides a method for estimating the concentration of alpha-thrombin required to produce a clot of known composition and predicts a direct relationship between the plasma concentration of fibrinogen and the amount of fibrin produced by a bolus of alpha-thrombin. The predicted relationship between the concentration of fibrinogen and the amount of fibrin produced in plasma provides a plausible explanation for the observed linkage between plasma concentrations of fibrinogen and the risk for ischemic heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W1498358597,"Proteolysis experiments of ABP-120 from Dictyostelium discoideum have previously demonstrated that removal of residues 89-115 from a tryptic peptide which retains actin binding activity, abolishes actin binding (Bresnick, A. R., Warren, V., and Condeelis, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9236-9240). Antibodies made against a synthetic peptide of this 27-amino acid sequence (27-mer) specifically immunoprecipitate native ABP-120 from Dictyostelium high speed supernatants, demonstrating that the 27-mer sequence is on the surface of the molecule as expected for an active site. ABP-120 is inhibited in its binding to F-actin by Fab' fragments of the anti-27-mer IgG. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at an approximate molar ratio of 7 Fab' fragments/ABP-120 monomer. Viscoelastic measurements indicate that ABP-120 forms fewer cross-links with F-actin in the presence of the 27-mer synthetic peptide than in its absence. In F-actin cosedimentation assays, the binding of ABP-120 to actin is inhibited by the 27-mer synthetic peptide. Furthermore, the 27-mer synthetic peptide cosediments with F-actin, whereas a control hydrophobic peptide and a synthetic peptide of residues 69-88 of ABP-120 do not cosediment with F-actin. These observations suggest a direct involvement of the 27-mer sequence in the actin binding activity of ABP-120."

We have purified and characterized a peptide that contains this phosphoserine. The peptide was generated by chymotryptic and thermolytic digestion and was isolated by gel filtration, Fe3+ affinity chromatography, and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Its sequence, Leu-Glu-Leu-Ser(PO4)-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Ser-Lys-Ala-Ser-(Xaa)-Ile-Asn-Glu-Thr- Gln-Pro-Pro-Gln, shows that the Ser(PO4) is in an acidic environment, as is typical for casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. The hydrophobic repeat typical of alpha-helical coiled-coils is absent, suggesting that the sequence is part of a non-helical tail piece of the heavy chain. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1-9 is shown to be an effective substrate for casein kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W1641226980,"Repeated dissociation of the approximately 3600-kDa hexagonal bilayer extracellular hemoglobin of Lumbricus terrestris in 4 M urea followed by gel filtration at neutral pH produces a subunit that retains the oxygen affinity of the native molecule (approximately 12 torr), but only two-thirds of the cooperativity (nmax = 2.1 +/- 0.2 versus 3.3 +/- 0.3). The mass of this subunit was estimated to be 202 +/- 15 kDa by gel filtration and 202 +/- 26 kDa from mass measurements of unstained freeze-dried specimens by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this subunit showed that it consists predominantly of the heme-containing subunits M (chain I, 17 kDa) and T (disulfide-bonded chains II-IV, 50 kDa). Mixing of subunits M and T isolated concurrently with the 200-kDa subunit resulted in partial association into particles that had a mass of 191 +/- 13 kDa determined by gel filtration and 200 +/- 38 kDa determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy and whose oxygen affinity and cooperativity were the same as those of the 200-kDa subunit. The results imply that the 200-kDa subunit is a dodecamer of globin chains, consisting of three copies each of subunits M and T (3 x chains (I + II + III + IV], in good agreement with the mass of 209 kDa calculated from the amino acid sequences of the four chains, and represents the largest functional subunit of Lumbricus hemoglobin. Twelve copies of this subunit would account for two-thirds of the total mass of the molecule, as suggested earlier (Vinogradov, S. N., Lugo, S. L., Mainwaring, M. G., Kapp, O. H., and Crewe, A. V. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 8034-8038). The retention of only partial cooperativity by the 200-kDa subunit implies that full cooperativity is dependent on the presence of a complete hexagonal bilayer structure, wherein 12 200-kDa subunits are linked together by approximately 30-kDa heme-deficient chains."
https://openalex.org/W1605151226,"An endo-beta-xylosidase acting on the linkage region of peptidochondroitin sulfate was isolated from the mid-gut gland of the mollusc Patnopecten and purified about 375-fold, using a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200, and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. The pH optimum and the isoelectric point of this enzyme were 4.0 and 7.0, respectively. The molecular weight, estimated by gel filtration through Sephacryl S-200, was 78,000. The purified enzyme was completely free from protease, exoglycosidases, sulfatase, and phosphatase. This enzyme hydrolyzed the xylosyl serine linkage of the linkage region of various glycosaminoglycans, that is chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, all possessing a very small peptide segment, but not proteoglycans. It was concluded that this endo-beta-xylosidase was involved in the catabolism of proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1591168462,"We have mapped the regions of the glucocorticoid receptor important for killing the cells of a line of human leukemic lymphoblasts. The results show that the glucocorticoid response element-specific DNA binding domain is essential, and that only the sequence including the amino acids that subsume the first zinc finger through about half of the second zinc finger are absolutely necessary. Furthermore, in contrast to assays of receptor mutants for ability to increase gene transcription, deletion of the steroid binding domain results in a functionally constitutive receptor fully as active for cell kill as is the holoreceptor after addition of ligand. Deletion of most known transcription-activation, dimerization, ligand-binding, and nuclear translocation regions still leaves a receptor fragment highly potent for cell lethality. The results suggest that delivery systems for such a fragment could result in effective new therapies for certain malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1493325957,"Phosphate-activated glutaminase in intact pig renal mitochondria was inhibited 50-70% by the sulfhydryl reagents mersalyl and N-ethylmaleimide (0.3-1.0 mM), when assayed at pH 7.4 in the presence of no or low phosphate (10 mM) and glutamine (2 mM). However, sulfhydryl reagents added to intact mitochondria did not inhibit the SH-enzyme beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (a marker of the inner face of the inner mitochondrial membrane), but did so upon addition to sonicated mitochondria. This indicates that the sulfhydryl reagents are impermeable to the inner membrane and that regulatory sulfhydryl groups for glutaminase have an external localization here. The inhibition observed when sulfhydryl reagents were added to intact mitochondria could not be attributed to an effect on a phosphate carrier, but evidence was obtained that pig renal mitochondria have also a glutamine transporter, which is inhibited only by mersalyl and not by N-ethylmaleimide. Mersalyl and N-ethylmaleimide showed nondistinguishable effects on the kinetics of glutamine hydrolysis, affecting only the apparent Vmax for glutamine and not the apparent Km calculated from linear Hanes-Woolf plots. Furthermore, both calcium (which activates glutamine hydrolysis), as well as alanine (which has no effect on the hydrolytic rate), inhibited glutamine transport into the mitochondria, indicating that transport of glutamine is not rate-limiting for the glutaminase reaction. Desenzitation to inhibition by mersalyl and N-ethylmaleimide occurred when the assay was performed under optimal conditions for phosphate activated glutaminase (i.e. in the presence of 150 mM phosphate, 20 mM glutamine and at pH 8.6). Desenzitation also occurred when the enzyme was incubated with low concentrations of Triton X-100 which did not affect the rate of glutamine hydrolysis. Following incubation with [14C]glutamine and correction for glutamate in contaminating subcellular particles, the specific activity of [14C]glutamate in the mitochondria was much lower than that of the surrounding incubation medium. This indicates that glutamine-derived glutamate is released from the mitochondria without being mixed with the endogenous pool of glutamate. The results suggest that phosphate-activated glutaminase has a functionally predominant external localization in the inner mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1674631930,"The EcoRII endonuclease cleaves DNA containing the sequence CC(A/T)GG before the first cytosine. The methylation of the second cytosine in the sequence by either the EcoRII methylase or Dcm, a chromosomally coded protein in Escherichia coli, inhibits the cleavage. The gene for the EcoRII endonuclease was mapped by analysis of derivatives containing linker insertions, transposon insertions, and restriction fragment deletions. Surprisingly, plasmids carrying the wild-type endonuclease gene and the EcoRII methylase gene interrupted by transposon insertions appeared to be lethal to dcm+ strains of E. coli. We conclude that not all the EcoRII/Dcm recognition sites in the cellular DNA are methylated in dcm+ strains. The DNA sequence of a 1650-base pair fragment containing the endonuclease gene was determined. It revealed an open reading frame that could code for a 45.6-kDa protein. This predicted size is consistent with the known size of the endonuclease monomer (44 kDa). The endonuclease and methylase genes appear to be transcribed convergently from separate promoters. The reading frame of the endonuclease gene was confirmed at three points by generating random protein fusions between the endonuclease and beta-galactosidase, followed by an analysis of the sequence at the junctions. One of these fusions is missing 18 COOH-terminal amino acids of the endonuclease but still displays significant ability to restrict incoming phage in addition to beta-galactosidase activity. No striking similarity between the sequence of the endonuclease and any other protein in the PIR data base was found. The knowledge of the primary sequence of the endonuclease and the availability of the various constructs involving its gene should be helpful in the study of the interaction of the enzyme with its substrate DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1528234579,"Toxin production in a large number of Pyrenophora teres isolates have been investigated. During fungal growth, the pH of the medium decreases from 6.5 to about 3.0. Aspergillomarasmine A is the major toxin excreted into the culture medium. Nonenzymatic acid-catalyzed conversion of aspergillomarasmine A to anhydroaspergillomarasmine A proceeds at low pH and is prevented by repeated titration of the culture medium to pH 6.5. The four possible stereoisomers of N-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)aspartic acid have been chemically synthesized and their absolute configuration determined. From circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy and by measurements of specific optical rotation, the LL-form is identified as the stereoisomer produced by P. teres. Biosynthetic experiments using radioisotopes demonstrate that the LL-isomer of N-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl) aspartic acid is a direct precursor of aspergillomarasmine A. Consequently, L-configuration is assigned to the two corresponding asymmetric carbon atoms of aspergillomarasmine A. This is in contrast to earlier reports which had indicated D configuration. The phytotoxicity of anhydroaspergillomarasmine A is comparable with that of L-aspartic acid, whereas LL-N-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)aspartic acid exerts strong phytotoxicity in the bioassays as shown previously for aspergillomarasmine A. The amount of LL-N-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)aspartic acid which accumulates in the P. teres cultures is low, indicating that aspergillomarasmine A is the toxin which plays the major role in the pathological changes associated with the barley net-spot blotch disease."
https://openalex.org/W2167121410,"Immune complexes (ICs) induce an initial transient increase in cytosolic intracellular calcium [( Ca2+]in) levels in human neutrophils (PMN). Changes in PMN [Ca2+]in were measured with the fluorescent calcium indicator Indo-1 ( [1-[2-amino-5-(6-carboxylindol-2-yl]-phenoxyl]-2-(2'-amino-5 '- methylphenoxy]ethane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid), at the level of individual cells by flow cytometry. Two kinds of immune complexes (ICs) were used in this study: an insoluble (IIC) and a more soluble less valent immune complex (SIC) with fewer available Fc receptor binding ends per molecule of SIC than IIC. Simultaneous binding and activation studies performed on the flow cytometer with fluoresceinated IIC or SIC demonstrated that a majority of the cells bound each stimulus uniformly. However, only an IC dose-dependent proportion of those IC-bound cells responded with an increase in [Ca2+]in. Analysis of Indo-1 fluorescence signals from neutrophils exposed to IIC, corrected for the contribution of the nonresponding population, indicated that every dose of IIC elicited a similar maximum [Ca+2]in within the responding population. In contrast, the magnitude of the increase in [Ca2+]in elicited by low doses of SIC did become dependent on dose. Cells treated with pertussis toxin and exposed to IIC exhibited a normal [Ca2+]in response both in magnitude and expression. Therefore, [Ca2+]in responses induced by immune complexes are expressed by subpopulations of PMN, in a response which is dependent on the valency of the stimulus. In addition, pertussis toxin sensitive G protein(s) appear not to have a major role in IIC-induced [Ca2+]in changes, membrane potential changes, production of superoxide anions, and elastase release."
https://openalex.org/W2150819625,"Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have changed the asparagine in human single-chain urinary plasminogen activator (u-PA) at position 302 to an alanine. This alteration removes the only known amino acid residue glycosylated in the protein. The single-chain u-PA containing an alanine residue at position 302 instead of asparagine (scu-PA(N302A] cDNA gene was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Secretion of the protein product into the culture broth was achieved by replacing the human secretion signal codons with those from yeast invertase, adding a yeast promoter from the constitutively expressed glycolytic genes triosephosphate isomerase or phosphoglycerate kinase, and integrating multiple copies of these transcriptional units into the genome of yeast strains carrying the supersecreting mutation ssc1. When fermented in a fed-batch mode, these recombinant baker's yeast strains secreted scu-PA(N302A) in a strongly growth-associated manner. Greater than 90% of the u-PA found in the culture broth was in the single-chain form. Scu-PA(N302A) was purified to homogeneity using two chromatography steps. The purified protein had a molecular weight of 47,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and lacked any detectable N-linked glycosylation. The in vitro fibrinolytic properties of scu-PA(N302A) were found to be essentially equivalent to those of natural single-chain u-PA derived from the human kidney cell line TCL-598. Since scu-PA(N302A) lacks the immunogenic N-linked carbohydrate pattern of yeast, it may be a useful therapeutic agent which can be produced economically by yeast fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W1496279789,"The specificity of HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus-1) protease has been evaluated relative to its ability to cleave the three-domain Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE66) and related proteins in which the first domain has been deleted or replaced by a segment of CD4. Native PE66 is not hydrolyzed by the HIV-1 protease. However, removal of its first domain produces a molecule which is an excellent substrate for the enzyme. The major site of cleavage in this truncated exotoxin, called LysPE40, occurs in a segment that connects its two major domains, the translocation domain (II), and the ADP-ribosyltransferase (III). This interdomain region contains the sequence ...Asn-Tyr-Pro-Thr... which is similar to that surrounding the scissile Tyr-Pro bond in the gag precursor polyprotein, a natural substrate of the HIV-1 protease. Nevertheless, it is not this sequence that is recognized and cleaved by the enzyme, but one 6 residues away, ...Ala-Leu-Leu-Glu... in which the Leu-Leu peptide bond is hydrolyzed. A second, slower cleavage takes place at the Leu-Ala bond 3 residues in from the NH2 terminus of LysPE40. When domain I of PE66 is replaced by a segment comprising the first two domains of CD4, the resulting chimeric protein is hydrolyzed at the same Leu-Leu bond by HIV-1 protease. Enzyme activities toward synthetic peptides modeled after the sequences defined above in LysPE40 are in complete accord, relative to specificity, kinetics, and pH optimum, with results obtained in the hydrolysis of the parent protein. These findings demonstrate that ideas concerning the specificity of the HIV-1 protease that are based solely upon its processing of natural viral polyproteins can be expanded by evaluation of other multidomain proteins as substrates. Moreover, it would appear that it is not a particular conformation, but sequence and accessibility that play the dominant role in defining sites in a protein substrate that are susceptible to hydrolysis by the enzyme."

The affinities of the photolabels for adenylyl cyclase were determined by their inhibition of [3H]forskolin binding to bovine brain membranes. 6-AIPP-Fsk and 7-AIPP-Fsk inhibited [3H]forskolin binding with IC50 values of 15 nM and 200 nM, respectively. 125I-6-AIPP-Fsk labeled a 115-kDa protein in control and GTP gamma S-preactivated bovine brain membranes. This labeling was inhibited by forskolin but not by 1,9-dideoxyforskolin or cytochalasin B. 125I-6-AIPP-Fsk labeling of partially purified adenylyl cyclase was inhibited by forskolin but not by 1,9-dideoxyforskolin. 125I-7-AIPP-Fsk specifically labeled a 45-kDa protein and not a 115-kDa protein in control and GTP gamma S-preactivated brain membranes. This labeling was inhibited by forskolin, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, cytochalasin B, and D-glucose but not cytochalasin E or L-glucose.

It was purified and studied by mass spectrometry. Electrospray ionization of its abnormal beta-chain indicated a 70-Da mass increase. Separation of the trytic digest by reversed-phase liquid chromatography revealed an abnormal beta T1 peptide. Cesium ion bombardment ionization produced a protonated molecular ion at m/z 1022.516, showing an additional C3H2O2 residue to normal beta T1. The amino acid sequences of both abnormal and normal beta T1 peptides were found identical by comparison of their collision activation spectra. Time course hydrolysis of abnormal beta T1 indicated a rapid loss of the modifying group, leading to normal beta T1. At least, mild treatment with acidic methanol showed an additional methylated site, comparatively with normal beta T1. All these results are consistent with a ketimine-linked pyruvic acid at the amino end of the beta-chain of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1578743341,"The effects of cations and glycerol on the dissociation induced by pressure and on the reassembly of Glossoscolex paulistus hemoglobin were examined by light scattering, gel filtration, and electron microscopy. Calcium stabilized the quaternary structure of the hemoglobin against pressure dissociation. In the presence of 50 mM Ca2+, the half-dissociation pressure (p 1/2) increased by 400 bar, which corresponds to an average stabilization of -0.62 kcal/mol of dissociating subunit. Calcium also promoted a large increase in the yield of recovery of fully assembled hemoglobin at the expense of the partially dissociated (one-twelfth subunit) and fully dissociated forms. Glycerol protected the hemoglobin from pressure dissociation, increasing the half-dissociation pressure (p 1/2) and promoted an increase in the yield of recovery of fully assembled hemoglobin by about 40%. Addition of calcium after return to atmospheric pressure increased recovery of the fully associated form only in a long time scale (many days). The existence of time-dependent changes in the conformation of the dissociated subunits is suggested to explain the partial association to one-twelfth subaggregates (drifted forms) that lack the ability to reassemble to native hemoglobin. The promotion of reassembly by nonprotein factors (calcium and glycerol) is suggested to occur by preventing the formation of wrong intermediate forms (drifted one-twelfth subunits)."
https://openalex.org/W1484319291,"The molecular action of ricin A chain involves cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond between ribose and the adenine 4324 nucleotides from the 5' end of mammalian 28 S rRNA (Endo, Y., and Tsurugi, K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8128-8130). In this paper, four ricin- and abrin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants that possess ribosomes resistant to this N-glycosidase action are described. Three of the mutant phenotypes, Lec26, Lec27, and Lec28, were recessive in somatic cell hybrids and define at least two new lectin-resistant complementation groups. The most extensively characterized mutant type, LEC17, was dominant in such hybrids. None of the mutants were cross-resistant to modeccin. Post-mitochondrial supernatants from each of the four mutants were resistant to inhibition of cell-free protein synthesis by ricin, ricin A chain, and abrin. In addition, polysomes isolated from mutant cells were resistant to cleavage of the adenine-ribose N-glycosidic bond by ricin A chain or abrin, as assayed by the release of an approximately 470-nucleotide fragment following aniline treatment of ribosomal RNA extracted from toxin-treated polysomes. The unique lectin-resistance properties of the different mutants suggests that the accessibility of adenine 4324 to each toxin differs. It seems likely that the recessive Chinese hamster ovary ribosomal mutants reflect structural changes in different ribosomal proteins while the dominant phenotype may be due to the modification of protein(s) or rRNA involved in toxin-ribosome interaction. Further analysis of these cell lines should provide new insights into the structure/function relationships of eukaryotic ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1686884193,"The potential for altering the specificity of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase toward gaseous substrates is explored through a modest perturbation of the active site microenvironment. Specifically, replacement of active site Glu-48 with carboxy-methylcysteine is achieved in a two-step process in which the catalytically incompetent Cys-48 mutant protein is first generated and then treated with iodoacetic acid. This regimen of concerted site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification, effectively lengthening the glutamyl side chain by insertion of a sulfur atom between the beta- and gamma-methylene groups, results in a protein possessing 4-6% of wild-type carboxylase activity. Concomitantly, the engineered enzyme exhibits a specificity factor 5-fold lower than that of wild-type enzyme. This represents the first example of a major change in substrate specificity, albeit in favor of oxygenation, effected by structural alteration of an active site side chain."

The A1 adenosine receptor was solubilized with digitonin from rat testicular membranes and then purified more than 25,000-fold by sequential use of affinity chromatography on xanthine amine congener-immobilized agarose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, re-affinity chromatography on xanthine amine congener-agarose, and finally gel permeation chromatography on TSK-3000SW. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the final preparation showed a single broad band of Mr 41,000 by autoradiography after radioiodination. This Mr 41,000 peptide was also specifically labeled with an A1 adenosine receptor affinity labeling reagent. A high affinity A1 adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-[3H]dipropylxanthine, bound saturably to the purified receptor with a KD of approximately 1.4 nM. The purified receptor also showed essentially the same specificity for adenosine agonists and antagonists as the unpurified receptor preparations, although the affinities of the purified adenosine receptor for agonists were significantly low compared to those of unpurified receptor preparations indicating that the purified A1 adenosine receptor exists as a low agonist-high antagonist affinity state. Deglycosylation of the purified testis adenosine A1 receptors with endoglycosidase F produced an increase in the mobility of the receptor protein to an apparent Mr 30,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, similar to that of deglycosylated A1 adenosine receptors of rat brain membranes. Peptide maps of the purified testis and brain A1 adenosine receptors using trypsin and V8 protease suggest that these receptors show some structural homologies."
https://openalex.org/W1502765874,"We have investigated the biogenesis of the biotin-binding alpha-subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (alpha PCC) in cultured Buffalo rat liver cells. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and the newly synthesized alpha PCC was immunoprecipitated with anti-alpha PCC antibodies and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Biotinylation of the alpha-subunit was detected by a mobility-shift assay following incubation with avidin. In the presence of biotin and the uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), alpha PCC precursor accumulated in the cytosol and was quantitatively biotinylated. Subsequent removal of the uncoupler in a chase protocol allowed the accumulated precursor to be translocated into mitochondria and cleaved to its mature form. When cells were grown in biotin-depleted medium and labeled in the presence of DNP, no biotinylation of the cytosolic precursor was observed. Nonetheless, the accumulated precursor was efficiently imported into mitochondria and cleaved to mature alpha PCC upon removal of the uncoupler. In parallel experiments in the absence of DNP, non-biotinylated mature alpha PCC accumulated in mitochondria; following addition of biotin, the apo-alpha PCC was converted rapidly to its holo-form. We conclude that both the alpha PCC precursor and its mature counterpart are competent for biotinylation and that biotinylated and nonbiotinylated alpha PCC precursor are competent for import by mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1523901972,"Past work identified and characterized an apparently novel protein kinase activity (designated HMK) that is highly and transiently stimulated in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells by nerve growth factor (NGF). In vitro, HMK phosphorylates both high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins and myelin basic protein. This study investigates the potential mechanisms of HMK regulation in intact PC12 cells and reveals the following. 1) HMK activation is independent of macromolecular synthesis while the subsequent post-induction suppression requires both RNA and protein synthesis. 2) Neither cAMP-dependent nor Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases appear to play a role in regulation of HMK activity by NGF. 3) In vitro, HMK activity is inactivated by protein phosphatase 2A. 4) In vivo, HMK activation by NGF is inhibited by the kinase inhibitor, K-252a. (5) Vanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induces HMK activity in intact cells, while okadaic acid, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, is much less efficacious. 6) Application of okadaic acid to vanadate-pretreated cells synergistically stimulates HMK activity to a level comparable to that achieved with NGF. (7) Activation of HMK by NGF is not significantly affected when cells are pretreated with okadaic acid. However, the subsequent NGF-promoted deactivation of HMK is greatly accelerated by okadaic acid. (8) NGF down-regulated HMK activity can be heterologously restimulated by exposure to vanadate and okadaic acid. These data suggest that phosphorylation plays a critical role in both the up- and down-regulation of HMK activity in NGF-treated cells. Moreover, suppression of HMK activity requires ongoing macromolecular synthesis and appears to occur by inactivation rather than degradation."

The interaction blocked the binding of the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody OKT4A and the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). DIDS inhibited the acute infection of CD4+ cells by HIV-1 with a potency (IC50 approximately 30 microM) similar to that which blocked gp120 binding (IC50 approximately 20 microM) to the cellular antigen. Pretreating uninfected CD4+ C8166 cells with DIDS blocked their fusion with chronically infected gp120+ cells. DIDS covalently and selectively modified lysine 90 of soluble CD4 and abolished the gp120-binding and antiviral properties of the recombinant protein. When added to cells productively infected with HIV-1, DIDS blocked virus growth and cleared cultures of syncytia without inhibiting cellular proliferation. The stilbene disulfonic acids are a novel class of site-specific CD4 antagonists that block multiple CD4-dependent events associated with acute and established HIV-1 infections."
https://openalex.org/W1491073116,"Human skin fibroblasts express, in addition to versican, a second large chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, which has been investigated with the aid of a specific antiserum in cultures of fetal fibroblasts. Its core protein, obtained after chondroitin ABC lyase treatment, exhibits an apparent molecular mass of about 740 kDa in the absence of a reducing agent whereas reduction produces two core proteins of 460 and 300 kDa, respectively. Both subunits carry one or very few dermatan sulfate chains of about 20 kDa which are of similar chemical composition irrespective of the type of subunits to which they are attached. Tryptic peptide maps of [35S]methionine-labeled core proteins indicated that both subunits are related neither to each other nor to versican, suggesting that the proteoglycan exists predominantly as a heterodimeric molecule. It is insensitive to collagenase and does not interact with hyaluronan. Pulse-chase experiments suggested that the core proteins are different gene products. Dimerization begins soon after core protein synthesis but requires more than 2 h for completion. Glycosaminoglycan synthesis occurs immediately prior to secretion. A small proportion of both subunits may be secreted in form of a monomeric proteoglycan. The heterodimeric proteoglycan is a major proteoglycan species of fetal fibroblasts. The secreted product represents 10-20% of [35S]methionine and about 5-10% of [35S]sulfate incorporated into secreted proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1508929518,"Isolation and biochemical analysis of the components involved in protein translocation into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) requires starting material highly enriched in membranes derived from this organelle. We have chosen to study the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to profit from the ease of genetic manipulation. To date, however, no efficient scheme has been devised that allows the purification of functional rough ER-derived membranes from yeast, largely because proteins have yet to be identified that are rough ER-specific. In the experiments described here, we expressed the human rough ER marker ribophorin I to facilitate the analysis of subcellular fractionation. We found that the endoplasmic reticulum of yeast could be separated into two distinct domains by fractionation on continuous sucrose gradients. This procedure revealed a bimodal distribution of ER markers. The yeast homologue of the heavy chain-binding protein, BiP (encoded by the KAR2 gene), and the product of the SEC62 gene were present in two fractions having equilibrium densities of 1.146 and 1.192 g/ml, respectively. In contrast, our analysis showed that preprotein translocation activity and retention of the rough ER-specific protein ribophorin I were specific only to the membrane fraction with an equilibrium density of 1.192 g/ml. To prepare fractions highly enriched in translocation competent rough ER-derived membranes for analysis, we developed a density shift fractionation scheme that optimizes the purity of membranes containing human ribophorin I. Membranes obtained by this method were found to possess the majority of the appropriate functional markers, including ATP-independent preprotein binding, ribosome binding, and post-translational translocation. Mitochondria, the major contaminant of the 1.192 g/ml fraction, were significantly depleted in density-shifted membrane populations."

(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 13091-13096], the 50-kDa disulfide-bonded trimer (chains II-IV), the monomer (chain I), and the approximately 30-kDa linker (chains VA, VB, and VI), were measured following photolysis over time scales ranging from picosecond to millisecond. CO recombination at 436 nm subsequent to excitation (9 ns) at 532 nm showed three phases covering a 100-fold range for the Hb, dodecamer, trimer, and linker protein. The proportion of the fast phase was 0.1-0.2 for the trimer, dodecamer, and Hb. The relative rates and amplitudes of the phases were not affected by changes in CO concentration or excitation intensity. The monomer showed a single phase with a rate of 2 x 10(6) M-1 s-1. The second-order reaction with NO showed two rates. The faster rate was 90 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 and accounted for approximately 0.7 of the reaction for all species except the monomer, where it accounted for the full reaction. The slower rate was 15 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 for all species except the monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1507973860,"We have monitored the level of mRNA encoding the glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzyme trisephosphate isomerase (TPI) during the growth arrest of cells by serum deprivation and the subsequent growth activation of cells by serum addition. This analysis has demonstrated that the steady state level of TPI mRNA changes 5-20-fold, depending upon the cell type, during the transversal of cells from a proliferative to a nonproliferative state and vice versa. These changes are largely attributable to changes in the rate of TPI gene transcription rather than to alterations in post-transcriptional processes as determined by nuclear run-on measurements. Following serum stimulation, the increase in TPI gene expression is maximal at or around the onset of DNA synthesis. We have also quantitated TPI mRNA throughout the cell cycle following cell synchronization with aphidicolin. Our results indicate that the steady state level of TPI mRNA is relatively constant throughout the division cycle of proliferating cells. Thus, while TPI gene expression is modulated during the traversal of cells to and from a nonproliferative state, it is not significantly modulated during the cycle of events that is characteristic of continuously proliferating cells."
https://openalex.org/W1508325988,"Liver ganglioside patterns of eight rat strains were classified according to two phenotypes: SHR type, characterized by predominance of b-series gangliosides (GD1b, GT1b, GQ1b), and DA type, characterized by predominance of a-series gangliosides (GM1, GD1a). Comparison of ganglioside pattern expressed in the liver of F1 hybrids and backcross F2 hybrids indicated that SHR type is controlled by a single autosomal-dominant gene which probably determines the expression of sialytransferase 2 activity for synthesis of GD3 from GM3."
