https://openalex.org/W2014182955,"Background The neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) includes loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, nitrated α-synuclein (N-α-Syn) enriched intraneuronal inclusions or Lewy bodies and neuroinflammation. While the contribution of innate microglial inflammatory activities to disease are known, evidence for how adaptive immune mechanisms may affect the course of PD remains obscure. We reasoned that PD-associated oxidative protein modifications create novel antigenic epitopes capable of peripheral adaptive T cell responses that could affect nigrostriatal degeneration. Methods and Findings Nitrotyrosine (NT)-modified α-Syn was detected readily in cervical lymph nodes (CLN) from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxicated mice. Antigen-presenting cells within the CLN showed increased surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, initiating the molecular machinery necessary for efficient antigen presentation. MPTP-treated mice produced antibodies to native and nitrated α-Syn. Mice immunized with the NT-modified C-terminal tail fragment of α-Syn, but not native protein, generated robust T cell proliferative and pro-inflammatory secretory responses specific only for the modified antigen. T cells generated against the nitrated epitope do not respond to the unmodified protein. Mice deficient in T and B lymphocytes were resistant to MPTP-induced neurodegeneration. Transfer of T cells from mice immunized with N-α-Syn led to a robust neuroinflammatory response with accelerated dopaminergic cell loss. Conclusions These data show that NT modifications within α-Syn, can bypass or break immunological tolerance and activate peripheral leukocytes in draining lymphoid tissue. A novel mechanism for disease is made in that NT modifications in α-Syn induce adaptive immune responses that exacerbate PD pathobiology. These results have implications for both the pathogenesis and treatment of this disabling neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W2014059210,"Experimental studies have observed Long Term synaptic Potentiation (LTP) when a presynaptic neuron fires shortly before a postsynaptic neuron, and Long Term Depression (LTD) when the presynaptic neuron fires shortly after, a phenomenon known as Spike Timing Dependant Plasticity (STDP). When a neuron is presented successively with discrete volleys of input spikes STDP has been shown to learn ‘early spike patterns’, that is to concentrate synaptic weights on afferents that consistently fire early, with the result that the postsynaptic spike latency decreases, until it reaches a minimal and stable value. Here, we show that these results still stand in a continuous regime where afferents fire continuously with a constant population rate. As such, STDP is able to solve a very difficult computational problem: to localize a repeating spatio-temporal spike pattern embedded in equally dense ‘distractor’ spike trains. STDP thus enables some form of temporal coding, even in the absence of an explicit time reference. Given that the mechanism exposed here is simple and cheap it is hard to believe that the brain did not evolve to use it."
https://openalex.org/W2165461758,"Natamycin is a polyene antibiotic that is commonly used as an antifungal agent because of its broad spectrum of activity and the lack of development of resistance. Other polyene antibiotics, like nystatin and filipin are known to interact with sterols, with some specificity for ergosterol thereby causing leakage of essential components and cell death. The mode of action of natamycin is unknown and is investigated in this study using different in vitro and in vivo approaches. Isothermal titration calorimetry and direct binding studies revealed that natamycin binds specifically to ergosterol present in model membranes. Yeast sterol biosynthetic mutants revealed the importance of the double bonds in the B-ring of ergosterol for the natamycin-ergosterol interaction and the consecutive block of fungal growth. Surprisingly, in strong contrast to nystatin and filipin, natamycin did not change the permeability of the yeast plasma membrane under conditions that growth was blocked. Also, in ergosterol containing model membranes, natamycin did not cause a change in bilayer permeability. This demonstrates that natamycin acts via a novel mode of action and blocks fungal growth by binding specifically to ergosterol.

Fungal infections have recently become a growing threat to human health, especially in persons whose immune systems are compromised (for example, by human immunodeficiency virus and cancer chemotherapy). Only a few effective antifungal agents are currently in use; these include the polyenes, the fluorocytes, and the azole derivatives. One important problem is the increase of drug resistance, particularly against azole antimyotics and fluorocytosine (1Ghannoum M.A. Rice L.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 501-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance against polyene antibiotics is still a rare event, which makes these antibiotics particularly interesting as antifungal agents. The polyene antibiotics have a ring structure in which a conjugated double bond system is located opposite to a number of hydroxyl functions. Often a mycosamine group is present in combination with a carboxyl moiety, rendering the molecule amphoteric (Fig. 1). In the past convincing evidence has been presented that several members of this class of antibiotics target sterols and in particular ergosterol, the abundant and main sterol of fungal membranes (2Kruijff de B. Demel R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 339: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 3Bolard J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 257-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Different types of polyene antibiotics were shown to have different modes of action despite that they share a common target. The larger polyenes like amphotericin B and nystatin form pores together with ergosterol in the plasma membrane that collapse vital ion gradients, thereby killing the cells. The smaller uncharged filipin also destroys the membrane barrier, but by a completely different mechanism. Filipin forms large complexes with sterols between the leaflets of the lipid bilayer, resulting in loss of the barrier function (2Kruijff de B. Demel R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 339: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Natamycin (also called pimaricin) is a very effective member of the polyene antibiotic family with a large standing record of applications. It is produced by Streptomyces natalensis and used against fungal infections, but it is also widely utilized in the food industry to prevent mold contamination of cheese and other nonsterile foods (e.g. cured meats) (4Aparicio J.F. Colina A.J. Ceballos E. Martin J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10133-10139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the mechanism of action of this antifungal agent is still unknown and it is even unknown whether it targets ergosterol in the fungal membrane. It is relatively small while it contains a tetraene compared with a pentaene in filipin, which is already considered as a small polyene antibiotic (Fig. 1). It contains a mycosamine group that renders it amphoteric, which is a feature that is also present in nystatin. Whereas natamycin has similar features of both filipin (small) and nystatin (amphoteric), it is difficult to predict its mechanism of action. We wanted to gain more insight into the mode of action of natamycin, which could in turn help to develop new or improved antifungal formulations or result in novel strategies to prevent fungal spoilage. To determine the interaction of natamycin with membranes in relation to its sterol composition, we tested in a comparative manner using filipin and nystatin as references, the interaction of natamycin with phosphatidylcholine model membranes of varying sterol composition using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) 2The abbreviations used are:ITCisothermal titration calorimetryDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineCFDA-SE5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl esterHPTS8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium saltDDAON,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxideMICminimum inhibitory concentrationCFcarboxyfluoresceinLUVslarge unilamellar vesiclesMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and other binding studies. In addition, the ability of natamycin to permeabilize these model membranes was studied. isothermal titration calorimetry 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide minimum inhibitory concentration carboxyfluorescein large unilamellar vesicles 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Parallel to the studies performed on model membranes, the effect of natamycin on yeast growth, the binding of the antibiotic with intact yeast cells, and the plasma membrane integrity were determined. These studies were performed using strains that carry specific mutations in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway (ergΔ) or that were reprogrammed to contain cholesterol as the main sterol (5Heese-Peck A. Pichler H. Zanolari B. Watanabe R. Daum G. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2664-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We could demonstrate that, differently from any other polyene antibiotic of which the mode of action is known, natamycin blocks fungal growth by binding specifically to ergosterol, but without permeabilizing the membrane. Chemicals—1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Ergosterol was purchased from Larodan AB (Sweden). DOPC or sterols were dissolved in chloroform to a stock concentration of 20 mm. The phospholipid concentration of DOPC was determined by phosphate analysis according to Rouser et al. (6Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). The polyene antibiotics nystatin and filipin were dissolved in Me2SO, whereas natamycin was dissolved in 85:15 Me2SO/H2O (v/v); all were obtained from Sigma. All antibiotic solutions were prepared freshly before the start of an experiment and the concentrations of the polyene antibiotics were determined by UV absorption on a PerkinElmer UV-visible spectrometer (Lambda 18). The molar extinction coefficients of the polyene antibiotics were determined in methanol to be 7.6 × 104 m-1 cm-1 (318 nm), 6.7 × 104 m-1 cm-1 (318 nm), and 8.5 × 104 m-1 cm-1 (356 nm) for natamycin, nystatin, and filipin, respectively. The molar extinction coefficient of ergosterol was measured in methanol to be 0.97 × 104 m-1 cm-1 (262 nm). The ionophore nigericin (dissolved in ethanol), ampicillin sodium salt, and the amino acids adenine, uracil, and l-tryptophan were obtained from Sigma. 5-(and -6)-Carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE) (dissolved in Me2SO) and 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) were both purchased from Invitrogen. N,N-Dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide (DDAO) was bought from Fluka Biochimica (Buchs). All other chemicals used were of analytical or reagent grade. Strains and Growth Conditions—For all experiments, medium was inoculated directly from plates with colonies that were not older than 2 weeks. Unless otherwise mentioned, cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in rich medium (10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter Bacto-peptone, and 20 g/liter dextrose with 1 g/liter adenine, 2 g/liter uracil, and 1 g/liter tryptophan (YPUADT)) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. For strains RH6611 and RH6613 SD medium was used (1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 20 g/liter glucose, 2 mg/liter trace components, 5 g/liter ammonium sulfate) supplemented with vitamins and the appropriate amino acids minus histidine and leucine (SD-His-Leu).

Riezman, submitted for publication Open table in a new tab MIC Value Determinations—Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by diluting the polyene antibiotics in YPUADT (with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin) to concentrations of 400, 350, 300, and 250 μm of which 100 μl was added to the first row of a 96-well suspension culture plate (U-form, Greiner Bio One). This was followed by a 1:1 dilution series in medium. Overnight cultures were diluted back to an A600 0.0001, of which 100 μl was added to the culture plate. The total volume per well was 200 μl. Strains RH6611 and RH6613 (in SD-His-Leu medium) were diluted to an A600 0.01, because they had a very slow growth rate. The MIC value was determined to be the lowest concentration of antibiotic, which inhibits the growth of the yeast strain and could be determined by eye on the 96-well plate after an incubation of 24 h at 30 °C. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUVs)—LUVs with a mean diameter of 200 nm were prepared using the following protocol. Aqueous phospholipid suspensions were prepared by premixing ergosterol or cholesterol with DOPC in the desired molar ratios as solutions in chloroform and evaporating the solvent in a stream of nitrogen, followed by drying the lipid film for 20 min under vacuum. Sterols were present in a range of 10 to 30 mol %. All following handlings were performed at 50 °C. The lipid film was hydrated and repeatedly vortexed until all lipid was removed from the walls of the test tube. Then a freeze-thaw cycle was repeated eight times using liquid nitrogen and a water bath. Subsequently, the lipid suspension was extruded 8 times through a polycarbonate membrane filter with a pore size of 0.2 μm (Whatman International). The size of the vesicles was determined after extrusion by using the Zetasizer 3000 (Malvern Instruments). The average of the size of the vesicles was 168 ± 3.7 nm for vesicles without sterols, 165 ± 1.2 nm for vesicles with 10% cholesterol, and 173 ± 8 nm for vesicles with 10% ergosterol. Thus no significant differences in size were observed. The resulting vesicle suspension was stored at 4 °C. The final phospholipid concentration was determined by phosphate analysis according to Rouser et al. (6Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). ITC Measurements—Titration experiments were carried out on a MCS titration calorimeter from Microcal Inc. LUVs were prepared as described above in 50 mm MES, 100 mm K2SO4, pH 6.0, or 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Similar results were obtained with the different buffers. The vesicles were injected into a sample cell (volume = 1.345 ml) containing 50 μm antibiotic in the same buffer as used for the vesicle suspension. Because the polyene antibiotics are dissolved in Me2SO, an equal amount was added to the LUV suspension to compensate for any heat generated by dilution of this solvent. No more than 1% Me2SO was present. The solutions were degassed, before the start of the titration. The experiments consisted of 44 injections, 5 μl each, of a stock solution of vesicles at 25 °C (8 mm final phospholipid concentration). The results were analyzed using the ORIGIN software (version 2.9) provided by Microcal Inc. The interaction between the vesicles and the antibiotics was complex in that no clear saturation of this interaction was observed. Therefore the stoichiometry of the interaction could not be determined. An approximation of the binding constant was made using the ORIGIN software, where the value of integrated heat of the last injection was subtracted from all data and the model of one set of sites was fitted to the resulting data. Binding Assay Using Centrifugation of Model Membranes—Vesicles were prepared as described above in 10 mm MES/Tris, 15 mm K2SO4 at pH 7. The reduced ion strength facilitated the pelleting of the vesicles. The concentrations of antibiotics and vesicles were varied from 0 to 0.1 and 0.5 to 5 mm, respectively, unless indicated otherwise. Vesicles were incubated with the polyene antibiotics for 1 h in an Eppendorf incubator (22 °C, 650 rpm), with a maximum of 1% Me2SO present. To spin down the vesicles and the bound antibiotic, 1 ml of the mixture was centrifuged in a TLA 120.2 rotor in a Beckman Ultracentrifuge (TL-100) for 1.5 h at 100 krpm and 20 °C. The amount of antibiotic before centrifugation and in the supernatant and pellet was determined by UV absorption after 7 times dilution in methanol followed by centrifugation to remove any precipitated salts. The phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis according to Rouser et al. (6Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). Under these conditions less than 10% of the phospholipids remained in the supernatant. The antibiotics were not pelleted in the absence of lipid below a concentration of 75, 34, and 30 μm, respectively, of natamycin, nystatin, and filipin. The binding isotherms of the interaction of natamycin with ergosterol could be described by the Langmuir adsorption model assuming that ergosterol was the only binding site for natamycin in the DOPC vesicles and that only the ergosterol in the outer leaflet of the bilayer could have an interaction with natamycin. The Langmuir adsorption model was applied to the data of the amount of natamycin bound to the vesicles versus the amount of free natamycin in the supernatant (7Langmuir I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1916; 38: 2221-2295Crossref Scopus (7969) Google Scholar). From using this model in Sigmaplot (10.0), the binding constant and the binding saturation of natamycin with ergosterol could be determined. Binding Assay Using Centrifugation of Intact Cells—Yeast were grown to the mid-logarithmic phase in 200 ml of YPUADT (with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin) or SD medium. As a negative control the Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used that was grown to the logarithmic phase in 100 ml of Luria Broth (LB) medium at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at room temperature at 3600 × g for 10 min in a Sorvall RC 5B centrifuge (SLA 1500), washed two times in 100 ml of 10 mm MES/Tris, 15 mm K2SO4 at pH 7, and resuspended in a small volume of buffer. The A600 of the cell suspensions was determined and a series of 1-ml cell suspensions were prepared ranging from an A600 of 0 to 15. The cells were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and resuspended in the same buffer containing 30 μm natamycin. As a control, cells were resuspended in buffer with no natamycin. The cells were incubated for 1 h in an Eppendorf incubator (900 rpm at room temperature) and spun down for 15 min at 3000 × g. The amount of natamycin in the supernatant was determined by UV absorption as described above (spectrum from 250 to 350 nm) and used to calculate the amount of natamycin bound to the yeast cells. Carboxyfluorescein Permeability Assay in Large Unilamellar Vesicles—Carboxyfluorescein (CF)-loaded vesicles were prepared as described above in 50 mm MES/KOH buffer at pH 7 (8Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. Kruijff de B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6968-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To remove the untrapped CF, a Sephadex G-50 spin column equilibrated with 50 mm MES, 100 mm K2SO4 buffer at pH 7 was used. The CF-loaded vesicles were diluted in 1200 μl of 50 mm MES, 100 mm K2SO4 buffer at pH 7 followed by the addition of the antibiotic. The antibiotic-induced CF leakage from the vesicles was monitored by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 513 nm (excitation set at 430 nm) on a SLM AMINCO Spectrofluorometer (SPF-500). The detergent Triton X-100 was added at the end of the experiment to destroy the lipid vesicles and the resulting fluorescence was taken as the 100% leakage value. Proton Permeability Assay in Large Unilamellar Vesicles—Proton permeability was determined in an assay with HPTS-loaded vesicles as performed by van Kan et al. (9van Kan E.J. Demel R.A. Breukink E. der Bent van A. Kruijff de B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7529-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the strong pH dependence of the fluorescence of HPTS. Vesicles were prepared as described above in a 2 mm HPTS solution in 0.2 m NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer at pH 7. To create a lower pH at the outside and remove all the untrapped HPTS, a Sephadex G-25 spin column was used equilibrated with 10 mm MES, 0.2 m Na2SO4 buffer at pH 5.5. To determine the phospholipid concentration of the resulting vesicles the lipids were first extracted according to Bligh-Dyer (10Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) to exclude the phosphate from the buffer in the following phosphate analysis according to Rouser et al. (6Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). The effects of the polyene antibiotics on the proton permeability of the lipid vesicles was monitored by adding aliquots of antibiotic to 1200 μl of 10 mm MES and 0.2 m Na2SO4 buffer, pH 5.5, containing HPTS-loaded vesicles (35 μm phospholipid phosphorous). The fluorescence emission was detected at 508 nm (excitation at 450 nm) on a SLM AMINCO Spectrofluorometer (SPF-500). Differing from van Kan et al. (9van Kan E.J. Demel R.A. Breukink E. der Bent van A. Kruijff de B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7529-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the detergent DDAO was used instead of Triton X-100, because DDAO did not have any effect on the fluorescence of the probe where Triton X-100 did have an effect (not shown). DDAO was added at the end to destroy the lipid vesicles and the resulting fluorescence was taken as the 100% leakage value, whereas the blank without antibiotic was used as a reference for 0% leakage. Nigericin, a polyether ionophore known to collapse proton gradients, was used as a positive control (11Boyer M.J. Hedley D.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Proton Permeability Assay in Yeast—The assay was based on the loading of yeast cells with the probe CFDA-SE as described by Bracey et al. (12Bracey D. Holyoak C.D. Caron Nebe-von G. Coote P.J. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1998; 31: 113-125Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Bracey D. Holyoak C.D. Coote P.J. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1998; 85: 1056-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). CFDA-SE is a non-polar molecule that spontaneously penetrates cell membranes and is converted to the anionic pH-sensitive 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CF-SE) by intracellular esterases (9van Kan E.J. Demel R.A. Breukink E. der Bent van A. Kruijff de B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7529-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Once the probe is internalized, amine reactive coupling of succinimidyl groups of CF-SE to aliphatic amines of intracellular proteins results in the formation of membrane-impermeable pH-sensitive probe conjugates. Wild type yeast cells from an overnight culture were diluted to an A600 of ∼0.8 and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 3 min. The cells were washed and resuspended in an equal volume of 100 mm citric/phosphate buffer at pH 4 (100 mm citric acid, 50 mm NaH2PO4, and 50 mm KOH). CFDA-SE (100 μm) was added and the cells were incubated overnight while shaking at 37 °C. The viability of the cells was not significantly compromised by the loading conditions. Loaded cells were harvested (3000 × g for 3 min), washed, and resuspended in YPUADT buffered with 50 mm citric/phosphate (pH 4) to an A600 of 0.4. To recover from the stress imposed by the probe loading conditions, the cultures were left for 1 h at 30 °C with shaking. The effects of the polyene antibiotics on the proton permeability of the yeast cells were monitored by adding aliquots of antibiotic to 5 ml of culture and measuring the A600 and fluorescence at regular intervals. The A600 was determined on a Helios Epsilon UNICAM spectrometer and the fluorescence emission was detected at 525 nm (excitation at 495 nm) on a SLM AMINCO Spectrofluorometer (SPF-500). Sterol Specificity of Natamycin Binding to Membranes—To test whether sterols are required for membrane affinity of natamycin we used phosphatidylcholine model membranes containing ergosterol, the main fungal sterol or cholesterol, the main sterol in mammals. The interaction between natamycin and sterols in the model membrane was first studied using ITC. ITC measurements were performed where LUVs containing either no sterols, cholesterol, or ergosterol were titrated into a solution of natamycin (Fig. 2). Natamycin displayed no interaction with vesicles containing no sterols as the resulting heats were no different from the control (Fig. 2A). LUVs containing 10 mol % cholesterol produced only minor heat effects during the first injections, which indicates that natamycin displayed only a very small interaction with cholesterol containing vesicles (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, 10 mol % ergosterol containing vesicles displayed a significant amount of interaction with natamycin as evidenced by the consecutive heat effects (Fig. 2C). This titration curve differs from a normal titration curve as no clear saturation of the interaction was observed. The binding constant between natamycin and ergosterol was estimated to be 5.7 × 104 m-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Comparable large differences in effects between cholesterol and ergosterol were observed for sterol concentrations of 20 mol % (data not shown). Furthermore, the binding of natamycin to vesicles was studied by separating the bound from the free natamycin by centrifugation. Fig. 3A shows a representative graph of these results, from which can be concluded that ergosterol containing vesicles had a significant interaction with natamycin. In the absence of sterols or in the presence of cholesterol very little interaction with natamycin was observed consistent with the ITC experiments (Fig. 2). A similar sterol dependence of natamycin binding was observed when varying the concentrations of vesicles (data not shown). The binding constant was determined by the Langmuir adsorption model in SigmaPlot (10.0) to be 2.5 ± 1.0 × 104 m-1, which is in reasonable agreement with the binding constant determined in the ITC measurements. The binding saturation from the Langmuir adsorption model was determined at 72 ± 12 μm by extrapolating the data in SigmaPlot (10.0). By assuming that only the sterol in the external leaflet of the lipid vesicles could establish an interaction with the antibiotic, the sterol to antibiotic ratio was calculated to be ∼1:1. If all sterols would be available for the interaction, because of sterol flip-flop, the ratio would be 2:1. The affinity of natamycin for ergosterol containing vesicles was compared with that of filipin and nystatin to get insight into the relative strength of this interaction. Fig. 3B shows a representative graph of the results obtained with these antibiotics. Of the three polyene antibiotics filipin showed the highest affinity, followed by natamycin and nystatin. Sterol Specificity in the Antibiotic Action—To test if ergosterol is needed for natamycin to exert its antifungal activity in vivo, yeast strains carrying specific mutations in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway (ergΔ) were used. Because of these mutations, the strains cannot synthesize ergosterol. However, they each accumulate a distinct set of sterols that, compared with ergosterol, have structural differences in the side chain and double bonds in the B or C ring (Fig. 4). The availability of these strains allows us to address the sterol specificity for polyenes, in relation to their inhibitory activity. The most prominent sterols present in the ergΔ mutants are tabulated in percentage of total sterol present, together with their MIC values for the polyene antibiotics natamycin, nystatin, and filipin in Table 3. The sterol composition of the erg strains given in Table 3 was taken from Heese-Peck et al. (5Heese-Peck A. Pichler H. Zanolari B. Watanabe R. Daum G. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2664-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and specifies the percentage of a listed sterol compared with the total sterol composition of a cell. The most sensitive erg strain is erg4Δerg5Δ, which has a MIC value of the wild type strain. The least sensitive toward natamycin was erg2Δerg6Δ, which contained mostly zymosterol. From the strain with the highest sensitivity toward the lowest, the most striking sterol structural feature that causes the loss of activity is the loss of double bonds in ring B. For example, the sterols in erg3Δ have one double bond at position C-7,8 and it is only 3 times less sensitive to natamycin compared with the wild type, whereas erg2Δerg6Δ has lost both double bonds at C-5,6 and C-7,8 and is 37 times less sensitive compared with the wild type. Variations in the C17 side chain of the sterols did not have very large effects on the sensitivity toward natamycin, which can be observed when comparing erg4Δerg5Δ with the wild type. The yeast strain sensitivities toward nystatin were similar compared with natamycin. Filipin sensitivity seemed not to be so dependent on the sterol structure. The results demonstrate that double bonds in the B ring of the sterols are very important for natamycin to inhibit the growth of yeast, whereas changes of the C17 side chain are of less importance.TABLE 3The minimum concentration of the polyene antibiotics needed to inhibit the growth of different ergΔ mutants The MIC values for natamycin (MICnatam), nystatin (MICnyst), and filipin (MICfilip) are given for the different ergΔ strains, together with the structure and percentage of the most abundant sterols in an ergΔ strain, as stated in Ref. 5Heese-Peck A.

https://openalex.org/W1999755328,"Previous studies have succeeded in identifying the cognitive state corresponding to the perception of a set of depicted categories, such as tools, by analyzing the accompanying pattern of brain activity, measured with fMRI. The current research focused on identifying the cognitive state associated with a 4s viewing of an individual line drawing (1 of 10 familiar objects, 5 tools and 5 dwellings, such as a hammer or a castle). Here we demonstrate the ability to reliably (1) identify which of the 10 drawings a participant was viewing, based on that participant's characteristic whole-brain neural activation patterns, excluding visual areas; (2) identify the category of the object with even higher accuracy, based on that participant's activation; and (3) identify, for the first time, both individual objects and the category of the object the participant was viewing, based only on other participants' activation patterns. The voxels important for category identification were located similarly across participants, and distributed throughout the cortex, focused in ventral temporal perceptual areas but also including more frontal association areas (and somewhat left-lateralized). These findings indicate the presence of stable, distributed, communal, and identifiable neural states corresponding to object concepts."
https://openalex.org/W2094746410,"There is sexual dimorphism of skeletal muscle, the most obvious feature being the larger muscle mass of men. The molecular basis for this difference has not been clearly defined. To identify genes that might contribute to the relatively greater muscularity of men, we compared skeletal muscle gene expression profiles of 15 normal men and 15 normal women by using comprehensive oligonucleotide microarrays. Although there were sex-related differences in expression of several hundred genes, very few of the differentially expressed genes have functions that are obvious candidates for explaining the larger muscle mass of men. The men tended to have higher expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, ribosomal proteins, and a few translation initiation factors. The women had >2-fold greater expression than the men (P<0.0001) of two genes that encode proteins in growth factor pathways known to be important in regulating muscle mass: growth factor receptor-bound 10 (GRB10) and activin A receptor IIB (ACVR2B). GRB10 encodes a protein that inhibits insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling. ACVR2B encodes a myostatin receptor. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed higher expression of GRB10 and ACVR2B genes in these women. In an independent microarray study of 10 men and 9 women with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, women had higher expression of GRB10 (2.7-fold, P<0.001) and ACVR2B (1.7-fold, P<0.03). If these sex-related differences in mRNA expression lead to reduced IGF-1 activity and increased myostatin activity, they could contribute to the sex difference in muscle size."
https://openalex.org/W2073685606,"Although human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great promise as a source of differentiated cells to treat several human diseases, many obstacles still need to be surmounted before this can become a reality. First among these, a robust chemically-defined system to expand hESCs in culture is still unavailable despite recent advances in the understanding of factors controlling hESC self-renewal.In this study, we attempted to find new molecules that stimulate long term hESC self-renewal. In order to do this, we started from the observation that a commercially available serum replacement product has a strong positive effect on the expansion of undifferentiated hESCs when added to a previously reported chemically-defined medium. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the active ingredient within the serum replacement is lipid-rich albumin. Furthermore, we show that this activity is trypsin-resistant, strongly suggesting that lipids and not albumin are responsible for the effect. Consistent with this, lipid-poor albumin shows no detectable activity. Finally, we identified the major lipids bound to the lipid-rich albumin and tested several lipid candidates for the effect.Our discovery of the role played by albumin-associated lipids in stimulating hESC self-renewal constitutes a significant advance in the knowledge of how hESC pluripotency is maintained by extracellular factors and has important applications in the development of increasingly chemically defined hESC culture systems."

Independently, a group of zebrafish researchers discovered that a different mutation in the zebrafish orthologue of this gene was responsible for the hypo-pigmented phenotype of the golden zebrafish (7Lamason R.L.

Using data from the human HapMap project (8Consortium International HapMap Nature. 2005; 437: 1299-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (4777) Google Scholar), they observed that the alternate alleles of the nsSNP (rs1426654) in human SLC24A5 were present at very different frequencies in populations of African and European ancestry. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the allele encoding threonine 111 of the protein encoded by SLC24A5 was associated with lighter skin in an admixed African-American population.

Amino acid sequence alignments predict that SLC24A5 encodes a member of the potassium-dependent sodium calcium exchanger protein family, designated NCKX5. The NCKX family currently consists of five members (NCKX 1-5) that are thought to use both the inward sodium gradient and the outward potassium gradient to extrude calcium across the plasma membrane. NCKX proteins have been shown to operate in retinal rod and cone photoreceptors as well as in several types of neurons in the brain (for review, see Ref. 12Altimimi H.F. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Channels. 2007; 1: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A sixth protein, designated NCKX6, is now thought to belong to a distinct, but related protein family (CCX) as it shows substantial divergence in phylogenetic analyses (13Cai X. Lytton J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1692-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and lacks many of the residues conserved between NCKX1-5 that are key for transport activity. Although SLC24A5 is predicted to encode an NCKX protein, the exchanger activity of NCKX5 has yet to be experimentally demonstrated. The residue altered by the nsSNP in SLC24A5 lies in a region of the protein that is highly conserved across all NCKX family members. This region contains a number of residues that are critical for exchange function (14Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P.

Here we describe a full analysis of the transcript expression profile of all known sodium-calcium exchangers in cultured human and murine melanocytes together with an immunocytochemical analysis of native NCKX5 expression. We show that this protein has a novel trans-Golgi network intracellular localization in normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHM), and using siRNA-mediated knockdown we demonstrate conclusively that SLC24A5 expression is required for melanin synthesis in both cultured mouse and human melanocytes. We also demonstrate that, as predicted, SLC24A5 encodes a protein with potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchanger activity. Through site-directed mutagenesis in a heterologous expression system, we demonstrate that the residue switch encoded by the nsSNP in SLC24A5 markedly alters exchanger activity when introduced into NCKX2 or NCKX5. Together, these data support the hypothesis that a nsSNP in the SLC24A5 gene directly alters human skin color through its effect on the sodium-calcium exchanger activity of NCKX5. Cell Culture—NHM from neonatal foreskin were cultured in MGM (M254 medium supplemented with human melanocyte growth supplement) (Cascade Biologics) at 37 °C, 9% CO2. Melanocytes were dedifferentiated as previously described (19Cook A.L. Donatien P.D. Smith A.G. Murphy M. Jones M.K. Herlyn M. Bennett D.C. Leonard J.H. Sturm R.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1150-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using M254 and 50 nm EDN3 for 7 days before knockdown (cells denoted MC:MB). B16 F10 mouse melanoma cells (ATCC) were cultured in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and quantified using Ribo Green (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Roche Applied Science first strand synthesis kit. Real-time PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad iCycler using human or murine SLC24 or SLC8, human vSNARE, or murine TBP QuantiTect real-time PCR primers (Qiagen) and SYBR Green PCR master mix (Bio-Rad). All measurements from each cell type were made on a single cDNA sample. Data analysis was performed using the comparative cycle threshold method (ΔCT). Anti-NCKX5 Antibodies—Peptides anti-NCKX5-(I) (DEGQPFIRRQSRTDSG) and anti-NCKX5-(C) (GNNKIRGCGG) were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and rabbits were immunized in a 90-day protocol. Bleeds were affinity-purified using individual peptides conjugated to bovine serum albumin on a Sepharose support. Immunoblotting—For membrane extracts NHM were lysed in 0.25 m sucrose, PBS using a Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes). Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C. Membrane-associated proteins were extracted using 1% Triton X-100 in PBS plus protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged. Alternatively, whole cell lysates were prepared from NHM using 1% Triton X-100 in PBS plus protease inhibitor mixture, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Protein content was determined by BCA assay. Proteins (15 μg/well unless otherwise stated) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% Novex bis-tris acrylamide gels, transferred to Invitrulon membrane, blocked in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 with 2% w/v skimmed milk protein (PBS/T), and probed with primary antibody diluted in PBS/T. Primary antibodies consisted of anti-NCKX5-(C) at 0.5 μg/ml goat anti-Trp1 (G17), mouse anti-tyrosinase clone T311, mouse anti-Lamp-1 clone H4A3, mouse anti-Mart-1 clone A103 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse HMB45 (against pmel17) clone MCA2146 (Serotec), and mouse anti-β-actin (Abcam Plc). Secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as appropriate diluted in PBS/T. Detection was via SuperSignal Western picochemiluminescence substrate (Perbio) and visualized with a Chemidoc XRS imaging system (Bio-Rad). The Mr of the bands was determined using Quantity One 4.6.3 one-dimensional analysis software from Bio-Rad. Myc-tagged hNCKX5 was expressed by transient transfection in HEK293 cells. Deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase F was carried out as described before (17Kinjo T.G. Szerencsei R.T. Winkfein R.J. Kang K. Schnetkamp P.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin. Cells were blocked with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% saponin, PBS for 1 h at room temperature, probed with primary and secondary antibodies, and mounted with Vectashield® (Vector Laboratories). Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-human NCKX5-(I) and NCKX5-(C) at 0.8 μg/ml, TGN46 and HMB45 (AbD Serotec), GM130 (BD Biosciences), anti-gp100 (AbCam), Mel-5 anti-TYRP1 (Signet), and T311 anti-tyrosinase (AbCam). Other antibodies tested for co-localization were Lamp 1, flotillin 2 and syntaxin 8 (BD Biosciences), EEA1, Sar1, β-COP, PEX-19 (AbCam), Lamp 2 (RDI), C423 (anti-clathrin L) (Covance), and syntaxin 6 (Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor® 488 donkey anti-rabbit, 633 donkey anti-sheep, or 633 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica TCSSp1 confocal S laser microscope with Leica LCS software. Images were acquired using 20× (dry) or 60× (oil immersion 1.4na) objectives. 488- and 633-nm excitation was via argon or HeNe lasers respectively. Optical series were collected at 0.5 μm z-steps. For co-localizations with GM130, the topological separation of the signal from each channel was determined by plotting the intensity profile of each signal in three separate cross-sections of the Golgi stacks. RNA-mediated Interference Transfections—B16 or NHM were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/cm2 for melanogenesis experiments or 1 × 104 cells/cm2 for immunofluorescence microscopy experiments; MC:MB cells were seeded at 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2. Cells were adhered for 24 h and transfected with 2 μg/ml Lipofectamine 2000 and 50 nm or 100 nm Stealth™ RNA-mediated interference duplex. All dilutions were performed with Opti-MEM. Murine siRNA targeted nucleotides 762-787, with a corresponding scrambled control. Human siRNA targeted nucleotides 185-210 and 492-517 with scrambled control corresponding to 260-285. Cells were incubated with transfection reagents for 6-8 h. NHM were returned to MGM and grown for 5-6 days before analysis. B16 cells were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, after 72 h the media was analyzed for melanin content, and the cells incubated for 1 h in WST-1 reagent (Roche Applied Science) to determine viability. Sucrose Density Gradient Fractionation—Light and Dark NHM were extracted to obtain a total granule fraction and fractionated essentially as described by Chen et al. (23Chen K. Manga P. Orlow S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed, trypsinized, and resuspended in 0.25 m homogenization buffer. After 60 strokes in a Dounce tissue-grinder, they were centrifuged at 100 × g to remove debris, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g (4 °C) before loading onto a stepped sucrose gradient (0.8-2 m in 0.2 m increments). Gradients were centrifuged at 25,000 rpm (4 °C) in a Beckman SW28 rotor. Interface fractions were collected, and 7.5 μl of each fraction was loaded per well in SDS reducing buffer. Melanin Assay—NHM were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, PBS and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min, and protein was quantified by BCA assay. Melanin pellets washed in 1:1 ethanol/diethyl ether were dissolved in 1 m NaOH, 10% Me2SO, 30 min, 60 °C. Melanin content of the supernatants or culture media was measured at 450 nm. Clustal Alignments—Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW program using the default settings. The resultant alignment files were visualized using Jalview multiple alignment editor (20Clamp M. Cuff J. Searle S.M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar), and manual adjustments made as necessary. Functional Analysis of Mutant NCKX2 and NCKX5—Codons for the indicated residues were mutated using cDNA of the Myc-tagged short splice variant of human NCKX2 (AAF25811) or human NCKX5 and cloned in to the pEIA vector as described before (14Winkfein R.J.

The Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) was inserted between Ser-52 and Glu-53 of human NCKX5. The mutant and wild-type NCKX2 and NCKX5 proteins were expressed in insect High Five cells, and protein expression was monitored by Western blotting with the Myc mAb (New England Biolabs). NCKX function was assayed by measuring 45Ca2+ uptake via reverse exchange in Na+-loaded cells as described in detail previously (21Szerencsei R.T. Tucker J.E. Cooper C.B. Winkfein R.J. Farrell P.J.

Protein content of cell samples was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. SLC24A5 mRNA Is the Predominant Sodium-Calcium Exchanger Transcript in Human and Mouse Melanocytes—In mammalian cells sodium-calcium exchange is mediated both through NCKX proteins, encoded by the SLC24 gene family, and potassium-independent sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) proteins encoded by the closely related, but distinct SLC8 gene family. This gene family comprises three members, NCX1-3, transcripts of which are found in many tissues, in particular in the heart and brain (for review, see Ref. 22Annunziato L. Pignataro G. Boscia F.

The transcript profile of all known sodium-calcium (potassium) exchangers was determined in monolayer cultures of NHM and mouse melanocytes using real-time PCR (Fig. 1). In both cultures the predominant isoform was SLC24A5, which was >100-fold more highly expressed than any of the other SLC24A transcripts, and transcripts of the SLC8 family were not detected in either cell line. In NMH low levels of SLC24A1 and very low levels of SLC24A3 and SLC24A4 were detected, and in the mouse melanocytes, low levels of SLC24A4 and very low levels of SLC24A1 and SLC24A3 were found. NCKX5 Protein Is Located in an Intracellular Membrane and Partially Co-localizes with the Trans-Golgi Network—The specificity of affinity-purified antisera for native NCKX5 protein was assessed through siRNA-mediated knockdown in NHM. Transfection with two different siRNA duplexes (siRNA 185 and siRNA 492) resulted in >90% knockdown of SLC24A5 transcript levels compared with control cultures after 48 h. 3R. S. Ginger, S. E.

Western blots of cell extracts harvested 5 days after transfection and probed with affinity-purified anti-NCKX5-(C) sera showed that a triplet of bands of ∼43 kDa were clearly detected in extracts from control or untreated cells but were virtually absent in extracts from SLC24A5 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2A). The apparent size of these bands is surprisingly low compared with the predicted molecular mass in the absence of glycosylation of 54.9 kDa. However, the lower molecular mass observed here is consistent with that observed for heterologously expressed recombinant hNCKX5 detected through amino and carboxyl-terminal tags, which also runs as a triplet of bands ∼43 kDa (Fig. 2B). De-glycosylation of the recombinant protein (Fig. 2B) removes the upper band, suggesting that the lower bands reflect signal peptide cleavage of unglycosylated protein. Non-transfected HEK cells do not show any reactivity with the anti-Myc antibody. 3R. S. Ginger, S. E. Askew, R. M. Ogborne, S. Wilson, D. Ferdinando, T. Dadd, A. M. Smith, S. Kazi, R. T. Szerencsei, R. J. Winkfein, P. P. M. Schnetkamp, and M. R. Green. These results show that the affinity-purified polyclonal antibody preparation detects NCKX5 protein in human melanocyte extracts, with some nonspecific reactivity, suggested by the detection of other higher and lower molecular weight bands that are not affected by SLC24A5 knockdown. Cultured dark NHM probed by immunofluorescence with either of our anti-NCKX5 antisera, raised against different peptides and regions of NCKX5, showed the same strong perinuclear staining and also punctuate staining distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). We found no evidence of plasma membrane staining with these antisera using confocal microscopy. A similar pattern of staining was observed in both light and dark NHM, although the perinuclear staining was less intense in lighter melanocytes.3 The perinuclear staining co-localized with the trans-Golgi marker TGN46 (Fig. 2C), although merged images of serial optical sections revealed that NCKX5 only co-localized with part of the TGN (Fig. 3A). Co-staining of NHM with anti-NCKX5 and the cis-Golgi marker GM130 (Fig. 3B) showed that the location of the two antigens was close though not coincident with a separation of ∼300-500 nm, calculated from plots of signal intensity in each channel across multiple sections the Golgi stacks.3 These data suggest that NCKX5 is partially located in a region of the TGN. Treatment of light or dark melanocytes with either of the human siRNA duplexes for 5 days resulted in complete loss of perinuclear NCKX5 in >90% of cells. This is seen as a loss of yellow color in the merged images of cells double-stained for NCKX5 (green) and TGN46 (red). However no marked effect on the punctate staining was observed (Fig. 3C).3 This confirms that the perinuclear staining we have observed with both antibody preparations is specific to NCKX5 and not due to the nonspecific reactivity detected by Western blot. However the punctuate staining is either not specific to this protein, or the protein localized to these structures is not removed by siRNA knockdown even after 10 days.3 Co-localization studies with multiple markers of melanosomes, lysosomes, or endosomes were unable to determine the identity of this punctuate staining (Fig. 3D).3 NCKX5 Co-fractionates with TGN46 in NHM Extracts—Subcellular fractionation provides an alternative approach to determine the localization of proteins. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation has previously been used to enrich for melanosomal proteins (23Chen K. Manga P. Orlow S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Using the same approach, fractionated NHM extracts were probed with anti-NCKX5 (C) and the TGN46 antibody (Fig. 4). Fractions 4-6 (corresponding to the 1.2/1.4 m, 1.4/1.6 m, and 1.6/1.8 m sucrose interfaces, respectively) contained pigment and were similarly enriched for both NCKX5 and TGN46, supporting the co-localization observed between these two antigens using immunofluorescence and indicating that these fractions contain trans-Golgi membranes as well as melanosomes. SLC24A5 Knockdown Reduces Melanin Production in Mouse B16 Melanocytes—In melanocyte monolayer cultures, where transfer is not possible, melanosome turnover is limited to some degree by cellular turnover, making it difficult to measure the inhibition of melanin production over short time-courses. Mouse B16 cells are unusual in this respect because they secrete melanin directly into the surrounding culture media, and melanogenesis is only triggered when cells reach the stationary phase of growth (24Laskin J.D. Piccinini L. Engelhardt D.L. Weinstein I.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 113: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This affords the opportunity to assess the effect of SLC24A5 knockdown against a low background of pre-existing melanin. Therefore, the effect of SLC24A5 siRNA knockdown on melanin production was first assessed in mouse B16 melanocytes. Treatment with siRNA 762 elicited a marked and reproducible reduction in melanin production 72 h post-knockdown (87.7% reduction p < 0.0001) compared with the control siRNA (Fig. 5, A and B) without any detectable toxicity. This demonstrates that this gene and its products play a controlling role in melanogenesis in this system. SLC24A5 Knockdown Reduces Melanin Production in NHM—The effect of SLC24A5 knockdown on melanogenesis in cultured NHM was investigated by comparing the melanin content of cell pellets 5 days after siRNA transfection. NHM transfected with either of the SLC24A5 knockdown siRNAs (Fig. 6A) resulted in significant percentage reductions of 22 and 30.5% (siRNA 185 and 492, respectively; p < 0.0001) of total cellular melanin compared with the control cells, demonstrating that SLC24A5 expression plays an important role in melanin synthesis in these cells. The effect of SLC24A5 knockdown on melanogenesis was even clearer when assessed in depigmented melanocytes (Fig. 6B). In these cultures the difficulty of measuring a reduction in de novo melanin synthesis against a large background of pre-existing melanin was substantially lessened. The pigment content of NHM cultured in melanoblast media for 1 week was greatly reduced (Fig. 6B, MB), and switching these cells back into normal melanocyte media restored pigment production after 5 days (Fig. 6B, MGM). Transfection of de-differentiated cells with SLC24A5 siRNA knockdown duplexes (185 and 492) almost completely blocked pigment synthesis after switching back into melanocyte media compared with the control transfection (Fig. 6B, SC) with a normalized percentage difference in melanin content of 80-90% (p < 0.0001). These results demonstrate for the first time that SLC24A5 expression is necessary for melanin production in human epidermal melanoblasts stimulated to differentiate. Melanosomal Markers Are Down-regulated after SLC24A5 Knockdown—Protein extracts prepared from re-pigmented melanoblasts treated with control or SLC24A5 knockdown siRNAs were probed by Western blotting for known melanosomal markers (Fig. 7). The expression of early melanosome markers pmel17 (85-kDa form) and MART1 and late melanosomal markers TYR and TYRP1 was substantially reduced after SLC245A5 knockdown. Conversely, expression of the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 was up-regulated after SLC24A5 knockdown, suggesting that SLC24A5 plays a role very early in melanosome biogenesis and that this process is intimately linked with lysosome biogenesis. Switching Threonine for Alanine at Residue 111 of NCKX5 or Residue 177 of NCKX2 Reduces Exchange Activity—The NCKX proteins have a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity in two regions that have been identified as essential for exchange activity (denoted α1 and α2). The non-synonymous SNP (rs1426654) that is associated with natural skin color variation lies within the first of these highly conserved regions. All NCKX proteins and all cross-species orthologues of NCKX5 have an alanine at this position, except the NCKX5 variant identified in light-skinned humans, which has a threonine (Fig. 8, A and B). Consistent with the notion that native NCKX5 is localized to an intracellular membrane, no NCKX activity could be measured across the plasma membranes of B16 or NHM cells using established methods (12Altimimi H.F. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Channels. 2007; 1: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and neither was traffick"

We aimed to identify the incidence rate of new TB cases among TB contacts and to relate this to their initial Mantoux and ELISPOT test results. Methods and Findings After initial Mantoux and ELISPOT tests and exclusion of co-prevalent TB cases, we followed 2348 household contacts of sputum smear positive TB cases. We visited them at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months, and investigated those with symptoms consistent with TB. Those who were diagnosed separately at a government clinic had a chest x-ray. Twenty six contacts were diagnosed with definite TB over 4312 person years of follow-up (Incidence rate 603/100,000 person years; 95% Confidence Interval, 370–830). Nine index and secondary case pairs had cultured isolates available for genotyping. Of these, 6 pairs were concordant and 3 were discordant. 2.5% of non-progressors were HIV positive compared to 12% of progressors (HR 6.2; 95% CI 1.7–22.5; p = 0.010). 25 secondary cases had initial Mantoux results, 14 (56%) were positive ; 21 had initial ELISPOT results, 11 (52%) were positive; 15 (71%) of 21 tested were positive by one or the other test. Of the 6 contacts who had concordant isolates with their respective index case, 4 (67%) were Mantoux positive at recruitment, 3 (50%) were ELISPOT positive; 5 (83%) were positive by one or other of the two tests. ELISPOT positive contacts, and those with discordant results, had a similar rate of progression to those who were Mantoux positive. Those negative on either or both tests had the lowest rate of progression. Conclusions The incidence rate of TB disease in Gambian TB case contacts, after screening for co-prevalent cases, was 603/100,000 person years. Since initial ELISPOT test and Mantoux tests were each positive in only just over half of cases, but 71% were positive by one or other test, positivity by either might be the best indication for preventive treatment. These data do not support the replacement of the Mantoux test by an ELISPOT test in The Gambia or similar settings."

The KCNQ channels represent a subfamily of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) 3The abbreviations used are:Kvvoltage-gated K+ channelCaMcalmodulinLQTlong QTPBSphosphate-buffered salineICPinductively coupled plasmaWTwild typeNHSN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide. channels, whose members (Kv7.1-5) are expressed in a wide variety of tissues. These channels play a major role in brain and cardiac excitability through the modulation of the cardiac potential waveform, the regulation of action potential generation and propagation, the tuning of neuronal firing patterns, and the modulation of neurotransmitter release (1Jentsch T.J.

Mutations in human KCNQ genes lead to major cardiovascular and neurological disorders, such as the cardiac long QT syndrome or neonatal epilepsy (3Jentsch T.J. Hubner C.A. Fuhrmann J.C. Nat.

Like all Kv channels, the KCNQ α subunits share a common core structure of six transmembrane segments with a voltage-sensing domain (S1-S4) and a pore domain (S5-S6) (see Fig. 1A), likely to approximate the mammalian Kv1.2 channel α structure described by MacKinnon and co-workers (4Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). Often, KCNQ α is in complex with the integral membrane auxiliary subunit, known as KCNE1, IsK, or MinK. This protein alters channel properties, such as single channel conductance and activation kinetics while increasing channel density in the plasma membrane (5Abbott G.W. Goldstein S.A. Mol. Interv. 2001; 1: 95-107PubMed Google Scholar). Several structural features of the Kv7 α family members distinguish them from the larger Kv channel superfamily. In particular, their primary sequence encodes a large (300-500 residues), intracellular COOH terminus (Fig. 1A). Sequence analysis predicts four helical regions (dubbed A-D) present in all family members (6Yus-Najera E. Santana-Castro I. Villarroel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28545-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Helices C and D are thought to form coiled-coil assemblies. Yeast two-hybrid screens for proteins interacting with the COOH terminus revealed CaM, the ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor protein, as a binding partner (6Yus-Najera E. Santana-Castro I. Villarroel A. J.

Moreover, CaM constitutively associates with the channel (6Yus-Najera E. Santana-Castro I. Villarroel A. J. Biol.

Helices A and B encode the binding site for CaM, and CaM association is required for proper channel assembly and function (6Yus-Najera E. Santana-Castro I. Villarroel A. J. Biol.

LQT mutations that disrupt or significantly weaken the CaM interaction result in little or no complex and little channel expression in live cells (8Shamgar L. Ma L. Schmitt N. Haitin Y. Peretz A.

Res. 2006; 98: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, CaM acts as an additional auxiliary subunit of the KCNQ channel complex. Additionally, Ca2+-CaM is a Ca2+ sensor for KCNQ1 function, transducing Ca2+ signals to stimulate IKS channels and producing a Ca2+-dependent left shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation. This Ca2+-sensitive IKS-current stimulation could increase the cardiac repolarization reserve, preventing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Biochemical and functional studies have identified Kv7 COOH-terminal regions important for channel tetramerization and trafficking (12Schmitt N. Schwarz M. Peretz A. Abitbol I. Attali B. Pongs O.

Little work has directly examined on a protein level the postulated structural modules and their functional correlates. What precisely is the tertiary and quaternary organization of the COOH terminus, and what does it do that distinguishes it from the other Kv channel subfamilies? Using a recombinant bacterial co-expression system (8Shamgar L. Ma L. Schmitt N. Haitin Y. Peretz A. Wiener R. Hirsch J. Pongs O. Attali B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we have dissected the KCNQ1 COOH terminus protein complex. Our findings suggest that the KCNQ1 COOH terminus may be divided into two parts, where the membrane proximal half is important for functional expression, folding, and gating of the channel but not oligomerization, whereas the membrane distal half directs folding, oligomerization, partner specificity, and trafficking to the plasma membrane. This COOH terminus is a multifunctional platform, employing relatively simple structural modules to assemble a channel with high specificity in an apparent hierarchical manner. For bacterial expression vectors, PCR was used to engineer BamHI and NotI restriction sites onto the specific human KCNQ1 gene fragments. PCR product was ligated into doubly digested (BamHI and NotI) modified pETDuet vector. This pETDuet vector contains a His8 tag sequence and TEV protease recognition sequence upstream to multiple cloning site I with CaM inserted into multiple cloning site II. Positive clones were identified by restriction analysis and subsequently sequenced in all DNA constructs described below. In addition, all site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the QuikChange (Stratagene) method. Altered sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Subcloning of Δ Helix C—The KCNQ1 sequence in a pcDNA3 vector was used as a template for QuikChange, where primers were designed to delete helix C (residues 548-565). This modified vector then served as the template for PCR of an insert for the pETDuet vector. Subcloning of Δ Loop—Construction was in two steps. First, PCR was used to engineer BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites onto a KCNQ1 gene fragment (residues 352-386). PCR product was ligated into a doubly digested (BamHI and EcoRI), modified pETDuet vector. Then PCR was used to engineer EcoRI and NotI restriction sites onto an additional gene fragment (residues 504-622). This PCR product was ligated into doubly digested (EcoRI and NotI) modified pETDuet vector already contained the fragment encoding residues 352-386. Subcloning of COOH Terminus-GCN4-LI Chimera—Subcloning was in two steps. First, PCR was used to engineer BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites into the KCNQ1 gene fragment (residues 352-594). PCR product was ligated into doubly digested (BamHI and EcoRI) modified pETDuet vector. Then the GCN4-LI sequence (encoding IEDKLEEILSKLYHIENE-LARIKKLLG) was amplified by primers containing EcoRI and NotI sites in the 5′- and the 3′-flanking regions, respectively. GCN4-LI PCR product was ligated into doubly digested (EcoRI and NotI) modified pETDuet vector that already contained DNA encoding residues 352-594. Subsequently, the EcoRI restriction site was deleted by mutagenesis. Transformed Escherichia coli BL-21 Tuner (Novagen), containing the “RIL” Codon Plus™ plasmid (Stratagene) cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Upon reaching an A600 of 0.3, the temperature was lowered to 16 °C, and growth continued until the culture reached an A600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 135 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 14 h by centrifugation, frozen, and suspended in 120 ml of lysis buffer, buffer L (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After lysis by a microfluidizer (Microfluidics), cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated metal chelate Ni2+-CAM (Sigma) column (buffer A: 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer A, containing 10 mm imidazole, until a stable base line was achieved. After elution with buffer A, supplemented with 125 mm imidazole, the protein eluate was then subjected to TEV protease in a ratio of 1:150. The proteolysis continued for 12 h. Subsequently, the sample was diluted 4-fold with 10% glycerol and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column (buffer S: 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The column was then washed with buffer S, and fractions were eluted with a shallow linear gradient of buffer S, containing 50-600 mm NaCl. Fractions were pooled and applied to a pre-equilibrated Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) with buffer F (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The elution peak was concentrated to 3 mg ml-1 using spin concentrators (Vivascience), divided into aliquots, and flash-frozen in liquid N2. For purification of Δ helix D, Δ helices C-D, and Δ loop-CaM complexes, a Superdex-200 gel filtration column was employed instead of the Superose-6 gel filtration column. Both KCNQ1 gene fragments (residues 535-572 or 535-622, respectively) were amplified by PCR with primers containing BamHI and NotI sites in the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, respectively. PCR product was ligated into doubly digested (BamHI and NotI) pGEX 4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Expression was as above. Cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After lysis, cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose column (buffer A: PBS, pH 7.4), at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer A and eluted with buffer B (100 mm Tris pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm glutathione), and the protein was applied to a pre-equilibrated Superdex 200 gel filtration column with buffer F. The elution peak was concentrated and stored as above. The selenomethionine Δ loop-CaM complex was prepared by inhibition of the methionine pathway. Inoculum was grown from a single transformed colony in 10% LB medium. The cells were pelleted, and media supernatant was removed, prior to the addition to 2 liters of New Minimal Medium, containing Kao and Michayluk vitamin solution (Sigma), 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Upon reaching an A600 of 0.3, the temperature was lowered to 16 °C. Lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine (100 mg/liter), isoleucine, leucine, and valine (50 mg/liter), and dl-selenomethionine (50 mg/liter) were added 45 min before induction, when the culture reached an A600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 135 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside over a 16-h period. Purification of the selenomethionine protein was similar to that of the native protein, except that 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to all solutions to prevent oxidation of the selenomethionine derivative protein. The helix D synthetic peptide (residues 585-621, acetylated and amidated at the NH2 and COOH termini, respectively) was purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C18 column (Vydac) with a shallow acetonitrile gradient of 35-60% (both solvents were supplemented with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Sedimentation velocity analysis of the different protein samples were carried out at 40,000 or 50,000 rpm and 5 °C (except Δ helices C-D and point mutants that were centrifuged at 10 °C) in an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter Inc.) with a UV-visible optics detection system, using an An60Ti rotor and 12-mm double sector centerpieces. All of the proteins were equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, buffer except for CT-GCN4LI, which was in PBS. The sedimentation velocity runs were done at different protein concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 mg/ml. Sedimentation profiles were registered every 5 min at the appropriate wavelength (ranging from 230 to 280 nm). The sedimentation coefficient distributions were calculated by least-squares boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data using the c(s) method (17Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar) as implemented in the SEDFIT program. The corresponding standard s-values (S20,w) were obtained from the experimental s-values upon correction for density, viscosity, and protein concentration (18van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1986: 110-136Google Scholar), using the SEDNTERP program (19Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J.

Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at multiple speeds (9000, 13,000, 22,000, 32,000, 40,000, and 43,000 rpm) and wavelengths (230, 238, 250, and 280 nm) with short columns (80 μl) using the same instrumentation and conditions as described above. In order to determine the stoichiometry of the two KCNQ-CaM complexes, the sedimentation equilibrium data of these macromolecular mixtures were analyzed assuming the linear approximation of the buoyant molecular weights (20Cole J.L.

Methods. 1999; 19: 194-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), bMw,ij = ibMw,A + jbMw,B, where ij refers to the complex AiBj, and bMw,A and bMw,B are the buoyant molecular weights of pure A and pure B, respectively. In this case, the weight-average buoyant molecular masses (bMw) were determined from the sedimentation equilibrium data by fitting a single species model to the experimental data using either a MATLAB program based on the conservation of signal algorithm (22Minton A.P. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1994: 81-93Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Allen Minton, National Institutes of Health) or the HeteroAnalysis program (20Cole J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 212-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); both analytical methods gave essentially the same results. The molecular masses of the single solute components (helix D peptide and CaM) were determined from the corresponding experimental buoyant values using 0.734 and 0.732 cm/g as the partial specific volumes of peptide and CaM, respectively, calculated from the amino acid composition using the SEDNTERP program. All measurements were done with an Aviv CD spectrometer model 202. Spectra were measured over the range of 260-180 nm at a scan rate of 1 nm/s. A cell with 0.1-mm path length was used. Each spectrum is an average of five scans. The raw data were corrected by subtracting the contribution of the buffer to the signal. Then data were smoothed and converted to molar ellipticity units. Protein concentration was determined using the predicted extinction coefficient at 280 nm. For melting experiments, CD was measured at 222 nm with a 1-mm path length cell. Temperature equilibrium time was 2 min, and integration time was 30 s. The CD data were scaled from 0 to 1 with respect to the initial native form and the fully unfolded form using the equation, CDscaled=CDobs-CDinitialCDfinal-CDinitial Proteins were injected onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL or Superdex 200 10/300 GL or Superdex 75 10/300 GL (Amersham Biosciences) column. Proteins were eluted with buffer F at a flow rate of 0.5, 0.7, or 0.8 ml/min for Superose 6, Superdex 200, or Superdex 75 columns, respectively. Crystals were grown in 12-16% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7-8, at 19 °C by sitting drop vapor diffusion. Equal volumes (1 μl) of frozen stock protein (15 mg/ml) were mixed with reservoir solution. Native crystals appeared after 2 weeks. Heavy atom soaks were prepared by adding 1 mm K2ReCl6 directly to drops containing crystals for 24 h. Four selenomethionine protein crystals appeared after several months. Crystals were cryoprotected by sequential dilution with reservoir solution, including 24% glycerol, and then loop mounted and flash frozen in liquid N2. Diffraction data were obtained under standard cryogenic conditions and processed with HKL (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). We executed a single wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment on the selenomethionine crystals, using the anomalous selenium peak. Heavy atom site location and experimental phases calculation was performed with CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering from the selenium and rhenium derivative data sets against the native data set were used for experimental phase calculation. Subsequent density modification with SOLOMON (26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) gave electron density maps of excellent quality. An initial model was built with ARP/wARP (27Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and subsequently refined with Refmac5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) with rounds of model building. Recordings were performed using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Signals were amplified using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments), sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 800 Hz via a 4-pole Bessel low pass filter. Data were acquired using pClamp 8.2 software in conjunction with a DigiData 1322A interface. The patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Warner Instrument Corp.) with a resistance of 4-7 megaohms. The intracellular pipette solution contained 130 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K2ATP, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted with KOH to pH 7.4 (290 mOsm). The external solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11 mm glucose, 5.5 mm HEPES, adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4 (310 mOsm). Series resistances (8-15 megaohms) were compensated (75-90%) and periodically monitored. COS7 cells were grown on 13-mm diameter coated glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Cells were rinsed for 5 min in PBS and subsequently fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Following extensive washes in PBS, the cells were permeabilized by incubation with 10% normal goat serum in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min. Cells were then washed twice for 10 min each in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum. Cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with a rabbit anti-KCNQ1 (Alomone Laboratories) channel or mouse anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma) antibodies. After a 3 × 5-min wash in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies, CY2-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Jackson Immunoresearch) and RRX-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch), respectively. Cells were viewed, and digital images were taken using a Zeiss 510 META confocal microscope using the 488-nm argon or 543-nm HeNe excitation laser lines. Biotinylation of surface proteins was carried out by incubating cells with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm EDTA (solution A) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by incubating cells for 5 min in solution A containing 20 mm glycine, followed by three washes in solution A. Cells were lysed in buffer P (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol (w/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v)), containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), for 1 h at 4 °C under rotation. Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated by incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed six times with buffer P. Proteins were eluted by incubation with sample buffer at room temperature and then resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted. Peptide samples were suspended at room temperature in a mixture of metal chloride salts containing Tris (10 mm), pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and a 20 μm concentration of the indicated metals for 2 h at 0.35 mg/ml. Subsequently, peptide was dialyzed for 16 h against the same buffer without metals. Samples were prepared for analysis by incubation in a hot water bath at 80 °C for 2 h with the following addition. One-ml volumes of concentrated nitric acid were added to 1-2-ml sample batches in polypropylene 50-ml tubes. Liquid residues were taken up in deionized water and made up to a 10-ml volume with the same solvent. Metal concentration in the acid extract was determined by ICP atomic emission spectrometry. An ICP atomic emission spectrometer with cross-flow nebulizer was used (Spectroflame Modula E from Spectro, Kleve, Germany). Oligomeric State of the KCNQ1 COOH Terminus-CaM Complex—Work by Pitt and co-workers (11Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) suggested previously that a soluble KCNQ1 COOH terminus-CaM complex is tetrameric using chemical cross-linking, consistent with the universal tetrameric structure of Kv channels. Using a similar molecular complex, comprising soluble COOH terminus and constitutively bound CaM (Fig. 1, B and C), we probed its oligomerization state (i.e. its molecular weight) by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. The results indicate that the complex is best modeled as a tetramer with four subunits of KCNQ1 COOH terminus and four bound molecules of CaM (Fig. 1D). Data analysis, assuming a single sedimenting solute species, yields a buoyant molecular weight of 54,000 ± 3000 (solid line). This value is very close to that calculated from the addition of the buoyant molecular weights of four molecules of the COOH terminus (4 × 8400) and four of CaM (4 × 4500). It is not compatible with a 4:2 complex (dotted line). Sedimentation velocity studies that evaluate homogeneity/dispersity of the same COOH terminus-CaM complex provide convincing evidence that the primary species (89-95% of the total loading concentration, varying by experiment) is this very same tetrameric complex (8.2 S) with a minor species that represents a higher molecular weight aggregate (11.4 S) (Fig. 1E). Importantly, there is no evidence of a free CaM species, indicating that CaM is stably bound, since measurements of CaM alone exhibit a symmetrical sharp distribution with a standard s value of 2.8 S, compatible with the expected value for monomeric CaM (Fig. 1E). No such peak is detected in the profile of the COOH terminus-CaM complex. The hydrodynamic behavior of the 4:4 COOH terminus-CaM complex (frictional ratio f/f0 = 1.8; see Ref. 29Waxman E. Laws W.R. Laue T.M. Nemerson Y. Ross J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) is compatible with the solute being an elongated, nonglobular protein. Moreover, calcium is not required for this assembly, since size exclusion chromatography of a COOH terminus-CaM1234 complex, utilizing a CaM mutant that does not bind calcium, behaves like a COOH terminus-CaMWT complex (Fig. 1F). CaM Organization—To explore the possibility that CaM may induce oligomerization by its association with the COOH-terminal proximal half, we coexpressed CaM with a protein segment spanning helix A and B but truncated afterward (Δ helices C-D plus CaM) (Fig. 1, B and C). Sedimentation velocity and size exclusion chromatography indicates that it behaves as a 1:1 complex of CaM to Δ helices C-D; i.e. CaM does not cross-link COOH terminus subunits, inducing their oligomerization (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. 1A), neither in the presence of calcium (1 mm) nor in its absence (5 mm EDTA). Since the intervening loop between helices A and B is long, binding by CaM of these two helices may be in either parallel or anti-parallel helical arrangements. Nevertheless, the loop is not necessary for CaM binding, since its removal does not prevent formation of the Δ loop-CaM complex (Fig. 1, B and C), consistent with an anti-parallel helix bundle as the target of CaM. Role of the Distal COOH Terminus (Helices C and D)—Earlier studies on KCNQ have assigned regions from the distal COOH terminus, encompassing sequences predicted to form the two helices C and D with what has been called an assembly or tetramerization domain. Both of these predicted he"
https://openalex.org/W1981513721,"Synonymous DNA substitution rates in the plant chloroplast genome are generally relatively slow and lineage dependent. Non-synonymous rates are usually even slower due to purifying selection acting on the genes. Positive selection is expected to speed up non-synonymous substitution rates, whereas synonymous rates are expected to be unaffected. Until recently, positive selection has seldom been observed in chloroplast genes, and large-scale structural rearrangements leading to gene duplications are hitherto supposed to be rare.We found high substitution rates in the exons of the plastid clpP1 gene in Oenothera (the Evening Primrose family) and three separate lineages in the tribe Sileneae (Caryophyllaceae, the Carnation family). Introns have been lost in some of the lineages, but where present, the intron sequences have substitution rates similar to those found in other introns of their genomes. The elevated substitution rates of clpP1 are associated with statistically significant whole-gene positive selection in three branches of the phylogeny. In two of the lineages we found multiple copies of the gene. Neighboring genes present in the duplicated fragments do not show signs of elevated substitution rates or positive selection. Although non-synonymous substitutions account for most of the increase in substitution rates, synonymous rates are also markedly elevated in some lineages. Whereas plant clpP1 genes experiencing negative (purifying) selection are characterized by having very conserved lengths, genes under positive selection often have large insertions of more or less repetitive amino acid sequence motifs.We found positive selection of the clpP1 gene in various plant lineages to correlated with repeated duplication of the clpP1 gene and surrounding regions, repetitive amino acid sequences, and increase in synonymous substitution rates. The present study sheds light on the controversial issue of whether negative or positive selection is to be expected after gene duplications by providing evidence for the latter alternative. The observed increase in synonymous substitution rates in some of the lineages indicates that the detection of positive selection may be obscured under such circumstances. Future studies are required to explore the functional significance of the large inserted repeated amino acid motifs, as well as the possibility that synonymous substitution rates may be affected by positive selection."

We analyzed the components of purified nuclear polyQ aggregates by mass spectrometry.

In vitro study revealed that TLS could directly bind to truncated N-terminal huntingtin (tNhtt) aggregates but could not bind to monomer GST-tNhtt with 18, 42, or 62Q, indicating that the tNhtt protein acquired the ability to sequester TLS after forming aggregates. Thioflavin T assay and electron microscopic study further supported the idea that TLS bound to tNhtt-42Q aggregates at the early stage of tNhtt-42Q amyloid formation.

These studies suggest that the components of AIPs reflect either the cellular defense against polyQ aggregates or the cellular machinery affected by polyQ aggregates. Therefore, identification of AIPs should help elucidate the process of aggregate formation, the cellular response to aggregates, and the mechanisms of cellular dysfunction caused by the polyQ aggregates, but the AIPs are still not fully uncovered. We have previously established a method to identify the components of nuclear polyQ AIPs from Neuro2a cells stably transfected with tNhtt-150Q-EGFP-NLS (HD150Q-NLS cells), which express a cDNA encoding htt exon 1 containing 150 CAG repeats and fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and nuclear localization signals (NLS) (15Doi H. Mitsui K. Kurosawa M. Machida Y. Kuroiwa Y. Nukina N. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using this method, we identified ubiquitin-interacting proteins, ubiquilin 1,2 and Tollip, as new AIPs and confirmed that the method was applicable to the analysis of AIPs. In this report, we extended our previous study and found that the RNA-binding protein TLS (translocated in liposarcoma) (16Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), also known as FUS (17Rabbitts T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), is the major component of nuclear polyQ aggregates, and its family proteins, EWS and TAF15, are also found in purified polyQ aggregates. TLS is associated with polyQ aggregates formed by tNhtt-150Q-EGFP-NLS and ataxin-3 with 130Q in Neuro2a and HeLa cells, and neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) in a mouse model of HD. In an in vitro assay, we showed that TLS can directly bind to polyQ aggregates in the early stage of amyloid formation but cannot bind to monomer GST-tNhtt fusion proteins with 18, 42, or 62Q, suggesting that TLS is sequestered to polyQ aggregates through the conformational change of expanded polyQ stretches. Mice—Heterozygous htt exon 1 transgenic male mice of the R6/2 (145 CAG repeats) strain (Jackson code, B6CBA-TgN (HD exon 1) 62) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). R6/2 mice and their age-matched controls were sacrificed, and their brains were collected. The mouse experiments were approved by the animal experiment committee of the RIKEN Brain Science Institute. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits against the following peptides. Anti-TLS antibodies Ab-TLS-M and Ab-TLS-C were generated against amino acids 260-274 and 501-518 of mouse TLS, respectively. An anti-EWS antibody, Ab-EWS-M, was generated against amino acids 349-363 of mouse EWS. Anti-TAF15 antibodies Ab-TAF15-M and Ab-TAF15-C were generated against amino acids 155-173 and 541-554 of mouse TAF15, respectively. An N- or a C-terminal cysteine residue was added to each peptide for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or to SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce). These polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified using the SulfoLink kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Monoclonal anti-htt (EM48; MAB5374), monoclonal anti-polyglutamine (1C2; MAB1574), and monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (MAB1510) were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); monoclonal anti-GFP (clones 7.1 and 13.1) was from Roche Applied Sciences; monoclonal anti-v5 (R960-25) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-v5 (R961-25) were from Invitrogen; monoclonal anti-Hsp70 (SPA-810) was from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada); and rabbit polyclonal anti-TATA-binding protein (TBP) (SC-204), goat polyclonal anti-EWS (Ab-EWS-C; SC-6532), and anti-lamin B (SC-6217) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

To differentiate the Neuro2a cells, N6, 2′-O-dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was added to the medium, and to induce the expression of the tNhtt-polyQ-EGFP-NLS proteins, ponasterone A (Invitrogen) was added. To isolate nuclear aggregates or to prepare a nuclear soluble fraction, HD150Q-NLS cells were plated in 150-mm dishes and cultured overnight. The medium was supplemented with 5 mm dbcAMP or with both 5 mm dbcAMP and 1 μm ponasterone A. After 3 days, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. HD150Q-NLS cells treated with 5 mm dbcAMP were designated HD150Q-NLS-D cells, and HD150Q-NLS cells treated with both 5 mm dbcAMP and 1 μm ponasterone A were designated HD150Q-NLS-D/I cells. Transfection of Plasmids and siRNA—cDNA for mouse TLS, EWS, and TAF15 were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from the total RNA fraction of adult mouse brain. Each PCR product amplified from cDNA was subcloned into TOPO-pcDNA3.1-v5/His mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). To make TLS deletion mutants, each deletion fragment indicated in the figure was amplified from pcDNA3.1-TLS-v5/His and was subcloned into TOPO-pcDNA3.1-v5/His.

(Austin, TX). siRNA for luciferase (D-001100-01-20) was purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). siRNAs were mixed at the indicated concentrations and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Isolation of Nuclear polyQ Aggregates and Identification of Aggregate-interacting Proteins by Mass Spectrometry—Nuclear polyQ aggregates were purified from HD 150Q-NLS cells as a final insoluble fraction from sequential extraction of nuclear proteins (15Doi H. Mitsui K. Kurosawa M. Machida Y. Kuroiwa Y. Nukina N. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The final nuclear insoluble fractions of HD150Q-NLS-D and HD150Q-NLS-D/I cells were boiled in the sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain (Molecular Probes), and bands in the gels were detected on a transilluminator. Each visible band of the insoluble fraction of HD150Q-NLS-D/I cells was excised. In the case of the insoluble fraction of HD150Q-NLS-D cells, gel regions corresponding to the molecular weight of the visible bands of the HD 150Q-NLS-D/I insoluble fraction were also excised. The in-gel digestion and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis were carried out as described previously (15Doi H. Mitsui K. Kurosawa M. Machida Y. Kuroiwa Y. Nukina N. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry data were analyzed to predict the candidate sequence for the AIPs using MASCOT software (Matrix Science) and a public domain protein data base (National Center for Biotechnology Information) (20Mitsui K. Doi H. Nukina N. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 412: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Preparation of Nuclear Soluble Fractions—To prepare the nuclear soluble fractions, we used, with minor modifications, a previously reported method that was developed for the preparation of nuclear extract and that was shown to be useful for in vitro transcription (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Pelleted 1.2 × 108 HD 150Q-NLS-D and HD 150Q-NLS-D/I cells were suspended in 5 ml of 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,000 rpm, resuspended in 2 ml of same buffer, and lysed by 10 strokes with a glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 rpm to pellet the nuclei. After the supernatants were removed, the pellets were subjected to a second centrifugation for 20 min at 25,000 × g to remove residual cytoplasmic material, and the resulting pellets were designated as crude nuclei. These crude nuclei were resuspended in 500 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences) and homogenized by 10 strokes with a glass Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with a vortex and centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 × g. The resulting supernatants were dialyzed overnight against a 300 times volume of 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The dialysates were used as nuclear soluble fractions. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates, nuclear fractions, nuclear soluble fractions, and purified aggregates were prepared as described above. These materials (20 μg/lane each fraction or 1 × 106 nuclear aggregate particles/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The antibody dilutions were 1:2000 for anti-GFP, anti-v5-HRP, and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and 1:500 for anti-Hsp70, anti-TBP, anti-LaminB, and EM48 in 0.05% Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline (TBST). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Human Brain—Human brain tissue was obtained from the Brain Collection at the University of Tsukuba. The full consent of the family was obtained at the time of autopsy, and the Hospital Human Subjects Ethics Committee approved the study. The HD case studied in this paper was examined by a neuropathologist to confirm HD pathology and assign a pathological grade (22Vonsattel J.P. Myers R.H. Stevens T.J. Ferrante R.J. Bird E.D. Richardson Jr., E.P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1985; 44: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry—Neuro2a cells growing on four-well chamber slides were co-transfected with 0.25 μg of TOPO-pcDNA3.1/v5-His vector containing TLS, TLS deletion mutants, EWS or TAF15, and tNhtt-153Q-EGFP-NLS. One day after transfection, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS. The frozen brains of R6/2 mice mounted in Tissue-Tek were cut into 10-μm sections with a freezing microtome. Paraffin-embedded human brain tissue sections from HD patient were deparaffinized and autoclaved in PBS for 5 min to enhance the staining. The immunostaining procedures were as described in our previous study (8Jana N.R. Tanaka M. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 15Doi H.

Uchikawa C. Suzuki T. Kurosawa M. Ikeda T. Tamaoka A. Sakurai T. Nukina N. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 518-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The antibody dilutions were 1:1000 for anti-v5 and monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (for brain tissue, anti-ubiquitin antibody dilution was 1:20000.) and 1:500 for monoclonal EM48 antibody and Alexa-488 or Alexa-546 conjugated secondary antibody in TBST. In some cases, staining was carried out using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Aggregate Counting—HD150Q-NLS growing on 12-well plates were transfected with plasmids or siRNAs in the amounts indicated in the figures, treated with 5 mm dbcAMP and 1 μm ponasterone A for 3 days, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Plasmid-transfected cells were immunostained with anti-v5 followed by nuclear staining with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342, trihydrochloride, and trihydrate (Molecular Probes) in PBS, and siRNA-transfected cells were stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342, trihydrochloride, and trihydrate in PBS. The quantification of the aggregation was performed by high content screening using an ArrayScan®VTI high content screening reader (Cellomics Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). The ArrayScan®VTI is able to measure the fluorescence intensity within each single cell in the visual field. A Target Activation Cellomics BioApplication V2 protocol was used, and the data were analyzed by Cellomics vHCS™:View software. Protein Purification and in Vitro Binding Study—Escherichia coli BL21 (RP) carrying pGEX-6P-2 expression plasmids of tNhtt-18Q, 42Q, or 62Q was grown to an A600 of 0.5 at 37 °C and then induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) for 2 days at 15 °C. Cultures of induced bacteria were centrifuged at 2,300 × g for 30 min, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in a three-times volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol) containing 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 20 ng/ml DNase I and protease inhibitor mixture, and stored at -80 °C. Bacterial lysates were thawed at 4 °C and centrifuged at 43,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatants were adjusted to pH 7.5 and applied to a column containing 25 ml of Glutathione-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham Biosciences), and the column was extensively washed with buffer A. The bound GST fusion protein was eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm glutathione. As for His-tagged TLS (His-TLS), E. coli BL21 (RP) carrying pET-15b expression plasmids of TLS and TLS deletion mutant were grown to an A600 of 0.8 at 37 °C and then induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 24 h at 20 °C. Cultures of induced bacteria were collected, resuspended, and divided into a supernatant and pellet using the same procedures as for GST-tNhtt proteins. The pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 3% Triton X-100, stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. This step was repeated three times, and the pellets were washed with MilliQ water and centrifuged. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 6 m guanidine and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were adjusted to pH 7.5 and applied to an nickel column, and then the nickel column was extensively washed with buffer A. The bound His-tagged protein was eluted with buffer A containing 0.2 m imidazole. The purified proteins were stocked at -80 °C. 100 μl of 50% v/v Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated with 200 μl of 50 μg/ml GST-tNhtt-18Q, 42Q, or 62Q in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol) at 4 °C for 60 min with rotation and then placed in a spin column, centrifuged, and washed twice with 200 μl of buffer B. Each resin in the spin column was mixed with 200 μl of 50 μg/ml His-TLS in buffer B, incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation, centrifuged, washed twice with 200 μl of buffer B, and eluted three times with 200 μl of buffer B containing 10 mm glutathione. Each through-fraction was collected and analyzed. A complementary experiment was carried out for the confirmation. 100 μl of 50% v/v, BD TALON (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was used to bind to His-TLS, and the binding assay was performed using the procedure described above. Far Western Blot Analysis and Filter Trap Assay—200 μl of 50 μg/ml GST-tNhtt-18Q, 42Q, or 62Q in buffer B was incubated with or without 2 units of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience) at 4 °C for 2 h. Where indicated, another incubation at 30 °C for 16 h was added. The reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of SDS sample buffers into each sample. Each sample was boiled for 5 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by the transfer to a PVDF membrane. For the filter trap assay, 200 μl of the indicated concentrations of GST-tNhtt fusion proteins were incubated with 2 units of PreScission protease at 30 °C for 16 h. Each sample was filtered by a cellulose acetate membrane. After the PVDF membranes or cellulose acetate membranes were blocked with TBST containing 2% nonfat milk, the membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies or incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.01 μm His-TLS in TBST. The membranes incubated with His-TLS solutions were washed extensively with TBST and probed with Ab-TLS-C. 1C2 was diluted 1:2000 in TBST, and the dilutions of the other antibodies were the same as used in the Western blot analysis. Thioflavin T Assay—The thioflavin T assay was carried out essentially as described previously (24Chien P. DePace A.H. Collins S.R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 424: 948-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Stocked GST-tNhtt-42Q and His-TLS were diluted and adjusted with buffer B and then filtered through a PVDF membrane with 22 μm pores before the assay. Each protein solution was mixed with 20 μl of 250 μm thioflavin T (Sigma-Aldrich) in 250 mm glycine (pH 8.0), and buffer B was added for a total volume of 200 μl. Where indicated, 10 μl of 0.2 unit/μl PreScission protease in buffer B and/or sonicated tNhtt fibrils was included in the solutions. Fluorescence was monitored using a 96-well fluorescence plate reader Spectra Max M2 (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA; 442-nm excitation and 485-nm emission). 96-well plates were tightly covered with polyolefin sealing tape (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) to prevent evaporation of solutions. Thioflavin T assays were carried out at 30 °C and read automatically every 2 min with 5 s of shaking between measurements. Electron Microscopy—The negative staining for the tNhtt-42Q fibrils and TLS was performed as reported previously (25Tanaka M. Machida Y. Nishikawa Y. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Fujisawa T. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34717-34724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the images were recorded on a LEO 912AB electron microscope (LEO, Cambridge, UK). Each of the indicated reactants was spun down by centrifugation at 186,000 × g for 30 min, and resuspended in PBS. The samples on copper grids were treated with EM48, 1C2, or Ab-TLS-M antibodies, followed by 5- or 10-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibodies. Identification of TET Family Proteins in Purified tNhtt-150Q-EGFP-NLS Aggregates by Mass Spectrometry—Nuclear polyQ aggregates were isolated from the nuclei of the HD150Q-NLS cells by sequential extractions of soluble nuclear proteins as described in our previous study (15Doi H. Mitsui K. Kurosawa M. Machida Y. Kuroiwa Y. Nukina N. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE of the purified nuclear polyQ aggregates from HD-150Q-NLS-D/I (Fig. 1B, differentiated and induced to express polyQ proteins) cells, each band was excised as indicated in Fig. 1B (left panel, arrows), and the proteins in gel pieces were digested with trypsin and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis. As a result, we identified TLS as the major component of the major band and the gel-excluded materials (Fig. 1). We suspected that TLS was one of the major nuclear polyQ aggregate-interacting proteins. EWS and TAF15, which have high similarity to TLS (Fig. 1A, right panel) and which are known as TET family proteins (along with TLS), were also found in purified nuclear polyQ aggregates (Fig. 1). But EWS and TAF15 were not found as the major component of each band. The major component of each band was heat shock 70 protein (Hsc70) in both cases. TET family proteins were not found in the insoluble fraction of HD150Q-NLS-D (differentiated, but not induced) cells. TET Family Proteins Were Bound to polyQ Aggregates in neuro2a Cells through a QSY-rich Domain—We performed Western blot analysis to verify the presence of these proteins in the aggregates. To this end, we generated polyclonal antibodies Ab-TLS-M and Ab-TLS-C against TLS, Ab-EWS-M against EWS, and Ab-TAF15-M and Ab-TAF15-C against TAF15 (Fig. 2A). We also used a commercially available goat polyclonal anti-EWS antibody (Ab-EWS-C). Western blot analysis confirmed that TLS, EWS, and TAF15 were co-purified with nuclear polyQ aggregates (Fig. 2B). These findings suggested that TLS, EWS, and TAF15 were capable of binding to the polyQ aggregates and shifted to the SDS-insoluble fraction upon formation of polyQ aggregates. Consistent with the mass spectrometry results, in the TET family proteins, TLS was present at the highest level in the purified aggregates fraction. To check whether TET family proteins co-localize with polyQ aggregates, we generated expression plasmids of TET family proteins. An immunocytochemical study revealed that the overexpressed full-length TLS-v5/His, EWS-v5/His, and TAF15-v5/His co-localized with nuclear polyQ aggregates (Fig. 2D, left panel). Next, to determine the aggregate-interacting domain of TET family proteins, we generated expression plasmids of TLS deletion mutants as indicated in Fig. 2C. TLS deletion mutants that contained the N-terminal QSY-rich domain of TLS (TLS-N-162-v5/His∼TLS-N-440-v5/his) co-localized with polyQ aggregates of HD150Q-NLS cells (Fig. 2D; TLS (N-162) and data n"
https://openalex.org/W1963542699,"Tuberculosis causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. DC-SIGN, encoded by CD209, is a receptor capable of binding and internalizing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Previous studies have reported that the CD209 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-336A/G exerts an effect on CD209 expression and is associated with human susceptibility to dengue, HIV-1 and tuberculosis in humans. The present study investigates the role of the CD209 -336A/G variant in susceptibility to tuberculosis in a large sample of individuals from sub-Saharan Africa.A total of 2,176 individuals enrolled in tuberculosis case-control studies from four sub-Saharan Africa countries were genotyped for the CD209 -336A/G SNP (rs4804803). Significant overall protection against pulmonary tuberculosis was observed with the -336G allele when the study groups were combined (n = 914 controls vs. 1262 cases, Mantel-Haenszel 2 x 2 chi(2) = 7.47, P = 0.006, odds ratio = 0.86, 95%CI 0.77-0.96). In addition, the patients with -336GG were associated with a decreased risk of cavitory tuberculosis, a severe form of tuberculosis disease (n = 557, Pearson's 2x2 chi(2) = 17.34, P = 0.00003, odds ratio = 0.42, 95%CI 0.27-0.65). This direction of association is opposite to a previously observed result in a smaller study of susceptibility to tuberculosis in a South African Coloured population, but entirely in keeping with the previously observed protective effect of the -336G allele.This study finds that the CD209 -336G variant allele is associated with significant protection against tuberculosis in individuals from sub-Saharan Africa and, furthermore, cases with -336GG were significantly less likely to develop tuberculosis-induced lung cavitation. Previous in vitro work demonstrated that the promoter variant -336G allele causes down-regulation of CD209 mRNA expression. Our present work suggests that decreased levels of the DC-SIGN receptor may therefore be protective against both clinical tuberculosis in general and cavitory tuberculosis disease in particular. This is consistent with evidence that Mycobacteria can utilize DC-SIGN binding to suppress the protective pro-inflammatory immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2018562330,"There is increasing evidence that modified phospholipid products of low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation mediate inflammatory processes within vulnerable atherosclerotic lesions. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is present in vulnerable plaque regions where it acts on phospholipid oxidation products to generate the pro-inflammatory lysophsopholipids and oxidized non-esterified fatty acids. This association together with identification of circulating Lp-PLA2 levels as an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease provides a rationale for development of Lp-PLA2 inhibitors as therapy for atherosclerosis. Here we report a systematic analysis of the effects of in vitro oxidation in the absence and presence of an Lp-PLA2 inhibitor on the phosphatidylcholine (PC) composition of human LDL. Mass spectrometry identifies three classes of PC whose concentration is significantly enhanced during LDL oxidation. Of these, a series of molecules, represented by peaks in the m/z range 594-666 and identified as truncated PC oxidation products by accurate mass measurements using an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer, are the predominant substrates for Lp-PLA2. A second series of oxidation products, represented by peaks in the m/z range 746-830 and identified by LTQ Orbitrap analysis as non-truncated oxidized PCs, are quantitatively more abundant but are less efficient Lp-PLA2 substrates. The major PC products of Lp-PLA2, saturated and mono-unsaturated lyso-PC, constitute the third class.

Despite this interest, the consequences of Lp-PLA2 inhibition at the molecular level have not been systematically explored either in vitro or in vivo. Here we have used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to characterize the (quantitative) changes observed in phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species during in vitro oxidation of purified human LDL and the further modifications caused by the presence of an irreversible Lp-PLA2 inhibitor, SB222657 (29Macphee C.H.

Our results distinguish two classes of PC products of LDL oxidation on the basis of greater or lesser efficiency of hydrolysis by Lp-PLA2 and confirm that saturated and monounsaturated LPCs are the predominant PC products of the reaction.

Isolation and Oxidation of LDL—LDL was isolated from normal human plasma (obtained from volunteers with informed consent and stored at -70 °C) by ultracentrifugation in successive KBr gradients (37Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Each preparation was from plasma from a single donor. Briefly, thawed plasma (8 × 4.8 ml in 8 Beckman 355646 10-ml polycarbonate tubes) was adjusted to 1.019 g/ml by the addition of 0.2 ml per tube of 1.34 g/ml KBr solution (containing 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 75,000 rpm (Beckman OptimaMax ultracentrifuge, MLA.80 rotor) at 4 °C for 14 h. The top 1 ml from each tube (containing very low density lipoprotein) was removed and discarded; the remainders from each tube were pooled, mixed thoroughly, and 3.25 ml was pipetted into each of eight fresh polycarbonate tubes. The density was adjusted to 1.063 g/ml by the addition of 0.595 ml of 1.34 g/ml KBr (containing 1 mm EDTA), and volume was adjusted to 5 ml by the addition of 1.063 g/ml KBr (containing 1 mm EDTA). Tubes were centrifuged again (as before), and the top 1 ml from each (containing LDL) was pooled and dialyzed overnight in a Pierce Slide-a-lyser cassette (3-12 ml, 3500 molecular weight cut off) against 2 changes of phosphate-buffered saline (4 liter each) containing 1 mm EDTA. Dialysate was sterilized by filtration through a 0.2-μm unit (Minisart) and stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 4 weeks before use. Before oxidation, LDL samples were dialyzed (as above) into phosphate-buffered saline without EDTA and pipetted into 4 × 1-ml aliquots in sterile screw cap microcentrifuge tubes. Lp-PLA2 inhibitor (SB222657, 300 nm) or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) was added, and tubes were vortexed and left at room temperature for 20 min. For non-oxidized LDL EDTA (1 mm) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, 50 μg/ml) were added before the addition of 40 μm copper sulfate; for oxidized samples, EDTA and BHT were omitted. All tubes were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C; EDTA and BHT were then added to the oxidized samples. Treated LDL samples were stored at -20 °C before lipid extraction. Lipid Extraction of LDL Samples—Lipids were extracted from 0.8 ml of treated LDL using the chloroform/methanol procedure of Bligh and Dyer (38Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42904) Google Scholar). A mixture of dimyristoyl PC (PC14:0/14:0, 10 nmol) and heptadecanoyl LPC (LPC17:0, 1 nmol) were added in 100 μl of chloroform to act as internal calibration standards. Chloroform (0.9 ml) and methanol (2 ml) were then added to each sample in a screw-top glass tube (Corning), and samples were shaken vigorously to form a single phase. A biphasic mixture was formed by the addition of a further 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml water followed by vigorous shaking and centrifugation at 1000 rpm in an Allegra 6 bench-top centrifuge using GH3.8 swingout rotor (Beckman). The lower (chloroform-rich) phase was carefully recovered into a glass vial, dried at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen gas, and stored at -20 °C for a maximum of 7 days before MS analysis. Using a comprehensive range of synthetic standards, we determined that recovery of PC was 86.5%, and that of lysoPC was 78.1%. Consequently, the use of the internal recovery standards PC14:0/14:0 and lysoPC17:0 provided a quantitative estimation of PC and lysoPC concentrations, respectively (data not shown). Lipid Extraction of Carotid Artery Plaque Samples—Human carotid artery plaques were obtained with informed consent at endarterectomy. The plaques were segmented, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Frozen segments of plaque (∼200 mg each) were pulverized using a ball-grinding method (Mikro-Dismembrator, Sartorius). Approximately 100 mg of frozen ground artery powder was added to 2 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of methanol together with internal standards dimyristoyl PC (40 nmol), heptadecanoyl LPC (4 nmol), and butylated hydroxytoluene (50 μg/ml). Samples were then homogenized with an Ultraturrex homogenizer for 2 min with cooling in an ice bath. After further addition of 3 ml of methanol and 1.6 ml of 0.9% (wt:vol) NaCl, extracts were vigorously shaken to obtain a single phase. Chloroform (2 ml) and water (2 ml) were then added with further shaking to form two phases which were then separated by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min. The lower chloroform layer was decanted, dried under nitrogen gas, and stored as above. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Dried lipid extracts were dissolved in solvent (methanol:chloroform:water: ammonia, 70:20:8:2, vol:vol, 500 μl) and introduced by direct infusion at a flow rate of 10 μl/min into the electrospray ionization interface of a Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Wythenshaw, UK). Collision gas-induced dissociation of all protonated PC, oxidized PC, and LPC species generated a diagnostic phosphorylcholine fragment of m/z = 184 (39Hunt A.N. Clark G.T. Attard G.S. Postle A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8492-8499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consequently, diagnostic precursor scans of m/z = 184 were used to quantify PC species. Because previous reports suggest that the ionization efficiency of polyunsaturated PC species was concentration-dependent compared with monounsaturated species (40Koivusalo M. Haimi P. Heikinheimo L. Kostiainen R. Somerharju P. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 663-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated this possible differential ionization effect under our experimental conditions. The ionization response of PC16:0/20:4 was identical to those of PC16:0/16:0, PC18:1/18:1, and PC16:0/18:2 over more than 2 orders of magnitude, confirming that the analysis of different molecular species was quantitative within the concentration range of samples analyzed in this study (data not shown). Identities of fatty acyl compositions of resolved PC species were determined by product ion scans under conditions of negative ionization. Protonated PC species do not readily generate negative ions, and consequently [M-15]- species formed by loss of a methyl group from the choline head group were selected for fragmentation. Mass spectrometric data were obtained at unit resolution and processed using MassLynx software (Micromass). After conversion to centroid format, ion intensities were corrected for the 13C effect and the progressive decreasing formation of the diagnostic ion with increasing molecular mass (39Hunt A.N. Clark G.T. Attard G.S. Postle A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8492-8499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Further Characterization of PC Species by Exact Mass Measurement—Exact mass measurement was performed on a hybrid linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap™, Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) used in both positive and negative ion modes. The sample was introduced via infusion at 5 μl/min using an integrated syringe pump and ionized in a standard electrospray source with sheath gas flow of 10 units, capillary temperature of 275 °C, and spray voltage of 4.5 kV. The capillary and tube lens voltages for positive mode analysis were set to 50 and 120 V, respectively. In the negative mode the capillary voltage was -50 V; the tube lens voltage was set to -250 V for most analyses and to -189 V when a chlorinated adduct was a preferred species. The linear ion trap operated with a target value 3 e4; the corresponding target value for the orbitrap mass analyzer was 2 e5. The instrument was calibrated externally according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The spectra were acquired under operator control with the resolving power settings of 100,000 at m/z 400 (full width at half-maximum) corresponding to the acquisition time period of 1.5 s/scan. The mass accuracy for all of the species of oxidized PCs identified in this study was better than 1.5 ppm. Statistics—Absolute measured PC concentrations for all LDL samples were expressed relative to total PC concentration (as a percentage) in the corresponding non-oxidized LDL (native) sample. The figures shown all represent the mean ± S.D. of six LDL samples. Levels of PC subclasses in native LDL (nLDL), oxidized LDL (oxLDL), and LDL oxidized in the presence of SB222657 (ox + iLDL) were compared by t test (assuming unequal variances) using Microsoft Excel data analysis tools. Oxidation of LDL Phosphatidylcholine—Incubation with 40 μm CuSO4 (in the absence of EDTA and BHT) for 20 h caused substantial and reproducible alterations to the PC molecular species composition of LDL. Oxidation under the conditions described for 20 h was assumed to have proceeded to completion on the basis that no further enhancements of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances or lipid hydroperoxides were detected for oxidation reactions extended beyond this time (data not shown). Representative mass spectra of LDL PC incubated with and without BHT/EDTA (in addition to CuSO4) are shown in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively, as diagnostic precursor scans of the m/z = 184 phosphorylcholine fragment ion in positive ionization. These spectra are displayed at equivalent ion signal responses, normalized to the base peak (m/z 758) for the native unoxidized sample. They demonstrate that oxidation (i.e. incubation with CuSO4 in the absence of BHT and EDTA) decreased ion intensities of LDL PC species at m/z = 758, 782, 786, 806, and 810 and increased intensities of ions at m/z = 772, 774, 788, 790, 800, 802, 816, 818, 828, 830, 842, and 848. Supplemental Table 1 summarizes the exact masses and elemental formulae of the native non-oxidized PC and LPC species, determined by LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometry, together with compositions calculated from P184 scans and molecular species identified from the fatty acyl ions generated by collision-induced dissociation fragmentation of the [M-15]- precursor ions in negative ionization. Oxidation also increased the ion abundances of LPC species at m/z = 496 and 524 and of a series of ions from m/z = 594 to 666 (see Fig. 1, region in 36× magnification). Identities of the oxidation products are discussed below. Altered concentrations of PC species after copper-induced oxidation are shown in Table 1 (columns 1 and 3) as the means of six LDL preparations, stratified by degree of unsaturation and lipid class. For diradyl PC species, the extent of the oxidation-induced decrease in concentration correlated well with the degree of fatty acyl unsaturation. Thus, there was loss of most PC species containing arachidonate (20:4) or docosa-hexaenoate (22:6), significant loss of di- and tri-unsaturated fatty acid-containing species, and negligible change in observed concentration of the major mono-unsaturated species, 16:0/18:1 PC. The concentration of measurable total PC after oxidation was around 20% lower than in the native sample, suggesting that a proportion of the PC had degraded (during the oxidation reaction) to a point where it no longer contained a choline head group or had formed species (possibly protein adducts) that were either no longer extractable or were not detectable in the range analyzed.TABLE 1Composition of native and copper-oxidized LDL phosphatidylcholine in the presence and absence of Lp-PLA2 inhibitorLDLLDL + SB222657oxLDLoxLDL + SB222657Saturated and monounsaturated speciesPC16:0/16:00.61 ± 0.090.60 ± 0.150.84 ± 0.180.81 ± 0.14PC16:0/16:10.43 ± 0.150.45 ± 0.140.59 ± 0.240.56 ± 0.15PC16:1/16:10.14 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.030.09 ± 0.020.11 ± 0.03PC16:0/18:110.61 ± 1.9210.63 ± 2.3412.27 ± 4.1811.01 ± 2.62PC18:0/18:12.64 ± 0.222.64 ± 0.222.64 ± 0.222.64 ± 0.22Total14.43 ± 2.1714.45 ± 2.6116.44 ± 4.5715.15 ± 2.85Di-unsaturated speciesPC16:0/18:221.27 ± 2.7421.55 ± 3.337.46 ± 3.036.70 ± 2.20PC18:0/18:213.12 ± 1.4313.13 ± 1.655.86 ± 1.645.38 ± 1.12PC16:1/18:20.73 ± 0.200.73 ± 0.170.37 ± 0.150.34 ± 0.11PC18:1/18:27.25 ± 1.087.33 ± 0.971.38 ± 0.671.23 ± 0.37Total42.37 ± 4.4042.75 ± 5.3615.07 ± 5.3713.65 ± 3.69Polyunsaturated speciesPC18:0/20:32.27 ± 0.352.21 ± 0.370.48 ± 0.160.51 ± 0.12PC16:0/20:48.75 ± 1.229.00 ± 1.380.35 ± 0.200.29 ± 0.14PC18:0/20:45.21 ± 1.005.31 ± 1.060.31 ± 0.140.31 ± 0.10PC16:1/20:41.64 ± 0.551.73 ± 0.520.07 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.02PC18:1/20:43.31 ± 0.743.24 ± 0.630.42 ± 0.030.50 ± 0.09PC18:0/22:50.68 ± 0.230.67 ± 0.210.28 ± 0.070.30 ± 0.04PC16:0/22:66.79 ± 2.226.77 ± 2.290.55 ± 0.090.89 ± 0.22PC18:0/22:62.39 ± 0.892.35 ± 0.930.48 ± 0.120.61 ± 0.08Total31.05 ± 6.3431.27 ± 6.542.93 ± 0.543.49 ± 0.59Alkylacyl PC5.06 ± 0.425.12 ± 0.862.39 ± 0.382.99 ± 0.36LysoPC3.63 ± 1.163.60 ± 1.1516.72 ± 3.918.60 ± 4.01Long chain oxPC3.34 ± 0.763.49 ± 0.7128.76 ± 4.1231.93 ± 2.81Short chain oxPC0.13 ± 0.730.12 ± 0.030.49 ± 0.091.19 ± 0.39 Open table in a new tab Oxidation increased the concentrations (quantified as the percentage of the total PC measured in the corresponding native LDL) of three separate categories of PC that are likely to be the result of oxidative modification of diradyl PC species. The largest observed increases were to species detected over a range between m/z 772 and 848 (“long chain oxidized PC”). These species, presumed to be products of oxygen addition at double bonds of polyunsaturated acyl moieties (see below), were present in relatively small amounts in nLDL (total of all species 3.34%) but were increased nearly 9-fold in absolute terms after oxidation (to 28.8%, p < 0.001). Second, oxidation significantly increased concentrations of saturated and monounsaturated LPC species from a total of 3.05% in nLDL to 16.38% in oxLDL (p < 0.001). Concentrations of all the di- and polyunsaturated LPC species were substantially decreased. Finally, oxidation also increased concentrations of species detected at m/z values between those of the LPC and diradyl PC in the range m/z 594-666 (total 0.13% in nLDL and 0.49% in oxLDL; p < 0.005) that are likely to represent oxidatively truncated products of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing PC species (“short chain oxidized PC,” see below). The Role of Lp-PLA2 during LDL Oxidation—We examined the possible actions of Lp-PLA2 during LDL oxidation by including an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme (SB222657, 300 nm) in the oxidation reaction; the data are presented in column 4 of Tables 1 and 2. The consequences of Lp-PLA2 inhibition on levels of the three classes of PC whose concentrations were enhanced during oxidation are summarized in Fig. 2. Generation of LPC (saturated and monounsaturated species) was strongly but incompletely inhibited by SB222657 (oxLDL, 16.38%; ox + iLDL, 8.30%; p < 0.005), showing that these are the major LPC products of Lp-PLA2 activity (Fig. 3, upper panel). The presence of inhibitor had no significant effect on the oxidation-mediated reduction of the di- and polyunsaturated LPC species. Importantly, the PC species in the m/z 594-666 region of the 184 precursor spectrum, whose levels were increased by oxidation, were all further enhanced by at least 2-fold in the presence of inhibitor (Fig. 2, center panel; total 0.49% in oxLDL and 1.19% in ox + iLDL; p < 0.005). This result strongly suggested that all of these ion peaks represent (at least in part) molecules that are substrates of Lp-PLA2. The inhibitor also further enhanced concentrations of the higher mass PC species characteristic of LDL oxidation, although the proportional increase in these species was considerably less than that observed for the lower m/z products (total in oxLDL 28.8%; ox + iLDL 31.9%; not significant; Fig. 2, lower panel), suggesting that species constituting the bulk of the PC detected in this region are less efficiently hydrolyzed by Lp-PLA2 during LDL oxidation.TABLE 2Identities and compositions of oxidized phosphatidylcholine species in oxidized LDLExact massElemental formulaLDLLDL + SB222657oxLDLoxLDL + SB222657Oxidized lysoPC species534.3188C26H49O8NP0.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.09 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.02536.3342C26H51O8NP0.01 ± 0.000.01 ± 0.000.33 ± 0.100.20 ± 0.06538.3499C2"

In this study, we found that snapin, which binds SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25,000 Da) and enhances the association of the SNARE complex with synaptotagmin, is an interacting partner for both wild type and mutant torsinA. Snapin co-localized with endogenous torsinA on dense core granules in PC12 cells and was recruited to perinuclear inclusions containing mutant ΔE-torsinA in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In view of these observations, synaptic vesicle recycling was analyzed using the lipophilic dye FM1-43 and an antibody directed against an intravesicular epitope of synaptotagmin I. We found that overexpression of wild type torsinA negatively affects synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Conversely, overexpression of ΔE-torsinA in neuroblastoma cells increases FM1-43 uptake. Knockdown of snapin and/or torsinA using small interfering RNAs had a similar inhibitory effect on the exo-endocytic process. In addition, down-regulation of torsinA causes the persistence of synaptotagmin I on the plasma membrane, which closely resembles the effect observed by the overexpression of the ΔE-torsinA mutant. Altogether, these findings suggest that torsinA plays a role together with snapin in regulated exocytosis and that ΔE-torsinA exerts its pathological effects through a loss of function mechanism. This may affect neuronal uptake of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, playing a role in the development of dystonic movements.

There is no evidence for neurodegeneration in DYT1 dystonia, implying that abnormal movements are caused by a functional neuronal defect (4Rostasy K. Augood S.J. Hewett J.W. Leung J.C. Sasaki H.

All cases of typical DYT1 dystonia are caused by an in-frame GAG deletion (ΔGAG302/303; ΔE) in DYT1 gene, resulting in the loss of a glutamic acid in the C-terminal region of the encoded protein, torsinA (1Ozelius L.J.

Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian neuronal cells, torsinA is found throughout the cytoplasm, neurite processes, and growth cones (6Kamm C. Boston H. Hewett J.

In contrast, in cells overexpressing the mutant (ΔE-torsinA), the protein is redistributed from ER to NE and accumulates in large perinuclear membranous inclusions, which appeared to arise from the nuclear envelope (7Hewett J.

TorsinA-positive inclusions have been found in the midbrain of DYT1 patients, suggesting that they are relevant to the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia (15McNaught K.S. Kapustin A. Jackson T.

In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, ΔE-enriched inclusions contain the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), a membrane-associated protein involved in loading dopamine vesicles (14Misbahuddin A.

Other indirect evidence for abnormal dopaminergic function in DYT1 dystonia comes from cell models showing that torsinA affects the membrane distribution of the dopamine transporter and influences the activation of dopaminergic D2 receptors in a transgenic mouse model (16Torres G.E.

Consistent with these observations, torsinA is highly expressed in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (18Augood S.J. Martin D.M. Ozelius L.J. Breakefield X.O. Penney Jr., J.B.

To investigate the role of torsinA further, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using full-length wt-torsinA and ΔE-torsinA as bait. Snapin, a SNAP25 (synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa)-binding protein (21Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), was identified and its interaction with both wild type and mutant torsinA confirmed by in vitro and in vivo assays. Snapin is thought to promote the maturation/priming of synaptic vesicles (SVs) by interacting with components of the SNARE complex (21Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 22Chheda M.G. Ashery U. Thakur P. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In view of this observation, we investigated whether overexpression of wild type or mutant torsinA affects SV recycling in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, to understand the functional link between torsinA and snapin, we examined the effects of siRNA-based knockdown of both proteins. Our findings suggest that overexpression of wt-torsinA as well as knockdown of the endogenous torsinA negatively affects SV turnover, whereas ΔE-torsinA appears to act as a loss of function mutant by enhancing synaptic membrane turnover.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from DAKO UK (Ely, UK) and ECL was from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK). Cell Culture—SH-SY5Y cell lines stably transfected with pcDNA3.1, containing either wild type DYT1, GAG-deleted DYT1 (DYT1-ΔE) or no insert (14Misbahuddin A. Placzek M.R. Taanman J.W. Gschmeissner S. Schiavo G. Cooper J.M. Warner T.T. Mov. Disord. 2005; 20: 432-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were grown in 1:1 mixture of Eagle's minimal essential medium (Promochem, Middlesex, UK), Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2 under selective conditions (0.4 mg/ml G418; Invitrogen). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate the baits, human full-length DYT1 and DYT1-ΔE cDNAs were inserted in-frame into the HindIII and BamHI sites of the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). The bait was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y187 strain (MATa), which was then mated with AH109 yeast strain (MATa) pretransformed with an adult human brain cDNA library. Positive clones were selected for growth on Ade-/His-/Trp-/Leu-/α-galactosidase plates. Plasmid DNA was isolated and transformed in Escherichia coli using pGEM®T Easy Vector System (Promega, Madison, WI), and DNA sequencing was performed using automated methods. To confirm the specificity of the interactions, cDNA from positive colonies was rescued, retransformed in fresh yeast cells, and tested for β-galactosidase activity, using the yeast β-galactosidase assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Full-length DYT1 and DYT1-ΔE and their six deletion mutants (tors1-3) were amplified by PCR from pGBKT7 and the C-terminal deletion mutant of human snapin from pSFV1-PV-IRES-GFP vector (a kind gift from Dr. J.

A vector encoding full-length snapin fused to GST was kindly provided by Dr. R. Jahn (23Vites O. Rhee J.S. Schwarz M. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26251-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced in E. coli BL21 by the addition of 400 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C (50Lalli G. Herreros J. Osborne S.L. Monteccucco C. Ressetto O. Shiavo G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2715-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon lysis of the bacteria in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Tween, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and EDTA-free protein inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim, DE), fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween, 0.5 m NaCl and eluted in 20 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Purified torsinA and its mutant were then dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm ATP, whereas snapin and its fragment were dialyzed against PBS. In Vitro Transcription-Translation and Pulldown Assays—For pulldown assays, GST fusion proteins containing torsinA, ΔE-torsinA, snapin, and its deletion mutants were bound to glutathione-Sepharose in Hank's buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 5.36 mm KCl, 136 mm NaCl, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 1.26 mm CaCl2, 6.1 mm glucose) containing 0.1% BSA (Hank's-BSA) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then blocked with 2% BSA in Hank's buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with Hank's. 35S-Labeled proteins were generated using TnT Quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), precleared on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and then incubated with either prebound GST fusion proteins or GST alone for 1 h at 4 °C in Hank's-BSA. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were then washed with ice-cold Hank's-BSA containing 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in loading buffer. Eluted proteins were then analyzed by autoradiography. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the GST fusion proteins. SH-SY5Y cell lines expressing wild type HA-tagged fusion torsinA and ΔE-torsinA were washed in PBS, scraped, and then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) containing 0.5% CHAPS (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) for 30 min at 4 °C under constant agitation. Precleared cell extracts were incubated with immobilized GST-snapin or GST overnight at 4 °C. After six washes with lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Cell extracts from SH-SY5Y expressing HA-tagged wild type DYT1, DYT1-ΔE (20 μg protein/lane), prepared as above, were incubated with anti-snapin antibodies (30 μg of antibody/sample; 1 mg of antibody for 1 ml of resin) overnight at 4 °C. As a negative control, the cell lysates were mixed with an irrelevant antibody (anti-GFP). Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were then added to each samples and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C under constant stirring. After extensive washes with lysis buffer containing 0.5% CHAPS, the beads were resuspended in loading buffer, boiled, and analyzed in SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. Immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-HA (1:1000) and anti-snapin (1:250) antibodies. Lysates of SH-SY5Y cells expressing wild type DYT1, DYT1-ΔE, or the control vector pcDNA3.1 were resuspended in loading buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blot (10 μg/lane). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with anti-VAMP2 (1:1000), anti-synaptotagmin I (M48, 1:200), or anti-actin (1:1000) antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were revealed by ECL and quantified (n = 3) using National Institutes of Health Image 1.61 software. Hippocampal Neuron Culture—E18 mouse embryos were dissected in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.6% glucose (PBS-G). Once removed, hippocampi were kept on ice in 1 ml of PBS-G buffer. Trypsin was added to 0.025% final concentration, and the tissues were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with constant stirring. The cells were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature and then resuspended in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% horse serum, 2 mm glutamine, 4.5 g glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, gentamicin, penicillin, and streptomycin) prior to plating on coverslips pretreated with poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. The following day, the growth medium was replaced with differentiating medium (Neurobasal, 2% B27, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin). The cells were analyzed for immunofluorescence after 4 days. Immunofluorescence—SH-SY5Y cell lines were plated onto glass coverslips and allowed to grow overnight. PC12 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and differentiated with 100 ng/ml nerve grow factor in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 72 h (24Herreros J. Ng T. Schiavo G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2947-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. SH-SY5Y were washed with PBS and incubated with 50 mm NH4Cl for 5 min. The cells were rinsed and PBS containing 10% goat serum was added for 1 h at room temperature. PC12 cells were incubated in blocking solution buffer (10% goat serum, 2% BSA, and 0.25% gelatin) for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted (anti-HA, 1:1000; anti-torsinA, 1:200; anti-snapin, 1:250; anti-SytI M48, 1:250; anti-VAMP2, 1:500; anti-SGI, 1:1000; and anti-PDI, 1:500) in PBS containing 0.05% saponin and 10% goat serum and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS three times for 10 min, AlexaFluor® 488-, 555-, and 647-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS (1:500) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were then washed and mounted with Mowiol 4-88 (EMD Bioscience, La Jolla, CA). Treatment with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml; Calbiochem) on control cells and cells expressing wt-torsinA was carried for 15 min, before fixing with 4% PFA and processing as described above. The images were acquired by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a 63× Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective. Electron Microscopy—SH-SY5 cells expressing ΔE-torsinA were fixed with 8% PFA, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, by adding directly to the cell medium at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by fixation in 4% PFA/phosphate buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were embedded in gelatin, cryoprotected in 2.3 m sucrose, and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ultrathin cryosections were cut using an FC6 cryo ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems UK) (25Roposo G. Kleijmeer M.J. Posthuma G. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Immunoglod Labeling of Ultrathin Cryosections: Application in Immunology. Blackwell Science, Cambridge, MA1997: 78-85Google Scholar). Cryosections were immunolabeled with polyclonal rabbit anti-snapin (1:500) and 10-nm protein A gold (Cell Microscopy Centre, UMC, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Differentiated PC12 cells were grown in 3-cm plastic dishes and fixed as above. The samples were processed for flat embedding and ultrathin cryosectioning (26Oorschot V. de Wit H. Annaert W.G. Klumperman J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Endogenous snapin was detected using polyclonal rabbit anti-snapin (1:500) and 10-nm protein A gold. The cryosections were viewed in a 1010 transmission electron microscope (Jeol UK), and the images were captured with an Ultrascan 1000 digital camera and Digital Micrograph software (Gatan UK). SV Recycling Assays—To monitor SV recycling, two independent exo-endocytic assays were performed. The first (27Matteoli M. Takei K. Perin M.S. Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) is based on a polyclonal antibody (Syt-163) against the intraluminal domain of rat SytI. The antibody was diluted (3 μg/ml) in KRH medium (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 6 mm glucose) containing 5 mm KCl or KRH medium with high potassium (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 6 mm glucose) and added directly to the cells. After 5 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed five times with KRH, fixed (4% PFA, 0.12 m sucrose in PBS), and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. The cells were stained with AlexaFluor® 488-conjugated secondary goat anti-rat antibody, washed, and mounted. The images were acquired by confocal microscopy using a 63× Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective with the pinhole fully open. The experiment was repeated three times, and ten random pictures for each sample were taken for quantification purposes. Mean fluorescence intensity of the cells was measured using ImageJ 1.36b. The second strategy is based on the uptake and unloading of the styril dye FM1-43 in SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing HA-tagged wild type DYT1, DYT1-ΔE, or control vector. SH-SY5Y plated on MatTek dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) were incubated with 10 μm FM1-43 dye (Invitrogen) in high potassium buffer (5 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 37 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose) for 1 min, followed by 1 min of incubation with Advasep-7 (1 mm, CyDex, Lenexa, KS) and by two washes with low potassium buffer (5 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 132 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose) to remove the surface-bound dye. As negative control, FM1-43 was added to the cells in absence of calcium (5 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 37 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm EGTA, 10 mm glucose) and in the presence of 50 μm 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen). Images were taken every 2 s with a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope equipped with a Nikon ×63, 1.4 NA Plan Ph3 oil-immersion objective. The excitation was provided by a 488-nm argon laser, and emitted light was collected using 560 filter set (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). The mean fluorescence intensity of five individual cells for each sample in three independent experiments was measured using Zeiss LSM 510 software version 3.2. RNA Interference—On-target plus Smartpool of siRNAs for human torsinA (60 nm) and human snapin (20 nm; Dharmacom, Chicago, IL) were used to knockdown gene expression. siRNAs were transfected into SHSY-5Y cells using 1-2 μl of Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen) in OptiMEM (Invitrogen). 5 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with Eagle's minimal essential medium: Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture, 10% fetal calf serum, and the cells were used at 72 h after transfections. The cells transfected with 20-60 nm scrambled oligonucleotides were used as control. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of torsinA and/or snapin was verified by immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis using monoclonal anti-torsinA and rabbit anti-snapin antibodies as previously described. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test analysis was assessed using Kaleidagraph version 4 (Synergy Software). Identification of Wild type and Mutant TorsinA-interacting Proteins—We undertook a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that interact with both wild type torsinA (wt-torsinA) and mutant torsinA (ΔE-torsinA). Human full-length DYT1 (DYT1-wt) and its GAG-deleted mutant (DYT1-ΔE) were used as baits to screen an adult human brain cDNA library under high stringency conditions. As a result, eight independent clones were isolated using DYT1-ΔE and five using DYT1-wt. Three clones obtained using ΔE-torsinA as a bait encoded for the C-terminal region (residues 112-300) of snapin, a synaptic protein previously involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at central synapses (21Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The interaction of wt-torsinA and ΔE-torsinA with snapin was first verified by an independent yeast two-hybrid analysis (supplemental Fig. S1). The β-galactosidase activity of single colonies was measured within 2 h and compared with that of a yeast strain co-transformed with wt-torsinA and its previously identified binding partner kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) (6Kamm C. Boston H. Hewett J. Wilbur J. Corey D.P. Hanson P.I. Ramesh V. Breakefield X.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19882-19892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the strength of the interaction of wt-torsinA with full-length snapin and KCL1 was comparable under our experimental conditions. No significant difference was found between the binding of snapin with wt-torsinA and ΔE-torsinA. These interactions were confirmed in GST binding assays: wt-torsinA and ΔE-torsinA expressed as GST recombinant fusion proteins were able to bind in vitro translated snapin (Fig. 1B). These results confirmed the specificity of the binding, because no interaction of snapin with GST alone was observed. To identify the specific domains involved in this interaction, a series of truncated mutants of wt-torsinA, ΔE-torsinA, and snapin were generated and tested in pull down assays (Fig. 1B). Deletion clones for wt-torsinA and ΔE-torsinA, corresponding to its first 181 residues and including the ATP-binding domain (tors-1) or only spanning the C-terminal coiled-coil region (residues 251-332; tors-3), were unable to bind snapin. In contrast, a fragment containing both ATP-binding and coiled-coil domains (residues 91-332; tors-2) showed the same intensity of binding of the full-length proteins (Fig. 1B). This finding indicates that the binding site is situated in this region, and the N terminus is not required for the interaction with snapin. In agreement with the results shown in Fig. 1A, no significant difference was observed in snapin binding between wt-torsinA and its mutant (Fig. 1B). In a parallel experiment, full-length snapin and its C-terminal fragment (residues 83-136; CC-snapin), expressed as GST recombinant proteins, were equally able to bind both wt-torsinA and ΔE-torsinA (Fig. 1C). In contrast, no binding to immobilized GST was detected. This result indicates that the coiled-coil region of snapin alone is sufficient to mediate the interaction with both wild type and mutant torsinA. A pulldown experiment was also performed using detergent extracts derived from stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells expressing wt and ΔE-torsinA tagged with an HA epitope. Specific interaction of GST-snapin with both wild type and mutant torsinA was revealed using an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1D). Snapin appeared to bind equally ΔE-torsinA and wt-torsinA, whereas no binding was detecte"
https://openalex.org/W2052235660,"Background Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by an inability to produce insulin endogenously. Based on a series of histopathology studies of patients with recent onset of the disease, it is commonly stated that the onset of clinical symptoms corresponds to an 80-95% reduction in beta cell mass. Motivated by the clinical importance of the degree of beta cell destruction at onset, a meta-analysis was used to determine the validity of this common wisdom. Methods and Findings The histopathology results identifying insulin containing islets in patients younger than 20 years of age were extracted from three different studies. The results for 105 patients were stratified by duration of diabetic symptoms and age at onset. Linear regression and a non-parametric bootstrap approach were used to determine the dependence of residual beta cell mass to age at onset. The percentage reduction in beta cell mass was highly correlated (p<0.001) with the age of onset with the greatest reduction in beta cell mass in the youngest patients. As this trend had not been previously observed, an alternative physiology-based model is proposed that captures this age-dependence. Conclusions The severity in beta cell reduction at onset decreased with age where, on average, a 40% reduction in beta cell mass was sufficient to precipitate clinical symptoms at 20 years of age. The observed trend was consistent with a physiology-based model where the threshold for onset is based upon a dynamic balance between insulin-production capacity, which is proportional to beta cell mass, and insulin demand, which is proportional to body weight."
https://openalex.org/W2059692646,"Molecular mechanisms by which signaling pathways operate in the malaria parasite and control its development are promiscuous. Recently, we reported the identification of a signaling pathway in Plasmodium falciparum, which involves activation of protein kinase B-like enzyme (PfPKB) by calcium/calmodulin (Vaid, A., and Sharma, P. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 27126–27133). Studies carried out to elucidate the function of this pathway suggested that it may be important for erythrocyte invasion. Blocking the function of the upstream activators of this pathway, calmodulin and phospholipase C, resulted in impaired invasion. To evaluate if this signaling cascade controls invasion by regulating PfPKB, inhibitors against this kinase were developed. PfPKB inhibitors dramatically reduced the ability of the parasite to invade erythrocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PfPKB associates with actin-myosin motor and phosphorylates PfGAP45 (glideosome-associated protein 45), one of the important components of the motor complex, which may help explain its role in erythrocyte invasion.

Almost 500 million cases of malaria are reported each year, and 1–3 million of these cases result in human death. Apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium, which is responsible for malaria, has a complex life cycle. It develops inside both human and insect hosts, but its development inside human erythrocytes is the major cause of malarial pathology. Upon invasion of the erythrocyte, the parasite resides inside the parasite vacuole and undergoes various developmental changes. Subsequent to nuclear division, several merozoites are generated, which upon release invade fresh erythrocytes resulting in higher parasitemia. It is clear that erythrocyte invasion is a key step for the parasite to infect the human host and therefore is a key target for intervention. Erythrocyte invasion is a multistep process wherein interaction between the merozoite and erythrocyte is followed by reorientation of the merozoite, which results in the formation of a tight junction between the merozoite apical end and the erythrocyte membrane (2Soldati D. Foth B.J. Cowman A.F. Trends Parasitol. 2004; 20: 567-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although reasonable information is available about the receptor-ligand interactions involved in recognition and formation of the junction, parasite events that cause the initiation of invasion process are poorly understood. It has been reported that parasite calcium levels need to be optimal for successful invasion (3McCallum-Deighton N. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that calcium-dependent signaling pathways may be critical in controlling signaling events. Sequencing of the Plasmodium genome and subsequent in silico work has indicated the presence of several putative signaling proteins in the parasite (5Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M.

PKB is activated upon phosphorylation by PDK1 (9Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). In contrast, PfPKB, which is a PKB-like enzyme in P. falciparum, is regulated via a PDK1 and Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent mechanism (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Kumar A. Vaid A. Syin C. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24255-24264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, we described a signaling pathway in Plasmodium falciparum, which involved the activation of PfPKB by calcium/calmodulin (CaM). Calmodulin interacts with the N-terminal region (NTR) of PfPKB and promotes its autophosphorylation-dependent activation. The intracellular calcium necessary for the activation of this pathway was mobilized from intra-parasitic stores by phospholipase C (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Despite this information, the function of this pathway had remained unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that CaM and intracellular calcium are important for invasion, and phospholipase C was found to play an important role in this process as it mediated intracellular calcium release needed for invasion. Because inhibition of PfPKB impaired invasion, we conclude that this calcium/calmodulin signaling pathway is crucial for erythrocyte invasion. In addition, we provide evidence that PfPKB interacts with actin-myosin motor complex and phosphorylates PfGAP45 (glideosome-associated protein 45). mammalian protein kinase B calmodulin calmodulin binding domain P. falciparum homologue of Glideosome-Associated Protein 45 N-terminal region protein kinase B-like enzyme in P. falciparum deletion of PfPKB lacking the NTR that is catalytically active phospholipase C immunoprecipitate inner membrane complex scrambled fluorescein isothiocyanate P. falciparum homologue of myosin tail interacting protein. mammalian protein kinase B calmodulin calmodulin binding domain P. falciparum homologue of Glideosome-Associated Protein 45 N-terminal region protein kinase B-like enzyme in P. falciparum deletion of PfPKB lacking the NTR that is catalytically active phospholipase C immunoprecipitate inner membrane complex scrambled fluorescein isothiocyanate P. falciparum homologue of myosin tail interacting protein. Reagents—PfPKB-pGEX4T1 plasmid used for protein expression and anti-PfPKB rabbit antisera used in these studies have been described earlier (10Kumar A. Vaid A. Syin C. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24255-24264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The following peptides: cross-tide (GRPRTSSFAEG), CBD peptide (IGKKRLRNSMSLSYERKKRIR), scr-peptide (MKLSGKRYRNSRLKEIRSRIK), and CBD-(1–15) (IGKKRLRNSMSLSYE) were custom-synthesized by Peptron, South Korea. Scr peptides have similar amino acid composition as CBD, but their arrangement has been scrambled. U73322, U73122, and W7 were purchased from Calbiochem. A443654 and A739985.3 were provided by Dr. Vincent Giranda, Abbott. Cell Culture, Synchronization, Preparation of Free Merozoites, Inhibitor Treatment, and Invasion Assays—P. falciparum strain 3D7 was cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium using either 10% AB+ human serum (11Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6161) Google Scholar) or 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen) (complete medium). Cultures were gassed with 7% CO2, 5% O2, and 88% N2, and synchronization of the parasites in culture was achieved by sorbitol treatment (12Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar). RBC-free merozoites were prepared by using a previously published method with slight modifications (13Blackman M.J. Scott-Finnigan T.J. Shai S. Holder A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14Mohrle J.J. Zhao Y. Wernli B. Franklin R.M. Kappes B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, sorbitol synchronized parasites at ring stages were collected and washed with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2 and incubated at 10% hematocrit in the same buffer with 1 mg/ml trypsin for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing with complete medium, parasites were plated at 6–8% parasitemia and 5% hematocrit in a T-175 cm2 culture flask containing 35 ml of complete medium. When parasites were predominantly in mid-schizont stage, 10–15 ml of fresh complete medium was added to the cultures. After 1–2 h, parasite cultures were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet parasitized and uninfected erythrocytes. Culture supernatant containing merozoites was centrifuged at 3300 × g to obtain the pellet of erythrocyte-free merozoites. Merozoites were resuspended immediately in complete medium and were incubated with fresh erythrocytes for invasion. Smears were stained with Giemsa and examined microscopically and were typically found free of either erythrocytes or intracellular parasitic stages. To determine the effect of inhibitors on PfPKB activity, inhibitors were added to either schizonts or merozoites in culture. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation was performed, and the IP was used for kinase assays (described below). For typical invasion assays, parasite cultures were synchronized using sorbitol as described above, and peptides and pharmacological inhibitors were added to mid-late schizonts (∼3% parasitemia) and 5% hematocrit, which was maintained using fresh erythrocytes. The formation of rings was analyzed periodically after every 2 h. For experiments with free merozoites, 1–5 × 109 merozoites were incubated with peptides or inhibitors for ∼10 min in complete medium prior to the addition of fresh erythrocytes at 5% hematocrit in culture medium. New ring stage infection was scored after 3 h by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears. At least 1000 erythrocytes from several different fields were counted for each experiment. Recombinant Protein Expression and Generation of Antisera—For expression of ΔPfPKB as a GST fusion protein, the pGEX4T1-ΔPfPKB plasmid construct was used, as described previously (10Kumar A. Vaid A. Syin C. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24255-24264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For expression of PfGAP45 and PfMTIP, corresponding cDNAs were amplified and cloned in PET28a and PQE30-UA vectors, respectively, and expressed as His6-tagged proteins in Bl21(DE3)-RIL Escherichia coli strain and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. These recombinant proteins were used to raise antisera in rabbits or mice using standard procedures. PfMTIP was also expressed as a GST fusion protein. For this purpose, PfMTIP was cloned in pGEX4T3 vector and expressed in BL21-RIL strain as described previously (15Jones M.L. Kitson E.L. Rayner J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 147: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were quantified and normalized by performing densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Metabolic Labeling of Parasites—Tightly synchronized parasite cultures (∼6–8% parasitemia) were washed at least three times either with phosphate or methionine-deficient RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone). Subsequently, parasites were cultured in media supplemented with 10% human serum. CBD peptide or pharmacological inhibitors were added to schizonts, which corresponded to ∼42–44-h post-invasion parasites. Inorganic 32P radionuclide in the form of [32P]orthophosphoric acid (2 mCi/ml) (16Mamoun C.B. Goldberg D.E. Mol.

Subsequently, parasite lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described below. The IP was resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and electrophoresed, and labeled proteins were detected using a Fuji FLA5000 scanner. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Parasites were released from infected erythrocytes by 0.05% (w/v) saponin treatment. Cell-free protein extracts were prepared by homogenizing parasite pellets in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μm sodium fluoride, 20 μm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1× Complete Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. PfPKB, PfGAP45, and PfMTIP were immunoprecipitated from the schizont or merozoite lysates using appropriate antisera as described previously (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, IP was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and FITC-Peptide Localization—Immunofluorescence was performed on thin blood smears of parasite cultures. Thin blood smears were first fixed with cold methanol and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (prepared in phosphate-buffered saline) before incubation with primary antibody. After washing with blocking buffer, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies labeled with FITC/Texas red or AlexaFluor488/594. For experiments performed with FITC-labeled peptides, CBD peptides were added to schizont stage parasite cultures. After 2 h, thin smears were processed for immunofluorescence for MSP-1 as described above. Slides were viewed using a Olympus fluorescence microscope. For indirect immunofluorescence assays described in Fig. 6A, confocal microscopy was performed using a Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. The single z-stack shown was processed using Olympus Fluoview 1.6 software. Images were processed using Image ProPlus or Adobe Photoshop software. Assay of Kinase Activity—Catalytic activity of GST-ΔPfPKB or 10 μl of immunoprecipitated PfPKB were assayed as described previously (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol)) using a small peptide substrate “crosstide” (100 μm, unless otherwise indicated) or other recombinant proteins like PfGAP45. Reactions were stopped by spotting the assay mixture on P11 phosphocellulose paper, and phosphate incorporation was measured by scintillation counting of the P11 paper. When recombinant proteins were used as substrate, reactions were stopped by boiling the mixtures in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Kumar A. Vaid A. Syin C. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24255-24264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, phosphate incorporation in substrate proteins was visualized by using a Fuji FLA5000 scanner. For PfPKB inhibition assays, pharmacological or peptide inhibitors were preincubated with ΔPfPKB 15 min prior to the addition of phosphoacceptor substrate and ATP. Phospholipase C and Calmodulin Inhibitors Block Erythrocyte Invasion—PfPKB is regulated by CaM by promoting its autophosphorylation in a calcium-dependent manner in vitro and in parasites. The calcium necessary for PfPKB activation by CaM is dependent on the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, the PfPKB pathway is regulated by CaM and phospholipase C-mediated calcium release (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Specific inhibitors of both CaM (19Matsumoto Y. Perry G. Scheibel L.W. Aikawa M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 45: 36-43PubMed Google Scholar) and PLC (20Gazarini M.L. Thomas A.P. Pozzan T. Garcia C.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Hotta C.T. Markus R.P. Garcia C.R. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2003; 36: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have been used successfully to block the activity of these proteins in Plasmodium. In this study, we used these inhibitors to evaluate the function of CaM and PLC in invasion. When the CaM inhibitor W7 was added to schizonts, it blocked the formation of rings suggesting that CaM plays a role in invasion (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with results published previously (19Matsumoto Y. Perry G. Scheibel L.W. Aikawa M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 45: 36-43PubMed Google Scholar). The role of PLC was determined by using its inhibitor U73122 and an inactive analogue of this compound U73322, which was used as a negative control. In comparison with U73322 or Me2SO treatment of schizonts, addition of U73122 inhibited new ring formation significantly suggesting that phospholipase C may be important for invasion. To explore if PLC controls invasion by regulating calcium release, U73122 was used in combination with ionomycin, a calcium ionophore. In this case, inhibition of invasion was significantly protected suggesting that PLC may control this process by regulating intracellular calcium release (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when free merozoites were used for invasion assays (data not shown). Previously, we have demonstrated that CaM and PLC inhibitors block PfPKB activity. When U73122 was used in the presence of ionomycin, PfPKB activity was restored suggesting that PLC-mediated calcium release is critical for PfPKB to function (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was reasonable to speculate that the modulation of PfPKB activity caused because of the inhibition of CaM and PLC may contribute to impaired invasion. Calmodulin-dependent Activation of PfPKB May Be Important for Erythrocyte Invasion; Design and Use of Peptide Inhibitors of PfPKB—CaM and PLC appear to play a role in invasion (Fig. 1), and because they act as upstream regulators of PfPKB (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the contribution of PfPKB in this process was worth investigating. Two different strategies were used to inhibit PfPKB as follows: 1) a pharmacological inhibitor competitive against ATP, and 2) peptide inhibitors, which target either PfPKB catalytic cleft and/or compete with CaM for PfPKB. Previous biochemical studies (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) had suggested that a calmodulin binding domain (CBD) exists in the NTR of PfPKB (Fig. 2A). In addition, a pseudo-substrate RXRXS motif is also embedded in the CBD, which probably holds PfPKB in an inactive state by interacting with its catalytic site. This was confirmed when a 21-amino acid peptide corresponding to the CBD motif could interact with CaM and prevent the activation of PfPKB in vitro (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This peptide can also compete directly with the catalytic site of PfPKB (Fig. 2B) as it inhibited the activity of ΔPfPKB, a variant of PfPKB that lacks the CBD and the NTR of PfPKB and therefore is active independent of Ca2+/CaM (1Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Kumar A. Vaid A. Syin C. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24255-24264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This “two-pronged” ability of the CBD peptide to inhibit PfPKB activity made it a putative tool for studying PfPKB function. Because this peptide may alter the function of other CaM-binding proteins, it was also important to generate a version of this peptide that could inhibit PfPKB exclusively by interacting with its active site without interacting with CaM. For this purpose, a truncated peptide, which lacked the last six amino acids of CBD, was synthesized. This peptide retained the pseudosubstrate RXRXS motif (Fig. 2A). Even though the CBD-(1–15) peptide failed to interact with CaM (supplemental Fig. IA), it effectively inhibited the activity of ΔPfPKB (Fig. 2B). Therefore, CBD-(1–15) does not interact with CaM and works exclusively as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PfPKB, which interacts with the catalytic domain. These peptide inhibitors were added to parasites followed by immunoprecipitation of PfPKB, and the kinase activity associated with PfPKB-IP was assayed. Both CBD and CBD-(1–15) peptides inhibited PfPKB activity, and the control scrambled version of peptides were ineffective (Fig. 2C). To demonstrate if these peptides enter the parasite, FITC-labeled CBD-(1–15) (Fig. 2D) and CBD (supplemental Fig. IB) were added to parasite cultures. The peptide-associated fluorescence was observed inside most schizonts/merozoites, which indicated that these peptides might work intracellularly. Like PfPKB, peptides also concentrated at the apical end of the parasite as observed for PfPKB (supplemental Fig. IB), and peptide associated fluorescence was largely absent from uninfected erythrocytes (data not shown). In contrast, FITC-labeled scr-CBD peptide, which does not inhibit and interact with PfPKB (Fig. 2B, supplemental Fig. ID), was not observed inside the parasite. These peptides were subsequently used to probe PfPKB function. When CBD and CBD-(1–15) peptide were added to segmenter/mature schizonts, a marked decrease in the formation of fresh rings was observed (Fig. 3A, left panel). Because there was no significant change in the number of schizonts (Fig. 3A, right panel) or their morphology, it is reasonable to infer that the decreased ring formation may be due to altered invasion and not due to defects on egress and maturation. Furthermore, invasion assays were also performed with free merozoites isolated from P. falciparum cultures. These merozoites when added to erythrocytes in culture resulted in the formation of rings, which was indicative of successful invasion (supplemental Fig. II). Although scr-CBD peptide-treated merozoites efficiently invaded erythrocytes, both CBD and CBD-(1–15) caused a significant reduction in the formation of rings indicating that invasion was significantly impaired (Fig. 3B). To rule out the effect of these peptides on other parasitic stages, changes in response to these peptides on the entire life cycle were monitored. The growth of parasites was normal until ∼46 h, and there were no significant changes in morphology of intraerythrocytic stages. Subsequent formation of rings in control cultures was indicative of the initiation of the next cycle. The peptide inhibitor-treated cultures had significantly less number of rings (supplemental Fig. IIIA), which was most likely due to impaired invasion as observed in above-described experiments (Fig. 3). A443654 Is an Effective Inhibitor of PfPKB Which Blocks Invasion—Until recently, there were no commercial inhibitors available for PKB-like enzymes from any organism. A443654 was developed as a specific inhibitor of mammalian PKB/AKT enzymes, which is competitive against ATP (22Luo Y. Shoemaker A.R. Liu X. Woods K.W. Thomas S.A. De Jong R. Han E.K. Li T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24255-24264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), A443654 was chosen as a possible candidate to inhibit PfPKB. A443654 successfully inhibited the activity of recombinant PfPKB in vitro with reasonable IC50 values (∼200 nm) (Fig. 4A). Importantly, A443654 treatment of schizonts resulted in a significant reduction of parasite PfPKB activity (Fig. 4B). To explore the function of PfPKB, A443654 was added to the ring stage parasites, and their growth was monitored at regular intervals. There was no change in parasitemia until ∼46 h, and at this point, a sudden decrease in rings formed in the next round of the life cycle (supplemental Fig. IIIB) was observed, which could be a result of impaired invasion. To explore this more specifically, invasion assays were performed using schizonts as well as free merozoites as described above for peptide inhibitors (Fig. 3). When schizonts were incubated with the inhibitor, no significant change in their number or morphology was observed. However, the number of rings formed subsequent to invasion was effectively reduced, IC50 ∼ 250 nm (Fig. 5A). Similar impairment of invasion was observed when free merozoites were used for assays indicating that A443654 blocks invasion (Fig. 5B). The inactive analogue of A443654 failed to cause any significant changes to PfPKB activity or invasion of the parasites in control experiments (supplemental Fig. IV). These data corroborate well with results obtained with peptide inhibitors and collectively highlight the importance of PfPKB activity in invasion of erythrocytes.FIGURE 5PfPKB inhibitor, A443654, blocks invasion. A, schizont-infected erythrocytes were incubated with Me2SO (DMSO) or different concentrations of A443654, and the number of schizonts (right panel) and rings (left panel) was individually scored at the indicated times post-addition of the inhibitor. Although there was a significant decrease in the number of rings formed, schizont number remained almost unaltered upon inhibitor treatment at any time point. No schizonts were observed after the 8-h time point (right panel). B, free merozoites isolated from P. falciparum cultures were incubated either with Me2SO (DMSO) or 0.5 μm A443654 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thin blood smears were prepared after 3 h, and the number of ring-infected parasites was counted. Representations of more than three independent experiments are shown in the figure. Error bars represent S.E. between the replicates of the same experiment. Right panel shows a representative field from cultures of inhibitor or Me2SO-treated merozoites post-invasion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PfPKB Interacts with PfGAP45 and Actin-Myosin Motor Complex—It has been demons"
https://openalex.org/W2071700663,"A spectroscopic assay using pyrene-labeled fission yeast Arp2/3 complex revealed that the complex binds to and dissociates from actin filaments extremely slowly with or without the nucleation-promoting factor fission yeast Wsp1-VCA.

Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 451-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Extensive structural and biochemical data established that Arp2/3 complex is intrinsically inactive, so nucleation depends on interactions with proteins called nucleation-promoting factors (2Welch M.D. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 247-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), actin monomers, and actin filaments. Four reactants create many possible pathways to the birth of a daughter filament on the side of a mother filament (see Fig. 1). The only way to identify the favored pathway is to measure the rates of all of the reactions and the concentrations of each of the reactants. actin-related protein verprolin homology, central, and acidic Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome protein dithiothreitol fluorescence resonance energy transfer glutathione S-transferase Latrunculin-A. actin-related protein verprolin homology, central, and acidic Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome protein dithiothreitol fluorescence resonance energy transfer glutathione S-transferase Latrunculin-A. An initial study by Marchand et al. showed that the VCA (verprolin homology, central, and acidic) region of the nucleation-promoting factor WASp (Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome protein) interacts with both actin monomers and Arp2/3 complex in rapid equilibria (3Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The verprolin homology and central region of these nucleation-promoting factors binds actin monomers, and the CA region binds Arp2/3 complex. Thus the C region binds both actin and Arp2/3 complex but not simultaneously (4Kelly A.E. Kranitz H. Dotsch V. Mullins R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10589-10597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The dissociation equilibrium constant for human WASp-VCA binding actin monomers is 0.6 μm, and the rate of exchange at equilibrium (k-) is 3 s-1. WASp-VCA binds bovine Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 0.9 μm and k- of 0.2 s-1. Because a mutation in human WASp-VCA from a patient with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome did not alter its affinity for actin monomers or Arp2/3 complex but decreased the number of actin filament barbed ends formed in bulk samples, Marchand et al. proposed a rate-limiting activation step, after a ternary complex consisting of Arp2/3 complex, VCA, and an actin monomer binds a mother filament and before the branch starts to grow. In the absence of a full set of rate constants, the possible pathways from reactants to branches were not well constrained. In particular nothing was known about the rates of which Arp2/3 complex binds and dissociates on the sides of mother filaments. To define the pathway more rigorously, we sought new spectroscopic assays to measure the rates of interactions between Arp2/3 complex, nucleation-promoting factors, actin monomers, and actin filaments. Ideally, the signal from an assay to measure the interaction between any two of the reactants will be insensitive to the presence of other binding partners, so that any perturbation of the reaction by other binding partners can be determined. Fig. 1 shows a detailed kinetic mechanism for the formation of actin filament branches to provide a guide to the reactions that we studied. Purification of S. pombe Arp2/3 Complex—Native Arp2/3 complex was purified from protease-deficient TM011 strain of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Cells were suspended in 1 ml of buffer U (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) per gram of wet cell pellet and stored at -80 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out at 0-4 °C. Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science, 1 tablet per 50 ml) were added to thawed cell pellets, and cells were lysed by mechanical disruption in a Microfluidizer (model M-110S, Microfluidics). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate, resuspended in buffer PKME (10 mm PIPES, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.5), and then dialyzed against PKME overnight. The dialyzed sample was clarified by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h before being applied to a column of 15 mg of GST-N-WASp-VCA immobilized on 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose. The column was washed with 30 ml of PKME, 20 ml of PKME-150 (10 mm PIPES, 150 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.5), eluted with buffer Q (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 25 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) containing 1 m NaCl and then dialyzed against buffer Q for at least 2 h. Arp2/3 complex was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a 1-ml column of Mono Q (AKTA FPLC, GE Healthcare). DTT was omitted from FPLC buffers, if the protein was to be labeled with a fluorescent dye. A typical yield was 1.2 mg from 50 grams of cells. Labeling Arp2/3 Complex—Arp2/3 complex for fluorescent labeling was immediately pooled from the Mono Q fractions and concentrated to at least 1 mg/ml using an Amicon ultra-4, 50,000 MWCO (Millipore). Concentrated fractions were reacted with a 20-fold molar excess of N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide or Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide on ice in the dark for up to 2 h. The reaction was quenched by addition of 10 mm DTT, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble dye and dialyzed against KMEI (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) with 0.1 mm ATP and 1 mm DTT overnight before use.

Cell. 2005; 16: 2313-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were purified and labeled with fluorescent dyes. Fission Yeast Mutagenesis—Mutations were created by introducing nucleotide changes into the forward integration primer for fission yeast transformations using the pFA6a vector (9Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie A. Steever 3rd, A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Isolating the non-parental ditype in tetrad analysis identified the double mutant strain. Mass Spectrometry—Purified S. pombe Arp2/3 complex was incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of Oregon-Green 488 iodoacetamide for 2 h on ice. Labeled and unlabeled samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fluorescence band (Fig. 2B) and corresponding band on the unlabeled control were cut from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digest. Analysis of peptide masses by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy by the Yates laboratory at Scripps Research Institute revealed a single peptide differing by 550 atomic mass units between the two samples. Theoretical trypsin digest maps of ARPC3 and ARPC4 identified the peptide as the C-terminal peptide of ARPC4, containing a single cysteine, residue 167. Pyrene Arp2/3 Complex Binding Assays—For equilibrium binding assays involving actin filaments, actin was polymerized for 1 h at room temperature before adding 50 nm pyrene-labeled Arp2/3 complex and incubating for an additional 2 h. Pyrene fluorescence was measured with an Alphascan fluorometer (Photon Technology International) with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 390 nm. The average counts per second for a 10-s scan are reported. For kinetic experiments, actin filaments were polymerized for 10-20 min before mixing by hand with 50 nm pyrene Arp2/3 complex and starting time courses. Fluorescence emission was measured for 1 s at 5-s intervals. Time courses were fit to single or double exponentials to yield observed rate constants. Fluorescence Anisotropy—Anisotropy measurements were made with an Alphascan fluorometer in a T-format. Fixed concentrations of rhodamine-VCA or VCA-rhodamine were mixed with actin or Arp2/3 complex and incubated for at least 30 min in KMEI or buffer G. Samples were excited with polarized light at 552 nm, and polarized emitted light was measured at 574 nm with 0.1 point/s for 30 s. The average anisotropy was calculated using PTI Felix software. FRET Measurements—FRET measurements were made with an Alphascan fluorometer. For steady-state measurements a fixed concentration of actin labeled on Cys-374 with Oregon Green 488 (Oregon Green actin) was mixed with a range of concentrations of rhodamine-VCA in the presence or absence of 1.5 μm Arp2/3 complex in KMEI and incubated for at least 30 min at room temperature. Emission scans from 510 to 610 nm were made using an excitation wavelength of 470 nm. Percent donor fluorescence quenched was calculated by comparing the average fluorescence from 519 to 524 nm with OG-actin alone. Kinetic experiments were performed using a MiniMixer stopped-flow apparatus (KinTek). The samples were excited at 470 nm, and emission was measured at 519 nm with a 3-nm slit width on the Alphascan monochromator. Time courses were fit to single exponentials to yield observed rate constants. Determination of Equilibrium and Kinetic Constants—Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting Equation 1 to the ligand concentration dependence of the signal (S) for pyrene fluorescence, anisotropy, or fraction donor fluorescence quenched, S=Sf+(Sb-Sf)(([R]+[L]+Kd)-(([R]+[L]+Kd)∧2-4*[R]*[L])∧0.5)/2*[L](Eq. 1) where Sf is the signal of the free receptor (R), Sb is the signal of the bound receptor, and [L] is the concentration of the ligand (species on the x-axis). Sb and Kd were left as parameters to be fit. For Fig. 4D, Sf was also left as a parameter to be fit. We calculated the association (k+) and dissociation (k-) rate constants by fitting Equation 2 to the observed rate constants (kobs), kobs=k+[L]+k-(Eq. 2) where [L] is the total concentration of ligand (species on the x-axis). Actin Filament Assembly Assays—Assembly of actin was measured with an Alphascan fluorometer from the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin (10Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) with 4 μm actin monomers (5% pyrene-labeled), 1 μm rhodamine-VCA, and a range of concentrations of fission yeast Arp2/3 complex. Fluorescence readings were converted to actin filament concentrations by normalizing the starting signal to 0 μm actin filaments and the average plateau value to 3.84 μm. Simulations of Actin Filament Assembly—Models were built, and simulations were run using Vcell 4.2 from National Resource for Cell Analysis and Modeling (NRCAM, www.vcell.org). Chemical species present and reactions are defined in Figs. 1A and 5C. Rate constants are reported in Tables 1 and 2. The LSODA integrator was used, and residuals were calculated using an output interval of 5 s to match the data acquisition rate of the actin assembly assays.TABLE 1Reactions and parameters used in the mathematical model shown in Fig. 5CReactionDescriptionk+k−ReferenceμM−1 s−1s−11Nucleation of an unbranched filament from monomers8 × 10−9aUnits are μm−3 s−1.0Empirical2Elongation of a filament by addition of monomers to barbed and pointed ends11.6 barbed, 1.3 pointed1.4 barbed, 0.8 pointed(28Pollard T.D.

Open table in a new tab Creation of Fluorescent Derivatives of S. pombe Arp2/3 Complex—Cysteine 167 of ARPC4 is the only reactive cysteine in S. pombe Arp2/3 complex, but it is not a good site to attach a fluorescent dye for biochemical experiments, because it interferes with Arp2/3 complex function (see supplemental text). Reaction of purified S. pombe Arp2/3 complex with Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide resulted in dye incorporation into only the ARPC4 subunit (Fig. 2, A and B). Analysis of tryptic peptides by mass spectroscopy identified a single peptide of ARPC4 containing cysteine 167 that differed by ∼550 atomic mass units between labeled and unlabeled samples. The other 22 cysteines in the complex did not react with Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide. Mutation of ARPC4 cysteine167 to serine resulted in the loss of Oregon Green 488 incorporation into Arp2/3 complex without altering its biochemical activity in actin filament nucleation assays (data not shown). Fission yeast expressing this mutation had no noticeable growth or morphology defects. Therefore the C167S mutation in ARPC4 provided a suitable background for creating new labeling sites. To develop a spectroscopic assay for interactions between Arp2/3 complex and actin filaments, we used our phylogenetic analysis of Arp2/3 complex (12Beltzner C.C. Pollard T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and existing biochemical evidence to pick a labeling site that might be close to the mother filament in branches. We chose to mutate the genome to replace a solvent-exposed, unconserved alanine (317) at the C terminus of ARPC2 with cysteine. We crossed the ARPC2 A317C strain with the strain containing the ARPC4 C167S mutation. The double mutant had normal growth and morphology under the conditions tested. Reaction of Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide with purified Arp2/3 complex from the double mutant (ARPC4-C167S/ARPC2-A317C) consistently labeled the ARPC2 subunit (Fig. 2B). The reaction went to completion in 2 h (data not shown). Oregon Green 488 occasionally labeled the band containing Arp2 and ARPC1 (Fig. 2B). Reaction of ARPC4 C167S/ARPC2 A317C Arp2/3 complex with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide created “pyrene-labeled Arp2/3 complex,” which behaved the same as wild-type fission yeast Arp2/3 complex by SDS-PAGE and in actin assembly assays monitored with the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin. However, pyrene-labeled Arp2/3 complex contributes to the overall pyrene fluorescence, so we did not attempt a quantitative analysis of actin assembly with this assay. Interaction of Arp2/3 Complex with Actin Filaments—Titration of pyrene-labeled Arp2/3 complex with unlabeled chicken skeletal muscle actin filaments gave a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence up to ∼5-fold (Fig. 2C). Fitting a binding isotherm to this data yielded a dissociation equilibrium constant of 4.6 ± 0.5 μm (Fig. 2D), similar to the affinity of Acanthamoeba Arp2/3 complex for actin filaments measured with cosedimentation assays (11Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). The extent of fluorescence enhancement was not affected by the presence of capping protein or by extensive shearing of the actin filaments (data not shown), treatments that increase the number of filament ends. The fluorescence enhancement being sensitive to the concentration of polymerized actin, but not the number of filament ends, suggests that the fluorescence enhancement is due to Arp2/3 complex binding to the sides of actin filaments rather than barbed or pointed ends. The fluorescence of pyrene-labeled Arp2/3 complex increased very slowly following the addition of actin filaments (Fig. 2E). A single exponential with a rate constant on the order of 10-3 s-1 fit the time course of the fluorescence change. We measured the time courses of the fluorescence change over a range of actin filament concentrations and plotted kobs versus actin filament concentration (Fig. 2F). The plot was linear with a slope corresponding to the association rate constant (k+) of 1.5 × 10-4 μm-1 s-1 and a y-intercept corresponding to the dissociation rate constant (k-) of 1.0 × 10-3 s-1 (Fig. 2F). The ratio of these rate constants (Kd = k-/k+ = 6.7 μm) confirmed the equilibrium measurements of the affinity. The time course of binding did not differ significantly for actin filaments polymerized for 6 min (a mixture of ATP-, ADP-Pi, and ADP-actin) and 45 min (mostly ADP-actin) (data not shown). The presence of a saturating concentration, 3 μm, of the nucleation-promoting factor S. pombe Wsp1 VCA fused to GST did not alter the association rate constant, but increased the dissociation rate constant to 3.4 × 10-3 s-1 (Fig. 2F). Fluorescence Anisotropy Assays for Binding of a Nucleation-promoting Factor to Arp2/3 Complex or Actin Monomers—We used fluorescence anisotropy (3Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) to measure interactions between S. pombe Wsp1 VCA labeled on an N-terminal cysteine residue with tetramethylrhodamine iodoacetamide (rhodamine-VCA) and chicken skeletal muscle actin monomers or S. pombe Arp2/3 complex (Fig. 3). Titration of a low concentration of rhodamine-VCA with unlabeled actin monomers (Fig. 3A) or unlabeled Arp2/3 complex (Fig. 3B) both gave binding isotherms with Kds of 16 nm. The anisotropy of rhodamine-VCA does not have a favorable signal-to-noise ratio to measure interactions of the complex of VCA and an actin monomer with Arp2/3 complex, so we used S. pombe Wsp1 VCA labeled on the C terminus (VCA-rhodamine). The fluorescent dye on the C terminus is far from the actin binding site, allowing the flexible VCA-rhodamine peptide to retain considerable rotational diffusion even when bound to an actin monomer. The rotational diffusion decreases when the C-terminal A region of VCA binds Arp2/3 complex, giving a favorable anisotropy change. VCA-rhodamine bound Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 130 nm by itself and a Kd of 310 nm in the presence of 3 μm actin monomers in a low ionic strength buffer (G-buffer, Fig. 3C). In a physiological strength buffer (KMEI), VCA-rhodamine bound Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 180 nm by itself and a Kd of 100 nm in the presence of 3 μm Latrunculin-A (Lat-A) actin (Fig. 3D). Therefore actin bound to VCA has only a small effect on the affinity of VCA for Arp2/3 complex, a 2-fold negative effect at low ionic strength, and a 2-fold positive effect with Lat-A actin at physiological ionic strength. FRET Assay for Binding of a Nucleation-promoting Factor to Actin Monomers—We developed an assay based on FRET to measure interactions between nucleation-promoting factors and actin monomers without interference by Arp2/3 complex. Actin monomers labeled with Oregon-Green 488 on Cys-374 served as the “donor” and VCA containing an N-terminal cysteine labeled with tetramethylrhodamine (rhodamine-VCA) served as the “acceptor.” Equilibrium binding experiments showed that a saturating concentration of acceptor quenches the donor fluorescence by ∼80% (Fig. 4, A and B). From the concentration dependence of the FRET signal we measured the affinity of rhodamine-VCA for Oregon Green actin monomers. The dissociation equilibrium constant was 15 nm in the absence and 29 nm in the presence of 1.5 μm Arp2/3 complex (Fig. 4B). We used competition experiments with unlabeled actin monomers to determine the dissociation rate of Oregon Green actin from rhodamine-VCA in the presence and absence of S. pombe Arp2/3 complex. In both experiments the rate of fluorescence increase due to the loss of FRET was 0.44 s-1 (Fig. 4C). From the Kd and k- measured in these experiments we calculate the k+ for rhodamine-VCA binding an actin monomer to be 29.3 μm-1 s-1 when rhodamine-VCA is free in solution and 15.2 μm-1 s-1 when rhodamine-VCA is bound to Arp2/3 complex. Estimation of the Activation Rate Constant by Mathematical Modeling—With our measurement of the kinetics of Arp2/3 complex interactions with actin filaments, we felt we had enough information to develop a mathematical model of actin assembly under standard in vitro conditions. Primarily, we wanted to measure the rate of an activation step, which was postulated to occur after the ternary complex of actin monomer, VCA, and Arp2/3 complex binds to the side of a mother filament and before the daughter filament starts to grow (3Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This activation step was proposed to explain how a mutation in WASp VCA might reduce the rate of branch formation with little impact on the affinity of VCA for Arp2/3 complex or actin monomers. To estimate the activation rate constant we collected the full time course of actin assembly over a range of Arp2/3 complex concentrations (0-100 nm) (Fig. 5A). The assay contained 4 μm actin (5% pyrene-labeled) and a saturating concentration of rhodamine-VCA (1 μm). We used Virtual Cell software to simulate the time course of polymerization, using the reaction parameters in Table 1. Fig. 5C shows a graphical depiction of the reaction pathway. We varied the value of the activation rate constant until the simulations matched the experimental data for the full range of concentrations of Arp2/3 complex. With activation rate constants <0.1 s-1 the simulations were slower than the experimental observations. An activation rate constant of 0.15 s-1 gave simulated time courses that matched the observations. Activation rate constants >0.15 s-1 accelerated the simulated time course of polymerization only modestly beyond the experimental observations. For example, with an activation rate constant of 0.15 s-1 and 50 nm Arp2/3 complex the simulated time course reached 80% completion in 318 s (similar to the experimental time of 324 s), whereas simulations with activation rate constants of 1.5 s-1 to 5 s-1 reached this point in 300 s. This analysis puts a lower limit of 0.15 s-1 on the activation rate constant. The simulations deviated systematically to a small extent from the experimental data (Fig. 5B). The residuals shared a non-random sinusoidal appearance, even for actin alone, because we used a simplified model of actin filament nucleation to allow us to focus on the reactions involved in branch formation. This simplification contributed most of the error but is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall analysis. With kinetic data on more of the interactions among Arp2/3 complex, VCA, actin monomers, and actin filaments, we sought to determine the predominant pathway of actin filament branch formation during cellular motility. For this simulation we used established rate constants for interactions between human WASp VCA and bovine Arp2/3 complex and skeletal muscle actin (3Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) along with rate constants for interactions of Arp2/3 complex and actin filaments, and activation of Arp2/3 complex from this study (Table 2). Marchand et al. determined equilibrium binding constants and dissociation rates for rhodamine-VCA and equilibrium binding values for unlabeled VCA. We wanted to use the rate constants for unlabeled VCA, so we adjusted the k- to correct for the effect of rhodamine on binding affinity. We also decreased by 2-fold the k+ for actin monomer binding to VCA in the presence of Arp2/3 complex (reactions 5, 6, 8, and 10) based on our FRET results (Fig. 4, B and C). Marchand et al. determined that the presence of 5 μm actin filaments increased the affinity of human WASp VCA for bovine Arp2/3 complex 5-fold but did not determine if this was due to a decrease in the k- or an increase in the k+ (Table 2). We included this observation in our model by decreasing the k- of reactions 4, 5, and 9 by 5-fold. With these adjustments, the free energy change is equivalent along each pathway to form an actin filament branch. We used estimated cellular concentrations of reactants found at the leading edge of motile cell types: 10 μm actin monomers (13Mogilner A. Edelstein-Keshet L. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1237-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), 200 nm activated nucleation-promoting factor (VCA) (our estimate), 5 μm Arp2/3 complex (10Higgs H.N.

J. 1999; 77: 1721-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The concentrations were held constant to mimic steady-state motility where recycling mechanisms actively turn over cytoskeletal components. We did not take into account the presence of profilin, which competes with VCA for binding actin monomers (10Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 15Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Biol.

GSEA, signatures of oncogenic pathway deregulation and predictors of chemotherapy sensitivity were evaluated within the two age-defined cohorts.In comparing deregulation of oncogenic pathways between age groups, a higher probability of PI3K (p = 0.006) and Myc (p = 0.03) pathway deregulation was observed in breast tumors arising in younger women. When evaluating unique patterns of pathway deregulation, a low probability of Src and E2F deregulation in tumors of younger women, concurrent with a higher probability of PI3K, Myc, and beta-catenin, conferred a worse prognosis (HR = 4.15). In contrast, a higher probability of Src and E2F pathway activation in tumors of older women, with concurrent low probability of PI3K, Myc and beta-catenin deregulation, was associated with poorer outcome (HR = 2.7). In multivariate analyses, genomic clusters of pathway deregulation illustrate prognostic value.Results demonstrate that breast cancer arising in young women represents a distinct biologic entity characterized by unique patterns of deregulated signaling pathways that are prognostic, independent of currently available clinico-pathologic variables. These results should enable refinement of targeted treatment strategies in this clinically challenging situation."
https://openalex.org/W2070763113,"Taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene is the first committed precursor of functionalized taxanes such as paclitaxel, a successful anticancer drug. Biosynthesis of taxanes in yew involves several oxidations, a number of which have been shown to be catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 oxygenases. Hydroxylation of the C-5α of taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene is believed to be the first of these oxidations, and a gene encoding a taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene 5α-hydroxylase (CYP725A4) was recently described (Jennewein, S., Long, R. M., Williams, R. M., and Croteau, R. (2004) Chem. Biol. 11, 379–387). In an attempt to produce the early components of the paclitaxel pathway by a metabolic engineering approach, cDNAs encoding taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene synthase and CYP725A4 were introduced in Nicotiana sylvestris for specific expression in trichome cells. Their co-expression did not lead to the production of the expected 5α-hydroxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene. Instead, taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was quantitatively converted to a novel taxane that was purified and characterized. Its structure was determined by NMR analysis and found to be that of 5(12)-oxa-3(11)-cyclotaxane (OCT) in which the eight-carbon B-ring from taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene is divided into two fused five-carbon rings. In addition, OCT contains an ether bridge linking C-5 and C-12 from opposite sides of the molecule. OCT was also the sole major product obtained after incubation of taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene with NADPH and microsomes prepared from recombinant yeast expressing CYP725A4. The rearrangement of the taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene ring system is thus mediated by CYP725A4 only and does not rely on additional enzymes or factors present in the plant. The complex structure of OCT led us to propose a reaction mechanism involving a sequence of events so far unknown in P-450 catalysis.

The diterpenoid paclitaxel (marketed as Taxol®) isolated from yew is an effective drug widely used in the treatment of numerous cancers (1Goldspiel B.R. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 110s-1125PubMed Google Scholar). Total chemical synthesis of paclitaxel has been described (2Nicolaou K.C. Yang Z. Liu J.J. Ueno H. Nantermet P.G. Guy R.K. Claiborne C.F.

Chem. Eng. News. 1994; 72: 32-34Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Paclitaxel is currently produced by extraction of yew needles and yew cells, and its analog Taxotere® is produced by semi-synthesis from the natural product 10-deacetylbaccatin III, which is also extracted from yew needles (4Commerçon A.

Development of alternative systems for higher yield and simpler process was however pointed out as a strategic priority (6Cragg G.M. Schepartz S.A. Suffness M. Grever M.R. J. Nat.

In this context, it is essential to understand the biosynthesis of paclitaxel (12Jennewein S. Croteau R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 57: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The isolation and characterization of naturally occurring taxoids have led to the hypothesis that at least 19 biochemical steps are required for the biosynthesis of paclitaxel starting from geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), 2The abbreviations used are:GGPPgeranylgeranylpyrophosphateCBTcembratrien-olCBTScembratrien-ol synthaseFTflow throughihpintro hairpin RNA interferenceMSmass spectrometryOCT5(12)-oxa-3(11)-cyclotaxaneT5αHtaxa-4(5),11(12)-diene 5α-hydroxylaseTStaxa-4(5),11(12)-diene synthaseGCgas chromatographyHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyHP-TLChigh performance TLC.2The abbreviations used are:GGPPgeranylgeranylpyrophosphateCBTcembratrien-olCBTScembratrien-ol synthaseFTflow throughihpintro hairpin RNA interferenceMSmass spectrometryOCT5(12)-oxa-3(11)-cyclotaxaneT5αHtaxa-4(5),11(12)-diene 5α-hydroxylaseTStaxa-4(5),11(12)-diene synthaseGCgas chromatographyHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyHP-TLChigh performance TLC. the universal precursor of diterpenoids (13Walker K.

A. 2004; 101: 9149-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although the pathway is not yet understood overall, several important steps have been elucidated in recent years (14Jennewein S. Wildung M.R. Chau M. Walker K. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9149-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The first committed step involves cyclization of GGPP to taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene by taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene synthase (TS). The TS enzyme has been characterized, and its cDNA has been cloned (15Wildung M.R. Croteau R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9201-9204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cyclization is thought to be followed by α-hydroxylation of taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene at the C-5 position, with allylic migration of the 4(5) double bond to the 4(20) position, thus leading to 5α-hydroxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene (16Jennewein S. Long R.M. Williams R.M. Croteau R. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This compound is also presumed to be the second intermediate of the paclitaxel pathway, because feeding Taxus brevifolia stem discs with labeled 5α-hydroxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene led to the labeling of advanced taxoids such as 10-deacetylbaccatin III, cephalomannine, and paclitaxel (17Hefner J. Rubenstein S.M. Ketchum R.E. Gibson D.M. Williams R.M. Croteau R. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cDNA coding for a taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene 5α-hydroxylase (T5αH) (GenBank™ accession number AY289209.1; called CYP725A4 in P-450 oxygenase nomenclature) was cloned and functionally expressed in yeast and Sf9 insect cells (16Jennewein S.

The catalytic efficiency of T5αH was, however, found to be very low, because only up to 2.5% of the taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene olefin was converted to 5α-hydroxytaxa-4 (20),11(12)-diene in engineered yeast co-expressing both TS and T5αH (8Dejong J.M.

Recently tobacco glandular trichome cells were described as an attractive and efficient target for the engineering of diterpenoid biosynthesis (18Wang E. Gan S. Wagner G.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Wang E. Wang R. DeParasis J. Loughrin J.H. Gan S. Wagner G.J. Nature. 2001; 19: 371-374Google Scholar). Because of significant knowledge of the paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway accumulated over the years, it appeared a good model to test the ability of the tobacco trichomes to support the production of complex diterpenoids. Nicotiana sylvestris is a wild tobacco whose trichomes produce a single class of diterpenoids, the cembratrien-diols (CBT-diols) (20Severson R.F. Arrendale R.F. Chortyk O.T. Johnson A.W. Jackson D.M. Gwynn G.R. Chaplin J.F. Stephenson M.G. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1984; 32: 566-570Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathway of these compounds was unraveled recently (21Wang E. Wagner G.J. Planta. 2003; 216: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), making it possible to knock out their production by gene silencing. This was achieved by introducing an intron hairpin RNA interference construct, named ihpCBTS, targeting the first step of the CBT-diols pathway, cembratrienol synthase (CBTS). As described elsewhere (11Tissier, A., Sallaud, C., and Rontein, D. (August 3, 2006) French Patent AN FR2006:000188Google Scholar), ihpCBTS under control of the CBTS trichome-specific promoter led to a drastic reduction in the production of endogenous CBT-diols to less than 10% of wild-type levels. The ihpCBTS line offers an excellent platform for expression of heterologous diterpene synthases. As a preliminary step to this study, TS was successfully expressed in N. sylvestris trichome cells yielding taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene at ∼20 μg·g–1 of fresh leaves on average, 10% of which is secreted and recovered in the trichome exudates (11Tissier, A., Sallaud, C., and Rontein, D. (August 3, 2006) French Patent AN FR2006:000188Google Scholar). This study reports the co-expression of both TS and CYP725A4, the next presumed step in the paclitaxel pathway, in tobacco trichomes. Unexpectedly, instead of 5α-hydroxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene, a novel oxidized taxane was found. We describe here how this new compound was identified, purified, and chemically characterized. We propose an unprecedented CYP-mediated reaction sequence for the conversion of taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene to this new compound, involving oxidation and subsequent cyclizations. Chemicals and Reagents—[1-3H]GGPP (15 Ci/mmol) and PD-10 column were from General Electric Healthcare. GGPP, NADPH, dithiothreitol, antibiotics, salts and buffers were from Sigma. All of the solvents were purchased from Fisher except diethylether, which was from Sigma. HP-TLC silica gel 60 plates (10 × 10 cm) were from Merck, and prepacked silica columns were from Interchim. Films (catalog number MS 111 1681) and reagents for autoradiography were from Kodak. Taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene, 5α-hydroxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene, and 5α-acetoxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene standards were provided by Rodney Croteau. Plant Culture—Tobacco plants were grown in soil in climate-controlled chambers, with a 14-h day/10-h night photoperiod under an illumination of 400-W high pressure metal halide lights, a temperature cycle of 25/20 °C (day/night), and 65% relative humidity. The plants were irrigated once a day with nutritive medium (22Woolhouse H.W. Hardwick K. New Phytologist. 1966; 65: 518-525Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Sequences for CYP725A4—A cDNA encoding the taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene 5α-hydroxylase (CYP725A4) was provided by Rodney Croteau (16Jennewein S. Long R.M. Williams R.M. Croteau R. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The clone was completely resequenced before being recloned into a plant expression vector. A single nucleotide difference with the original GenBank™ accession (AY289209.1) was reported to the original authors, and after due verification the GenBank™ entry was modified accordingly (accession number AY289209.2). This nucleotide difference results in a protein sequence difference near the C terminus. Instead of the IKLFPETIVN C terminus previously described for CYP725A4 (16Jennewein S. Long R.M. Williams R.M. Croteau R. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), AY289209.2 has an amino acid sequence (IKLFPRP) more closely related to that of other cytochrome P-450 oxygenases from yew belonging to the CYP725 family. For clarity, we refer to the first sequence as CYP725A4[ext.1] and to the updated sequence as CYP725A4. Plant T-DNA—PCR amplification was performed using the Pwo high fidelity enzyme (Roche Applied Science), and primers were designed to match the 22 nucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ ends of sequences, flanked with restriction sites. The TS and CYP725A4 cDNAs were provided by Rodney Croteau. An expression cassette for TS cDNA (11Tissier, A., Sallaud, C., and Rontein, D. (August 3, 2006) French Patent AN FR2006:000188Google Scholar) was constructed from the CBTS1.0 promoter (23Sallaud C. Rontein D. Tissier A. French Patent AN FR2005:002530. 2004; Google Scholar) between BamHI and NcoI, the TS cDNA between NcoI and XhoI, and the CBTS terminator (23Sallaud C. Rontein D. Tissier A. French Patent AN FR2005:002530. 2004; Google Scholar) between XhoI and SalI. PCR products were inserted into the plant expression vector pCAMBIA 2300 by ligation with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), and the final expression plasmid was named pLibro_16. A cassette for CYP725A4 cDNA (AY289209.2) was constructed from the CYP71D16 promoter (18Wang E. Gan S. Wagner G.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the CYP725A4 cDNA, and the Nos terminator, with restriction sites, ligation, and receiving vector as described for the TS cassette. The recombinant vector harboring CYP725A4 was named pLibro_17. The construction of a cassette comprising the ihpCBTS is described elsewhere (11Tissier, A., Sallaud, C., and Rontein, D. (August 3, 2006) French Patent AN FR2006:000188Google Scholar), and that plasmid was named pLibro_09. Plant Transformation and Progeny—The three pLibro vectors were separately introduced into the Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 by electroporation and then into the genome of N. sylvestris via standard tobacco transformation methods (24Horsch R.B. Fry J.E. Hoffmann N.L. Eichholtz D. Rogers S.G. Fraley R.T. Science. 1985; 227: 1229-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (3717) Google Scholar). Transformants and their progeny were selected by real time PCR to determine the copy number and expression level of transgenes. Real time PCR was carried out with TaqMan probes (ABI) in duplex reactions, on an ABI7000 instrument. The Taq-Man reference probe matched one allele of the CYP71D16 gene (18Wang E. Gan S. Wagner G.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which was shown to be a single copy gene in N. sylvestris and expressed specifically in the trichome cells (data not shown). The relative expression level was determined from the ratio 2Ct CYP71D16/2Ct transgene. Transgenic plants were crossed and self-pollinated to give the NsTax plant, which harbored all three transgenes in the homozygous state. Production of Truncated TS in Escherichia coli—The TS cDNA coding for a protein truncated at the N terminus at amino acid position 75 (TS_trunc) was cloned in the pET-30b expression vector (Novagen) between the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites. The stop codon was removed to insert a histidine tag in frame at the C terminus. The resulting recombinant vector pET::TS_trunc-HisTag was introduced into BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). The transformed cells were routinely grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 in LB medium with 100 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 20 μg/ml tetracycline. At that point isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (1 mm), and incubation was continued at 25 °C for 5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in a lysis buffer (200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm KCl). The cells were disrupted in a French Press. The extract was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatant was desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated with the lysis buffer. Purification of the recombinant TS_trunc-HisTag was performed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The final elution buffer containing proteins was exchanged with assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), using a PD-10 column. Production of [2-3H]Taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene—[2-3H]Taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was produced using purified recombinant TS_trunc-HisTag. [1-3H]GGPP (15 μCi/nmol) was diluted 28 times with cold GGPP to a final specific radioactivity of 0.54 μCi/nmol at a concentration of 1 mm. Production of [2-3H]taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was achieved using 500 μg of TS_trunc-HisTag, 92.7 μm [1-3H]GGPP at 30 °C during 2 h. The reaction medium was extracted with pentane (3 times, v/v), and the product was passed through a 100 mg silica column, concentrated, and counted in a scintillation counter. Labeling Experiment—The [2-3H]taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was resuspended in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, 10 mm sucrose, 2 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and sonicated 5 min in a bath. 15 discs (1-cm diameter) of fresh half-expanded leaves were vacuum infiltrated with the tritiated buffer containing 1 μCi of [2-3H]taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene in a 5-ml glass tube. The tissues were incubated 18 h at 25 °C under light and at 80 rpm (Infors incubator). After incubation the discs were washed with cold phosphate buffer and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen discs were ground with mortar and pestle to a fine powder and thawed in a ternary blend of chloroform:methanol:water (0.5:1:0.4 v/v/v) according to Ref. 25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Canadian J.

The extract was dissolved in pentane and loaded onto a 200-mg silica column. The column was eluted with diethylether. The flow through and eluate were brought to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 20 μl of pentane, and 10 μl was deposited onto a HP-TLC silica gel 60 plate. The plate was developed with a pentane:ethyl acetate (4:1 v/v) binary blend (17) and exposed to Kodak film for 3 weeks. Expression of CYP725A4 in Yeast—CYP725A4[ext.1] known as taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene 5α-hydroxylase (AY289209.1) and the CYP725A4 cDNAs (AY289209.2) were cloned in the BamHI site of the shuttle vector pYeDP60 (26Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The appropriate orientation of the cDNAs was selected by PCR, and the insert sequences were verified. The two plasmids were used to transform yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae WAT11 strain containing the Arabidopsis reductase ATR1 (27Urban P. Mignotte C. Kazmaier M. Delorme F. Pompon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19176-19186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The microsomes were prepared as described (26Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene oxygenase activities were tested in 200-μl catalytic assays using microsomes (20 mg of total proteins) resuspended in the following buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 μm NADPH, and 92 μm taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene (initially dissolved in 10 μl of Me2SO). The products were extracted three times with pentane. The organic samples were concentrated under a stream of nitrogen and analyzed by GC-MS. Purification of OCT—Exudate from 800 g of fresh leaves from NsTax plants was solubilized in pentane, loaded onto a silica open column (7 cm high, 1 cm diameter) with gravity flow, and washed with 50 ml of pentane. Flow through and washes were discarded. OCT was eluted with 50 ml of pentane:ether (95:5 v/v), and pentane was evaporated in a rotavapor (Büchi R-200). The dry compounds were dissolved in acetonitrile and filtrated through a polytetrafluoroethylene filter (pore size 0.45 μm). The filtrate was loaded in an HPLC apparatus (1100 series Agilent Technologies equipped with a quaternary pump) onto a reverse phase column (UP5-ODB 15QS, 150×2 mm; Interchrom). The solvents used for separation were water, acetonitrile, and a ternary blend composed of dichloromethane:hexane:methanol (66:33.5:0.5 v/v/v) (28Watson C. McCraw J. Polzin G. Ashley D. Barr D. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2004; 38: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The gradient program was: 0–20 min, from 70% acetonitrile in water to 100%; 20–24 min, 0 to 100% of ternary blend; 24–27 min, 100% of ternary blend. Flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The HPLC effluent was ionized in the atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source using a nitrogen nebulizing gas in the positive-ion mode, with the vaporizer at 300 °C and the capillary at 200 °C. A peak of pure OCT (detection at m/z 271 [M–17]+) was collected. GC-MS Analysis—Trichome exudate was extracted from fresh tobacco leaves in pentane for 2 min, and the samples were injected directly into GC-MS for analysis on a 6890 N gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 N mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). Separation was done in a 30-m × 0.25-mm diameter capillary with 0.25-μm film of HP-1ms (Agilent Technologies). The samples were injected using a cool on-column injector at 40 °C, followed by 10 °C/min to 150 °C, 2 min hold. The oven was programmed to start at 40 °C and then increased at 10 °C/min to 100 °C, followed by 3 °C/min to 280 °C and a 5-min hold. Electronic impact was recorded at 70 eV. OCT was quantified by ionization yield of diterpene alcohol: cis-abienol (Librophyt internal reference). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance—Analysis was done in a Bruker Avance DRX500 spectrometer (1H-500.13 MHz) equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance inverse cryoprobe TXI (1H-13C-15N) with z gradient. The spectra were recorded from a 1.7-mm NMR capillary tube (0.6 mg of sample) in 50 μl of CDCl3 solvent (δ1H 7.26 ppm -δ13C 77.16 ppm) at the temperature of 300 K. The pulse programs of all one-dimensional/two-dimensional experiments (1H,13C-DEPTQ, COSY, TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC) were taken from the Bruker standard software library. Molecular Modeling—The three-dimensional optimization structure of OCT was calculated with the ACD/three-dimensional viewer (version 10.0 from ACD/Labs Chemcad), which is based on CHARMM parametrization (29Brooks R.B.

Production of the NsTax Tobacco Transgenic Line Expressing TS and CYP725A4—To produce the 5α-hydroxytaxa-4(5),11(12)-diene in the trichomes of N. sylvestris, the cDNAs encoding TS (15Wildung M.R. Croteau R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9201-9204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and CYP725A4 (16Jennewein S. Long R.M. Williams R.M. Croteau R. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) were introduced in independent plant expression cassettes. The TS cDNA is controlled by the CBTS promoter (23Sallaud C. Rontein D. Tissier A. French Patent AN FR2005:002530. 2004; Google Scholar), and the CYP725A4 cDNA is controlled by the CYP71D16 promoter, both of which are trichome-specific (18Wang E. Gan S. Wagner G.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both constructs were stably introduced in the genome of N. sylvestris ihpCBTS line. In previous work, we have shown that expression of TS leads to efficient production of taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene in the leaf exudates (11Tissier, A., Sallaud, C., and Rontein, D. (August 3, 2006) French Patent AN FR2006:000188Google Scholar). A succession of crosses and self-fertilization gave a transgenic N. sylvestris line named NsTax harboring and expressing the two transgenes in the homozygous state. Genotypes of transformants and expression data of NsTax are presented in Table 1.TABLE 1Genotypes of transgenic tobacco lines and expression in NsTax plantsPlantsTSCYP725A4ihpCBTScopy nb.exp.copy nb.exp.copy nb.TS16 ± 1CYP725A4168 ± 15ihpCBTS1NsTax26 ± 2280 ± 192 Open table in a new tab Production of a Novel Oxidized Taxane in NsTax Plants—Leaf exudate from transgenic plants was analyzed by direct injection with a cool on-column injector into a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS), thereby avoiding any molecule alteration that could have occurred upon sample preparation (i.e. silica beads) or high temperature injection. Taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene and 5α-hydroxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene standards were used as references (Fig. 1A). Leaf exudates of ihpCBTS plants had no detectable taxanes (Fig. 1B). Consistent with previous work (11Tissier, A., Sallaud, C., and Rontein, D. (August 3, 2006) French Patent AN FR2006:000188Google Scholar), plants expressing TS and ihpCBTS produced taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene in the leaf exudate at 2 μg·g–1 of fresh weight (Fig. 1C). When CYP725A4 was expressed alone, no new product could be detected in the exudate (Fig. 1D). Finally, when TS, CYP725A4, and ihpCBTS were co-expressed in NsTax plants, taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was absent from the GC-MS profile, but the 5α-hydroxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene could not be detected either. Instead a new isomer, which was named OCT and whose structure is described below, was detected (Fig. 1E). Because of the lack of standards for taxane diterpenoids with a low level of oxidation, the OCT could not be identified initially. The retention time of OCT (39.52 min) was between those of taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene (36.86 min) and 5α-hydroxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene (40.72 min), suggesting an intermediate volatility. The mass spectrum of the OCT was highly distinct with a major positive ion m/z+ 191 (Fig. 1F) and a putative molecular ion m/z+ 288. This latter value is the expected molecular weight of a mono-oxidized diterpene, consistent with a single oxidative reaction on the taxadiene core. At this stage, exudate analysis and molecular weight were the only evidence pointing to OCT as an oxidized taxoid. OCT as a New Taxoid—To unambiguously prove that OCT is derived from taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene, tritiated taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was followed in trichome cells. [2-3H]Taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was biochemically synthesized using truncated TS recombinant protein from E. coli and [1-3H]GGPP as substrate. In our experimental conditions, labeling revealed that 10% of [1-3H]GGPP was converted to [2-3H]taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene. The [2-3H]taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was then used to vacuum infiltrate discs of fresh tobacco leaves. After overnight incubation, organic soluble compounds were extracted from whole leaves and loaded onto a silica resin to separate olefins, which were retrieved in the flow through (FT), from eluted oxidized compounds. FT and eluates were then analyzed on HP-TLC plates developed by autoradiography. When infiltration was done on leaves from wild type or TS-expressing plants, no radioactive label could be detected except in the FT (Fig. 2), indicating that [2-3H]taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was not metabolized. In contrast, with NsTax leaves radioactive label was recovered in the FT (60%) but also in the eluate (40%) (Fig. 2), meaning that [2-3H]taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was converted to a tritiated oxidized taxane. The labeled eluate"
https://openalex.org/W1973237320,"β-Defensins are small antimicrobial polypeptides that are mainly expressed by epithelial cells and play an important role in the antimicrobial innate immune response. In addition to the direct microbicidal effects of these polypeptides, it became evident that certain members of the β-defensin super family have the capacity to promote local innate inflammatory and systemic adaptive immune responses by interacting with the CC-chemokine receptor CCR6. We have identified mouse β-defensin 14 (mBD14, Defb14) as an orthologue of human β-defensin 3 (hBD3 or DEFB103). Based on primary structural analysis, mBD14 demonstrates greater (68%) homology to its human orthologue, containing three conserved cystein linkages, characteristic for the β-defensin super family. mBD14 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues including spleen, colon, and tissues of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Interestingly, we also detected mBD14 expression in immature CD11c+ bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. The expression of mBD14 can be induced by Toll-like receptor agonists such as lipopolysaccharide and poly(I:C) and by pro-inflammatory stimuli e.g. tumor necrosis factor and interferon-γ. Furthermore, expression of mBD14 seems to be regulated by activation of the intracellular pattern recognition receptor NOD2/CARD15 as revealed by reporter gene analysis. We prepared a recombinant mBD14-Ig fusion protein that retained potent antimicrobial activity against several Escherichia coli strains but not against various Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus strains. hBD3 and also the newly identified mBD14 were chemotactic for cells expressing the mouse CC-chemokine receptor CCR6. In addition, both hBD3 and mBD14 were chemotactic for freshly isolated mouse resident peritoneal cells. Thus, mBD14, based on structural and functional similarities, appears to be an orthologue of hBD3."
https://openalex.org/W2057646387,"Epithelial cells (ECs) continuously interact with microorganisms and detect their presence via different pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Ligation of epithelial TLRs by pathogens is usually associated with the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators and antimicrobial factors. In this study, using human airway ECs as a model, we found that detection of microbial patterns via epithelial TLRs directly regulates tissue homeostasis. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and microbial patterns signaling via TLR2 and TLR5 induce a set of non-immune epithelial responses including cell migration, wound repair, proliferation, and survival of primary and cancerous ECs. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene targeting, receptor-tyrosine kinase microarray and inhibition studies, we determined that TLR and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediate the stimulating effect of microbial patterns on epithelial repair. Microbial patterns signaling via Toll-like receptors 2 and 5 contribute to epithelial repair, growth and survival. This effect is independent of hematopoietic and other cells as well as inflammatory cytokines suggesting that epithelia are able to regulate their integrity in an autonomous non-inflammatory manner by sensing microbes directly via TLRs."
https://openalex.org/W2104557054,"Background C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase reactant and marker of inflammation, has been shown to predict risk of incident cardiovascular events. However, few studies have comprehensively examined six common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP gene, haplotypes, and plasma CRP levels with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods and Findings We conducted parallel nested case-control studies within two ongoing, prospective cohort studies of U.S. women (Nurses' Health Study) and men (Health Professionals Follow-up Study). Blood samples were available in a subset of 32,826 women and 18,225 men for biomarker and DNA analyses. During 8 and 6 years of follow-up, 249 women and 266 men developed incident nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD, and controls (498 women, 531 men) were matched 2:1 on age, smoking, and date of blood draw from participants free of cardiovascular disease at the time the case was diagnosed. Among both women and men, minor alleles were significantly associated with higher CRP levels for SNPs 1919A>T and 4741G>C, but associated with lower CRP levels for SNPs 2667G>C and 3872C>T. SNP 2667G>C was individually associated with increased risk of CHD in both women [OR 1.57 (95% CI 1.01–2.44); p = 0.047] and men [1.93 (95% CI 1.30–2.88); p = 0.001]. Two of the five common haplotypes were associated with lower CRP levels, and Haplotype 4 which included minor alleles for 2667 and 3872 was associated with significantly lower CRP levels and an elevated risk of CHD. The remaining SNPs or haplotypes were not associated with CHD in both populations. Conclusions Common variation in the CRP gene was significantly associated with plasma CRP levels; however, the association between common SNPs and CRP levels did not correspond to a predicted change in CHD risk. The underlying inflammatory processes which predict coronary events cannot be captured solely by variation in the CRP gene."
https://openalex.org/W1978544077,"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play an important role in a variety of nuclear processes, including genetic imprinting, RNA interference-mediated transcriptional repression, and dosage compensation. These transcripts are thought to influence chromosome organization and, in some cases, gene expression by directing the assembly of specific chromatin modifications to targeted regions of the genome. In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, little is known about the regulation of nuclear organization or gene expression, although a notable scarcity of identifiable transcription factors encoded in its genome has led to speculation that this organism may be unusually reliant on chromatin modifications as a mechanism for regulating gene expression. To study the mechanisms that regulate chromatin structure in malaria parasites, we examined the role of ncRNAs in the assembly of chromatin at the centromeres of P. falciparum. We show that centromeric regions within the Plasmodium genome contain bidirectional promoter activity driving the expression of short ncRNAs that are localized within the nucleus and appear to associate with the centromeres themselves, strongly suggesting that they are central characters in the maintenance and function of centromeric chromatin.

RNAs are non-coding if they are not translated into protein, and most do not have any substantial open reading frames. Examples of ncRNAs and their roles in chromatin assembly and modification are found in organisms as varied as dinoflagellates (1Moreno Diaz de la Espina S. Alverca E. Cuadrado A. Franca S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 84: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and yeast, fruit flies, mice, and humans (2Morey C. Avner P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and thus are likely conserved throughout a broad range of eukaryotic evolution. The most closely studied systems that employ ncRNAs to direct chromatin assembly and modification include examples of genetic imprinting (3Lewis A. Reik W. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2006; 113: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), RNAi-based transcriptional repression (4Verdel A. Moazed D.

Although different aspects of these RNAs have been characterized, exactly how they execute their tasks is still a mystery.

The centromeres of eukaryotic chromosomes are examples of chromosomal elements that assemble a unique, specific chromatin architecture that is necessary for proper chromosome segregation during replication. Studies of ncRNAs found at the centromeres of various organisms underscore the influence these RNAs have on chromatin structure and function. There is strong evidence that epigenetic marks on chromatin, and not DNA sequence, are the basis for centromere identity, inheritance, and function. Convincing evidence from several species suggests that any piece of DNA may function as a centromere if it is flagged with the proper epigenetic marks (7Cooke H.J. Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 319-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 8Karpen G.H. Allshire R.C. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 489-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, constitutive heterochromatin is strongly associated with centromeric and pericentromeric regions (9Pidoux A.L. Allshire R.C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and the only common trait of all centromeric chromatin studied so far is the presence of nucleosomes containing a centromere-specific histone H3 variant (10Carroll C.W. Straight A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 70-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that ncRNAs are involved in, or are at least associated with, the process of modifying centromeric chromatin in several organisms, including fission yeast (9Pidoux A.L.

There is evidence indicating that ncRNAs may also play a substantial role in Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan parasite that causes the most severe form of human malaria. The study of ncRNAs thus may be important for understanding the most basic aspects of this pathogen's biology, such as genome organization, gene regulation, and mitosis. These cellular processes are not well understood in this organism, and they likely do not occur in P. falciparum as they do in model eukaryotes. For example, there is a surprising lack of specific transcription factors and other transcription-associated proteins that bear any homology to those found in animals, plants, and fungi. In addition, although the degradation of double-stranded RNA molecules into short fragments (∼25 nucleotides) has been reported (17Malhotra P. Dasaradhi P.V. Kumar A. Mohmmed A. Agrawal N. Bhatnagar R.K. Chauhan V.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the key components of the RNAi pathway, including those required for RNAi-mediated transcriptional silencing, are missing from the genome (18Aravind L. Iyer L.M. Wellems T.E. Miller L.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 771-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Significant control of gene expression is likely exerted at the level of transcription, but the effectors remain elusive. However, a notable exception to the paucity of specific transcription-associated proteins is the CCCH-type zinc finger RNA-binding domain, which, after adjusting for genome size, is twice as abundant in the Plasmodium genome when compared with other eukaryotes (19Coulson R.M. Hall N. Ouzounis C.A. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1548-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Cook C.R. Kung G. Peterson F.C. Volkman B.F. Lei M. J. Biol.

This finding may suggest a more widespread role for RNAs in the cellular processes of P. falciparum compared with other eukaryotes. In addition, several examples of ncRNAs have been described in the literature. For instance, Su et al. (21Su X. Heatwole V.M. Wertheimer S.P. Guinet F. Herrfeldt J.V. Peterson D.S. Ravetch J.V. Wellems T.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) showed that ncRNAs are abundantly transcribed from members of the var gene family, and Kyes et al. (22Kyes S.A. Christodoulou Z. Raza A. Horrocks P. Pinches R. Rowe J.A. Newbold C.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) subsequently revealed that expression of these transcripts is tightly regulated over the course of the cell cycle. Many sporozoite-specific genes (e.g. starp, ctrp, and csp) have also been shown to be actively transcribed within a narrow window of the intra-erythrocytic cell cycle, but remain untranslated into protein (23Le Roch K.G.

Nature. 1998; 394: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition, both microarray analysis and studies using serial analysis of gene expression have detected transcripts that do not appear to encode proteins; however, the significance of these findings remains obscure (26Gunasekera A.M.

To study the potential role of ncRNAs in chromatin assembly in malaria parasites, we have examined the centromeres identified previously in P. falciparum. A recent report by Kelly et al. (28Kelly J.M. McRobert L. Baker D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6706-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) provides experimental evidence to support the annotation by showing that the activity of topoisomerase II, a known kinetochore protein, localizes to the A/T-rich regions originally proposed to be centromeres. We show that centromeric regions of the Plasmodium genome contain bidirectional promoter activity, and we detect short ncRNAs of discrete length transcribed from these regions. These transcripts are tightly localized within the nucleus and appear to be associated with the sequences annotated as centromeres, strongly suggesting that they are central characters in the maintenance and function of centromeric chromatin. These data support the hypothesis that ncRNAs might play an important role in initiating the proper organizational assembly of chromatin throughout the genome. Parasite Culture—The P. falciparum NF54 strain was used for transient and stable transfections as well as FISH experiments. For Northern blots, subclones of two isolates, IT (subclone A4) and NF54 (subclone NR13), were cultured and sorbitol-synchronized by standard techniques (29Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (5915) Google Scholar, 30Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). Parasites were grown as described previously (31Trager W. Jensen J.B. Bull. W. H. O. 1977; 55: 363-365PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, parasites were reared at 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium and supplemented with either 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen) or 10% human serum, 0.25% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin. Parasites were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 90% nitrogen. For etoposide experiments, parasites were cultured to ∼6% parasitaemia at ring stage; 200 μm etoposide (Sigma) was added; and parasites were incubated at 37 °C for ∼5 h. Parasitaemia of parasites used in all experiments was between 6 and 8%. DNA Constructs—The previously described plasmid pHLH (32Wu Y. Sifri C.D. Lei H-H. Su X. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) was modified into pHLRH. pHLRH was used as a plasmid backbone for cloning of pHLCsRH (Cs is the cen2 fragment) and pHLXRH (X being segments of the cen2 fragment). The sequence of Cs corresponds to MAL2, 447,329–448,405, in the P. falciparum genome. The derivative fragments CsA, CsB, and CsC (see Fig. 2) correspond to MAL2, 447,329–447,717, 447,752–448,146, and 448,119–448,405, respectively. The primers used to amplify the Cs, CsA, CsB, and CsC fragments (see Fig. 2) from pHLCsRH were 5′-AAACTGCAGCCCCCGCGGGTTATAG-3′ and 5′-GTGGCGGCCGCTCTAGAACAGTGGATCCCCCCTAC-3′ (Cs), 5′-AAACTGCAGCCCCCGCGGGTTATAG-3′ and 5′-ATTGCGCCGCTATATTTATGCAATATTAATTTATATATAAC-3′ (CsA), 5′-ATACTGCAGAAAAAGTTATATATAAATTAATATGC-3′ and 5′-ATAGCGGCCGCATATTAATATATAAAATAACAGTG-3′ (CsB), and 5′-ATACTGCAGTTACCTGTTATTTTATATATTAATAT-3′ and 5′-GTGGCGGCCGCTCTAGAACAGTGGATCCCCCCTAC-3′ (CsC). A control construct was made by amplifying the intron from PFF0020c (a var-like gene) using primers 5′-CGGGATCCCTCTAGGATTGTTATTATTTAAGG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACGTTTTGGTTTTGTTCTCATC-3′. Primers used to amplify a 737-bp probe for kahrp (knob-associated histidine-rich protein) from NF54 genomic DNA were 5′-GGTTCAGAAGGTTATGGAT-3′ and 5′-CCTTCAGCAGCACATTGTC-3′. Parasite Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Parasites were transfected using “DNA-loaded” red blood cells as described previously (33Deitsch K.W. Driskill C.L. Wellems T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Briefly, 350 μl of red blood cells (at 50% hematocrit) was combined with 50 μg of plasmid DNA in a total volume of 400 μl. This was then transferred to a 0.2-cm electroporation cuvette, chilled on ice, and electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus under conditions of 0.31 kV and 960 microfarads. The erythrocytes were washed with complete medium, and parasites were added for invasion. 4.5 ml of culture medium containing DNA-loaded erythrocytes at 5% hematocrit was combined with 0.5 ml of a standard parasite culture. For stable transfections, parasites were grown in the presence of 5 nm WR99210 as described (34Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed on 5-ml cultures at selected times after transfection (33Deitsch K.W. Driskill C.L. Wellems T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—RNA and Northern blot hybridizations were performed as described previously (35Kyes S. Pinches R. Newbold C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from synchronized parasites at various time points after red blood cell invasion, size-separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose, and then capillary-transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare). DNase treatment was performed for indicated samples using Ambion Turbo-DNase following the manufacturer's instructions. Short RNA was resolved on 15% acrylamide, 7 m urea, 1× TBE (0.089 m Tris, 0.089 m boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) gels, which were electroblotted for 15 min (50 V) in 0.5× TBE onto Hybond N+. RNA sizes were estimated with size markers (0.24–9.5-kb RNA marker from Invitrogen; Century marker from Ambion) and from EtBr-staining bands in parasite RNA. The shortest EtBr-visible band corresponds to tRNA (confirmed by hybridization) and is therefore ∼70–75 nucleotides. Blots were hybridized over-night (as described in Ref. 22Kyes S.A. Christodoulou Z. Raza A. Horrocks P. Pinches R. Rowe J.A. Newbold C.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with riboprobes at 50 °C (probe Cen2Rw, transcript of w strand) or 40 °C (the remaining probes) and washed in 1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7) at hybridization temperature. Films were exposed overnight. For riboprobes, a fragment representing the region to the “right” of the chromosome 2 centromere, termed Cen2R, was amplified from 3D7 (subclone of NF54) genomic DNA using the following primer pair: Cen2RF, 5′-CTGGAATAATAAGGTAACATGATTAATTTAC-3′; and Cen2RR, 5′-TTTATGTTCTCAGATGGTATAAGG-3′. A fragment representing the region to the “left” of the chromosome 2 centromere, termed Cen2L, was amplified from genomic DNA using the following primer pair: Cen2LF, 5′-TTGCGATATAACACCATATGTG-3′; and Cen2LR, 5′-GTAACATTTTAATCCTATTTG-3′. Similarly, probes near the putative centromere on chromosome 3 were amplified using the following primers: Cen3RF, 5′-AATAAATGATTATTTTATTGATGTG-3′; Cen3RR, 5′-GTGTCTTATTCCATAAGTATATATTG-3′; Cen3RbF, 5′-ATATAAAATATCTCTTATGTTATAGTTC-3′; and Cen3RbR, 5′-TGTTTCTTATTGAAATATGCATTA-3′. T7 promoter sequences were ligated to the ends of the resulting fragments, and probe templates were synthesized as per the manufacturer's instructions using an Ambion Lig'n'Scribe kit. Riboprobes were synthesized as per the manufacturer's instructions (Megascript, Ambion) using [α-32P]UTP. FISH—The DNA FISH technique was carried out on ring-stage parasites as described by Freitas-Junior et al. (36Freitas-Junior L.H. Bottius E. Pirrit L.A. Deitsch K.W. Scheidig C. Guinet F. Nehrbass U. Wellems T.E. Scherf A. Nature. 2000; 407: 1018-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. RNA FISH was performed on ring-stage parasites as described previously by Thompson (37Thompson J. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 72: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar) with minor changes. For detergent-treated FISH, 0.02% SDS and 0.1% Triton X-100 was added immediately prior to fixation with paraformaldehyde. DNA probes were labeled with biotin and fluorescein using Roche High-Prime kits. Biotin was detected using streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). RNA probes were labeled using a Promega riboprobe in vitro transcription kit and fluorescein-12-UTP and DIG-11-UTP (Roche Applied Science). DIG was detected using sheep anti-DIG antibody followed by donkey anti-sheep antibody using Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). After washing, the slides were mounted in anti-fade medium and visualized using an Olympus M081 fluorescent microscope. Slides were counted using 50–70 fields containing 5–10 nuclei per field for each experiment. Composite images were produced using Photoshop 6.0, and the images were collated. The Centromeres of P. falciparum Produce 75–175-Nucleotide Non-coding Transcripts—In the P. falciparum genome data base, centromeres have been annotated in all but 1 of the 14 chromosomes (28Kelly J.M. McRobert L. Baker D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6706-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These sequences were designated as centromeres based on their length (2–3 kb) and their A/T content (∼97%, compared with ∼82% across the genome). They are devoid of open reading frames and contain numerous multiple tandem repeats not conserved between chromosomes (38Wickstead B. Ersfeld K. Gull K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 360-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The function of these sequences as centromeres was experimentally validated recently (28Kelly J.M. McRobert L. Baker D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6706-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether ncRNAs were associated with these centromeres in a manner similar to other eukaryotes, Northern blotting was performed using total RNA extracted from cultured, asexual-stage parasites. To avoid making probes from the extremely A/T-rich, repetitive sequence found within the center of the centromeres, the DNA sequence from the boundaries of the A/T-rich cores of the centromeres on chromosomes 2 and 3 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into plasmids that enabled the production of strand-specific RNA probes using in vitro transcription (Fig. 1A). Hybridization of probes on both sides of the centromere on chromosome 2 (Cen2L and Cen2R) to Northern blots containing RNA extracted from trophozoite-stage parasites identified transcripts of ∼75 and ∼175 nucleotides (Fig. 1B). The Cen2R probes detected RNA using both c and w strand probes, indicating that both strands of the genomic region are actively transcribed. Hybridization with probes from one side of the chromosome 3 centromere (Cen3Rw) also identified an ∼175-nucleotide transcript. Probes located farther from the centromere (Cen3Rb), as well as probes from elsewhere in the genome, did not give a strong hybridization signal. DNase treatment did not change the strength of the hybridization signals, verifying that the bands detected on the Northern blots are, in fact, the result of hybridization to RNA and not contaminating genomic DNA (data not shown). The Centromeres of P. falciparum Contain Transcriptionally Active Promoters—The presence of RNA transcripts transcribed from the centromeres suggested that these sequences might contain promoter activity. To assess this possibility, several overlapping fragments from a portion of the centromere on chromosome 2 (see Fig. 1A) were cloned into a double reporter construct (firefly and Renilla luciferase) and then transiently transfected into cultured parasites. A negative control consisting of the double reporter construct without any insert was also used. Luminescence assays for both Renilla and firefly luciferase expression were performed to detect promoter activity within the various DNA fragments. All fragments from the centromeres displayed significant promoter activity, yielding considerable luminescence in transfected parasites (Fig. 2). The longest fragment contained a bidirectional promoter and displayed high levels of both firefly and Renilla luciferase expression, whereas the smaller fragments all actively expressed Renilla luciferase, but varied in the level of firefly luciferase detected. A negative control construct containing an intron sequence of similar A/T content did not give any signal. The variability in the luminescence signal obtained from the various DNA fragments may indicate either that this DNA segment contains multiple promoters, each driving expression of short transcripts similar to those detected by Northern hybridization, or, alternatively, that the promoter activity depends more on the secondary structure of the DNA than on its primary sequence. In this case, shortening the DNA fragment might alter its structure and, consequently, its promoter activity. In either case, these data confirm that this centromere contains robust promoter activity and suggest that this promoter activity is likely responsible for the production of the transcripts detected by Northern blotting. To further validate the promoter activity contained in the centromeric sequence and to investigate its activity over the course of the cell cycle, the Renilla coding region in the expression vector was replaced by the human dihydrofolate reductase gene (hdhfr) to allow for selection of stably transformed parasites. In addition, a stage-specific Northern blot was hybridized with the Cen2R probe. The stage specificity of the RNA on this blot was verified previously (22Kyes S.A. Christodoulou Z. Raza A. Horrocks P. Pinches R. Rowe J.A. Newbold C.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The Northern blot easily detected the transcripts in all stages tested, indicating that these RNAs are present in the nuclei throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 2C). The reporter construct displayed, however, a stark increase in expression levels late in the cell cycle (Fig. 2D), when the genome is being replicated 24–36 times. These data might suggest that the centromeric promoters actively transcribe these non-coding RNAs when the chromosomes are replicating and segregating or during merozoite formation and that the RNAs then persist throughout the rest of the cell cycle, as detected by Northern blotting. The Centromeric Non-coding RNAs Are Retained within the Nucleus—Non-coding RNAs involved in chromatin assembly in other systems are typically found within the nucleus and are associated with chromatin. To address the question of where the centromeric ncRNAs of P. falciparum are located, FISH was utilized. Ring-stage parasites were fixed and hybridized to strand-specific, fluorescently labeled ∼300-nucleotide RNA probes from the boundaries of both cen2 and cen3. The hybridization images clearly show that the non-coding RNAs produced from the centromeres on chromosomes 2 and 3 (cen2 and cen3) are nuclear, localizing to distinct foci within the region of DAPI-stained genomic DNA (Fig. 3A). Although the cen RNAs were almost exclusively nuclear (>90%), hybridization to kahrp mRNA gave signals that were primarily outside the nucleus (Fig. 3B). To determine whether centromeric RNAs colocalized into a specific position within the nucleus, two-color RNA FISH was performed using RNA probes for the centromeres on both chromosomes 2 and 3 (Fig. 3A, third column). There was no discernible pattern to where in the nucleus the non-coding RNAs were located, suggesting that there is no specific subnuclear location in which the centromeres reside. Subnuclear Localization of the Centromeric Non-coding Transcripts Is Protein-dependent—The localization of the centromeric ncRNAs within the nucleus may be the result of base pairing of the transcripts with the chromosomal DNA or, alternatively, incorporation into the protein structure of the chromatin assembled within this region of the chromosome. To determine whether disruption of the protein structure of the chromatin altered or eliminated the localization of the ncRNAs, RNA FISH was carried out with or without the addition of SDS/Triton X-100 as described previously (39Marty A.J. Thompson J.K. Duffy M.F. Voss T.S. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The smears were probed again with the Cen2R probe. RNA FISH performed without the addition of SDS/Triton X-100 resulted in positive signals as expected (Fig. 4). However, with the addition of the detergent the signal was lost. SDS/Triton X-100 treatment did not disrupt hybridization using DNA FISH, and there was no change in signal intensity between the slides treated or untreated with detergent, indicating the treatment did not disrupt the chromosomal DNA. In addition, DNA FISH typically resulted in smaller, sharper spots, suggesting that the larger, more diffuse spots observed by RNA FISH may be the result of hybridization to several RNA molecules at each centromere. Disruption of Centromeres Using Etoposide Results in Loss of Centromeric ncRNA—To confirm that the ncRNAs transcribed from the centromeres are in fact associating with centromeric DNA sequences, we utilized the fact that treatment of cells with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide results in cleavage of chromosomal DNA and disruption of centromeres (28Kelly J.M. McRobert L. Baker D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6706-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RNA FISH was performed on parasites grown in complete medium with or without etoposide using Cen2R RNA probes labeled with fluorescein. As a control, a probe to a small nuclear RNA (PFC0358c) that should not be affected by etoposide was used. As shown in Fig. 5, the centromeric non-coding RNAs were easily detectable in parasites prior to etoposide treatment; however, this signal was lost after treatment. The presence of a small nuclear RNA signal in both the untreated and treated slides indicates that the etoposide treatment specifically disrupts either the localization or the production of the centromeric non-coding RNAs while not affecting other RNAs found in the nucleus. These results indicate that the ncRNAs transcribed from the centromeres of P. falciparum likely bind to the centromeres themselves, consistent with previously proposed models of the role of ncRNAs in the assembly of specific chromatin structure (2Morey C. Avner P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Verdel A. Moazed D. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5872-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In protozoans, little is known about chromosomal organization, including centromere identity and structure. In this report, we lay the groundwork for the study of ncRNAs and their association with centromeric chromatin in P. falciparum. We have identified short ncRNAs of discrete length that are transcribed from centromeric sequences and are found exclusively in the nucleus. Additionally, we have demonstrated that the ncRNAs associate with centromeric chromatin likely via a protein interaction. This is the first time the cellular localization and chromatin associations of ncRNAs have been described in P. falciparum. It is noteworthy that all of the ncRNAs appear as short, discrete bands of similar sizes (either ∼75 or 175 nucleotides in length). Although the apparent consistent, discrete sizes of the detected transcripts suggest that the P. falciparum centromeric RNAs are processed, the genome does not contain homologues to any of the known factors involved in the micro-RNA or RNAi pathways. Our data therefore might provide the first indication that this protozoan may have a different, yet analogous system of non-coding RNA processing. The observation that transcripts from centromeric repeats localize to the nucleus and associate with nuclear proteins is consistent with studies of centromeric ncRNAs from other organisms. In fission yeast, maize, and mammals, the ncRNAs associate with the centromeric regions where the centromere-specific histone H3 is recruited. This association, in turn, has been shown to result in methylation of histone H3K9 and formation of pericentromeric heterochromatin in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (40Ekwall K. Chromosome Res. 2004; 12: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The common theme among our results and the other reports of centromeric ncRNAs is that these RNAs most likely act via protein and/or RNA-RNA interactions, rather than by base pairing with DNA. This distinction is notable, for there are examples of repetitive non-coding transcripts (for example, those that initiate Ig class-switch recombination in humans and mice) that form RNA-DNA hybrids and higher order chromatin structures (41Mizuta R. Mizuta M. Kitamura D. J. Electron Microsc. 2005; 54: 403-408PubMed Google Scholar). Even in cases where the existence of centromeric ncRNAs has been established, the mechanisms that lead to transcription of the centromeric repeats are not clear. There is an apparent paradox in that centromeres and pericentromeric repeats consist of heterochromatin, an environment that is defined as repressive to transcription. Nonetheless, transcription is necessary for the establishment and maintenance of this heterochromatic state (11Volpe T. Schramke V. Hamilton G.L. White S.A. Teng G. Martienssen R.A. Allshire R.C. Chromosome Res. 2003; 11: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16Maison C. Bailly D. Peters A.H. Quivy J.P. Roche D. Taddei A. Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Almouzni G. Nat.

Science. 2002; 297: 1833-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). How are the transcribed regions defined, and how is transcription initiated in presumably heterochromatic areas of such low sequence complexity (∼97% A/T content in the centromeric regions of P. falciparum)? The results of our reporter genes assays suggest that the centromeric RNAs are primarily transcribed at a point in the cell cycle when the chromosomes replicate and segregate into dividing nuclei and then persist throughout the remainder of the cell cycle, probably associated with the centromeres themselves. Thus the centromeric promoters would be highly active only when the structure of the chromosomes and the organization of the dividing nuclei are being organized. In fission yeast, a heterochromatin-associated protein was shown to promote RNA polymerase II accessibility to centromeric sequences (44Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), resulting in the production of transcripts that go on to be processed by the RNAi machinery and are necessary for the recruitment of the heterochromatin structural protein Swi6/HP1 (11Volpe T. Schramke V. Hamilton G.L. White S.A. Teng G. Martienssen R.A. Allshire R.C. Chromosome Res. 2003; 11: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 43Volpe T.A. Kidner C. Hall I.M. Teng G. Grewal S.I. Martienssen R.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1833-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). The P. falciparum genome, although lacking in specific transcription factors and RNAi components, does contain homologues to histone-modifying enzymes, chromodomain proteins (such as HP1), and chromatin assembly factors, and therefore malaria parasites are likely to use a similar mechanism to maintain their centromeres. Although the details of ncRNA function at centromeres may differ widely among species, the various mechanisms may converge at the level of higher order chromatin-organizing factors. Employing RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions to specify centromere structure may have allowed eukaryotic cells to circumvent problems implied in coding functional elements in the medium of rapidly evolving centromeric DNA. In P. falciparum, this idea is supported by the fact that the centromeric regions do not share DNA sequence homology, but they are characterized by A/T-rich tandem repeat sequences unique to each chromosome. It is possible that the secondary structure of the transcripts from these sequences is more important than the sequence itself. The transcripts may then function as beacons for the recruitment of chromatin-modifying complexes. The extent to which ncRNAs and alterations in chromatin structure affect gene expression, chromosome segregation, and other nuclear processes in P. falciparum is only just beginning to be discovered. The centromeres may provide a useful model for deciphering the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. By gaining insights into how parasites organize their genomes and control gene expression, it may be possible to design strategies to better manipulate these systems and potentially control some aspects of the disease. In addition, knowledge of how these processes are regulated in lower eukaryotes will shed light on the evolutionary conservation of fundamental aspects of genome organization.

These early studies suggested that mature AIF consists of residues 102–612 (Δ1–101), resides in the intermembrane space (IMS) of normal mitochondria and, upon an apoptotic stimulus, translocates to the nucleus and triggers chromatin condensation and large scale DNA fragmentation by cooperating with other proteins such as endonuclease G and cyclophilin A (CypA) (1Susin S.A.

To date, functional and structural studies have been carried out mainly on the Δ1–120 and shorter forms of recombinant AIF, which were purified from bacteria as apoproteins and refolded to incorporate FAD (1Susin S.A.

Based on the redox properties and structural similarity to the disulfide reductase family of enzymes, AIF was proposed to function as a superoxide-generating NADH oxidase (9Miramar M.D. Costantini P.

Finally, a recent observation that mitochondria in AIF-deficient neurons were fragmented, with aberrant cristae, led to a suggestion that AIF participates in maintaining mitochondrial structure (19Cheung E.C.

Despite the fact that there is a strong indication that AIF is linked to free radical homeostasis and oxidative stress, the mechanism and precise role of AIF in mitochondria remain elusive. One problem in elucidating the physiological function of AIF is that only truncated and refolded forms of the recombinant protein have been investigated (9Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L.

In this study, molecular and redox properties of naturally folded mature and apoptogenic AIF have been characterized and compared. Both flavoproteins were found to slowly react with NAD(P)H forming dimeric, air-stable FADH2-NAD(P) charge-transfer complexes (CTCs) with notable differences in the kinetics of NAD(P)H dissociation and CTC decay imposed by dissimilarities in the length of the N terminus. The redox-linked monomer-dimer transition, similarly occurring in the mitochondrial protein, was accompanied by a conformational change that involved a unique 509–559 insertion, a potential protein-protein interaction site, and affected susceptibility of AIF to proteases and AIF-DNA interaction, critical for initiation of the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway. Our results challenge previous concepts and suggest that AIF is a redox-signaling molecule whose normal and apoptogenic functions are controlled by NAD(P)H. Protein Expression and Purification—The cDNA of mouse AIF (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Clone 2225457) was used as a template to clone the Δ1–53 and Δ1–101 forms of the protein into a pKK233–3 vector with a cleavable C-terminal 6-histidine affinity tag. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified as described in the supplemental materials. Due to problems with expression of AIFΔ1–53 H453L, the mutation was introduced into a shorter Δ1–77 construct, and the resulting protein was expressed in the JM109 strain of E. coli. Wild-type (WT) AIFΔ1–77 was used for comparative analysis. Spectral Measurements—Kinetics of AIF reduction with NAD(P)H was monitored under anaerobic conditions at 452 nm and 25 °C using a SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, UK). Anaerobic samples were prepared as described previously (22Sevrioukova I.F. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Redox potentials of AIF were determined spectrophotometrically in xanthine saturated 100 mm phosphate, pH 7.0–9.0, containing 2 μm benzyl viologen (-359 mV) and catalytic amounts of xanthine oxidase (23Massey V. Curti B. Zanetti G. Ronchi S. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gtuyter, Como, Italy1991: 581-584Google Scholar). The dissociation rate constant for the AIF·NADH complex and redox activities of AIF were measured as described in the supplemental materials. To compare stability of the NAD(P)H-bound forms, AIF was sealed in an anaerobic cuvette, reduced with subequimolar NAD(P)H, and purged with pure oxygen to initiate flavin oxidation that was monitored at 452 nm and 25 °C. CD spectra of 2.5–5 μm AIF in the absence and presence of a 20-fold excess of NAD(P)(H) were recorded in 12 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette and a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Determination of the Molecular Size of AIF—The molecular size of recombinant AIF was determined by gel filtration on Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0. 5–10 nmol of AIF in the presence or absence of a 20-fold excess of NAD(P)(H) was used per injection. The molecular size of mitochondrial AIF was estimated using a combination of two-dimensional blue native (BN) and SDS-PAGE (24Wittig I. Braun H-P. Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting. Mice liver mitochondria (10 mg/ml) untreated or treated with 5 mm NAD(H) for 15 min at 25 °C, were incubated with digitonin (3 mg/mg of protein) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 53,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant fraction was subjected to 3–13% BN-PAGE followed by two-dimensional 5–15% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with an anti-AIF antibody raised against the 517–531 peptide (1:1000, Chemicon) and a secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:3000, Bio-Rad). Proteolytic Digests—10 μm AIF in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2 was incubated with trypsin (0.06 mg/ml, Sigma) or human calpain I (5 units/ml, Calbiochem) at 37 °C in the absence and presence of 2 mm NAD(P)(H). Proteolytic sites were identified by the N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the digestion products. AIF Release from Mitochondria—Mice liver mitochondria were isolated by standard differential centrifugation. Protein concentrations were measured by the Pierce BCA method. AIF release was induced as described previously (6Polster B.M. Basanez G. Etxebarria A. Hardwick J.M. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, 400 μg of mitochondria was incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the respiration medium (125 mm KCl, 2 mm K2HPO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 1 mm ADP, 1 μm ruthenium red) containing either 5 mm malate/glutamate or 5 mm succinate and 2 μm rotenone with or without 0.5–5 mm NAD(P)(H) and 100 μm calpeptin (Calbiochem), then placed for 60 min at 30 °C untreated or treated with a mixture of calpain (5 units/ml), 200 μm CaCl2, and either 200 nm calpain-activated Bid (cBid, Calbiochem) or 5 mm atractyloside (Atr, Calbiochem), then centrifuged for 30 min at 13,400 × g to collect supernatants. Released proteins were separated on 4–15% SDS gels, and AIF was detected by Western blotting as described above. AIF-DNA Interaction—Interaction of AIFΔ1–101 with linearized double-stranded DNA was examined using gel-retardation assays (25Vahsen N. Cande C. Dupaigne P. Giordanetto F. Kroemer R.T. Herker E. Scholz S. Modjtahedi N. Madeo F. Le Cam E. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2005; 25: 1763-1774Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 1–100 μg of AIF was incubated with a 100-bp DNA ladder (180–250 ng, New England Biolabs or Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, in the absence and presence of 2 mm NAD(P)(H) and equimolar amounts of recombinant human CypA (Calbiochem) or heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and electrophoresed in 50 mm Tris acetate on 1.2–2% agarose gel containing 0.6 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The ability of AIFΔ1–101 to degrade DNA was examined as described by Cande et al. (4Cande C. Vahsen N. Kouranti I. Schmitt E. Daugas E. Spahr C. Luban J. Kroemer R.T. Giordanetto F. Garrido C. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1514-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). 20 nm AIF was incubated with 200 ng of a pNEB plasmid (2.7 kb, New England Biolabs) with or without 20 nm CypA for 1–4 h at 37 °C. The resulting mixtures were resolved on 1.2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. The N-terminal Affinity Tag Affects AIF Folding—Folding of flavoenzymes is critical for their function, because it defines protein-flavin interactions and redox properties of the cofactor. Previously, AIF was cloned with a thioredoxin- or poly-histidine affinity tag attached to the N terminus, close to the FAD binding site, and was expressed and purified as an apoprotein that had to be refolded to incorporate FAD (1Susin S.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a structural homologue of AIF, we learned that the affinity tag must be placed at the C terminus and removed at the end of purification to allow in vivo FAD incorporation and to preserve redox properties of the flavoprotein. When cloned this way, both mature (Δ1–53) and apoptotic (Δ1–101) forms of mouse AIF were expressed in E. coli as soluble, FAD-bound proteins (supplemental Fig. 1S), redox properties of which differed significantly from those of refolded AIFΔ1–120 (9Miramar M.D. Costantini P.

AIF Produces Air-stable FADH2-NAD(P) Charge-transfer Complexes upon Reduction with NAD(P)H—The first difference between the proteins was that the midpoint redox potential of our AIF was 50–56 mV lower (Table 1) and poised 16–22 mV below that of the NAD/NADH couple (Em,7 =-320 mV). The manner of interaction with reduced pyridine nucleotides (PNs) was another striking dissimilarity. Refolded AIFΔ1–120 was reported to react with equimolar amounts of NAD(P)H without formation of an FADH2-NAD(P) CTC (9Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M. Haouzi D. Brothers G.

In flavoproteins, CTCs are produced as a result of π-π charge-transfer interactions between the parallel-stacked isoalloxazine ring of the reduced flavin (donor) and the nicotinamide ring of NAD(P) (acceptor) and absorb in the long wavelength region, where position of the absorption maximum reflects affinity of the complex: the greater the interaction between the reacting molecules, the longer the wavelength of the CTC absorption band (26Sakurai T. Hosoya H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 459-468Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). During reduction of refolded AIF, the 600–800 nm band was observed only when NAD(P)H was present in excess, and its absorption maximum depended on the AIF:PN ratio (9Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M. Haouzi D. Brothers G. Penninger J.M. Peleato M.L. Kroemer G. Susin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16391-16398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In contrast, high affinity CTC (λmax = 770 nm) was stoichiometrically formed upon addition of NAD(P)H to our flavoprotein (Fig. 1, A and B). 1 mol of NADH per mol of AIF was needed to completely reduce the flavin, indicative of very tight cofactor binding. Reaction with NADPH proceeded considerably slower within several hours (versus tens of minutes for NADH), and a 2-fold excess of the reductant was required to reach equilibrium and to fully reduce FAD. Similar to the refolded protein, our AIF did not stabilize FAD semiquinone intermediates. No changes in the AIF absorbance spectrum were detected in the presence of NAD or NADP.TABLE 1Properties of recombinant AIFΔ1–53Δ1–101Δ1–77 H453LAbsorption maxima (nm)273, 380, 452, 476273, 381, 452, 477273, 380, 450, 475ϵ452 nm (mm–1 cm–1)13.5 ± 0.313.2 ± 0.313.4 ± 0.2 (13.4 ± 0.3)aValues in parentheses are for WT AIFΔ1–77Em,7 (mV)–342 ± 3–336 ± 5–285 ± 5 (–341 ± 5)ΔEm/ΔpH (mV/pH unit)262626 (26)kcatNADH (s–1)0.20.30.6 (0.2)KmNADH (mm)0.60.50.6 (0.6)kcatNADH/KmNADH0.30.61.0 (0.3)kNADH (m–1 s–1)1.7 × 1022.3 × 102(1.9 × 102)bDependence of kobs for the reaction of AIFΔ1–77 H453L reduction with NADH on AIF concentration is hyperbolic with klim of 0.6 s–1kcatNADPH (s–1)1.0 × 10–21.7 × 10–20.6 (1.2 × 10–2)KmNADPH (mm)3.72.54.3 (3.5)kcatNADPH/KmNADPH2.7 × 10–36.8 × 10–31.4 × 10–1 (3.4 × 10–3)a Values in parentheses are for WT AIFΔ1–77b Dependence of kobs for the reaction of AIFΔ1–77 H453L reduction with NADH on AIF concentration is hyperbolic with klim of 0.6 s–1 Open table in a new tab Kinetic measurements showed that AIF had a 100-fold higher preference for NADH over NADPH (Table 1) but reacted with either cofactor orders of magnitude slower than other PN-dependent flavoenzymes. Having determined the second order rate constant for the AIF·NADH complex formation (kon, 1.7 × 102 m-1s-1) and the rate constant for NADH dissociation (koff, 2.8 ± 0.5 × 10-5 s-1, supplemental Fig. 2S) we estimated that Kd for NADH was very low, 150 ± 10 nm. Another remarkable feature of AIF was resistance of its NAD(P)H-bound forms to oxidation. Normally, it takes 2 days for air oxygen to fully oxidize FAD in CTC at ambient temperatures producing spectral changes opposite to those observed during the reduction step (not shown). To speed up the oxidation process, we measured kinetics of CTC decay under pure oxygen atmosphere. This reaction was multiphasic and accelerated with time (Fig. 1, C and D) most likely due to formation of multiple redox intermediates. Importantly, complexes with NADPH had a shorter lifetime than those with NADH, wherein AIFΔ1–53 was oxidized 2-fold slower than the corresponding redox forms of AIFΔ1–101. This was the first indication that the extended N terminus assists CTC formation/stabilization. AIF Possesses Low Electron Transferring Ability—Kinetic parameters, such as low NADH binding rates, high Km and low Kd for the cofactor, as well as the low redox potential of the flavin and high stability of the NADH-bound form, suggest that AIF cannot effectively transfer reducing equivalents from NADH to other molecules. Indeed, AIF catalyzed reduction of one- and two-electron acceptors with turnover numbers several orders of magnitude lower than those of traditional electron transferring flavoenzymes (Table 2). Notably, the 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) and cytochrome c reduction rates did not depend on whether catalase or superoxide dismutase was present in the reaction mixture, meaning that electrons to the acceptors came directly from AIF. The rate of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction, on the other hand, was decreased by ∼30% in the presence of superoxide dismutase and thus was partially mediated by superoxide anion, which is quite typical for oxidoreductases. Owing to high stability of CTC with NADH, the NADH oxidase activity of AIFΔ1–53 was virtually undetectable, and that of AIFΔ1–101 was very weak (<0.2 min-1). This is in contrast to refolded AIFΔ1–120 that was shown to oxidize NAD(P)H considerably faster and catalyze NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of cytochrome c and NBT exclusively via superoxide anion radicals (9Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M. Haouzi D. Brothers G. Penninger J.M. Peleato M.L. Kroemer G. Susin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16391-16398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Finally, neither form of our flavoprotein could transfer electrons from NADH to superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, ascorbate free radical, or dehydroascorbate, which suggests that AIF is not an antioxidant.TABLE 2NADH-dependent redox activities of AIFKmNADHKmsubstratekcatkcat/KmNADHmmmin–1AIFΔ1–53 DCIP2.0 ± 0.2-aDependence of kobs on DCIP concentration was not hyperbolic42 ± 421 NBT1.2 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.253 ± 544 Cytochrome c1.0 ± 0.10.15 ± 0.0246 ± 546AIFΔ1–101 DCIP1.4 ± 0.1-48 ± 634 NBT0.5 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.261 ± 5122 Cytochrome c1.3 ± 0.20.18 ± 0.0230 ± 323AIFΔ1–77 H453L DCIP1.3 ± 0.1 (1.7 ± 0.1)bParameters in the parentheses are for WT AIFΔ1–77-248 ± 20 (32 ± 3)191 (19) NBT0.6 ± 0.1cNBT reduction by the mutant was inhibited at NADH concentrations higher than 1.5 mm (1.3 ± 0.2)2.5 ± 0.3 (1.3 ± 0.1)167 ± 7 (52 ± 4)278 (40) Cytochrome cNBT reduction by the mutant was inhibited at NADH concentrations higher than 1.5 mm0.3 ± 0.03 (0.8 ± 0.1)0.06 ± 0.01 (0.12 ± 0.01)63 ± 1 (50 ± 3)217 (63) K3Fe(CN)6dFerricyanide reductase and NADH oxidase activities of AIFΔ1–53, Δ1–77, and Δ1–101 were negligible0.4 ± 0.10.13 ± 0.01111 ± 10278 NADH oxidationdFerricyanide reductase and NADH oxidase activities of AIFΔ1–53, Δ1–77, and Δ1–101 were negligible0.14 ± 0.012.5 ± 0.218a Dependence of kobs on DCIP concentration was not hyperbolicb Parameters in the parentheses are for WT AIFΔ1–77c NBT reduction by the mutant was inhibited at NADH concentrations higher than 1.5 mmd Ferricyanide reductase and NADH oxidase activities of AIFΔ1–53, Δ1–77, and Δ1–101 were negligible Open table in a new tab AIF Undergoes Dimerization and a Conformational Change upon NAD(P)H Binding—Redox properties of AIF suggest that either the flavoprotein has evolved as a low turnover electron transferase or plays another role in mitochondria where formation of stable CTC is functionally important. To test the latter possibility, we analyzed how PN binding affects molecular properties of AIF. Gel-filtration experiments showed that oxidized AIFΔ1–101 and Δ1–53 existed in solution as monomers (Fig. 2A). NAD(P) had no effect on the elution profile (not shown), but reduction with NAD(P)H caused a 2-fold increase in the molecular size of both proteins (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, AIF dimerization may be one of the factors stabilizing the FADH2·NAD(P) complex. A small monomeric peak seen in the elution profiles of the NADPH-reduced proteins (Fig. 2C) reflects partial dissociation of the lower affinity ligand, wherein the larger amount of monomers produced by the NADPH-bound apoptotic form (10 versus 5% in mature AIF) was another sign that the N-terminal peptide is recruited in CTC formation/stabilization. We analyzed also how PN cofactors affect the secondary structure of AIF. Far UV CD spectra of ligand-free AIFΔ1–53 and Δ1–101 were highly similar but not identical (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting that the N terminus of mature AIF may adopt an ordered conformation in solution. Only subtle changes in the CD spectra of both proteins were detected in the presence of oxidized cofactors. In contrast, complex formation with NAD(P)H caused significant perturbations in the 190–250 nm region. Computer analysis of the spectroscopic data identified a common trend in the NAD(P)H-induced structural changes in AIF, such as an increase in the β-strand and turn content and a decrease in the relative percentage of random coil (supplemental Fig. 3S). Redox-linked Conformational Changes in the N-terminal and 509–559 Peptides—Given that proteolytic processing of the AIF N terminus is a critical event leading to caspase-independent apoptosis, we examined how PN cofactors affect susceptibility of the mature recombinant flavoprotein to specific and nonspecific proteases, calpain I and trypsin, respectively. According to the N-terminal amino sequencing, calpain attacks oxidized AIFΔ1–53 at two sites, Gly102-Leu103 and Glu118-Gly119, producing 55 and 53-kDa fragments regardless of whether or not NAD(P) was present, and only at Gly102-Leu103 when AIF was reduced with NAD(P)H (Fig. 2F). Inability of calpain to access the Glu118-Gly119 site in the AIF·NAD(P)H complex was the third indication that the N-terminal peptide, previously designated as a linker connecting t"

EAAC1 (human nomenclature EAAT3) is an isoform of the plasma membrane glutamate transporter family localized to glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal populations and is an important physiological component of normal and abnormal synaptic transmission (2Diamond J.S.

The expression of GTRAP3-18 has been found to be induced by diverse stimuli including oncogenic transformation and ER Ca2+ depletion. Chronic morphine administration leads to a 300–400% increase in GTRAP3-18 mRNA (6Ikemoto M.J. Inoue K. Akiduki S. Osugi T. Imamura T. Ishida N. Ohtomi M.

These findings have been confirmed by microarray studies demonstrating increased expression of GTRAP3-18 mRNA under conditions of cell stress, inflammation, and cancer (GeoID 5194496). Molecular modeling and reported data concur that GTRAP3-18 is an integral ER membrane protein (9Abdul-Ghani M. Gougeon P.-Y. Prosser D.C. Da-Silva L.F. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol.

GTRAP3-18 and JM4, its closest relative (39% identity 61% consensus; GeneID 11230), are structurally homologous to the Ras superfamily in their secondary structure and low molecular weight, but lack a GTP-binding consensus motif. They are conserved in human, rat, and mouse and have a homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans (D2096.2). Phylogenic tree analysis of these conserved gene products was used to suggest reclassification as members of the expanded mammalian Yip 6 family: GTRAP3-18/JWA as Yip6b and JM4 as Yip6a, despite an undetermined cellular function (10Pfeffer S. Aivazian D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The Yip family is loosely defined as integral membrane Ypt-interacting proteins, which often self-associate (11Calero M. Collins R.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ypt proteins are yeast Rab GTPases (10Pfeffer S. Aivazian D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

One of the many functions assigned to Rab proteins is to regulate membrane trafficking spatially and temporally (13Collins R.N. Mol. Membr.

The sequences were: E1 (462–542), E2(462–574), E3(429–525), E4(486–565). The EAAC1 C terminus was further truncated into three regions: an extracellular loop (L, amino acids 431–443) that comprises part of both the glutamate binding and ER trafficking domains (19Kalandadze A.

Dual transformed yeast was selected for growth on histidine drop-out media and for β-galactosidase expression in the auxotrophic yeast strains MaV203 and AH109. Detailed results of these assays may be obtained by contacting the authors. Mammalian Cell Transfection—HEK293 and COS-7 cell lines were maintained according to standard protocols (ATCC), split 1 day before transfection and used at 50% confluency. All mammalian cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were harvested at 16–72 h growth according to the experimental design. Immunohistochemistry—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed, solubilized in 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C, and rinsed in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Primary (Roche Applied Science) antibodies were added at final concentrations ranging from 1:200 to 1:2000. Secondary antibodies Cy2 and Cy5 anti-mouse or anti-rabbit and Cy3 anti-chicken IgY (Jackson Antibodies) were chosen by experiment. Confocal microscopy of transfected cells in brain sections, hippocampal slice, disassociated cultures, and mammalian cells was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope. Na+-dependent Glutamate Uptake Assay—The activity and kinetics of expressed EAAT was assayed as described (1Lin C.I. Orlov I. Ruggiero A.M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lee A. Jackson M. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis performed using Student's t test and two-way ANOVA. Membrane Impermeant Biotinylation—Biotinylation was performed as described with some modifications (1Lin C.I. Orlov I. Ruggiero A.M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lee A. Jackson M. Rothstein J.D.

Enzymatic Deglycosylation—Endo H and PNGase were purchased from NEB. Cell lysates following biotinylation were digested at 37 °C for 12 h with gentle shaking with 2 units/μl of each enzyme in lysis buffer with the addition of 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent. Lysis buffer consisted of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Control samples were diluted and incubated without the addition of enzyme. The biotinylation assay was then completed as described above, or the samples were diluted in 2× loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of rEAAT3 at Asn-85, -128, -178, and -197 to Gln was performed using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as directed by the manufacturer. Mutagenesis of Pro-118 to Gly was performed in the same manner. Clones were verified by sequence analysis. Metabolic Labeling—Metabolic labeling of HEK293T cells was performed as described (24Melikian H.E. Ramamoorthy S. Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 266-276PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with Myc-rEAAC1 and HA-GTRAP3-18 at a 1:2 or a 1:1 ratio and pulsed with Trans-Label (ICN) at 3.5 h post-transfection for 10 min followed by media chase for up to 16 h. Harvested cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with c-Myc as described. Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and 35S emission on film. FRET Analysis—Two methods were used to detect FRET: donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching (DRAP (27Yang W. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 31: 31Google Scholar); and the three-filter method according to Youvan (19Kalandadze A. Wu Y. Fournier K. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5183-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), (28Dowd L.A. Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The equipment used consisted of an epi-fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss TM210, Germany) COS7 cells (3 × 105/well); images were taken using a ×63 oil objective and a LUDL filter wheel that allows for rapid exchange of filters (less than 100 ms). The system was equipped with the following fluorescence filters: CFP filter (ICFP; exc.: 436 nm, dichr.: 455 nm, em.: 480 nm), YFP filter (IYFP; exc.: 500 nm, dichr.: 515 nm, em.: 535 nm), and FRET filter (IFRET: excitation = 436 nm, dichroic mirror = 455 nm, emission = 535 nm). The acquisition of the images was performed with MetaMorph software (Meta Imaging, Universal Imaging Corporation, V. 4.6.). HEK293 cells were seeded on to poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (24-mm diameter). The next day, cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method: 1–3 μg of cDNA was mixed with CaCl2 and HBS buffer (280 mm NaCl/10 mm KCl/1, 5 mm Na2HPO4/12 mm dextrose/50 mm HEPES); after 6–10 min, the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate was added to the cells. After 4–5 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and briefly treated with glycerol, followed by the addition of fetal calf serum-containing medium. Media were replaced by Krebs-HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2). For DRAP, a CFP image was acquired before (Ib) and after (Ia) photobleaching using the YFP filter settings for 90 s. DRAP in a specific region of interest (intracellular parts that mostly show red to white color in the representative image) was quantified by FRET efficiency (E) as described in (24Melikian H.E. Ramamoorthy S. Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 266-276PubMed Google Scholar) according to Equation 1. E=(Ia-Ib)/Ia(Eq. 1) Images for the three-filter method were taken using a double dichroic mirror for all measurements. Various combinations of excitation and emission filters were used to produce the CFP, YFP, and FRET images (ICFP, IYFP, and IFRET, respectively). Background fluorescence was subtracted from all images; net FRET (nF) was calculated using Equation 2, nF=IFRET-(α×IYFP)-(β×ICFP)(Eq. 2) where α and β represent the bleed-through values for YFP (0.319 ± 0.001; n = 15) and for CFP (0.656 ± 0.006; n = 14). To gauge the system both with positive and negative controls for FRET imaging, we used a fusion protein of CFP and YFP (termed CYFP; Ref. 25Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and the CFP-tagged deletion mutant of the rat GABA transporter 1, CFP-rGAT1Δ37, lacking the last 37 amino acids, respectively. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test and two-way ANOVA for all n. All experiments were performed with a minimum n = 3 replicates. GTRAP3-18 Prevents Complex Oligosaccharide Formation on EAAC1 in a Dose-dependent Manner—EAAC1 and all members of the EAAT/ASCT gene family are N-linked (asparagine) glycosylated (26Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-linked oligosaccharides are processed to the complex state by resident Golgi enzymes preceding cell surface delivery (27Yang W. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 31: 31Google Scholar). Therefore, the state of the oligosaccharide may be used as an indicator of the extent of ER-Golgi trafficking and plasma membrane localization (27Yang W. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 31: 31Google Scholar). EAAC1 expressed in mixed cortical cultures (Fig. 1A, lane 1) was separated into intracellular (lane 2) and plasma membrane (lane 3) pools using membrane-impermeant biotinylation (n = 3). EAAC1 predominantly resides in intracellular compartments (lane 2) (28Dowd L.A. Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cell surface population of EAAC1 (lane 3) is enriched for complex oligosaccharide EAAC1 (70 kDa) (27Yang W. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 31: 31Google Scholar). EAAC1 protein forms a homotrimeric complex that is not completely disrupted by SDS-PAGE analysis (29Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The visualization of these dimeric and trimeric protein bands in Western analysis are typical of all molecular subtypes of plasma membrane glutamate transporters (14Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). We verified the assigned glycosylation state of EAAC1 protein using endoglycosidase treatment. The cortical culture cell lysates were exposed to the following treatments: no endoglycosidase (Fig. 1B, lane 1), Endo H (lane 2), or PNGase F (lane 3) (n = 3). Endo H selectively digests high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides. High mannose oligosaccharides are processed by enzymes resident in the Golgi; therefore, the presence of a high mannose oligosaccharide indicates that the protein has not left the ER membrane following translation. The endoglycosidase PNGase F, cleaves all N-linked oligosaccharides. The processed state of the oligosaccharide is noted by arrows; complex state (70 kDa) EAAC1 is Endo H-insensitive (black arrow), but the high mannose EAAC1 (60 kDa) is reduced by Endo H (lane 2, gray arrow). All oligosaccharides are cleaved by PNGase F, resulting in immunoreactive band collapse to 50 kDa (lane 3). We utilize endoglycosidase digest analysis in subsequent figures. The expression of GTRAP3-18 is inducible and is maintained at very low levels in native tissue (1Lin C.I. Orlov I. Ruggiero A.M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lee A. Jackson M. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1C, lysates of HEK 293T cells and adult mouse brain (20 μg per lane) are compared with that of HEK-293T cells transfected with GTRAP3-18 cDNA. The expression level of transfected GTRAP3-18 is comparable to that found in brain tissue lysate (Fig. 1C, lanes 2–3). The endogenous level of GTRAP3-18 is difficult to detect in mammalian cell lines (Fig. 1C, lane 1). We are unable to detect endogenous expression of GTRAP3-18 in multiple cell lines by Western blot analysis using 60 μg of cell lysate (data not shown). Mouse GTRAP3-18 is 97.9% identical to rat GTRAP3-18. The peptide sequence used to generate the antibody corresponds to a fully conserved region. However at the low molecular weight this subtle difference creates a band shift on Western blot analysis. We have found GTRAP3-18 expression to be potent and dose-dependent at this level of transfected expression (see Fig. 1G). The analysis of GTRAP3-18 presented here was performed using transfected GTRAP3-18 cDNA in mammalian cell lines at levels of expression that mimic the expression found in adult brain tissue from mouse or rat. We generated epitope-tagged cDNA constructs of GTRAP3-18 and EAAC1 to facilitate our analysis of the protein interaction. The addition of these small N-terminal epitope tags did not interfere with the expression, trafficking, or activity of the proteins (data not shown). In our initial characterization of GTRAP3-18 the mechanism by which GTRAP3-18-mediated decrease in EAAC1 cell surface activity was not described (1Lin C.I. Orlov I. Ruggiero A.M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lee A. Jackson M. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase digestion reveals that the processing of EAAC1 oligosaccharide chains is reduced following GTRAP3-18 co-expression (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1–3 with 4–6)(n = 6). The EAAC1 cell lysate (lane 1) is only partially sensitive to Endo H (lane 2). The EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18 co-transfected cell lysate (lane 4) has an increased sensitivity to Endo H digestion (lane 5). GTRAP3-18 expression leads to enrichment of the high mannose EAAC1 and a reduction in complex oligosaccharide EAAC1 populations (see arrows). Alterations in oligosaccharide processing that reduce the complex oligosaccharide form of EAAC1 correspond with a decrease in cell surface expression. Both oligosaccharide species of EAAC1 are evident in the whole cell lysate (Fig. 1E, lanes 1–3, see arrows)(n = 8), but it is the complex oligosaccharide form of EAAC1 that is associated with plasma membrane localization (lane 3). Following GTRAP3-18 co-transfection the amount of high mannose oligosaccharide EAAC1 is increased and there is a decrease in the amount of complex oligosaccharide EAAC1 in the lysate (Fig. 1E, lanes 3–6; see arrows) leading to a decrease in cell surface expression (lane 6). This newly recognized physiological effect of GTRAP3-18 on the oligosaccharide maturation of EAAC1 suggests that GTRAP3-18 is involved in the trafficking of EAAC1 and that GTRAP3-18 is functioning in the ER. The reduction of ER-Golgi trafficking of EAAC1 is associated with a concomitant reduction in plasma membrane Na+-dependent glutamate uptake activity of EAAC1 following co-transfection with GTRAP3-18 (Fig. 1F, p < 0.001) as previously described (1Lin C.I. Orlov I. Ruggiero A.M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lee A. Jackson M. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our initial characterization of GTRAP3-18 found its activity on EAAC1 to be dose-dependent (1Lin C.I. Orlov I. Ruggiero A.M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lee A. Jackson M. Rothstein J.D.

This dose dependence correlates with the physiological effect of GTRAP3-18 to prevent ER to Golgi trafficking of greater percentages of the EAAC1 protein, thereby limiting cell surface expression (Fig. 1G). As the GTRAP3-18 co-transfection is increased 2-fold (lanes 4–6 and 7–9), the level of complex oligosaccharide cell surface-expressed EAAC1 is decreased (lanes 3, 6, and 9). JM4, the GTRAP3-18 homologue, has similar capabilities in regulating EAAC1 trafficking (lanes 10–12) and is also localized to the ER (data not shown). GTRAP3-18 Activity Requires Four α-Helical Transmembrane Domains and Homo-oligomerization—The α-helical domains of GTRAP3-18 self-associate and GTRAP3-18 activity may be reconstituted by this association. We generated multiple truncations of GTRAP3-18 to determine domains important for activity (truncations diagrammed in supplemental Fig. S1). GTRAP3-18 protein has four transmembrane domains and cytosolic termini. The symmetrical GTRAP3-18 truncations, N-2TMD (transmembrane domains) (amino acids 1–93), and C-2TMD (amino acids 94–188), each have one cytosolic tail and two α-helical transmembrane domains. Following co-transfection (Fig. 2A), these truncated proteins are unable to alter the extent of plasma membrane expression of EAAC1 (lanes 6 and 8) or the ratio of high mannose to complex EAAC1 oligosaccharide (see arrows)(n = 5). They are also unable to reduce the Na+-dependent glutamate uptake activity of EAAC1 (data not shown). However, these truncated GTRAP3-18 proteins retain ER localization (data not shown). The trafficking activity of the N-2TMD and C-2TMD is reconstituted by co-transfection of both fragments (lanes 9–10). This reconstitution of GTRAP3-18 activity in the ER suggests that the α-helical transmembrane domains of GTRAP3-18 self-oligomerize in the ER membrane and that oligomerization is required for the prevention of ER to Golgi trafficking. The self-oligomerization of α-helical domains has been proposed as a means to enhance activity and selectivity for the Yip family, the GTRAP3-18 protein family in yeast, and has been demonstrated for PRA1/Yip3 (10Pfeffer S. Aivazian D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 30Sivars U. Aivazian D. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 2003; 425: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). EAAC1 expression (lanes 1–2) and EAAC1 co-transfected with full-length GTRAP3-18 (lanes 3–4) is shown for comparison and demonstrates the loss of complex oligosaccharide and membrane expression. The expression of GTRAP3-18 truncations is shown by anti-HA Western analysis and equal protein loading is verified by Western analysis of the transferrin receptor (TFR). We conducted two complementary FRET microscopy methods to address the homo-association properties of GTRAP3-18: donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching (DRAP) FRET microscopy and the three filter method. DRAP FRET relies on the premise that the donor fluorescence increases after complete photobleaching of the acceptor; this occurs only when energy transfer from a donor to acceptor fluorophore occurs. In Fig. 2B, significant GTRAP3-18 self-association in the ER is measured by DRAP FRET analysis of CFP- and YFP-tagged forms GTRAP3-18 (25Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A.

We transfected HEK293 cells with the following control plasmids to gauge our system, cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged mutant form of the GABA transporter 1 (GATΔ37) that strictly resides in the ER as negative control, and a concatemeric form of CFP and YFP termed CYFP (25Schmid J.A.

A summary of 6 experimental days with 6–10 values each (Fig. 2C, shown as means ± S.E.) are shown and the DRAP-FRET efficiency (E) was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When we co-transfected the CFP- and YFP-tagged forms of EAAC1, the value was indicative of homo-oligomerization between these subunits, in agreement with the observations by Gouaux' group (29Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained upon application of the three filter method (data not shown). Are α-helical domains of GTRAP3-18 solely mediating activity? What is the relative contribution of the cytosolic N- and C-terminal sequence of GTRAP3-18? Deletion of either or both of the GTRAP3-18 cytosolic tails created the following truncated proteins: N- and TMD (amino acids 1–142), C- and TMD"
https://openalex.org/W2074345274,"Tropomyosin (Tm) is an α-helical coiled-coil that controls muscle contraction by sterically regulating the myosin-actin interaction. Tm moves between three states on F-actin as either a uniform or a non-uniform semi-flexible rod. Tm is stabilized by hydrophobic residues in the “a” and “d” positions of the heptad repeat. The highly conserved Asp-137 is unusual in that it introduces a negative charge on each chain in a position typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. The occurrence of two charged residues in the hydrophobic region is expected to destabilize the region and impart flexibility. To determine whether this region is unstable, we have substituted hydrophobic Leu for Asp-137 and studied changes in Tm susceptibility to limited proteolysis by trypsin and changes in regulation. We found that native and Tm controls that contain Asp-137 were readily cleaved at Arg-133 with t½ of 5 min. In contrast, the Leu-137 mutant was not cleaved under the same conditions. Actin stabilized Tm, causing a 10-fold reduction in the rate of cleavage at Arg-133. The actin-myosin subfragment S1 ATPase activity was greater for the Leu mutant compared with controls in the absence of troponin and in the presence of troponin and Ca2+. We conclude that the highly conserved Asp-137 destabilizes the middle of Tm, resulting in a more flexible region that is important for the cooperative activation of the thin filament by myosin. We thus have shown a link between the dynamic properties of Tm and its function.

In skeletal and cardiac muscle, Tm controls contraction by regulating the binding of myosin to actin in conjunction with troponin (Tn) and Ca2+ (1Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Tm is also involved in the myosin-induced cooperative activation of the thin filament (2Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle, Tm is involved in the cooperative activation of contraction by phosphorylated myosin (3Smiley L.B. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego1966: 63-75Google Scholar). Non-muscle Tm stabilizes actin filaments and modulates the binding of other proteins (4Lees-Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Equilibria between three thin filament states, B (blocked), C (closed or Ca2+-induced), O or M (open or myosin-induced), are involved in the regulation of muscle contraction (5McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to Tn facilitates the initial binding of myosin heads in the first step. In the second step, myosin heads cooperatively facilitate the movement of Tm into the O-state to allow isomerization of the heads and the generation of force. There are several single site Tm mutations that are involved in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (6Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Harada K. Potter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 263: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Tardiff J.C. Heart Fail. Rev. 2005; 10: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Bottinelli R. Coviello D.A.

Med. 2000; 78: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that increase the Ca2+ sensitivity, indicating a shift into the B-state. However, the link between these mutations and the functional changes associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is unknown.Coiled-coils are primarily stabilized by inter-helical hydrophobic interactions in positions a and d in the 7-residue pseudo repeat, a-to-g. Residues at a- and d-positions consist mainly of Leu, Ala, Leu, Val, Tyr, and Met. At position 137 in both α- and β-Tm there is an Asp in a d-position instead of the typical hydrophobic residue. The remaining 24 Asp residues in Tm are outside of the hydrophobic ridge. Asp-137 is conserved in all skeletal and smooth muscle Tms and Tm from Drosophila to humans. Also, for non-muscle Tms, there is an Asp in an equivalent d-position. Asp residues with a short negatively charged side chain located at equivalent d-positions on both chains would be expected to destabilize the coiled-coil due to electrostatic repulsion. To determine the role of Asp-137 in a hydrophobic position, we substituted a Leu for the Asp in recombinant chicken skeletal α-Tm. In a preliminary study we determined that the Leu substitution increased the local and global thermal stability (11Sumida J.P. Hayes D. Langsetmo K. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 2006; 90Google Scholar). Here we report that tryptic cleavage occurs rapidly at Arg-133 for the native protein and that Leu substitution for Asp-137 markedly inhibits this process, indicating a local instability in native Tm in this region. F-actin inhibits the rate of Tm cleavage 10-fold, but proteolysis occurs in the same place, Arg-133. Although Asp-137 locally destabilizes the coiled-coil, it does not affect the binding to actin. However, the actin-myosin subfragment-1 (S1) ATPase activity is greater for the Leu mutant than for its control, C190A, in the absence of troponin and in the presence of troponin and Ca2+. This study provides evidence for the importance of structural flexibility due to a local unstable region that controls the function of Tm in its regulation of muscle activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation—All the Tms used in this work are recombinant Tms that have an Ala-Ser N-terminal extension, mimicking the N-terminal acetylation of native Tm (12Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate manipulation of the gene, a C190A Tm DNA construct corresponding to the TPM1 gene for chicken skeletal tropomyosin (Reinach laboratory, Ref. 12Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted between a BamH1 and Nde1 restriction site in a PAED4 plasmid vector. This vector was then used as a template for the D137L/C190A clone. Because both D137L/C190A and C190A lack the native cysteine at 190, complications due to potential disulfide cross-linking were avoided. The effects of the Leu substitution in D137L/C190A were controlled for by comparing its function with C190A and WT (Cys-190), which retains the native Cys at position 190. Point mutations for these controls and the D137L/C190A Tm were performed by modifying the C190A template using the QuikChange procedure (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequence analysis.BL21 Escherichia coli cells were transformed using the PAED4 plasmid. Bacterial colonies were grown on ampicillin plates, and individual colonies were selected and used to inoculate a starter culture, which was grown overnight. Plasmid DNA was isolated and purified (Qiagen Miniprep) from samples of the overnight culture. BamH1 and Nd11 restriction nucleases were used to excise the gene insert and visualized on an agarose gel to check the condition of the transformed plasmid. The overnight cultures were then used to inoculate 1 liter of Luria Bertani medium, and these preparations were then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the O.D. of the growth medium reached 0.6. Induction of the TPM1 gene expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the growth medium at various stages during the growth. Cells were grown for an additional 3 h after inoculation, at which time they were harvested by centrifuging the medium at 4000 rpm for 30 min, discarding the supernatant and placing the pelleted cells in a –80 °C freezer for overnight storage.Cells were lysed using freeze-thaw by adding 50 ml of lysis buffer, (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% sucrose) to the frozen pellet. Cellular debris was separated from the solution by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was placed into an 80 °C water bath and incubated for an additional 10 min after the appearance of a precipitate. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 40 min. The pH of the resulting solution was lowered to 4.6 to precipitate tropomyosin at its isoelectric point.The precipitate from the isoelectric precipitation was resuspended in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and was purified using a Hi Trap Q FPLC column (AKTA) using a linear salt gradient from 100 mm to 1 m NaCl. N-terminal sequence and mass spectral analysis were used to confirm the isolation of tropomyosin. The presence of any nucleotide contamination of the purified Tm solution was determined by UV-visible spectra.Initial characterization of the Leu mutant suggested that it did not bind well to actin. However, an intrinsic E. coli peptidase (13Kluwe L. Maeda K. Miegel A. Fujita-Becker S. Maeda Y. Talbo G. Houthaeve T. Kellner R. J. Muscle Res.

DNA was removed by ion exchange chromatography, (Hi Q column, ÁKTA FPLC). Further purification removed the variably truncated and cleaved impurities using a ceramic hydroxyapatite FPLC column (Bio-Rad) with a linear phosphate gradient in 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0.Tm, S1, and G-actin concentrations were determined using both Bradford assays and UV-visible spectroscopy, using ϵ276 nm = 1.68×104 m–1cm–1 for Tm and ϵ280 nm = 8.88×104 m–1cm–1 for S1. G-actin was prepared from rabbit acetone powder and purified by cycles of polymerization (16Lehrer S.S. Kerwar G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17Spudich J. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S1 was prepared by standard procedures (18Margossian S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The S1 and G-actin were stored at –80 °C after freezing in liquid N2 in the presence of sucrose. (Troponin was a gift from the laboratories of Drs. D. Szczesna-Cordray and J. Potter.) Denatured S1 was removed by co-sedimentation of a 1:2 mol ratio of S1 and F-actin in the presence of 5 mm ATP and recovering the supernatant.Physical characterization of S1, actin, Tn, and Tm was performed in a number of ways. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed to determine intact N-terminal sequence of all recombinant Tms and confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE. CD unfolding studies indicated that all recombinant Tms were folded properly. Tm to F-actin binding was confirmed by co-sedimentation and by titrations of actin-S1 ATPase with Tm (19Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).ATPase Measurements—ATPase measurements were done on a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrometer using the Enzcheck kit (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) that couples the release of Pi from ATP to an enzyme-substrate system producing a continuous change in absorbance at 360 nm (20Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). For Tm binding studies, inhibition of actin-S1 ATPase was monitored during additions of Tm (19Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Geeves M.A. Chai M. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9345-9350Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ dependence of actin-S1 ATPase for the mutants in the presence of troponin was performed using a 1 mm EGTA/NTA buffer system containing 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, pH 7.2; the effective ionic strength was calculated to be 80 or 100 mm for measurements performed in the absence and presence of Ca2+ + EGTA/NTA, respectively. Stock calibrated Ca2+ solutions were prepared and equilibrium constants (22Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. 1974; 1 (and Vol. 2, p. 283, Plenum, New York): 139-269Google Scholar) corrected to the experimental temperature (23Harrison S.M. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C1250-C1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ionic strength, and Maxchelator was used to calculate the free Ca2+ concentration. The pCa50 was determined by fitting the ATPase dependence on the Ca2+ concentration to the Hill equation using Kaleidegraph (Synergy Software). Errors were estimated from the standard deviation of replicate runs.Trypsin Digestion and Identification of Products—Tm in HEPES buffer (0.5 mg/ml in 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2) was treated with 0.002 mg/ml porcine trypsin (MSG; GE Biosciences) in a 30 °C water bath. At various times, aliquots were removed and mixed with 40× excess soybean trypsin inhibitor to quench the reaction. A control experiment was done to ensure that soybean trypsin inhibitor efficiently quenched the reaction. The samples were then prepared for SDS gel electrophoresis and mass spectral analyses. For Tm bound to actin, Tm at 0.3 mg/ml was reacted in the absence and presence of 1.5 mg/ml F-actin for increasing times in buffer. The trypsin-treated samples were diluted 1:10 with sinnapinic acid matrix and subjected to mass spectral analyses using a Perceptive Voyager MALDI-TOF.For N-terminal amino acid analyses, SDS-PAGE protein bands of trypsin-treated samples were blotted onto mini Pro-Blott polyvinylidene difluoride-type membranes (Applied Biosciences), extracted, and sequenced with standard protocols using an Applied Biosciences Procise sequencing instrument. The Procise software package was used to identify the first 10 N-terminal residues. Densitometry was performed on SDS gels using the fluorescence of the Coomassie stain, imaged with the Odyssey system (excited at 700 nm), and analyzed with the Odyssey software (version 2.0.4.0).Structural Analysis—The hydrophobic packing was compared at Asp-137 and Leu-207 in the 2.3 Å rat Tm structure (Protein Data Bank code 2b9c) (24Brown J.H. Zhou Z. Reshetnikova L. Robinson H. Yammani R.D. Tobacman L.S. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18878-18883Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA).RESULTSProteolytic Digestion of Tm—The Leu mutant D137L/C190A, a non-Cys control (C190A), and a wild type (WT) Tm were used in the digestion studies. Limited tryptic digestion of the Asp-137-containing controls C190A and WT initially produced two fragments, each about half the molecular weight of the intact Tm (Fig. 1A). Previous studies identified two fragments, an N-terminal fragment, T1, and a C-terminal fragment, T2, due to initial tryptic cleavage of rabbit skeletal αα-Tm at Arg-133 (25Pato M.D. Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 602-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary studies with native Rana temporaria muscle Tm showed that αα-Tm also was cleaved at Arg-133 (data not shown). The same site of cleavage was identified for these control recombinant chicken αα-Tms (see below). We also noted that some truncation (cleavage at the ends) of the Tms occurred as observed by a slightly faster moving band in SDS gels. SDS gels were used to monitor the loss of the main Tm band (intact and truncated) and to determine the kinetics of initial cleavage at Arg-133. For both the WT and C190A controls, the loss of the main band occurred with a t½ of ∼5 min (Fig. 1C). T1 and T2 were initially produced and were cleaved into smaller peptides with time. In contrast, the Leu mutant D137L/C190A was not cleaved at Arg-133 during a 1-h incubation. However, the Leu mutant was successively truncated by trypsin as indicated by the appearance of slightly faster migrating species (Fig. 1A). The molecular mass and the sites of cleavage and truncation were determined by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2) and N-terminal analyses (Fig. 3); see below.FIGURE 2MALDI MS of C190A and D137L/C190A treated with trypsin for the indicated times.

Therefore, the laser ionization procedure did not completely dissociate the molecule. Mass spectra were obtained for each time point of digestion. Here we show only molecular masses below 35 kDa of C190A at 3 and 6 min. At 3 min, in addition to the main band and the soybean trypsin inhibitor band (STI) (at 20 kDa), peptides T1 and T2 are seen (Fig. 2A). At 6 min, some remaining intact Tm chains are present (peak 1 as well as some truncated Tm chains, peak 2. Peak (T2)2 appears to be the presence of some dimer chains of peptide T2, indicating that T2 can exist as a dimer in solution, in agreement with earlier CD studies (25Pato M.D. Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 602-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dimer of T1 may also be present, but because of sample heterogeneity (truncated and intact species) and overlap with Peak 1, it was not positively identified. The indicated molecular mass helps define the peptides produced when compared with N-terminal analyses (see below). The MS spectra of D137L/C190A treated with trypsin for short and long times show a different pattern (Fig. 2B). At 6 min, almost equal quantities of intact Tm chains and truncated chains are present. The difference in molecular mass is ∼1000 Da, which corresponds to 9–10 amino acid residues clipped off (see below for identification of site). After 60 min of treatment, two other truncated species of lower molecular mass appeared. No significant cleavage to produce T1 and T2 is observed in agreement with the gel (Fig. 1A). The Leu mutant sample had some minor impurity present before trypsin treatment (Fig. 1A, 0 min). Our conclusions regarding the intact Tm are not altered by the presence of a small amount of low molecular mass impurity.The truncation and initial cleavage sites were determined by blotting and extracting the peptides from SDS gels and subjecting the extracted peptides to N-terminal analyses (Fig. 3). Intact Tm showed the expected N-terminal sequence of chicken α-Tm with the Ala-Ser extension (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequence of T2 from the control proteins C190A and WT corresponded to cleavage at Arg-133, which produced a peptide whose sequence starts with Leu-134. The molecular mass of chicken α-Tm from 134 to 284 obtained from mass spectra, 17.6 kDa, agreed with that calculated from the known sequence, 17.596 kDa, showing that T2 consists of residues 134–284. The determined molecular mass of the T1 peptide agrees with that calculated for residues 1–133 with the Ala-Ser N-terminal extension. The N-terminal amino acid sequence at increasing times indicated that the first site of truncation was after the KKK triplet at Lys-7. This is most probably the same site of truncation for the controls, in view of MS data. The second truncation site is at Lys-12, and the third site appears to be in the C-terminal region (Lys-244) determined from the molecular mass.Trypsin Proteolysis of Tm While Bound to Actin—To determine the effect of F-actin on the trypsin proteolysis of Tm, we compared the action of trypsin on the actin-Tm complex with Tm and F-actin alone (Fig. 1B). During 1 h of incubation with trypsin, Tm alone (C190A) was cleaved quite rapidly but the presence of actin reduced the rate of cleavage of Tm by a factor of 10 (Fig. 1D). F-actin alone was not affected by the 1 h of incubation with trypsin. Mass spectra showed that although Tm on actin-Tm produced some T1 and T2 peptides, there was no truncation at Lys-7. This suggested that F-actin protected Tm from truncation, in agreement with the known 9–11 amino acid overlap of the N and C termini (26Johnson P. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2264-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the recent structure of the overlap region (27Greenfield N.J. Huang Y.J. Swapna G.V. Bhattacharya A. Rapp B. Singh A. Montelione G.T. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 80-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which would protect cleavage at Lys-7. The lower rate of cleavage while bound to F-actin (Fig. 1D) indicates that actin stabilizes Tm. However, the production of T1 and T2 indicates that cleavage at Arg-133 still takes place while Tm is bound to actin. The Leu mutant was not cleaved or truncated while bound to actin during the same time period as the controls, as expected.Functional Effects of D137L Mutation—Actin binding properties of the Tms were studied by co-sedimentation with F-actin and also by titrations of F-actin S1 ATPase activity with Tm (19Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the continuous phosphate colorimetric assay system (see “Experimental Procedures”). F-actin co-sedimentation studies showed that for the Leu mutant and controls no Tm was found in the supernatant when 1 μm Tm was mixed with 10 μm actin (10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm NaCl) and spun to pellet the actin. Tm titrations of the F-actin-S1 ATPase at low [S1] showed that the Leu mutant D137L/C190A binds to actin with similar binding constant, Kb = 2 × 107 m–1 (data not shown).To determine the effect of the more stable Leu mutant on the Ca2+-dependent ATPase of the fully regulated thin filament actin Tm-Tn-S1, we used the continuous phosphate assay system (20Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). At high Ca2+, the ATPase was activated almost 2-fold more for the Leu mutant than the control (Fig. 4A). The S1 dependence of the actin-Tm-S1 ATPase (4B) showed that the thin filament containing the Leu mutant had a greater activity than the C190A both in the regulated thin filament (i.e. in the presence of Tn ±Ca2+) and in the absence of Tn. In agreement with Fig. 4A, in the absence of Ca2+ the activities were about the same.FIGURE 4Effect of the Leu mutation on actin-S1 ATPase activity.

We interpret this unstable region in native Tm as a “weak spot” around which the molecule could bend or flex when subjected to a perturbation. Thus, Tm appears to be a non-uniform flexible rod as opposed to a uniform flexible rod. This study therefore proposes that dynamic instability produces flexibility in Tm and furthermore that flexibility and function are linked.Previous studies have shown that thermal and denaturant-induced local unfolding of 30–60 amino acid residues in the middle of the Tm α-helix takes place prior to the main global transition (28Betteridge D.R. Lehrer S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Lehrer S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Ueno H.

Structure. 2006; 14: 43-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)}. In a preliminary study we reported that Leu substituted for Asp-137 in C190A control, shifted the main transition by +5o, and increased the magnitude of the local unfolding pre-transition (11Sumida J.P. Hayes D. Langsetmo K. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 2006; 90Google Scholar). Locally unfolded α-helices are necessary to allow accessibility for proteolytic cleavage (33Anfinsen C.B. Scheraga H.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 205-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 34Linderstrom-Lange K.U. Cold Spring Harbor Symp.

Early work with rabbit skeletal Tm showed that Arg-133 is the preferred site of initial cleavage by trypsin and noted that it was close to Asp-137, the only Asp in the hydrophobic ridge of the coiled-coil heptad repeat (25Pato M.D. Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 602-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We demonstrate here that when Asp-137 is replaced with Leu, the susceptibility of Tm to tryptic cleavage is removed. Another study indicated that V8 protease preferentially cleaves Tm at Glu-131, 4Z. Grabarek, private communication. indicating that the unstable region extends somewhat further to position 131. The site of trypsin cleavage in proteins is the peptide bond C-terminal to Lys and Arg. There are 53 Arg and Lys residues scattered fairly evenly across the 284 residues of Tm, with many located between positions 133 and 190. The lack of limited proteolysis at other regions in the middle of Tm suggests that the earlier observed unfolding pre-transition does not simply involve a single homogeneous"
https://openalex.org/W2092179194,"During membrane traffic, transport carriers are first tethered to the target membrane prior to undergoing fusion. Mechanisms exist to connect tethering with fusion, but in most cases, the details remain poorly understood. GM130 is a member of the golgin family of coiled-coil proteins tat is involved in membrane tethering at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi. Here, we demonstrate that GM130 interacts with syntaxin 5, a t-SNARE also localized to the early secretory pathway. Binding to syntaxin 5 is specific, direct, and mediated by the membrane-proximal region of GM130. Interestingly, interaction with syntaxin 5 is inhibited by the binding of the vesicle docking protein p115 to a distal binding site in GM130. The interaction between GM130 and the small GTPase Rab1 is also inhibited by p115 binding. Our findings suggest a mechanism for coupling membrane tethering and fusion at the ER to Golgi intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi, with GM130 playing a central role in linking these processes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that depletion of GM130 by RNA interference slows the rate of ER to Golgi trafficking in vivo. The interactions of GM130 with syntaxin 5 and Rab1 are also regulated by mitotic phosphorylation, which is likely to contribute to the inhibition of ER to Golgi trafficking that occurs when mammalian cells enter mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2081829900,"HIV-1 epidemic in Western Europe is largely due to subtype B. Little is known about the HIV-1 in Eastern Europe, but a few studies have shown that non-B subtypes are quite common. In Albania, where a recent study estimated a ten-fold increase of AIDS incidence during the last six years, subtype A and B account for 90% of the know infections.We investigated the demographic history of HIV-1 subtype A and B in Albania by using a statistical framework based on coalescent theory and phylogeography. High-resolution phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis showed a limited introduction to the Balkan country of subtype A during the late 1980s followed by an epidemic outburst in the early 1990 s. In contrast, subtype B was apparently introduced multiple times between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s. Both subtypes are growing exponentially, although the HIV-1A epidemic displays a faster growth rate, and a significantly higher basic reproductive number R(0). HIV-1A gene flow occurs primarily from the capital Tirane, in the center of the country, to the periphery, while HIV-1B flow is characterized by a balanced exchange between center and periphery. Finally, we calculated that the actual number of infections in Albania is at least two orders of magnitude higher than previously thought.Our analysis demonstrates the power of recently developed computational tools to investigate molecular epidemiology of pathogens, and emphasize the complex factors involved in the establishment of HIV-1 epidemics. We suggest that a significant correlation exists between HIV-1 exponential spread and the socio-political changes occurred during the Balkan wars. The fast growth of a relatively new non-B epidemic in the Balkans may have significant consequences for the evolution of HIV-1 epidemiology in neighboring countries in Eastern and Western Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2070002073,"Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases--enzymes that catalyze the first step of protein synthesis--in mammalian cells are now known to have expanded functions, including activities in signal transduction pathways, such as those for angiogenesis and inflammation. The native synthetases themselves are procytokines, having no signal transduction activities. After alternative splicing or natural proteolysis, specific fragments that are potent cytokines and that interact with specific receptors on cell surfaces are released. In this manner, a natural fragment of human tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (TyrRS), mini-TyrRS, has been shown to act as a proangiogenic cytokine. The mechanistic basis for the action of mini-TyrRS in angiogenesis has yet to be established. Here, we show that mini-TyrRS is exported from endothelial cells when they are treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Mini-TyrRS binds to vascular endothelial cells and activates an array of angiogenic signal transduction pathways. Mini-TyrRS-induced angiogenesis requires the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2/Flk-1/KDR). Mini-TyrRS stimulates VEGFR2 phosphorylation in a VEGF-independent manner, suggesting VEGFR2 transactivation. Transactivation of VEGFR2 and downstream angiogenesis require an intact Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif in mini-TyrRS, which is important for its cytokine activity. These studies therefore suggest a mechanism by which mini-TyrRS induces angiogenesis in endothelial cells and provide further insight into the role of mini-TyrRS as a link between translation and angiogenesis."

Mutations in DOK7 underlie a congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) associated with small and simplified neuromuscular synapses likely due to impaired Dok-7/MuSK signaling. The overwhelming majority of patients with DOK7 CMS have at least one allele with a frameshift mutation that causes a truncation in the COOH-terminal region of Dok-7 and affects MuSK activation.

Here, we identify a chromosome region maintenance 1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES) in the COOH-terminal moiety and demonstrate that the NES-mediated cytoplasmic location of Dok-7 is essential for regulating the interaction with MuSK in myotubes.

However, we previously identified Dok-7 as a muscle-intrinsic activator of the receptor protein-tyrosine kinase MuSK and further demonstrated that the Dok-7/MuSK signaling plays an essential role in the formation of neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a synapse between motor neuron and skeletal muscle (1Okada K.

The contraction of skeletal muscle is controlled by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine released from the motor nerve terminal. To achieve efficient neuromuscular transmission, acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) must be densely clustered on the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ. Indeed, impaired clustering of AChRs can underlie NMJ disorders that are both autoimmune (anti-MuSK antibody-positive myasthenia gravis) and genetic (CMS) in origin (9Vincent A. Lang B. Kleopa K.A.

We show that a NES and two SH2 target motifs in the COOH-terminal region are essential for Dok-7 to activate MuSK. In accordance, CMS-associated mutant Dok-7 lacking both elements fails to activate MuSK. Given that the PH domain, which is indispensable for MuSK activation, has a nuclear localization activity, the NES-mediated cytoplasmic retention of Dok-7 likely plays a role in regulating interaction with MuSK at the juxtamembrane part of cells. In addition, we show that CMS-associated missense mutations found in the PH or PTB domain inactivate Dok-7. Together, these findings suggest multiple pathogenic mechanisms underlying DOK7 CMS.

After transfection with Dok-7 expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), C2 myoblasts were cultured in differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum) for 5 days. We previously demonstrated that exogenous Dok-7 proteins were expressed in both undifferentiated myoblasts and differentiated myotubes (1Okada K. Inoue A. Okada M. Murata Y. Kakuta S. Jigami T.

Note that Btx-Sepharose was used to pull down the AChR pentamer complex, which includes the AChRβ1 subunit. For AChR clustering assays, 10 microscopic fields with the 40× objective were chosen at random, and the numbers of AChR clusters (>5 μm in their longest diameter) visualized with Alexa 594-conjugated Btx were counted using a DM6000B microscope (Leica). For fluorescent microscopy assays in Figs. 2 and 3, digital images were analyzed with Leica Deblur® software (AutoQuant) in a FW4000Z imaging system (Leica). For the MuSK phosphorylation assay in Fig. 4D, phosphorylated MuSK in C2 myotubes was visualized by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as in Fig. 4B, and levels of each phosphorylation were quantified with densitometry using NIH Image software (Version 1.63).FIGURE 3The NES-like sequence of Dok-7 serves as a functional NES and is crucial for MuSK activation in myotubes. A, the core Leu-241 in the NES-like sequence is required for the nuclear export of Dok-7-EGFP (WT). L241A, but not L248A substitution inhibited the nuclear export of Dok-7-EGFP. L245A substitution showed partial effects. Scale bar, 20 μm. B, the NES-like sequence facilitates accumulation of EGFP in the cytoplasm. EGFP fused with the 27 amino acids (225-251) of human Dok-7 including the NES-like sequence (NES-EGFP), but not its mutant form (mNES-EGFP) harboring a substitution equivalent to L241A mutation, was excluded from the nucleus (arrowheads). NES-EGFP translocated into the nucleus after the LMB treatment. Scale bar, 20 μm. C and D, the NES of Dok-7 is crucial for MuSK activation and AChR clustering.

Inoue A. Okada M. Murata Y. Kakuta S. Jigami T. Kubo S. Shiraishi H. Eguchi K. Motomura M. Akiyama T. Iwakura Y. Higuchi O. Yamanashi Y. Science. 2006; 312: 1802-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, it has remained unclear whether these domains play crucial roles in MuSK-dependent postsynaptic differentiation in vivo. Recently, two missense mutations, 98C→ T and 473G→ A, which produce mutant Dok-7 harboring A33V and R158Q substitutions in the PH and PTB domains, respectively, have been found in patients with DOK7 CMS (Fig. 1A and Refs. 27Palace J.

Beeson D. Abicht A. Lochmüller H. Brain. 2007; 130: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both Ala-33 and Arg-158 are conserved among vertebrates, and Dok-7-A33V and Dok-7-R158Q failed to induce MuSK activation, as judged by tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK and its downstream target AChRβ1 and subsequent AChR clustering in myotubes (Fig. 1, B-E). We confirmed that the forced expression of Dok-7 does not affect the differentiation of myotubes with regard to morphology and expression of myosin heavy chain, a known differentiation marker (supplemental Fig. S1 and Ref. 29Cabane C. Englaro W. Yeow K. Ragno M. Dérijard B. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, these CMS-associated mutations inactivate Dok-7, which apparently is mediated through an effect on the PH or PTB domain. Indeed, Dok-7-R158Q showed the same defect, a failure to bind with MuSK in HEK 293T cells, as Dok-7-RA, which carries an inactivated PTB domain (Fig. 1F and Ref. 1Okada K. Inoue A. Okada M. Murata Y. Kakuta S. Jigami T. Kubo S. Shiraishi H. Eguchi K. Motomura M. Akiyama T. Iwakura Y. Higuchi O. Yamanashi Y. Science. 2006; 312: 1802-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the PTB domain is necessary for Dok-7 to bind with MuSK (but not to activate MuSK) in heterologous cells, whereas it is required to activate MuSK in myotubes (Fig. 1, C, E, and F, and Ref. 1Okada K. Inoue A. Okada M. Murata Y. Kakuta S. Jigami T. Kubo S. Shiraishi H. Eguchi K. Motomura M. Akiyama T. Iwakura Y. Higuchi O. Yamanashi Y. Science. 2006; 312: 1802-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the 473G→ A mutation found in a patient with DOK7 CMS disrupts the PTB domain. Together, these data suggest crucial roles of the PH and PTB domains of Dok-7 in humans. Dok-7 Shuttles between the Cytoplasm and the Nucleus in Myotubes—601C→ T is a nonsense mutation identified in a patient with DOK7 CMS that produces a mutant peptide (Dok-7-R201X) lacking the entire COOH-terminal region (Arg-201 to Pro-504) (Fig. 2A and Refs. 26Beeson D. Higuchi O. Palace J. Cossins J. Spearman H. Maxwell S. Newsom-Davis J. Burke G. Fawcett P. Motomura M. Müller J.S. Lochmüller H. Slater C. Vincent A. Yamanashi Y.

Brain. 2007; 130: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Dok-7-R201X completely failed to activate MuSK and induce subsequent AChR clustering in myotubes (Fig. 2, B and C), unlike mutant Dok-7 produced by frameshift mutation 1124_1127dupTGCC (Dok-7-dupTGCC) which lacks the COOH-terminal peptide from Ala-378 to Pro-504 but induces reduced, but significant levels of MuSK activation as well as AChR clustering (Fig. 2A and Ref. 26Beeson D. Higuchi O. Palace J. Cossins J. Spearman H. Maxwell S. Newsom-Davis J. Burke G. Fawcett P. Motomura M. Müller J.S. Lochmüller H. Slater C. Vincent A. Yamanashi Y. Science. 2006; 313: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, there is possibly an additional functional element in the COOH-terminal region between Arg-201 and Ala-377. By searching databases, we noticed a potential NES sequence composed of 10 amino acids (240-249 amino acids) including Leu-241, Leu-245, and Leu-248 in human Dok-7, which are conserved among vertebrates (Fig. 2, A and D). We, therefore, investigated subcellular localization of Dok-7-R201X in myotubes to determine whether Dok-7 shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Dok-7-R201X showed prominent accumulation in the nucleus of"

The present study aimed to evaluate the relation of depressive symptoms with inflammatory factors and adipose-derived adipokines in middle-aged and older Chinese. Methodology/Principal Findings Data were from 3289 community residents aged 50–70 from Beijing and Shanghai who participated in the Nutrition and Health of Aging Population in China project. Depressive symptoms were defined as a Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 16 or higher. Plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), adiponectin, resistin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) were measured. Of the 3289 participants, 312 (9.5%) suffered from current depressive symptoms. IL-6 level was higher in participants with depressive symptoms compared to their counterparts in the crude analyses (1.17 vs. 1.05 pg/mL, p = 0.023) and this association lost statistical significance after multiple adjustments (1.13 vs. 1.10 pg/mL, p = 0.520). Depressive symptoms were not associated with increased mean levels of any other inflammatory factors or adipokines in the unadjusted or adjusted analyses. Conclusions/Significance We found no evidence that depressive symptoms were associated with inflammatory factors and adipokines in the middle-aged and older Chinese populations. Prospective studies and studies in clinically diagnosed patients are needed to confirm our results and clarify the relation of depression with inflammatory factors and adipokines."
https://openalex.org/W2044965631,"Alcohol has a strong causal relationship with sexual arousal and disinhibited sexual behavior in humans; however, the physiological support for this notion is largely lacking and thus a suitable animal model to address this issue is instrumental. We investigated the effect of ethanol on sexual behavior in Drosophila. Wild-type males typically court females but not males; however, upon daily administration of ethanol, they exhibited active intermale courtship, which represents a novel type of behavioral disinhibition. The ethanol-treated males also developed behavioral sensitization, a form of plasticity associated with addiction, since their intermale courtship activity was progressively increased with additional ethanol experience. We identified three components crucial for the ethanol-induced courtship disinhibition: the transcription factor regulating male sex behavior Fruitless, the ABC guanine/tryptophan transporter White and the neuromodulator dopamine. fruitless mutant males normally display conspicuous intermale courtship; however, their courtship activity was not enhanced under ethanol. Likewise, white males showed negligible ethanol-induced intermale courtship, which was not only reinstated but also augmented by transgenic White expression. Moreover, inhibition of dopamine neurotransmission during ethanol exposure dramatically decreased ethanol-induced intermale courtship. Chronic ethanol exposure also affected a male's sexual behavior toward females: it enhanced sexual arousal but reduced sexual performance. These findings provide novel insights into the physiological effects of ethanol on sexual behavior and behavioral plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2016551242,"Most modern eukaryotes diverged from a common ancestor that contained the alpha-proteobacterial endosymbiont that gave rise to mitochondria. The 'amitochondriate' anaerobic protist parasites that have been studied to date, such as Giardia and Trichomonas harbor mitochondrion-related organelles, such as mitosomes or hydrogenosomes. Yet there is one remaining group of mitochondrion-lacking flagellates known as the Preaxostyla that could represent a primitive 'pre-mitochondrial' lineage of eukaryotes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an expressed sequence tag (EST) survey on the preaxostylid flagellate Trimastix pyriformis, a poorly-studied free-living anaerobe. Among the ESTs we detected 19 proteins that, in other eukaryotes, typically function in mitochondria, hydrogenosomes or mitosomes, 12 of which are found exclusively within these organelles. Interestingly, one of the proteins, aconitase, functions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle typical of aerobic mitochondria, whereas others, such as pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and [FeFe] hydrogenase, are characteristic of anaerobic hydrogenosomes. Since Trimastix retains genetic evidence of a mitochondriate ancestry, we can now say definitively that all known living eukaryote lineages descend from a common ancestor that had mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2024692118,"Previously we reported that when cell cholesterol is acutely lowered with β-methyl-cyclodextrin the amount of activated ERK1/2 in caveolae dramatically increases. We traced the origin of this novel method of pERK1/2 accumulation to a macromolecular complex with dual specific phosphatase activity that contains the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A, the tyrosine phosphatase HePTP, the oxysterol-binding protein OSBP and cholesterol. When cell cholesterol is lowered, or oxysterols is introduced, the complex disassembles and pERK1/2 increases. In an effort to better understand how OSBP functions as a cholesterol-regulated scaffolding protein, we have mapped the functional parts of the molecule. The command center of the molecule is a centrally located, 51 amino acids (408-459) long sterol-binding domain that can bind both cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol. This domain is functional whether attached to the N- or the C-terminal half of OSBP. Introduction of a Y458S mutation impairs binding. Even though 25-hydroxycholesterol will compete for cholesterol binding to OSBP408-809, it will not compete for cholesterol binding in full-length OSBP. Upon further analysis we found that a glycine-alaninerich region at the N-terminal end of OSBP works with the PH domain to control cholesterol binding without affecting 25-hydroxycholesterol binding. Finally, we found that HePTP and PP2A bind the C-terminal half of OSBP, HePTP binds a coiled-coil domain (amino acids 732-761), and PP2A binds neither the coiled-coil nor HePTP. On the basis of this information we propose a new model for how OSBP is able to sense both membrane cholesterol and oxidized sterols and link this information to the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

Weng J. Anderson R.G. Science. 2005; 307: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Conditions that lower the cholesterol level of the plasma membrane (in particular, caveolae cholesterol) cause a dramatic increase in the level of cellular pERK1/2, which is followed by a marked increase in DNA synthesis (2Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The cause of the pERK1/2 increase is the loss of an enzyme activity that is able to remove phosphate from both threonine 185 and tyrosine 187 in human pERK2 (3Wang P.Y. Liu P. Weng J. Sontag E. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2658-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Instead of being a single protein, however, the dual phosphatase activity involves two separate sets of enzymes. One is the multiprotein, threonine phosphatase PP2A. The other is a member of the PTPPBS family (4Augustine K.A. Silbiger S.M. Bucay N. Ulias L. Boynton A. Trebasky L.D. Medlock E.S. Anat. Rec. 2000; 258: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of tyrosine phosphatase. These proteins work cooperatively as part of a high molecular weight complex (∼440 kDa) to dephosphorylate pERK1/2 when plasma membrane cholesterol is normal. Cholesterol depletion, however, silences the dual specific activity and, concomitant with the loss of cholesterol, the high molecular weight complex disassembles. Therefore, the cooperative behavior of the two enzymes is dependent on a cholesterol binding, scaffolding protein that holds the two phosphatases in the active configuration only when cholesterol is bound. A protein with the expected scaffolding activity was identified as OSBP (1Wang P.Y. Weng J. Anderson R.G.

A lipid-sensing protein is one where the occupation of a binding pocket by a specific lipid causes the molecule to undergo a conformational change that conveys new functional activity. A well characterized example of this type of molecule is the sterol-sensor family of membrane proteins (5Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). These are polytopic membrane proteins that contain a sterol-sensing motif within the spanning regions. In the case of the sterol sensors SCAP and HMG-CoA reductase, cholesterol binding to this motif causes each to bind one of the two isoforms of the integral membrane protein Insig. Whereas the binding of Insig to HMG-CoA reductase stimulates reductase degradation, Insig binding to SCAP causes retention of the transcription factor SREBP in the ER. Importantly, these sterol sensors appear to be specialized to sense the local level of sterol in the membrane where they reside (5Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S.

OSBP is 809 amino acids long (Fig. 1) and contains an N terminus (1-88) rich in glycine and alanine (Gly-Ala domain), a PH domain (90-183), a leucine zipper (209-244), a FFAT motif (360-364) that binds the ER protein VAP, and a sterol-binding region (408-809). Originally discovered as an oxysterol-binding protein (10Dawson P.A. Van der Westhuyzen D.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9046-9052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Taylor F.R. Kandutsch A.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the crystal structure of the yeast ORP Osh4 indicates that the sterol-binding pocket of OSBP may be able to accommodate a variety of sterols including cholesterol. The principle function of OSBP and other ORPs is thought to be to move sterols between different membrane compartments, although experiments in yeast “suggest that elimination of Osh proteins has an impact on the ability of the PM to sequester sterols but does not directly affect the transport of sterols” (12Sullivan D.P. Ohvo-Rekila H. Baumann N.A. Beh C.T. Menon A.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here we present new evidence in support of our model that OSBP functions as a sterol sensor. We map the sterol-binding region of OSBP to an area between residue 409 and 459 and show that it is this sequence that conveys stereospecific cholesterol and oxysterol binding. The binding site for the two OSBP client enzymes (HePTP and PP2A) resides between 459 and 809. Finally, we present evidence that the alanine/glycine-rich region at the N terminus (10Dawson P.A. Van der Westhuyzen D.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9046-9052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) controls the binding of cholesterol, but not 25-hydroxycholesterol, to the sterol-binding site in OSBP. Materials—Monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Monoclonal Abs for HA and Myc were from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). PP2A, C mAb was from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA) and PP2A, B55α, was a gift from Dr. Estelle Sontag at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Poly-Prep chromatography columns were from Bio-Rad and Ni-NTA beads were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol were from Sigma. Epicholesterol was from Steraloids Inc (Newport, RI). 1, 2-[3H]-(N)-cholesterol and 25-(26, 27-[3H])hydroxycholesterol were from PerkinElmer (Boston, MA). Protease inhibitor mixture set III and PMSF were from Calbiochem. Construction of Recombinant OSBPs—The key OSBP cDNA constructs used in this study, which were derived from a rabbit sequence (13Dawson P.A. Ridgway N.D. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16798-16803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are shown schematically in supplemental Fig. S3. For bacterial-expressed protein, all clones were inserted into the pET102-V5-His bacterial expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 or Rosetta. pET102-OSBP-V5-His was constructed as previously described (1Wang P.Y. Weng J. Anderson R.G. Science. 2005; 307: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). pET102-OSBP-V5-His was used as the template to generate a set of subclones. To obtain pET102-OSBP1-473-V5-His, the pET102-OSBP-V5-His was digested with HindIII, partially digested with XbaI, and the 5′ overhang of the purified large XbaI-HindIII fragment was filled in and ligated. To obtain pET102-OSBP1Δ77-310-V5-His, the pET102-OSBP-V5-His was digested with XhoI, partially digested with SgrAI, and the 5′ overhangs of the purified large SgrAI-XhoI fragment was filled in and ligated. To obtain the pET102-OSBP459-809-V5-His, pET102-OSBP-V5-His was digested with NcoI and the 5′ overhangs of the purified larger NcoI fragment was filled in and ligated. PCR was performed to obtain pET102-OSBP1-409-V5-His, pET102-OSBP311-809-V5-His, pET102-OSBP408-809-V5-His, pET102-OSBPY298S-V5-His, pET102-OSBPY458S-V5-His, and pET102-OSBP181-809. The clones were constructed using a QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following PCR primers respectively; 5′-CCAAGAAGGAAAAGAGAACCGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCC-3′ forward, 5′-GTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATAATGGAGCAGCTGGCAAAGC-3′ forward, 5′-AAGAAGGAGATATACATAATGGGGAGAACCAGAATACCATACAAG-3′ forward, 5′-GCAGAAGTCGCTGCAGTCTGAGAGAGACCAGCGC-3′ forward, 5′-GCCTTACTGAAGATCTGGAATCCCATGGGCTGTTAGACCG-3′ forward and 5′-CTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATAATGGCCAAGGCCAAGGCTGTG-3′ forward. pET102-OSBPΔ87-182-V5-His was constructed as previously described (1Wang P.Y. Weng J. Anderson R.G. Science. 2005; 307: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For the co-expression studies in HeLa cells, we used the pcDNA3.1-myc-His mammalian expression vector. pcDNA3.1-OSBP408-809-myc-His and pcDNA3.1-OSBP1-473-myc-His were constructed as described above for the pET102 vectors. pcDNA3.1-OSBPΔ732-760 was constructed by PCR using the primer forward 5′-GGAAAATGGGCGCTGGGAAGATGGCACACCTTATGATCC-3′. All subcloned cDNAs were sequenced to verify that the coding sequence was correct. Sterol Binding Assay—Expression of cDNA inserts in pET102 is induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3-4 h at room temperature. Bacteria were collected and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm imidazole, 0.2% protease inhibitor mixture set III, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bacteria were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 25 min to remove debris. The supernatant fraction was further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The clear supernatant fraction was assayed for protein concentration and OSBP construct expression level before each experiment. For each binding assay, the protein concentration of the lysate was kept at 1.8 mg/ml. To achieve similar concentrations, the constructs expression level was checked by semi-quantitative immunoblotting, and the highest expressing construct in each experiment was diluted with bacterial lysates from non-expressing cells. Sterol binding was measured by placing 9.5 ml of lysate in a 15-ml conical tube, adding the indicated concentration of [3H]sterol in 20 μl of 100% ethanol, and rotating the sample for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, 200 μl of Ni-NTA beads (prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction) was added to each tube, and the rotation continued for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The sample was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min to sediment the beads, and the supernatant fraction designated the unbound fraction. The beads were resuspended in buffer A and loaded onto a poly-prep chromatography column. Following three washings with 10 mm imidazole, once with 20 mm imidazole and once with 40 mm imidazole in buffer A, the bound His (6Mohammadi A. Perry R.J. Storey M.K. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1062-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)-tagged proteins were eluted with 160 mm imidazole in buffer A. The tritium radioactivity in the elution was then measured by scintillation counting. Instead of using the columns, the beads can also be washed by low speed centrifugation (500 × g, 2 min) using the same washing procedure. Then the beads were resuspended in 160 mm imidazole and centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min. The radioactivity in the supernatant/elution was determined by scintillation counting. Immunoblotting with a V5 mAb was performed to confirm equal amounts of His6-tagged OSBP protein in each assay of the same experiment. For each experiment, the lysate from non-expressing/control cells was employed for a parallel binding assay and the radioactivity in the elution was considered as the background. OSBP-specific 3H binding was obtained by subtracting the background radioactivity from the total radioactivity associated with the OSBP samples. The OSBP-specific bound tritium was then converted into fmol of sterol. Each binding curve was plotted with GraphPad Prism software, and the binding Kd was estimated using a nonlinear regression curve. With the Bradford protein assay, we estimated that 10-20 μg of OSBP construct was present in each assay and that the final ethanol concentration in each experiment was ∼0.5%. In tests not shown, we found that as much as 2% ethanol had no effect on the sterol binding characteristics of both wild type and mutant OSBPs. Depending on the sterol affinity and expression level, background binding (bacterial lysate alone) values for 25-hydroxycholesterol ranged from 1-18% and for cholesterol from 4-26%. A compilation of the binding experiments for the various constructs is shown in supplemental Fig. S3. OSBP-HePTP/PP2A Interaction Assay—The HePTP/PP2A-OSBP interaction assay was carried out in HeLa cells as previously described. Briefly cells were transfected with the indicated cDNA using Superfect transfection reagent, cultured for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in Buffer B (20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized by nitrogen bomb at 500 psi for 15 min on ice. The homogenates were centrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 × g and the His-tagged OSBP construct isolated from the supernatant fraction using Ni-NTA beads as previously described (1Wang P.Y. Weng J. Anderson R.G. Science. 2005; 307: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Other Methods—We used a one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons using Fisher's Least-Significant-Difference Test to analyze sterol binding to both normal and mutant OSBP (supplemental Fig. S1). Localization of the Sterol-binding Site—We reported previously that cholesterol promotes assembly of OSBP/HePTP/PP2A while 25-hydroxycholesterol causes disassembly (1Wang P.Y. Weng J. Anderson R.G. Science. 2005; 307: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), which implies that both sterols interact with OSBP. Recently the crystal structure of Osh4 was solved (14Im Y.J. Raychaudhuri S. Prinz W.A. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2005; 437: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and a sterol-binding pocket defined (Fig. 2). Consistent with our observation, this ORP can bind both cholesterol and oxysterol. The region of OSBP that is homologous to Osh4 (Fig. 2) encompasses amino acids 408-809 (OSBP408-809) and contains the previously defined oxysterol-binding region of the molecule (13Dawson P.A. Ridgway N.D. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16798-16803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

J. 2007; 405: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To see if OSBP408-809 will also bind cholesterol, we developed a method for measuring sterol binding to bacterial expressed OSBP408-809 (see “Experimental Procedures”). We tested the method by measuring the ability of OSBP408-809 to bind 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol as a function of sterol concentration (Fig. 3A). Binding was saturable with an average half-maximal binding (apparent Kd) of 5 nm (Fig. 3C), which is comparable to the binding of 25-hydroxycholesterol to full-length OSBP expressed in COS-M6 cells (13Dawson P.A. Ridgway N.D. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16798-16803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OSBP408-809 also bound cholesterol (Fig. 3B). A competition binding assay was used to determine if cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol bound to the same site on the molecule (Fig. 3D). Both unlabeled cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol competed for [3H]cholesterol binding to OSBP408-809. Epicholesterol, which is an optical isomer of cholesterol, failed to compete for binding. On the other hand, cholesterol did not compete for binding of 25-hydroxycholesterol to OSBP (E). We do not know the reason for this anomaly, but it may be due to the low solubility and low affinity of cholesterol compared with 25-hydroxycholesterol. Nevertheless, OSBP408-809 appears to have a single, stereospecific, sterol-binding site that can bind either cholesterol or oxysterols.FIGURE 3Stereo-specific binding of cholesterol (B, C-E) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (A, C-E) to OSBP408-809. In all experiments we used lysate from either bacteria-expressing His-tagged OSBP408-809 or control bacteria as described. A, constant amount of each lysate was incubated in the presence of the indicated concentration of 25-OH-[3H]cholesterol for 2 h at room temperature, and purified by nickel chromatography. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the [3H] associated with the control sample. B, same protocol was used to measure [3H]cholesterol binding. C, diagram of the OSBP408-809 construct along with its average estimated binding affinity of 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol. D, OSBP408-809 was incubated with 30 nm [3H]cholesterol in the presence of the indicated concentrations of unlabeled cholesterol (•), 25-hydroxycholesterol (▵), or epicholesterol (▪). The OSBP408-809-specific bound [3H]cholesterol was determined by scintillation counting. E, OSBP408-809 was incubated with 5 nm 25-OH-[3H]cholesterol in the presence of the indicated concentrations of unlabeled cholesterol (^), 25-hydroxycholesterol (▵), or epicholesterol (▪) for 2 h at room temperature. The OSBP408-809-specific bound 25-OH-[3H]cholesterol was determined by scintillation counting. We used immunoblotting to confirm that each sample within an experiment had the same amount of expressed OSBP constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of OSBP408-809 to bind both cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol is in agreement with the structural properties of the sterol-binding pocket found in Osh4 (14Im Y.J. Raychaudhuri S. Prinz W.A. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2005; 437: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Osh4 predicts that the β-barrel region of OSBP between amino acids 458 and 694 is the sterol-binding site (Fig. 2). A convenient restriction site allowed us to construct a cDNA coding for amino acids 1-473 of OSBP (OSBP1-473), which does not include any part of the the β-barrel region (Fig. 2). This construct clearly binds 25-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 4A and supplemental Figs. S1 and S3) with an average Kd of 122 nm (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. S1). It also binds cholesterol (•, Fig. 4B) with a Kd of ∼216 nm. If, on the other hand, the first 458 amino acids of OSBP (OSBP459-809) is deleted, sterol binding is lost (▵, Fig. 4, B and C). We also did not detect sterol binding to amino acids 1-409 (Figs. 4C, 5B, and 6A). The lack of sterol binding to both OSBP1-409 and OSBP459-809 suggests there is a single sterol-binding site in OSBP between amino acid 408 and 459 that will bind sterol when attached to either the N-terminal or the C-terminal one-half of the molecule. According to the model of Osh4 (14Im Y.J. Raychaudhuri S. Prinz W.A. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2005; 437: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), OSBP409-459 maps to the putative lid region of OSBP (Fig. 2). Based on this analysis, the β barrel region is not the primary sterol-binding site in OSBP.FIGURE 5Full-length OSBP binds both cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol. Experiments were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 3. A, constant amount of each lysate was incubated in the presence of the indicated concentration of 25-OH-[3H]cholesterol for 2 h at room temperature, and purified by nickel chromatography. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the [3H] associated with the control lysate. B, same protocol was used to measure [3H]cholesterol binding to the full-length OSBP. As a negative control, we measured [3H]cholesterol binding to OSBP1-409 (▪). C, diagram of full-length OSBP with the average estimated binding affinity of 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol. A one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons using Fisher's Least-Significant-Difference Test shows that the binding of sterol to 1-809 is statistically significant (supplemental Fig. S1). D, same sterol binding protocol was used to measure 25-OH-[3H]cholesterol binding to two mutated full-length OSBPs (Y298S and Y458S). Kd for binding of Y298S was 15.2 ± 1.2 nm. E, full-length OSBP was incubated in the presence of 60 nm [3H]cholesterol plus the indicated concentration of unlabeled 25-hydroxycholesterol for 2 h at room temperature. The amount of specific [3H]cholesterol bound was measured. We used immunoblotting to confirm that each sample within an experiment had the same amount of expressed OSBP constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6The N terminus of OSBP regulates cholesterol binding. A, same protocol as described above was used to measure 25-OH-[3H]cholesterol binding to OSBP311-809 (▪) and OSBP1-409 (▴). B, OSBP311-809 was incubated in the presence of 30 nm [3H]cholesterol plus the indicated concentration of unlabeled cholesterol (•), 25-hydroxycholesterol (▵), or epicholesterol (▪). C, diagrams of the OSBP311-809 and OSBPΔ77-310 with the average estimated binding affinity for 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol. A one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons using Fisher's Least-Significant-Difference Test analysis of binding to these constructs is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. D, standard binding protocol was used to measure 25-OH-[3H]cholesterol binding to OSBP311-809 and OSBPΔ77-310. E, in the same experiment we measured [3H]cholesterol binding to OSBP311-809 and OSBPΔ77-310. We used immunoblotting to confirm that each sample within an experiment had the same amount of expressed OSBP constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Regulation of Sterol Binding—With the sterol-binding site in the middle of the molecule it is possible that the C- and N-terminal portions of OSBP are specialized to regulate specific functions of the molecule. Two functions of interest are HePTP/PP2A binding and sterol-binding. Fig. 5A shows that full-length OSBP binds 25-hydroxycholesterol (•). It also binds cholesterol (•, Fig. 5B). The average of multiple trials indicates that in our assay full-length OSBP has a Kd of ∼37 nm for 25-hydroxycholesterol and ∼173 nm for cholesterol (Fig. 5C and supplemental Figs. S1 and S3). Ridgway et al. (15Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) reported that OSBP lacking amino acids 455-809 (OSBP1-454), which would delete four amino acids from the C-terminal end of the sterol-binding domain we have localized to OSBP409-459, does not bind oxysterols. We noticed that this set of amino acids contains a tyrosine residue at position 458 within a consensus CRAC motif cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus: (L/V)X(1-5)YX(1-5)(R/K)). CRAC domains have been implicated in cholesterol binding to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) (17Jamin N. Neumann J.M. Ostuni M.A. Vu T.K. Yao Z.X. Murail S. Robert J.C. Giatzakis C. Papadopoulos V. Lacapere J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and Neimann-Pick C2 (18Friedland N. Liou H.L. Lobel P. Stock A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2512-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed an OSBP with an amino acid substitution at position 458 (Y458S) and another with a substitution at 298 (Y298S) within a putative CRAC domain outside of the sterol-binding motif. Each was then tested for oxysterol binding (Fig. 5D). Whereas OSBPY298S exhibited normal, saturable 25-hydroxycholesterol binding with a Kd of ∼15 nm (▪), only nonspecific binding was detected for OSBPY458S (▴). Similar result was obtained for [3H]cholesterol binding (supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggest a role for tyrosine 458 in sterol binding to OSBP. Unlike OSBP408-809 (Fig. 3D), 25-hydroxycholesterol competed poorly for cholesterol binding to full-length OSBP (Fig. 5E). Therefore, we explored the possibility that the N-terminal end of OSBP influenced sterol binding to the sterol-binding site in OSBP408-459. Fig. 6A shows the 25-hydroxycholesterol binding curve for an OSBP that lacks the first 310 amino acids (OSBP311-809, ▪) compared with OSBP1-409 (▴). The estimated Kd for 25-hydroxycholesterol binding to OSBP311-809 was ∼20 nm, but in the same experiment this sterol did not bind OSBP1-409. OSBP311-809 also bound cholesterol (B and E) and binding was competed by both cholesterol (B, •) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (B, ▵) but not epicholesterol (B, ▪). Therefore, the sterol binding characteristics of OSBP are not influenced by the presence of amino acids 311-408 (compare Figs. 6B with 3D). We next constructed an OSBP that had an internal deletion between amino acids 77 and 310 (OSBPΔ77-310, Fig. 6C) and compared the 25-hydroxycholesterol (D) and cholesterol (E) binding characteristic with OSBP311-809. Whereas OSBPΔ77-310 (D, ○) and OSBPΔ77-310 (D, ▴) both bound 25-hydroxycholesterol equally well, cholesterol binding to OSBPΔ77-310 was reduced (E, ▴) compared with OSBP311-809 (E, ○). This suggests that the glycine-alanin"
https://openalex.org/W1971566977,"Alzheimer patients have increased levels of both the 42 amyloid-β-peptide (Aβ) and the amyloid binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), which is an intracellular binding site for Aβ. The overexpression of Aβ and ABAD in transgenic mice has shown that the binding of Aβ to ABAD results in amplified neuronal stress and impairment of learning and memory. From a proteomic analysis of the brains from these animals, we have identified for the first time that the protein endophilin I increases in Alzheimer diseased brain. The increase in endophilin I levels in neurons is linked to an increase in the activation of the stress kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase with the subsequent death of the neurons. We also demonstrate in living animals that the expression level of endophilin I is an indicator for the interaction of ABAD and Aβ as its expression levels return to normal if this interaction is perturbed. Therefore this identifies endophilin I as a new indicator of the progression of Alzheimer disease.

Alzheimer disease patients have increased expression of ABAD in Alzheimer disease-affected regions, as do transgenic animals that overexpress Aβ (4Yan S.D. Shi Y. Zhu A. Fu J. Zhu H. Zhu Y. Gibson L.

Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ABAD (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1 SO 8) provided the first three-dimensional structure of an internal binding site for Aβ. This region consists of a 20-amino-acid region close to the active site of the enzyme. A 20-amino-acid peptide of this Aβ binding domain of ABAD, fused to the cell membrane transduction domain of the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein, was able to block Aβ-induced toxicity (8Lustbader J.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 597-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Also, transgenic animals expressing both ABAD and a mutated form of the amyloid precursor protein (Tg mAPP/ABAD), resulting in an increase in intracellular Aβ, have an enhanced neuronal cytotoxicity with subsequent changes in spatial learning memory (8Lustbader J. Cirilli M. Lin C. Xu H.W. Takuma K. Wang N. Caspersen C. Chen X. Pollack S. Chaney M. Trinchese F. Liu S. Gunn-Moore F. Lue L-F. Walker D. Kuppusamy P. Zewier Z. Arancio O. Stern D. Yan S.D. Wu H. Science. 2004; 304: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). This is via mitochondrial dysfunction because the neurons from these animals show spontaneous generation of reactive oxygen species, a decrease in ATP levels, and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (10Takuma K.

Previously, we identified peroxiredoxin II as a protein whose expression increased within the brains isolated from Tg mAPP/ABAD animals and Alzheimer disease patients. We showed that the physiological role of this increase appears to be the protection of neurons from Aβ-induced toxicity (11Yao Y. Taylor M. Davey F. Ren Y. Aiton J. Coote P. Chen X. Yan S.D. Gunn-Moore F.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Significantly, we also showed that if the interaction of Aβ with ABAD was perturbed, then these molecular changes are reversed in living animals, thus indicating that ABAD is a suitable target for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (11Yao Y. Taylor M. Davey F. Ren Y. Aiton J. Coote P. Chen X. Yan S.D. Gunn-Moore F.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a second protein that is increased within the brains isolated from Tg mAPP/ABAD animals and Alzheimer disease patients. This protein is endophilin I, which has not been previously linked to Alzheimer disease but has been shown to influence c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity (12Ramjaun A.R. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Tong X.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28913-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We demonstrate in primary cortical neurons that an increase in endophilin I leads to an increase in JNK activation with the subsequent death of these neurons. Additionally, expression of truncated versions of endophilin I blocked Aβ-induced JNK activation and toxicity. We also show that if the interaction of Aβ with ABAD is perturbed, then these molecular changes are reversed in living animals, thus indicating that endophilin I, like peroxiredoxin II, can act as a marker for the interaction of Aβ and ABAD and hence is a suitable target for the treatment of Alzheimer disease. Transgenic Animals and Human Material—Transgenic mice with neuronal targeted expression of ABAD (Tg ABAD) were generated under the control of platelet-derived growth factor-B chain promoter. Transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of human amyloid precursor protein (a minigene encoding hAPP695 and 751 and hAPP70 bearing V717F, K670M/N671L; Tg mAPP mice, J-20 line) were provided by Dr. Mucke (13Mucke L. Masliah E. Yu G.Q. Mallory M. Rockenstein E.M. Tatsuno G. Hu K. Kholodenko D. Johnson-Wood K. McConlogue L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4050-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tg ABAD mice were crossed with Tg mAPP mice to generate double Tg ABAD/mAPP. Tg mice for our studies were in the C57BL/6 background. Characterization of these animals was described in the previous studies (8Lustbader J. Cirilli M. Lin C. Xu H.W. Takuma K. Wang N. Caspersen C. Chen X. Pollack S. Chaney M. Trinchese F. Liu S.

Human Alzheimer disease brain tissues were obtained from Columbia Alzheimer's Disease Research Center brain banks. Proteomics—Brains from Tg ABAD/mAPP, Tg ABAD, and non-Tg littermates were dissolved in 8 m urea, 2 m thio-urea, 4% CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1% immobilized pH gradient buffer, pH 3–10 (Amersham Biosciences), 40 mm Tris base, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Soluble proteins were purified from this extract by sonication followed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 17,000 × g, 45 mins. From each brain, ∼50 mg of soluble proteins was produced. For analysis of protein expression differences, 100 μg of protein was separated in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing on 18-cm, pH 4–7, immobilized pH gradient strips (Amersham Biosciences) before second dimension separation on large 23 × 23 cm 10% polyacrylamide gels (100 V overnight). Proteins were initially visualized by silver staining. To identify proteins, replica gels were run with larger amounts of protein loaded (1 mg). These gels were stained with SyproRuby (Genomic Solutions), and gel images were captured using a fluorescent scanner. The protein spots were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsinization, and masses of the resulting peptides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of flight mass spectrometry analysis. Proteins were then identified by peptide mass fingerprinting by searching appropriate web-based data base programs (MS-Fit at the ProteinProspector web site). Western Blot and Immunocytochemistry Analysis—Brain homogenates from Tg animals or Alzheimer disease patients were loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed by rabbit endophilin I (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and followed by goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugated IgG. The immunoreactive bands were detected using a Lumi-Light kit (Roche Applied Science). Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with rabbit anti-endophilin I (1:50) followed by the secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase, Sigma). Sites of antigens were detected by 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole chromogen (Sigma). Preparation of Transfected Embryonic Mouse Cortical Culture—Primary neuronal cultures of embryonic age 14 CD1 wild-type mice were generated following standard protocols. The cerebral cortex was dissected, and 25 mg of trypsin (Worthington Biochemical) was added for 4 min. Following DNase (30 units) addition, the cells were gently triturated to prepare a single cell suspension, and cell number was obtained using a hemacytometer. Neurons were nucleofected with 2 μg of DNA (endophilin I full-length, endophilin I Δ-SH3, endophilin I GFP-SH3, kindly provided by Dr. P McPherson (Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University)), using the Amaxa mouse neuron nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Neurons were seeded onto a 96-well plate (Nunc) precoated with 50 mg/ml poly d-lysine (Sigma) at a density of 200 cells/well or 35-mm Petri dishes precoated with poly d-lysine at a density of 500,000 cells/well. 24 h later, medium was replaced by serum-free medium with B27 supplement (Invitrogen). Following a further 72 h, 50 μm aged Aβ peptide (14Morishima Y. Gotoh Y. Zieg J. Barrett T. Takano H. Flavell R. Davis R.J. Shirasaki Y. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7551-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was added to experimental wells. For cell counting experiments, 24 h after Aβ treatment, cells were fixed and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained. The total number of live cells (as assessed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining) per well at the completion of the trial was counted. Each experiment was performed three times. In each experiment, control and Aβ-treated cultures were set up in triplicate. For immunoblotting, 8 h after Aβ treatment, neurons were harvested in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris(pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm Sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated for four times for 5 s, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm, 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using Bradford's reagent. Equal amounts of lysate protein were run on a 4–12% precast Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose blots were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-phospho-specific-JNK, anti-JNK (Cell Signaling)) at a dilution of 1:2000 overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 containing 3% bovine serum albumin. After a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (1:5000, Bio-Rad), the membranes were subjected to ECL reagents (Pierce) for immunoreactivity detection. Each experiment was repeated three times. All results are expressed as means and standard errors, and the statistical tests were analyzed by analysis of variance using STATVIEW program. Proteomics Analysis of Transgenic Brains—Five-month-old Tg mAPP/ABAD mice show significant behavioral changes and deficits in mitochondrial function as compared with single transgenic animals (8Lustbader J. Cirilli M. Lin C. Xu H.W. Takuma K. Wang N. Caspersen C. Chen X. Pollack S. Chaney M. Trinchese F. Liu S. Gunn-Moore F. Lue L-F. Walker D. Kuppusamy P. Zewier Z. Arancio O. Stern D. Yan S.D. Wu H.

FASEB J. 2005; 14: 2040-2041Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). To maximize the potential changes in protein levels, we performed our initial proteomic analysis on animals of 8 months of age as single Tg mAPP mice also show behavioral changes at this age (16Arancio O. Zhang H.P. Chen X. Lin C. Trinchese F. Puzzo D. Liu S. Hegde A. Yan S.F. Stern A. Luddy J.S. Lue L.F. Walker D.G. Roher A. Buttini M. Mucke L. Li W. Schmidt A.M. Kindy M. Hyslop P.A. Stern D.M. Du Yan S.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4096-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Whole brains were analyzed from three mice of each genotype (matched for age and sex). The three genotypes analyzed were animals expressing ABAD (Tg ABAD), mAPP, and ABAD (Tg mAPP/ABAD) and non-transgenic litter mates (non-Tg) and have been previously described (8Lustbader J. Cirilli M. Lin C. Xu H.W. Takuma K. Wang N. Caspersen C. Chen X. Pollack S. Chaney M. Trinchese F. Liu S. Gunn-Moore F. Lue L-F. Walker D. Kuppusamy P. Zewier Z. Arancio O. Stern D. Yan S.D. Wu H.

FASEB J. 2005; 14: 2040-2041Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted and analyzed as detailed before (11Yao Y. Taylor M. Davey F. Ren Y. Aiton J. Coote P. Chen X. Yan S.D. Gunn-Moore F.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and under “Experimental Procedures.” All samples were run in duplicate. The two-dimensional gels of the separated proteins from the brains of Tg ABAD, Tg mAPP/ABAD, and non-Tg controls led to the identification of a protein spot that was consistently up-regulated in the Tg mAPP/ABAD transgenic animals as compared with the Tg ABAD transgenic animals or the non-transgenic littermate controls (Fig. 1). By mass spectrometry, this protein was identified as the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein 2A endophilin I (gene: SH3GL2) (Swiss Prot Accession No Q62420). Importantly, the predicted molecular weight and pI value (molecular weight 39,877, pI 5.3, endophilin 1) of this protein corresponded favorably to the observed molecular weight (molecular weight 42,000, pI 5.4, endophilin I). Increased Expression of Endophilin I in Tg mAPP/ABAD and Alzheimer Disease Brains—An increase in endophilin I expression has not been reported before for any neurodegenerative disease, although it had been previously predicted (17Reutens A.T. Begley C.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis confirmed a consistent up-regulation of endophilin I in both the hippocampus (Fig. 2A) and the cortex (Fig. 2B) of the Tg mAPP/ABAD animals as compared with the non-transgenic controls and a β-actin control. Analysis of all immunoreactive bands combined demonstrated that expression of endophilin I was increased about 2.5–3-fold in hippocampus and cortex of Tg mAPP/ABAD as compared with the non-Tg mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Endophilin I is a cytoplasmic protein (17Reutens A.T. Begley C.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and immunocytochemistry confirmed that the expression level was indeed increased in the Tg mAPP/ABAD transgenic animals as compared with the non-transgenic littermate controls (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the result of Western blot for endophilin I, intensities of endophilin I immunostaining in cerebral cortex were about 3-fold-increased as compared with the non-Tg mice (Fig. 2C). To assess whether the observed increase in endophilin I expression was relevant in Alzheimer disease, we next screened human brain tissue. By both Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A) and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 3B), we observe that there was a consistent increase in endophilin I expression in the temporal cortex of Alzheimer patients as compared with non-demented age-matched controls. Immunostaining with specific antibody to endophilin I showed that increased expression of endophilin I was predominately present in the neurons of temporal cortex of Alzheimer disease brain. An altered level of endophilin I suggests its significance in the Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Increased Endophilin I Expression Leads to Activation of JNK and a Subsequent Decrease in Neuronal Viability—Endophilin I has been previously linked to JNK activation in the HEK293 cell line where an increase in endophilin I expression led to an increase in JNK activity; additionally, expression of truncated versions of endophilin I (Fig. 4A) led to the blocking of the activation of JNK (12Ramjaun A.R. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Tong X.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28913-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We confirmed that this also occurs in primary cortical neuronal cultures as expression of full-length endophilin I led to an increase in JNK activation as compared with transfected controls (Fig. 4B). The addition of Aβ has been previously shown to activate JNK activity in cortical neurons (14Morishima Y. Gotoh Y. Zieg J. Barrett T. Takano H. Flavell R. Davis R.J. Shirasaki Y. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7551-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, in this report, when one of the two differing truncated versions of endophilin I were expressed in these neurons, then JNK activation was blocked even in the presence of toxic levels of Aβ (Fig. 4B). The activation of JNK has long been associated with a decrease in neuronal viability (18Bozyczko-Coyne D. O'Kane T.M. Wu Z.L. Dobrzanski P. Murthy S. Vaught J.L. Scott R.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 849-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Connors T.J. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 157-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore as part of the experiments, we additionally counted the number of neurons that survived this process. The results reflect those that were found for the JNK phosphorylation. We saw significant decreases in neuronal cell viability when full-length endophilin I was expressed or with the addition of Aβ in cortical neurons (Fig. 4C). Additionally, the expression of the two truncated versions of endophilin I resulted in an increase in survival of neurons even in the presence of toxic levels of Aβ (Fig. 4C). Thus it would appear that the increased levels of endophilin I may be partly responsible for the increased levels of JNK activation previously observed in the brains of Alzheimer disease sufferers (20Thakur A. Wang X. Siedlak S.L. Perry G. Smith M.A. Zhu X. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 1668-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Perturbing the Interaction of Aβ with ABAD Results in a Reversal in Expression of Endophilin I in Tg mAPP Animals—The solving of the crystal structure of Aβ bound to ABAD indicates that residues 94–114 of ABAD interact with Aβ. A peptide spanning this region of ABAD inhibits ABAD-Aβ interaction in vitro and protects primary neuronal cultures from Aβ-induced cytotoxicity (8Lustbader J. Cirilli M. Lin C. Xu H.W. Takuma K. Wang N. Caspersen C. Chen X. Pollack S. Chaney M. Trinchese F. Liu S. Gunn-Moore F. Lue L-F. Walker D. Kuppusamy P. Zewier Z. Arancio O. Stern D. Yan S.D. Wu H. Science. 2004; 304: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). This peptide has been modified further by the addition of the cell membrane transduction domain of the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat protein fused with a mitochondrial matrix protein-targeting sequence and the region of ABAD between residues 93 and 116 to produce Tat-mito-ABAD-DP. This chimeric peptide was then successfully used in living animals by intraperitoneal injection to reverse the increased expression of peroxiredoxin II, which is observed in Tg mAPP animals (11Yao Y. Taylor M. Davey F. Ren Y. Aiton J. Coote P. Chen X. Yan S.D. Gunn-Moore F.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This leads to a subsequent improvement in the learning and memory of the transgenic animals (21Yao J. Mei L. Luddy J. Chen X. Stern D. Arancio O. Yan S.D. Program Number 716.11, 2004 Abstract Viewer/Itinerary Planner. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D.C.2004Google Scholar). Therefore to determine whether endophilin I expression is also directly due to the interaction of Aβ and ABAD, we performed the same experiments as detailed previously (11Yao Y. Taylor M. Davey F. Ren Y. Aiton J. Coote P. Chen X. Yan S.D. Gunn-Moore F.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), injecting intraperitoneally either the forward (Tat-mito-ABAD-DP) or the reverse peptides (Tat-mito-ABAD-RP) into Tg mAPP/ABAD animals. Western blot analysis of the proteins from hippocampus of Tg mAPP/ABAD animals of 8 months of age showed a significant increase in the expression level of endophilin I as compared with non-transgenic animals using a β-actin expression control. Tg mAPP/ABAD animals treated with the reverse peptide (Tat-mito-ABAD-RP) also show an elevated level of endophilin I (Fig. 5). However, in those animals that were treated with Tat-mito-ABAD-DP, the expression of endophilin I was significantly decreased (Fig. 5). These data confirm that the increased expression of endophilin I is a result of the interaction of Aβ and ABAD and confirms that the Tat-mito-ABAD peptide disrupts this interaction. Intracellular Aβ can elicit toxic events by binding to the mitochondrial protein ABAD (8Lustbader J. Cirilli M. Lin C. Xu H.W. Takuma K. Wang N. Caspersen C. Chen X. Pollack S. Chaney M. Trinchese F.

Alzheimer patients show an increase in the expression levels of both Aβ and ABAD with their subsequent binding, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the death of neurons (8Lustbader J. Cirilli M.

FASEB J. 2005; 14: 2040-2041Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Indeed, transgenic animals with elevated levels of both Aβ and ABAD show learning and memory deficits as early as 4 months of age as compared with transgenic animals expressing elevated levels of solely Aβ or ABAD or non-transgenic animals (8Lustbader J. Cirilli M. Lin C. Xu H.W. Takuma K. Wang N. Caspersen C. Chen X. Pollack S. Chaney M. Trinchese F. Liu S. Gunn-Moore F. Lue L-F. Walker D. Kuppusamy P. Zewier Z. Arancio O. Stern D. Yan S.D. Wu H. Science. 2004; 304: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). This is thought to be the result of an increase in the oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species within the brains of these animals (8Lustbader J. Cirilli M. Lin C. Xu H.W. Takuma K. Wang N.

Previously, we performed a proteomic analysis of the brains from transgenic animals that were expressing both mAPP and ABAD (Tg mAPP/ABAD) (11Yao Y. Taylor M. Davey F. Ren Y. Aiton J. Coote P. Chen X. Yan S.D. Gunn-Moore F.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Despite the previously observed cellular dysfunction of Tg mAPP/ABAD animals (15Caspersen C. Wang N. Yao J. Sosunov A. Chen X. Lustbader J.W. Xu H.W. Stern D. McKhann G. Yan S.D.

The apparent function of this increase of this antioxidant protein appeared to be an attempt at protecting neurons from Aβ toxicity (11Yao Y. Taylor M. Davey F. Ren Y. Aiton J. Coote P. Chen X. Yan S.D. Gunn-Moore F.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The discovery that within the brains of Tg mAPP/ABAD animals and Alzheimer sufferers, the levels of protein expression for endophilin I are increased is a novel observation. Endophilin I is a cytoplasmic SH3 domain-containing protein, which is present in presynaptic nerve termini (22Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Through its SH3 domains, it can bind to other endocytic proteins including synaptojanin and dynamin and hence is known to have a role in synaptic vesicle formation (17Reutens A.T. Begley C.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Endophilin I can also complex with signaling molecules including cell surface receptors (23Howard L. Nelson K.K. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and the germinal center kinase-like kinase (12Ramjaun A.R.

In particular, previous studies have shown that overexpression of endophilin I activates JNK activation in HEK293 cells, whereas expression of truncated parts of endophilin I blocked this activation (12Ramjaun A.R.

Increases in JNK activity have been long associated with Alzheimer disease. It is activated by the addition of Aβ to neuronal cultures (14Morishima Y. Gotoh Y. Zieg J. Barrett T. Takano H. Flavell R.

McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28913-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggest a potential new signaling pathway contributing to the activation of JNK in Alzheimer disease. Expression of endophilin I in cortical neurons caused a significant increase in JNK activation with a subsequent decrease in neuronal viability. There was also no apparent synergistic increase in JNK phosphorylation when endophilin I and Aβ were added together. This may reflect the maximal activity within this experiment, and this is also suggested from the survival data. Additionally, as was previously reported in HEK293 cells (12Ramjaun A.R. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Tong X.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28913-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the expression of the truncated versions of endophilin I significantly prevented the activation of JNK with a subsequent increase in neuronal viability, even in the presence of Aβ. Notably, both truncated versions with and without the SH3 domain had the ability to prevent inactivation of JNK. Future studies will determine how this might occur, but it is possible to speculate that prevention of relocation of JNK and/or upstream activators may be responsible, as occurs with the JNK-interacting protein (31Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). It is also possible to speculate that endophilin I may also have other roles in Alzheimer disease. Indeed, other binding partners for endophilin I include SH3-domain GRB2-like (endophilin) interacting protein 1, which has been identified as a neuronal protein that regulates energy balance (32Trevaskis J. Walder K. Foletta V. Kerr-Bayles L. McMillan J. Cooper A. Lee S. Bolton K. Prior M. Fahey R. Whitecross K. Morton G.J. Schwartz M.W. Collier G.R. Endocrinology. 2005; 46: 3757-3764Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A change in the overall energy balance is known to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of Tg mAPP/ABAD animals and also in patients with Alzheimer disease (10Takuma K. Yao J. Huang J. Xu H. Chen X. Luddy J. Trillat A.C. Stern D.M. Arancio O. Yan S.S. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 597-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). More recently, endophilin I has been shown to increase the production of APP (33Schobel S. Neumann S. Seed B. Lichtenthaler S.F. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Future studies will explore this new signaling pathway and its involvement in Alzheimer disease and will require the production of further transgenic animals as these events occur over longer periods of time than are achievable from cell culture of embryonic or neonatal neuronal cultures. Not only is it important to identify factors that underlie the cause of Alzheimer disease, but it would be advantageous if they also reflect its progression. Previously, we identified peroxiredoxin II as one such potential marker. This is because the intraperitoneal injection into Tg mAPP animals of a decoy peptide comprising of ABAD residues 93–116, coupled to a mitochondrial matrix-targeting sequence and a Tat cell-permeating sequence, resulted in the reversal of the increased expression levels of peroxiredoxin II (11Yao Y. Taylor M. Davey F. Ren Y. Aiton J. Coote P. Chen X. Yan S.D. Gunn-Moore F.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore the reversal of expression to normal levels of endophilin I by the use of the same Tat-mito-ABAD blocking peptide is the identification of another potential factor. It also confirms that the binding of Aβ to ABAD results in increases in endophilin I expression. The actual mechanism of how this occurs and why is unknown. However, it is possible to speculate as it is known that the mitochondria within Tg mAPP/ABAD and Alzheimer patients are under stress due to this interaction, which leads to leakage of reactive oxygen species and enhances CypD translocation, triggering open mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (9Yan S.D. Stern D.M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2005; 86: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Takuma K. Yao J. Huang J. Xu H. Chen X. Luddy J. Trillat A.C. Stern D.M. Arancio O. Yan S.S. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 597-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The consequence of these events would be to activate signal transduction pathway in the cytosol that leads to increases in endophilin I. Future studies will explore whether this is a general stress response or whether it is specific to Alzheimer disease. As endophilin I is involved in synaptogenesis (17Reutens A.T. Begley C.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), one possibility is that the increase in endophilin I is an attempt to maintain synaptic connectivity, which is know to be decreased in Alzheimer disease. Our results also confirm previous finding that the prevention of Aβ binding to ABAD is a suitable drug target, as opposed to the production of inhibitors to ABAD, which essentially will have the same effect as the addition of Aβ as this will result in inhibiting the activity of the enzyme (34Kissinger C.R. Rejto P.A. Pelletier L.A. Thomson J.A. Showalter R.E. Abreo M.A. Agree C.S. Margosiak S. Meng J.J. Aust R.M. Vanderpool D. Li B. Tempczyk-Russell A. Villafranca J.E. J. Mol.

Lett. 2006; 16: 4657-4660Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In summary, we have identified proteins that are elevated in Alzheimer disease and remain elevated even after death. Notably, the increases in expression of our identified proteins have differing actions as peroxiredoxin II is an antioxidant, whereas endophilin I will contribute to the toxicity observed in the death of neurons from Alzheimer disease patients (Fig. 6). Our findings suggest that an abnormality for endophilin I, which had previously been predicted (17Reutens A.T. Begley C.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), has been found, and future studies will investigate the role of this novel signaling pathway further and whether it is involved in other neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1973531279,"The balance between carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) nutrients must be tightly coordinated so that cells can optimize their opportunity for metabolism, growth and development. However, the C and N nutrient balance perception and signaling mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of two allelic oversensitive to sugar1 mutants (osu1-1, osu1-2) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using the cotyledon anthocyanin accumulation and root growth inhibition assays, we show that the osu1 mutants are more sensitive than wild-type to both of the imbalanced C/N conditions, high C/low N and low C/high N. However, under the balanced C/N conditions (low C/low N or high C/high N), the osu1 mutants have similar anthocyanin levels and root lengths as wild-type. Consistently, the genes encoding two MYB transcription factors (MYB75 and MYB90) and an Asn synthetase isoform (ASN1) are strongly up-regulated by the OSU1 mutation in response to high C/low N and low C/high N, respectively. Furthermore, the enhanced sensitivity of osu1-1 to high C/low N with respect to anthocyanin accumulation but not root growth inhibition can be suppressed by co-suppression of MYB75, indicating that MYB75 acts downstream of OSU1 in the high C/low N imbalance response. Map-based cloning reveals that OSU1 encodes a member of a large family of putative methyltransferases and is allelic to the recently reported QUA2/TSD2 locus identified in genetic screens for cell-adhesion-defective mutants. Accumulation of OSU1/QUA2/TSD2 transcript was not regulated by C and N balance, but the OSU1 promoter was slightly more active in the vascular system. Taken together, our results show that the OSU1/QUA2/TSD2-encoded putative methyltransferase is required for normal C/N nutrient balance response in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2094398825,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis at its nucleotide binding domains (NBD). The NBDs dimerize in a head-to-tail configuration, forming two ATP binding pockets (ABP) with the ATP molecules buried at the dimer interface. Previous studies have indicated that ABP2, formed by the Walker A and B motifs of NBD2 and the signature sequence of NBD1, is the site critical for the ATP-dependent opening of CFTR. The G551D mutation in ABP2, the third most common cystic fibrosis-associated mutation, abolishes ATP-dependent gating, resulting in an open probability that is ∼100-fold lower than that of wild-type channels. Interestingly, we found that the ATP analog N6-(2-phenylethyl)-ATP (P-ATP) increases G551D currents mainly by increasing the open time of the channel. This effect is reduced when P-ATP is applied together with ATP, suggesting a competition between ATP and P-ATP for a common binding site. Introducing mutations that lower the nucleotide binding affinity at ABP2 did not alter significantly the effects of P-ATP on G551D-CFTR, whereas an equivalent mutation at ABP1 (consisting of the Walker A and B motifs of NBD1 and the signature sequence of NBD2) dramatically decreased the potency of P-ATP, indicating that ABP1 is the site where P-ATP binds to increase the activity of G551D-CFTR. These results substantiate the idea that nucleotide binding at ABP1 stabilizes the open channel conformation. Our observation that P-ATP enhances the G551D activity by binding at ABP1 implicates that ABP1 can potentially be a target for drugs to bind and increase the channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2010185030,"African sleeping sickness is caused by Trypanosoma brucei. This extracellular parasite lacks de novo purine biosynthesis, and it is therefore dependent on exogenous purines such as adenosine that is taken up from the blood and other body fluids by high affinity transporters. The general belief is that adenosine needs to be cleaved to adenine inside the parasites in order to be used for purine nucleotide synthesis. We have found that T. brucei also can salvage this nucleoside by adenosine kinase (AK), which has a higher affinity to adenosine than the cleavage-dependent pathway. The recombinant T. brucei AK (TbAK) preferably used ATP or GTP to phosphorylate both natural and synthetic nucleosides in the following order of catalytic efficiencies: adenosine > cordycepin > deoxyadenosine > adenine arabinoside (Ara-A) > inosine > fludarabine (F-Ara-A). TbAK differed from the AK of the related intracellular parasite Leishmania donovani by having a high affinity to adenosine (Km = 0.04–0.08 μm depending on [phosphate]) and by being negatively regulated by adenosine (Ki = 8–14 μm). These properties make the enzyme functionally related to the mammalian AKs, although a phylogenetic analysis grouped it together with the L. donovani enzyme. The combination of a high affinity AK and efficient adenosine transporters yields a strong salvage system in T. brucei, a potential Achilles' heel making the parasites more sensitive than mammalian cells to adenosine analogs such as Ara-A. Studies of wild-type and AK knockdown trypanosomes showed that Ara-A inhibited parasite proliferation and survival in an AK-dependent manner by affecting nucleotide levels and by inhibiting nucleic acid biosynthesis.

Studies of wild-type and AK knockdown trypanosomes showed that Ara-A inhibited parasite proliferation and survival in an AK-dependent manner by affecting nucleotide levels and by inhibiting nucleic acid biosynthesis. Trypanosoma brucei is an extracellular parasite that is transmitted by tsetse flies and lives in the blood, lymph, and central nervous system of its mammalian hosts (1Barrett M.P.

The parasite causes African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. There are two variants of African sleeping sickness, a chronic form caused by the subspecies Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and an acute form caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Both variants are fatal, but the chronic form has a slower progress. Current treatment is unsatisfactory because of low efficacy and high toxicity. Therefore, there is a great need of new drugs to treat the disease, especially at later stages when the parasites infect the brain. Promising results with the adenosine analog cordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine) on T. brucei-infected mice with brain infection suggest that adenosine analogs can be developed into new anti-trypanosomal agents (3Rottenberg M.E.

Unlike mammalian cells, trypanosomes lack de novo purine biosynthesis, and they are therefore totally dependent on purine salvage (4El Kouni M.H. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 99: 283-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The major purine source in human blood is a matter of controversy; when the blood was directly mixed with an adenosine deaminase inhibitor to prevent purine degradation, adenosine was present at 2 μm concentration, whereas hypoxanthine (0.7 μm) and inosine (0.2 μm) were minor sources (5Slowiaczek P. Tattersall M.H.N. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, other reports claim that the adenosine concentration is much lower and that hypoxanthine is the major source (6Ontyd J. Schrader J. J.

T. brucei has high affinity adenosine transporters driven by the protonmotive force that are able to concentrate adenosine inside the cells (8Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H.

Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but the affinities for adenosine are 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than the adenosine affinities of the trypanosome transporters. The current belief is that adenosine is salvaged by a two-step process in T. brucei where intracellular cleavage to adenine is followed by phosphoribosylation to AMP (4El Kouni M.H. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 99: 283-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).

It is therefore important for the parasites to have efficient transporters that concentrate adenosine inside the cells. However, because of the great uncertainty about the blood adenosine concentration, it is not known whether this transport is efficient enough to saturate the enzyme activity. The AMP formed by the cleavage-dependent pathway can be used for the synthesis of all purines needed (GMP is made from AMP via IMP and XMP (4El Kouni M.H. Pharmacol.

The cleavage-dependent pathway is probably not the only way to salvage adenosine because the published T. brucei genome (13Berriman M. Ghedin E. Hertz-Fowler C. Blandin G. Renauld H. Bartholomeu D.C. Lennard N.J. Caler E. Hamlin N.E. Haas B. Bohme U. Hannick L. Aslett M.A. Shallom J. Marcello L. et al.Science. 2005; 309: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) contains two putative adenosine kinase (AK) genes (Tb927.6.2300 and Tb927.6.2360). The encoded proteins are very similar to each other, differing by only four amino acids (see supplemental Fig. 1). Recently, it was shown that T. brucei becomes less sensitive to cordycepin when AK is silenced by RNA interference (14Lüscher A. Onal P. Schweingruber A.M. Mäser P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 3895-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have cloned, expressed, and characterized the T. brucei AK (Tb927.6.2360) to understand its role in adenosine salvage and activation of nucleoside analogs. The T. brucei AK (TbAK) had ∼2.5 orders of magnitude higher adenosine affinity (and catalytic efficiency) than IAG-NH (11Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21713-21719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Pellé R. Schramm V.L. Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2118-2126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which catalyzes the first step in the cleavage-dependent pathway. The powerful salvage system consisting of a high affinity AK and efficient transporters seems to make T. brucei perfectly adapted to purine-poor environments. It is also interesting from a drug development point of view because many nucleoside analogs need to be activated by TbAK to mediate cytotoxicity. The cleavage-resistant drug adenine arabinoside (Ara-A) was taken up by the parasites and phosphorylated by the TbAK-dependent pathway. The resulting Ara-ATP inhibited trypanosome proliferation and survival by incorporation into nucleic acids and by affecting nucleotide levels in the parasite. Cloning and Expression of TbAK—The AK gene was amplified from T. brucei TC221 genomic DNA. Primers used were 5′-AAC TGC TCA TGA GCT CCG CTC CTC TGA GGG TAT ACG-3′ (TbAK forward) and 5′-ACG GGG TAC CTC AAG GAG AAA AAC TGG GCT T-3′ (TbAK reverse). The PCR product was cloned into the pETM-20 vector (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) by using NcoI and Acc65I restriction sites. The cloning of the AK gene was confirmed by agarose gel analysis and DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid (pETM20-TbAK) contained a fusion construct with Escherichia coli thioredoxin A (TrxA) and TbAK. In addition, the construct also contained a hexahistidine tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site between the two proteins to facilitate purification and subsequent removal of the fusion protein. Expression and Purification of Recombinant TbAK—The pETM20-TbAK vector was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) plysS cells (Merck) and expressed. The cells were grown in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing 60 μg/ml carbenicillin and 27.2 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm (Forma Orbital Shaker, Thermo Electron Corp., Marietta, OH). At an optical density of 0.5 at 550 nm, isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged (3,000 × g for 30 min) and resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). The cells were lysed by freezing and thawing and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1.25-ml His-Select™ cartridge (Sigma) equilibrated with 25 ml of buffer A. The column was washed with 30 ml of 5 mm imidazole in buffer A and subsequently with 5 ml of 10 mm imidazole in buffer A. The TrxA-tagged TbAK was eluted with 30 ml of 20 mm imidazole in buffer A. The protein-containing fractions were pooled and precipitated with 80% (0.52 g/ml) ammonium sulfate at 0 °C and centrifuged (30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The pellet was dissolved in 500 μl of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6 and 0.1 mm DTT) and desalted on a G-25 Sephadex column (6 ml) equilibrated with buffer B. The protein concentration was assessed by the Bio-Rad protein assay (BioRad) and compared with a standard curve made from bovine serum albumin. The presence of 0.1 mm DTT was necessary to keep the protein stable during freezing and thawing. Removing the Fusion Partner from TbAK by TEV Proteolysis—Approximately 0.7 mg of TrxA-TbAK protein in 2 ml of buffer B was cleaved by 40 μg of TEV protease for 1 h at room temperature. The cleaved protein mixture was loaded onto a 1.25-ml His-Select™ cartridge (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer B. Pure TbAK was collected in the flow-through, whereas the hexahistidine-tagged TrxA and TEV protease were bound to the column. The protein-containing fractions in the flow-through were pooled, concentrated by a 20-ml Vivaspin column (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. The TrxA tag had no obvious effect on enzyme activity (data not shown). TbAK Assays—Assays were performed with 3H-labeled adenosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine, or inosine from Moravek Biochemicals Inc., Brea, CA. Prior to the enzyme activity analysis, TbAK was diluted in Dilution buffer, which consists of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (10 mm Tris-HCl was used in the pH optimization experiment), 50 mm KCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.1 mm DTT. The diluted protein was mixed with assay components in a volume of 50 μl. The assay mixture contained 3H-labeled nucleoside (adenosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine, or inosine), 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm potassium phosphate, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. When high nucleoside substrate and enzyme concentrations were used, 0.05 mg/ml creatine kinase and 8 mm phosphocreatine were added to the assay mixture to avoid depletion of ATP (ADP inhibits the reaction). Phosphocreatine and creatine kinase had no effect on enzyme activity under conditions where ATP levels were stable (low enzyme and substrate concentration). The assay components were mixed on ice and stored for 10 min before the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After completion of the assays, the tubes were placed on ice, and 20 μl of the assay mixtures was spotted onto DE81 filters (Whatman). After drying, the filters were washed three times for 5 min by 1 mm ammonium formate under agitation. The radioactivity was eluted from the filters by 0.1 m HCl/KCl before scintillation counting as described previously (15Ives D.H. Durham J.P. Tucker J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 28: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The unit definition of enzyme activity from 1 mg of TbAK protein is in μmol/min. HPLC Enzyme Assay—The standard AK assay was sometimes complemented by HPLC studies to check the exact nature of the products and to study TbAK activity with adenosine analogs that were not radioactive. After completion of the assay, the assay mixtures were diluted in water, and 20 μl was loaded onto a 4.6 × 100-mm ACE 3 AQ column (Advanced Chromatography Technologies, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Cordycepin and cordycepin-5′-monophosphate were separated with a running buffer consisting of 7.5% (v/v) methanol, 33 mm KH2PO4, and 61 mm KCl (the pH was adjusted to 6 with 5 m KOH). The same buffer was also used to separate 2′-deoxyadenosine from dAMP, whereas the methanol concentration was decreased to 5% (v/v) to separate adenosine from AMP, Ara-A from Ara-AMP, and F-Ara-A from F-Ara-AMP. Cultivation of Trypanosomes and Mammalian Cells—Culture-adapted bloodstream forms of the T. brucei brucei cell line TC221 (16Hirumi H. Hirumi K. Doyle J.J. Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1980; 80: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were propagated in Hirumi's modified Iscove's medium-9 (17Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) lacking thymidine and Serum Plus but supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 7% CO2. This modification of the growth medium has no obvious effect on trypanosome proliferation (18Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mouse Balb/3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC no.CCL-163) or human WS1 fibroblasts (ATCC no.CRL-1502) were cultivated as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with l-glutamine (0.584 g/liter) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 7% CO2. Preparation of T. brucei Enzyme Extracts—Trypanosomes (5 × 108 cells) were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the pellet was washed twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.1 mm DTT. The trypanosomes were lysed by sonication as described previously (19Hassan H.F. Coombs G.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1986; 84: 217-223Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed at –80 °C. The assay was performed as before except that 2 mm ATP was used (instead of 0.5 mm) and that 50 mm NaF (phosphatase inhibitor) was included to prevent ATP degradation. Protein concentration was assessed by the Bio-Rad protein assay and compared with a standard curve made from bovine serum albumin. Western Blots—Samples were prepared from noninduced and induced TbAK knockdown T. brucei cells. Trypanosomes (4 × 108 cells) were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. To break the cells, the suspensions were mixed with 300 mg of 0.5-mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products, Inc.) and vortexed three times for 15 s (the samples were chilled on ice between each vortex cycle). The cell extracts were centrifuged for 1 min (16,000 × g), and the supernatants were used for SDS-PAGE. Western analysis was performed with α-TbAK immune serum diluted 33,000 times in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST) and 2% (w/v) skim milk. The blot was probed with an α-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences), developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences), and quantified by Kodak Image Station 2000R. The membrane was stripped, and a second Western blot was made with α-BiP antibody obtained from J. Bangs laboratory (University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison). BiP is a T. brucei homolog of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein and is used as loading control in Western blots. The immune serum against TbAK was produced by Agrisera AB (Vännäs, Sweden). Measurement of NTP and dNTP Pools—Logarithmically growing trypanosomes (1–3 × 108 cells) or 50–75% confluent mammalian cells from a 15-cm dish were collected, and their NTPs and dNTPs were extracted by a trichloroacetic acid-based procedure as described previously (18Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The NTPs/dNTPs were quantified by HPLC (20Håkansson P. Hofer A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7834-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) using a 100 × 4.6 mm, 3-μm 1500-Å PolyWAX A column from PolyLC Inc., Columbia, MD. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The mobile phase was made up from 2% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.3 m KH2PO4 and was adjusted to pH 5 with 1 m K2HPO4. When necessary, dNTPs were purified from NTPs by boronate chromatography prior to the HPLC analysis (18Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The nucleotides were quantified by comparing the peak heights to a standard mixture of nucleotides. Measurement of Trypanosome or Mammalian Cell Proliferation in the Presence of Drugs—T. brucei cells (10,000 cells/well) were grown for 60 h in a 96-well microtiter plate in the presence of 200 μl of medium containing various concentrations of Ara-A (in combination with 1 μm 9-erythro-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA)) or F-Ara-A. Control trypanosomes that were incubated without drug (or with only EHNA) were still in the logarithmic growth phase at 60 h. The cells were quantified as previously described (21Räz B. Iten M. Grether-Bühler Y. Kaminsky R. Brun R. Acta Trop. 1997; 68: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar); after the addition of 20 μl of Alamar Blue® (BIOSOURCE) and a 2-h incubation period, the cell densities were quantified by fluorescence measurements (excitation at 540 nm and measurement at 583 nm). The equipment used consisted of an FP6500 spectrofluorometer and an FMP-963 microtiter plate reader (Jasco). Human WS1 fibroblasts and mouse Balb/3T3 cells (5,000 cells/well) were also grown for 60 h in the presence of drugs and quantified by the Alamar Blue® assay. Control cells incubated without drug (or with only EHNA) were 50–75% confluent at 60 h. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Determination—Trypanosomes (500,000/ml) were treated with various concentrations of Ara-A (+1 μm EHNA) or F-Ara-A for 60 h. Control cells incubated without drug had reached a cell density of 2–3 million/ml at this time point. MIC values were determined by microscope inspection and defined as the lowest concentration of drug where no motile trypanosomes with normal morphology were detected (the detection limit was ∼10,000 cells/ml). MIC90 was defined as the lowest concentration where more than 90% of the cells were killed (less than 50,000 cells/ml remained). Measurement of 3H-Labeled Uracil/Thymidine Incorporation into Nucleic Acids—Trypanosomes (2 × 108 cells) were centrifuged at 1,800 × g for 2 min and resuspended in 10 ml of medium. After 30 min of preincubation with 1 μm EHNA, 10 μCi of [6-3H]uracil (39 Ci/mmol) or [methyl-3H]thymidine (15 Ci/mmol) was added together with various concentrations of Ara-A, and the cells were incubated for 60 min. The radioactive uracil and thymidine were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals Inc., Brea, CA. Cell material precipitated with trichloroacetic acid was dissolved in 0.6 m NaOH and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Scintillation counting of 100 μl of this material revealed the total amount of radioactivity in nucleic acids (RNA + DNA). DNA could be recovered from the NaOH-treated nucleic acids by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the material (100 μl) and collection on glass filters as described previously (22Nicander B. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity in RNA was obtained by subtracting the DNA counts from the total counts. The incorporation of radioactivity into nucleic acid was linear during the 60-min incubation period (data not shown). Expression and Purification of TbAK—The TbAK gene was cloned into pETM-20. The resulting plasmid encoded a hexahistidine-tagged TrxA protein fused to TbAK. Protein expression in the absence of this tag resulted in only small amounts of insoluble protein. The expressed TrxA-TbAK protein was purified to homogeneity by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 1, lane 1). The fusion protein was digested by TEV protease and repurified by nickel-agarose. Because the TEV protease and the fusion partner had hexahistidine tags, they bound to the column, and pure TbAK could be collected in the flow-through (Fig. 1, lane 2) with a final yield of 6 mg from a starting material of 125 mg of protein (1-liter culture). The TrxA-TbAK and TbAK bands were in agreement with their expected molecular masses of 52 and 38 kDa, respectively. Gel filtration analysis showed that, in agreement with the human, Leishmania donovani and Toxoplasma gondii AKs (23Andres C.M. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11388-11393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Datta A.K. Bhaumik D. Chatterjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5515-5521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Darling J.A. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the TbAK protein was primarily monomeric in the absence and presence of 3 mm ATP (data not shown). Optimization of Enzyme Assay Conditions—TbAK activity was optimized using 0.5 μm adenosine (enzyme activity is inhibited at higher concentrations) and 0.5 mm ATP as substrates. Optimal enzyme activity was obtained at pH 6–8.5 (Fig. 2A). The enzyme activity was stimulated by phosphate ions (Fig. 2B). The dependence on phosphate might be a general property of AKs because it has also been observed in enzymes from L. donovani, mammals, yeast, and plants (26Maj M.C. Singh B. Gupta R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4059-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The human enzyme can also be activated by small phosphate-containing organic compounds such as phosphocreatine (27Park J. Singh B. Maj M.C. Gupta R.S. Protein J. 2004; 23: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but this compound had no effect on the trypanosome enzyme (Fig. 2B). TbAK activity was dependent on MgCl2, whereas KCl (0–0.25 m) and DTT (0–1 mm) had no obvious effect on enzyme activity (data not shown). TbAK activity was linear with time (0–30 min) and protein concentration (data not shown). The specific activity of the enzyme was between 11 and 28 units/mg, depending on the phosphate concentration. This activity is higher than for the native and recombinant human AKs assayed under optimal conditions (3.7 and 3.4 units/mg, respectively (28Spychala J. Datta N.S. Takabayashi K. Datta M. Fox I.H. Gribbin T. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1232-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)) but in the same range as for the mouse recombinant AK (16 units/mg (29Sahin B. Kancy J.W. Nairn A.C. Spychala J. Ealick S.E. Fienberg A.A. Greene R.W. Bibb J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). ATP and GTP Were Preferred Phosphate Donors for TbAK—The enzyme could use ATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP as phosphate donors. With ATP as phosphate donor, the enzyme activity had a Vmax value of 11.6 units/mg (Table 1). The other phosphate donors gave higher Vmax values, but they needed to be present at higher concentrations to saturate the enzyme as seen by their high Km values. Comparing the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) with different phosphate donors show that ATP and GTP are the preferred ones. Because ATP is present at higher concentrations than GTP in T. brucei cells (18Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is probably the major phosphate donor under physiological conditions.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of TbAK incubated under standard assay conditionsSubstrateKmVmaxKikcatkcat/Kmμmunits/mgμms-1(s-1 × m-1) × 106ATPaThe phosphate donor is the studied substrate while the adenosine concentration was used at 0.5 μm.26 ± 2.411.6 ± 0.167.30.28GTPaThe phosphate donor is the studied substrate while the adenosine concentration was used at 0.5 μm.82 ± 1425 ± 0.81160.19UTPaThe phosphate donor is the studied substrate while the adenosine concentration was used at 0.5 μm.340 ± 5629 ± 1.5180.052CTPaThe phosphate donor is the studied substrate while the adenosine concentration was used at 0.5 μm.610 ± 8332 ± 1.7200.032Ado0.041 ± 0.003113.0 ± 0.2514 ± 1.08.1200Cordycepin13 ± 1.86.1 ± 0.223.90.30dAdo110 ± 166.6 ± 0.274.20.038Ara-A230 ± 272.1 ± 0.091.30.0058Ino570 ± 2201.8 ± 0.301.10.0020F-Ara-A540 ± 610.17 ± 0.0100.110.00020a The phosphate donor is the studied substrate while the adenosine concentration was used at 0.5 μm. Open table in a new tab TbAK Activity Was Regulated by Substrate Inhibition—TbAK activity measured at different adenosine concentrations showed an increasing enzyme activity up to a plateau starting at ∼0.25 μm adenosine in the absence of phosphate (Fig. 3A). The 0 and 50 mm phosphate curves followed each other at low adenosine concentrations (<0.05 μm), but the 50 mm curve continued to increase when the 0 mm phosphate curve bent off, resulting in higher Km and Vmax values. At high adenosine concentrations, the enzyme was inhibited as seen in Fig. 3B where a wider range of substrate concentrations is plotted with a logarithmic abscissa. Substrate inhibition usually follows the rules of uncompetitive inhibition described by the Equation 1, which has also been used to calculate substrate inhibition constants for the mammalian adenosine kinases (30Maj M. Singh B. Gupta R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), v=Vmax×A/(Km+A+(A2/Ki))(Eq. 1) where A = [adenosine]. By using Equation 1, a good fit was obtained for all data points except when the substrate concentration was 100 μm or above. The kinetic constants calculated from this experiment are shown in the figure legend (0 and 50 mm phosphate curves) and Table 1 (5 mm phosphate).

https://openalex.org/W2027884654,"Abstract The obligate intracellular human pathogenic bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis has evolved multiple mechanisms to circumvent the host immune system. Infected cells exhibit a profound resistance to the induction of apoptosis and down-regulate the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II molecules to evade the cytotoxic effect of effector immune cells. Here we demonstrate the down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) on the surface of infected cells. Interestingly, other members of the TNFR family such as TNFR2 and CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) were not modulated during infection, suggesting a selective mechanism underlying surface reduction of TNFR1. The observed effect was not due to reduced expression since the overall amount of TNFR1 protein was increased in infected cells. TNFR1 accumulated at the chlamydial inclusion and was shed by the infected cell into the culture supernatant. Receptor shedding depended on the infection-induced activation of the MEK-ERK pathway and the metalloproteinase TACE (TNFα converting enzyme). Our results point to a new function of TNFR1 modulation by C. trachomatis in controlling inflammatory signals during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2069746005,"K(+) efflux through voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels can attenuate the release of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormones by hyperpolarizing the membrane potential and attenuating Ca(2+) influx. Notably, direct interaction between Kv2.1 channels overexpressed in PC12 cells and syntaxin has recently been shown to facilitate dense core vesicle (DCV)-mediated release. Here, we focus on endogenous Kv2.1 channels and show that disruption of their interaction with native syntaxin after ATP-dependent priming of the vesicles by Kv2.1 syntaxin-binding peptides inhibits Ca(2+) -triggered exocytosis of DCVs from cracked PC12 cells in a specific and dose-dependent manner. The inhibition cannot simply be explained by the impairment of the interaction of syntaxin with its SNARE cognates. Thus, direct association between endogenous Kv2.1 and syntaxin enhances exocytosis and in combination with the Kv2.1 inhibitory effect to hyperpolarize the membrane potential, could contribute to the known activity dependence of DCV release in neuroendocrine cells and in dendrites where Kv2.1 commonly expresses and influences release."
https://openalex.org/W2050582664,"Epac1 is a cAMP-responsive exchange factor for the small G-protein Rap. It consists of a regulatory region containing a cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain and a catalytic region that activates Rap. In the absence of cAMP, access of Rap to the catalytic site is blocked by the regulatory region. We analyzed the conformational states of the CNB domain in the absence and in the presence of cAMP and cAMP analogues by NMR spectroscopy, resulting in the first direct insights into the activation mechanism of Epac. We prove that the CNB domain exists in equilibrium between the inactive and the active conformation, which is shifted by binding of cAMP. cAMP binding results in conformational changes in both the ligand binding pocket and the outer helical segments. We used two different cAMP antagonists that block these successive changes to elucidate the steps of this process. Highlighting the role of dynamics, the superactivator 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP induces similar conformational changes as cAMP but causes different internal mobility.

By transducing biochemical signals from extracellular cues into an intracellular response, biological switches play a crucial role in modulating signaling pathways and functions. One of the oldest stimuli, conserved from bacteria to mammals, is the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (1Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar).

In mammals, CNB domains are found in the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), in cyclic nucleotide-responsive ion channels, and in the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Epac. Upon cAMP binding, these proteins initiate diverse intracellular signaling events. Epac acts as a GEF for the small G-protein Rap (3Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 4Seino S. Shibasaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1303-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Small G-proteins cycle between a signaling-inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, with the latter exchange activity catalyzed by GEFs such as Epac. Rap itself is involved in cellular processes such as cell adhesion and junction formation (5Bos J.L. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 2004; 119: 615-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The combined data illustrate that CNB domains utilize a common mechanism to bind and sense cAMP (13Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Binding of the ligand induces conserved conformational changes within the domain that are translated in a specific way to activate the protein. This allows the CNB domain to act as a switch unit in such different biochemical processes as kinase activity or guanine nucleotide exchange activity. The core of the CNB domain consists of a β-sandwich that is flanked by the N-terminal helical bundle (NHB) and the C-terminal hinge helix connecting the lid region. The phosphate sugar moiety of cAMP interacts with the so-called phosphate binding cassette (PBC), consisting of two β-strands connected by a short one-turn helix and a loop (14Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Binding of cAMP induces tightening of the PBC, repositioning a critical leucine residue. This allows the hinge helix to move closer to the β-sandwich, bringing the lid region in direct contact with the base of the cyclic nucleotide, as well as initiating changes in the NHB. The active conformation is then stabilized by the interaction of the base with the lid (13Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).For Epac, the crystal structure of the inactive state of the protein revealed that the CNB domain sterically blocks the access of Rap to the catalytic site in the CDC25 homology domain, which is responsible for mediating the exchange activity (10Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The relative orientation between the CNB domain-containing regulatory region and the catalytic region is determined by two contact points, the switch board and the ionic latch. The ionic latch is formed by residues of the NHB and the CDC25 homology domain. The switchboard is localized at the connection between the C terminus of the CNB domain and the catalytic region, where the C-terminal strands of the CNB domain are assumed to form the lid in the ligand-bound conformation. This suggests that in the course of activation, the central β-sandwich moves closer to the hinge and the lid, thereby disrupting the interactions of the ionic latch (10Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).As there is little structural information on cAMP-bound Epac, we used NMR spectroscopy to investigate the CNB domain of Epac1. By titrating the cAMP ligand into the isolated domain, we provide insight on the nature of cAMP-induced conformational changes as well as the dynamics of the domain in solution. Using different cyclic nucleotide-based inhibitors, the stepwise mechanism of activation is delineated. Additionally, the role of ligand binding dynamics and the C-terminal hinge region is addressed with the super activator 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Isotope Labeling of the CNB Domain—The CNB domain of Epac1 (residues 169-318) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein from the pGEX4T vector (GE Healthcare). BL21 DE3 (Novagen) cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl (Sigma-Aldrich) as the sole nitrogen source for 15N and 3 g/liter [13C6]glucose as the sole carbon source for 15N/13C-labeled samples at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6-1.0. Protein production was induced at 20 °C by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 16 h the cells were harvested, resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol and eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 mm glutathione. Glutathione was removed by dialysis, and the glutathione S-transferase tag was cleaved by incubation with 40 units of thrombin (Serva) for 3 h at room temperature. The cleaved glutathione S-transferase was removed by running the sample over a glutathione column and the buffer then exchanged to 20 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol. Typical yields were 10-30 mg of protein/liter of culture.NMR Spectroscopy—Experiments were performed at 25 °C in the presence of 10% D2O. Protein concentration was typically 0.5 mm, unless stated otherwise. 1H frequencies were calibrated using the internal water signal, 15N and 13C frequencies using indirect referencing (15Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). Spectra were processed with NMRPipe (16Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11376) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Sparky. NMR data allowing spectral assignments were acquired using Bruker Avance 600 MHz with cryoprobe, Avance 700 MHz, and Avance 750 MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with 5-mm triple resonance probes. Backbone and side chain assignments of 1 mm cAMP-containing Epac1 CNB domain were established with [1H,13C]HSQC, [1H,15N]HSQC, the triple resonance experiments HN(CO)CA, HNCA, (H)CC(CO)NH, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, H(CCO)NH, and HBHA-(CO)NH, supplemented with H(C)CH-TOCSY, two-dimensional [1H,1H]NOESY, (H)CNH-NOESY, H(C)CH-NOESY, and NOESY-[15N]HSQC experiments. For the assignment of ligand-free Epac1 CNB domain the following experiments were used: [13C]HSQC and [15N]HSQC, HNCACB, HNCA, HNCO, (H)CC(CO)NH, HBHA(CO)NH, TOCSY-[15N]HSQC, NOESY-[15N]HSQC, and H(C)CH-TOCSY. All NMR experiments were recorded essentially as described (17Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. 2nd Ed. Protein NMR Spectroscopy, Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2007Google Scholar). The program TALOS (18Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) was used to assess the secondary structure elements of the ligand-free and cAMP-bound Epac1 CNB domain. Titration experiments were performed using a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer with cryoprobe on 15N-labeled Epac1 CNB domain NMR sample by stepwise addition of small aliquots of concentrated cAMP, Rp-cAMPS, N6-phenyl-cAMP, or 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP stock solutions (BioLog). Eight [1H,15N]HSQC spectra were recorded with increasing ligand concentrations of 0.5, 0.8, 1, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 μm.Proton-deuterium exchange experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer with cryoprobe. 15N-labeled Epac1 CNB domain NMR samples, either in the absence or presence of 1 mm cAMP, were lyophilized and resolved in 500 μl of D2O. In the course of 24 h, 150 short [1H,15N]HSQC experiments (∼9.75 min each) were recorded. The first spectrum was obtained after a dead time of 15 min. The time dependence of the peak intensity was fitted as single exponential decay using three-parameter curve fitting, followed by a 500-step Monte Carlo simulation by use of the program CurveFit to determine kex.RESULTSBoth the unbound and cAMP-bound forms of the CNB domain of Epac1 feature [1H,15N]HSQC spectra with a well dispersed 1H dimension, indicative of a folded protein (Fig. 1A). Using standard triple resonance methods, the backbone and side chain resonances of the protein were assigned. In the cAMP-free state, 67% of the backbone amide groups were assigned unambiguously and for the cAMP-bound state 85% (Fig. 1B). The lower percentage of assignment in the cAMP-free state is caused by both spectral overlap and missing peaks. These missing peaks imply the presence of internal dynamics on a μs-ms time scale in the absence of cAMP. Additionally, in the bound state a series of unambiguous nuclear Overhauser effects were assigned connecting the cAMP molecule with residues Val251 and Val259 (data not shown), demonstrating that cAMP is indeed bound to the protein.The secondary structure elements for both the unbound and cAMP-bound forms of Epac1 were determined using the chemical shift analysis program TALOS (18Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) and are in good agreement with the crystal structure of Epac2, demonstrating that the isolated CNB domain behaves similarly as in the full-length protein (9Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Overall, the secondary structure elements of the unbound and bound domains are highly similar, confirming that binding of cAMP does not induce global changes in the overall structure of the protein (Fig. 1B). However, cAMP binding does result in a shortening of the hinge helix, a clear indication that cAMP causes structural changes in the C-terminal region. Similarly, an induction of a kink in the hinge helix was observed for PKA upon activation (8Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This is in contradiction to modeling studies on Epac that suggested a cAMP-induced transition of the lid region into a helical structure (19Yu S. Fan F. Flores S.C. Mei F. Cheng X. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15318-15326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Brock M. Fan F. Mei F.C. Li S. Gessner C. Woods Jr., V.L. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32256-32263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Titration of cAMP to Epac1—The structural consequences of cAMP binding were assessed by titrating cAMP into the protein solution and monitoring changes in the [15N,1H]HSQC spectra, where each peak corresponds to a particular amino acid and thus provides a structural readout throughout the domain (Fig. 2A). Addition of cAMP produced changes throughout the spectrum, with the majority of peaks displaying slow exchange behavior (for example, residues His200 and Gln298 in Fig. 2A). Additionally, some peaks appeared upon ligand addition, suggesting a slow exchange where the residue in the absence of cAMP is either not detectable under the experimental conditions or located in a remote area of the spectrum (for example, residue Arg279 in Fig. 2A). For visualization, the observed chemical shift differences were mapped on the ligand-free crystal structure of the CNB domain of Epac2 with cAMP modeled in from the PKA crystal structure (Fig. 2B). A multitude of residues clustered around the cAMP molecule are affected. These residues are particularly localized in the PBC, which is in close proximity to the phosphate sugar moiety of cAMP, and in the sheet formed by the β-strands 2, 7, 4, and 5 (β-2-7-4-5-sheet), which is shielding one side of the cAMP molecule. A strong deshielding of residue Arg280 in the PBC, expected to be in close proximity to the phosphate moiety, is observed upon cAMP binding (Fig. 1A). These changes predominately reflect changes in the electronic environment induced by the presence of the cAMP molecule. It is interesting to note changes in regions more distant to the cAMP molecule, notably the NHB and the C-terminal hinge/lid region (Fig. 2B). Both regions are predicted to undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding (13Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The NMR data confirm that initial binding of cAMP is translated into more distal effects that lead to the activation of the protein.FIGURE 2cAMP-induced changes. A, overlay of [15N,1H]HSQC spectra recorded in the presence of 0, 10, and 500 μm cAMP. The chosen section is representative for the quality of the obtained spectra and shows the kinds of exchange behavior observed during the titration. B, the residues affected by cAMP were mapped on the second CNB domain of Epac2 taken from the crystal structure of the autoinhibited Epac2 (Protein Data Bank code 2bvy) (10Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The cAMP molecule shown in ball-and-stick representation was placed according to the cAMP-bound structure of PKA (Protein Data Bank code 1rgs) (6Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). C, for several residues, two alternative conformations were assigned in the absence of cAMP. One of these conformations corresponds to the cAMP-bound chemical shift. One example, residue His200 is shown during the course of titration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An Active Epac Population in the Absence of cAMP—In the ligand-free state, a second conformation was assigned for several residues (Figs. 1B and 2C). The second conformation has chemical shift values of its cAMP-bound-state counterparts, suggesting the presence of a static population of >20% of the active conformation as estimated from peak intensities (Fig. 2C). Most of these residues are clustered in the NHB. The observed second conformation confirms the hypothesis that Epac exists in a dynamic equilibrium between the inactive and active states, even in the absence of cAMP (21Rehmann H. Rueppel A.

Methods Enzymol. 2006; 407: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Proton-Deuterium Exchange—To assess the effects of cAMP binding on the stability and hydrogen bonding of Epac, proton-deuterium exchange was monitored by recording [15N,1H]HSQC spectra. A protein in solution samples several conformations, some of which allow backbone amide groups to undergo solvent exchange. A low exchange rate reflects strong hydrogen bonding of the corresponding residue. Residues undergoing slow exchange are found in the NHB and the central β-core, demonstrating that these parts of the protein act as stable units (Fig. 3A). Addition of cAMP results in only minor changes. However, increases in the protection of residues in the binding pocket are seen, for example Arg279, which is directly involved in binding to cAMP as evidenced by the crystallographic data from PKA (6Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 7Diller T.C. Xuong Madhusudan N.H.

Cell. 2004; 119: 615-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, residues outside the core binding pocket are also affected. Ile304 in the hinge helix gains protection, and Ala217, Leu219, and Phe221 in the loop connecting the NHB and β1 lose protection (Fig. 3, B-D). This demonstrates again that cAMP induces conformational changes in the NHB and the hinge helix and that the cAMP-bound state is a dynamic conformation.FIGURE 3Deuterium exchange in the presence and absence of cAMP. The exchange rate of the individual residues in the absence (A) and presence (B) of cAMP were plotted against the residue number. Gray bars represent residues for which the exchange reaction was completed within 900 s, the dead time of the experiment. Residues without a bar are either a proline or unassigned. C, the ratio of the exchange rates in the absence and presence of cAMP is plotted against the residue number. A value bigger than one indicates gain of protection and a value smaller than one indicates loss of protection in the presence of cAMP. Gray bars represent residues for which the exchange reaction either in the absence or the presence of cAMP was completed within the dead time of the experiment (900 s). To calculate the ratio, a kex of 0.005 s-1 was assumed for residues that underwent complete exchange within the dead time, so that the calculated ratio in these cases is underestimated. D, residues with an at least 4-fold gain or loss in protection were mapped onto the CNB domain of Epac2 in red and blue, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of cAMP Antagonists—Rp-cAMPS and N6-phenyl-cAMP (Fig. 4A) are competitive inhibitors of Epac that bind to Epac with similar affinity as cAMP but are unable to efficiently activate the protein (23Rehmann H. Schwede F. Doskeland S.O. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38548-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These analogues were used to separate effects attributed solely to binding of the ligand from those attributed to conformational changes resulting in activation.FIGURE 4Effects of competitive inhibitors. A, the chemical structures of Rp-cAMPS and N6-phenyl-cAMP are shown. Residues that undergo chemical shift changes upon titration with Rp-cAMPS and N6-phenyl-cAMP were mapped onto the structure of Epac2 (see Fig. 2). Residues with the same chemical shift changes as observed during the titration with cAMP are highlighted in orange and residues with different chemical shift changes in blue. B, the peaks for Glu196, Thr261, Ile303, and Thr187 are shown in the absence of ligand and the presence of cAMP, Rp-cAMPS, and N6-phenyl-cAMP and their chemical shifts compared. Glu196 and Thr187 are localized in the NHB, Thr261 in the β-2-7-4-5 sheet, and Ile303 in the hinge.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rp-cAMPS, where the equatorial phosphate oxygen of the phosphate that interacts with the PBC is replaced by a sulfur, was titrated into the CNB domain, and changes in the [15N,1H]HSQC spectra were mapped onto the domain structure (Fig. 4A). As with cAMP, most residues in the β-2-7-4-5 sheet are affected by the presence of Rp-cAMPS. Furthermore, the chemical shifts of these residues are comparable with the cAMP-bound shifts, indicating that Rp-cAMPS occupies the same or a very similar position in the binding pocket (for example, Thr261 in Fig. 4B). However, unlike cAMP, the PBC is barely affected by the presence of Rp-cAMPS. Similarly, fewer changes are observed for residues situated in the NHB or the hinge helix (for example Glu196 in Fig. 4B). The limited changes that are observed for the hinge helix are different from those induced by cAMP, as indicated by the different chemical shifts of the peaks (for example, Ile303 in Fig. 4B). Thus, the precise engagement of the PBC is a prerequisite for conformational changes in the hinge and the NHB.To further study the activation mechanism, the antagonist N6-phenyl-cAMP was used. With this analogue, the base is modified at the 6 position by the extension of a phenyl group, and therefore its structural effects on Epac should be distinct from Rp-cAMPS. N6-phenyl-cAMP induces changes in the β-2-7-4-5 sheet similar to those induced by cAMP and Rp-cAMPS, indicating the proper positioning of N6-phenyl-cAMP in the binding pocket (Fig. 4A; for example, Thr261 in Fig. 4B). However, unlike Rp-cAMPS, N6-phenyl-cAMP does affect residues of the PBC, initiating the first step in the activation process. Subsequently, much more extensive changes are observed in the NHB and hinge region than with Rp-cAMPS (for example, Thr187 in Fig. 4B). However, these changes are often different from those caused by cAMP, as evidenced by their different chemical shifts (for example, Ile303 in Fig. 4B). Thus, while the PBC adopts an active conformation and releases the steric restraint that prevents the movement of the hinge, the final active conformation is not properly stabilized due to the inability of N6-phenyl-cAMP to properly interact with the lid.Superactivation of Epac—To further explore ligand-induced activation of Epac, we studied 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, which induces higher activity than cAMP and hence acts as a superactivator of the protein (23Rehmann H.

Mapping 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-induced changes from the [15N,1H]HSQC spectra onto the Epac structure, it is clear that this compound affects similar regions of the CNB domain as cAMP, illustrating the common activated conformation produced by the two molecules (Fig. 5, A and B). However, the type of chemical exchange seen is quite different. These differences are particularly obvious for the hinge helix and the lid, as well as for parts of the PBC (Fig. 5B). Peaks that undergo slow exchange in the course of the titration with cAMP fail to appear during the titration with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (Fig. 5, A and B). These peaks are now in a conformational exchange whose time scale is undetectable in this NMR experiment, indicating that 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP differently affects the protein dynamics in this region. Therefore, while the previous inhibitors highlighted the role of proper structural rearrangements in activation, the superactivator, which induces a similar conformation as cAMP, suggests that dynamics also play a role in protein activation.FIGURE 5Effects of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. A, overlay of [15n-1H]HSQC spectra recorded in the presence of cAMP (black) or 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (red), with a magnification of a section indicated by the box. The chemical structure of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is shown next to the spectra. B, changes in residues upon titration with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP were mapped on the structure of Epac2 (see Fig. 2). Residues for which corresponding peaks disappear during the titration are shown in magenta.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study we analyzed the structural consequence of cAMP binding to the CNB domain of Epac and addressed the mechanism of antagonism as well as superactivation mediated by cAMP analogues. We demonstrated the successive nature of the agonist-induced conformational changes, experimentally validating a universal model by which CNB domains sense cAMP and translate the initial binding event to changes in the outer parts of the domain.Interestingly, in the absence of cAMP, a double conformation was assigned to several residues, some of which correspond to the active conformation. Indeed, previous biochemical studies suggested that Epac exists in equilibrium between an inactive and active conformation, whereby binding of cAMP shifts this equilibrium to the active state (22Rehmann H. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 407: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Based on the NMR peak intensity, the active conformation was estimated to be ∼20% of the molecules. This is more than suggested by the analysis of the"
https://openalex.org/W2054442403,"MAPK signaling cascades are evolutionally conserved. The bacterial effector, YopJ, uses the unique activity of Ser/Thr acetylation to inhibit the activation of the MAPK kinase (MKK) and prevent activation by phosphorylation. YopJ is also able to block yeast MAPK signaling pathways using this mechanism. Based on these observations, we performed a genetic screen to isolate mutants in the yeast MKK, Pbs2, that suppress YopJ inhibition. One suppressor contains a mutation in a conserved tyrosine residue and bypasses YopJ inhibition by increasing the basal activity of Pbs2. Mutations on the hydrophobic face of the conserved G α-helix in the kinase domain prevent both binding and acetylation by YopJ. Corresponding mutants in human MKKs showed that they are conserved not only structurally, but also functionally. These studies reveal a conserved binding site found on the superfamily of MAPK kinases while providing insight into the molecular interactions required for YopJ inhibition."

Although GRK2 has been extensively investigated, the function of cardiac GRK3 remains unknown. Thus, in this study cardiac function of GRK3 was investigated in transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-restricted expression of a competitive inhibitor of GRK3, i.e. the carboxyl-terminal plasma membrane targeting domain of GRK3 (GRK3ct). Cardiac myocytes from Tg-GRK3ct mice displayed significantly enhanced agonist-stimulated α1-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of ERK1/2 versus cardiac myocytes from nontransgenic littermate control (NLC) mice consistent with inhibition of GRK3. Tg-GRK3ct mice did not display alterations of cardiac mass or left ventricular dimensions compared with NLC mice.

Thus, inhibition of GRK3 apparently reduces tolerance to elevation of preload. In conclusion, inhibition of cardiac GRK3 causes hypertension because of hyperkinetic myocardium and increased cardiac output relying at least partially on cardiac myocyte α1-adrenergic receptor hyper-responsiveness.

The principal action of GRKs is as catalysts of phosphorylation of agonist-activated GPCRs leading to desensitization of receptor function. Seven G protein-coupled receptor kinase isoforms (GRK1–7), each encoded by a separate gene, have been cloned and characterized (1Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Four of these have been reported to be expressed in myocardial tissue, i.e. GRK2 (βARK1), GRK3 (βARK2), GRK5, and GRK6. A report from our laboratory suggested functional diversity among the different GRKs in the heart based on the findings of distinct differences of distribution of the GRK isoforms among the cellular elements of the heart (2Vinge L.E. Øie E. Andersson Y. Grøgaard H.K. Andersen G.Ø. Attramadal H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2490-H2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, myocardial expression of GRK3 in several species (man, porcine, and rat) was found to be restricted to cardiac myocytes (CM). GRK2 and GRK5, on the other hand, were ubiquitously expressed among the cellular elements of myocardial tissue. Although GRK2 was predominantly expressed in microvascular endothelial cells, similar levels of GRK2 and GRK3 were found in fully differentiated rat CMs (3Vinge L.E. Andressen K.W. Attramadal T. Andersen G.Ø. Ahmed M.S. Peppel K. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Levy F.O. Skomedal T. Osnes J.B. Attramadal H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unique to GRK2 and GRK3, which constitute a separate subgroup within the GRK family, is a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain) that targets these kinases to the membrane and cytosolic surface of their cognate receptors (4Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). These PH domains provide binding interfaces with liberated Gβγ subunits and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphates at the plasma membrane and may also directly interact with the receptor (6Gan X.Q.

Thus, the GPCR substrate specificities of GRK2 and GRK3 may be determined by binding interfaces with both Gβγ and receptor. Several studies have employed mini-genedirected expression of a carboxyl-terminal polypeptide fragment of GRK2, i.e. GRK2ct (βARK1ct), which confers competitive inhibition of endogenous GRK2 (7Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 8Rockman H.A. Choi D.J. Akhter S.A. Jaber M.

Among these are studies that demonstrate that GRK2 controls β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) signaling in CMs. Although GRK2-mediated regulation of β-ARs in CMs has been extensively studied, the substrate specificities of GRK2 and GRK3 have until recently been poorly understood. The diverging primary structures of the carboxyl-terminal regions of GRK2 and GRK3 recently led us to investigate potential differences between GRK2 and GRK3 with respect to substrate specificities at GPCRs in CMs. By means of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GRK2 or GRK3, or their respective competitive inhibitors, i.e. GRK2ct or GRK3ct in CMs, the substrate specificities of GRK2 and GRK3 at GPCRs that have key roles in regulation of cardiac function were unraveled (3Vinge L.E. Andressen K.W. Attramadal T. Andersen G.Ø. Ahmed M.S. Peppel K. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Levy F.O. Skomedal T. Osnes J.B. Attramadal H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An important observation in this study was that GRK2ct mirrored the specificity of GRK2 whereas GRK3ct mirrored the specificity of GRK3. Briefly, the novel findings uncovered in these studies were that GRK3 has substantially higher potency and efficacy than GRK2 at endogenous endothelin receptors (ET-R) and α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-AR) on CMs. At cardiac β1-AR, however, GRK3ct efficacy appeared much weaker than for the ET-R (3Vinge L.E. Andressen K.W. Attramadal T. Andersen G.Ø. Ahmed M.S. Peppel K. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Levy F.O. Skomedal T. Osnes J.B. Attramadal H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, GRK3 emerges as a primary regulator of ET-R and α1-AR signaling, i.e. signaling pathways involved in regulation of cardiac contractility, growth, and survival signaling. Indeed, these findings are consistent with studies of hybrid transgenic mice in which cardiac-specific overexpression of GRK3, but not that of GRK2, was found to attenuate myocardial hypertrophy in mice with concomitant cardiac expression of a constitutively active mutant of α1B-AR (9Eckhart A.D. Duncan S.J. Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, myocardial overexpression of GRK3 did not invoke alterations of cardiac β-AR signaling either in vitro or in vivo (10Iaccarino G. Rockman H.A. Shotwell K.F. Tomhave E.D. Koch W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 44: H1298-H1306Google Scholar). Although cardiac-restricted overexpression of GRK3 has provided some novel insights into the function of GRK3, strategies aimed at inhibiting endogenous GRK3 are imperative. In the case of GRK2, competitive inhibition of endogenous activities by cardiac-restricted expression of the carboxyl-terminal region of the kinase (GRK2ct/βARK1ct) has been extensively investigated. These studies have revealed that GRK2 plays an essential role in the regulation of cardiac β-adrenergic receptor function. Nevertheless, many of the conclusions from these studies are limited by the fact that we do not know to what extent expression of the GRK2ct/βARK1ct peptide confers selective inhibition of endogenous GRK2. Yet employment of a similar principle for inhibition of endogenous GRK3, i.e. expression of the carboxyl-terminal region of GRK3, is an intriguing strategy in terms of unraveling selective functions of the carboxyl-terminal fragment of GRK2 and GRK3. Furthermore, neither transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of GRK3 nor GRK3 knock-out mice were reported to display a distinct cardiac phenotype (10Iaccarino G. Rockman H.A. Shotwell K.F. Tomhave E.D. Koch W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 44: H1298-H1306Google Scholar, 11Walker J.K.L. Peppel K. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron R.G. Fisher J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R1214-R1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, rigorous investigation of cardiac structure and function in mice with cardiac-restricted inhibition of GRK3 is clearly needed. In this study we have generated transgenic mice with CM-specific expression of a presumptive competitive inhibitor of endogenous GRK3, i.e. GRK3ct, to investigate the physiological function of myocardial GRK3. Inhibition of endogenous GRK3 results in a surprising phenotype with elevated blood pressure because of hyperkinetic myocardium and thus uncovers novel important roles of GRK3 in the regulation of cardiac function and maintenance of cardiovascular function. Generation of Transgenic GRK3ct Mice—A mini-gene construct (GRK3ct) encoding the carboxyl terminus of rat GRK3 (GenBank™ accession number M87855; amino acids 495–687) under control of the mouse α-myosin heavy chain promoter was constructed. The GRK3ct cDNA was preceded by the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of transcription and flanked at the 3′-end by SV40 splice and poly(A)+ signals. This DNA construct was microinjected into fertilized oocytes from C56BL/6-CBA hybrid mice before implantation of the oocytes in pseudopregnant mice. Incorporation of transgene in the resultant offspring was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA using an SV40 cDNA probe (SV40 splice and poly(A)+ DNA; nucleotides 3792–4094 of pcDNA1 plasmid (Invitrogen)). Two transgenic founder lines, i.e. Tg-GRK3ct (1Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) and Tg-GRK3ct (2Vinge L.E. Øie E. Andersson Y. Grøgaard H.K. Andersen G.Ø. Attramadal H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2490-H2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (demonstrating the highest myocardial expression of GRK3ct by Western blot analysis), were established and propagated. The founder mice (F0) were backbred with C56BL/6-CBA hybrid mice to generate the F1 generation. Further expansion was performed by mating transgenic siblings within the F1 generation. Nontransgenic littermate controls (NLC) were generated from noninjected C56BL/6-CBA mice (siblings of the mice employed for pronuclear injection) and bred similar to the transgenic lines, i.e. similar background as Tg-GRK3ct mice. Unless otherwise indicated, mice of the Tg-GRK3ct(1) line were employed in all experiments. Histochemical Analysis of Myocardial Tissue and Immunohistochemical Analysis of Myocardial GRK2 and GRK3—Myocardial tissue sections (male, 9 months) were stained with hematoxylin/eosin or picrosirius red (van Gieson's solution). Immunohistochemical analysis of myocardial distribution of endogenous GRK2 or GRK3 was performed using purified anti-GRK2- or anti-GRK3-specific IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (2Vinge L.E. Øie E. Andersson Y. Grøgaard H.K. Andersen G.Ø. Attramadal H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2490-H2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of GRK3ct mRNA and Peptide Expression—To assess the specificity of α-myosin heavy chain promoter-driven expression of GRK3ct, several tissues from Tg-GRK3ct mice (male, 3 months) were sampled for isolation of total RNA and subsequent Northern blot analysis using the 32P-labeled SV40 cDNA probe described above. Lysates of isolated CMs from Tg-GRK3ct and nontransgenic littermate control (NLC) mice (male, 3 months) were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously using anti-GRK3-specific IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (2Vinge L.E. Øie E. Andersson Y. Grøgaard H.K. Andersen G.Ø. Attramadal H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2490-H2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Echocardiographic Examination—Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using the Vivid 7 System (GE Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway) and a 13-MHz linear array transducer. Two-dimensional guided M-mode recordings of the left ventricle (LV) in the short axis view at the level of the papillary muscle were obtained, and interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness at end-diastole, respectively, were measured. Internal LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters (LVEDD and LVESD, respectively) were recorded as the largest anterio-posterior diameter. Fractional shortening was determined as fractional shortening = (LVEDD - LVESD)/LVEDD. All echocardiographic recordings were performed under sedation with midazolam (6.25 mg/kg subcutaneously). All dimensions were analyzed off line by using the EchoPac software analysis program (GE Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway) by a trained specialist who had no knowledge of the study groups. Tail-cuff Plethysmography—Tail-cuff plethysmographic recording of blood pressure was performed with a system for noninvasive digital recording of blood pressure in mice (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) (12Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Smithies O. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The mice (male, 3 and 9 months) were familiarized with the procedure by daily training sessions for 7 days before recording of blood pressure in order to reduce stress and the associated variability that may occur upon immobilization of mice in the restraining units required to perform tail-cuff plethysmography. The recorded blood pressure was average of seven successful readings from sessions on 3 consecutive days. Telemetry—The components of the radiotelemetry system (Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN) have been described previously (13Mills P.A. Huntsman D.A. Brockway B.P. Weirs L.M. Gleeman A.J.M. Schwartz R.S. Kramer K. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1537-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Miniature radiotelemetric pressure transducers (PhysioTel PA-C20) were implanted in the aortic arch via catheterization of the left carotid artery in male (3 months) Tg-GRK3ct mice (n = 7) and corresponding NLC mice (n = 6) as described previously (14Buts G.M. Davisson R.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 5: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The mice were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle and allowed to recover for 10 days before recording of blood pressure, and other variables were commenced. Data were subsequently analyzed by the analysis software module (Dataquest A.R.T. 2.3 Gold, Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN). Isolation of CMs and Maintenance of Primary Cultures—CMs were isolated from Tg-GRK3ct and NLC hearts (male, 3 months) by Ca2+-free retrograde perfusion and enzymatic digestion as described previously (15O'Connell T.D. Rodrigo M.C. Simpson P.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 357: 271-296PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated CMs were plated in wells pre-coated with mouse laminin (Invitrogen) and maintained in Joklik's minimum essential medium supplemented with 25 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.0, 23.8 mmol/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.6 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter BDM, 1 mmol/liter dl-carnitine, 10 mmol/liter creatine, 20 mmol/liter taurine, 0.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 μmol/liter insulin, and 0.1 nmol/liter thyroxin in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Assay of Receptor-generated Responses in Isolated CMs—Six hours before assay of receptor-generated responses, the cell culture medium was replaced with minimum essential medium containing the supplements indicated above except insulin and thyroxin. The cells were subsequently stimulated with agonists (100 nmol/liter endothelin-1, 5 min; 100 nmol/liter angiotensin II, 5 min; 1 μmol/liter isoproterenol, 5 min; or 10 μmol/liter phenylephrine, 15 min). In the case of phenylephrine stimulation, minimum essential medium was also supplemented with 1 μmol/liter timolol. The assays were stopped at the indicated time points, and cells were harvested in sample buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, 1 mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, and 1 mmol/liter phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (2Vinge L.E. Øie E. Andersson Y. Grøgaard H.K. Andersen G.Ø. Attramadal H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2490-H2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The filter membranes were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phospho-ERK1/2-specific IgG (anti-phosphothreonine 202/phosphotyrosine 204 ERK1/2, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) or anti-phosphoserine 16 phospholamban IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm similar levels of total ERK1/2 and total phospholamban, parallel filter membranes were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-ERK1/2 IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-phospholamban IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cardiac Responses to Continuous Exposure to α1-AR or β1-AR Agonists—Tg-GRK3ct and NLC mice (male, 9 months) were randomized to continuous infusion of phenylephrine (Sigma; 170 μmol·kg-1·day-1 subcutaneously, i.e. 30 mg·kg-1·day-1 subcutaneously), isoproterenol hydrochloride (120 mg·kg-1·day-1 subcutaneously), or vehicle (saline) for 14 days (n = 10 mice in each treatment group for both Tg-GRK3ct and NLC mice) delivered by subcutaneously implanted micro-osmotic pumps (Alzet®). The dose of phenylephrine employed was based on previous reports and was verified in pilot experiments to be a subpressor dose (16Keys J.R. Greene E.A. Koch W.J. Eckhart A.D. Hypertension. 2002; 40: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Blood pressure was monitored by tail-cuff plethysmography at day 0, 7, and 14, and echocardiography was performed at day 0 and 14 after implantation of the micro-osmotic pumps. Analysis of Contractility of Isolated Papillary Muscles—Tg-GRK3ct and NLC mice (male, 3 months) were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital (10 mg intraperitoneally) and euthanized by excision of the heart. The aorta was cannulated, and the heart was subjected to retrograde perfusion with relaxing buffer (118.3 mmol/liter NaCl, 3.0 mmol/liter KCl, 0.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 4.0 mmol/liter MgSO4, 2.4 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 24.9 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 10.0 mmol/liter glucose, 2.2 mmol/liter mannitol) containing 20 mmol/liter BDM and equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to pH 7.4 at 31 °C. The posterior LV papillary muscle was ligated at each end, carefully excised and mounted in organ bath, and allowed to adapt for 20 min before BDM was washed out. Ca2+ was gradually increased to 1.8 mmol/liter and Mg2+ lowered to 1.2 mmol/liter. The muscles were field-stimulated with alternating polarity at 1 Hz with impulses of 5-ms duration and current about 20% above individual threshold (10–15 mA, determined in each experiment). The isometrically contracting muscles were stretched to the maximum of their length-tension curve. The force was recorded and analyzed as described previously (17Andersen G.Ø. Qvigstad E. Schiander I. Aass H. Osnes J.B. Skomedal T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1471-H1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After equilibration in the presence of prazosin (0.1 μmol/liter), isoproterenol was added directly to the organ baths at increasing concentrations until supramaximal concentration of agonist was obtained with respect to inotropic response. Signal averaged contraction-relaxation cycles were calculated for the different experimental periods and used to determine the inotropic response expressed as increase in (dF/dt)max at increasing concentrations of isoproterenol. Analysis of Cardiac Function in Vivo and ex Vivo—In vivo cardiac function was determined as described elsewhere (18Georgakopoulos D. Mitzner W.A. Chen C.H. Byrne B.J. Millar H.D. Hare J.M. Kass D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1416-H1422PubMed Google Scholar) after trans-carotid catheterization of the LV of anesthetized Tg-GRK3ct and NLC (male, 3 months) mice using a Millar pressure-conductance catheter (SPR-853, Millar Instruments, Houston, TX). The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1% isoflurane) and pressure-volume parameters were recorded at heart rate stabilized above 450 beats/min. Analyses of cardiac function in ex vivo perfused (working mode) hearts from Tg-GRK3ct and NLC mice (male, 9 months) were obtained by inserting the catheter into the LV via the apex. All hearts were electrically paced (8 Hz) and pressure-volume parameters analyzed at different filling pressures (5–17.5 mm Hg) according to a previously described protocol with minor modifications (19How O.J. Aasum E. Kunnathu S. Severson D.L. Myhre E.S.P. Larsen T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H2979-H2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Echocardiographic alterations from starting point to end point in the phenylephrine infusion study were determined by two-tailed paired Student's t test, followed by two-tailed nonpaired Student's t test to assess intergroup differences. In the ex vivo perfused working heart experiments, dependent variables were assessed by two-way analysis of variance followed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni's test was applied in the case of multiple comparisons. All other experiments were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. All data are presented as mean ± S.E., p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Distribution of GRK2 and GRK3 Immunoreactivities in Mouse Myocardial Tissue—As demonstrated in Fig. 1, GRK2 immunostaining was found predominantly in the endothelial lining of the microvasculature (middle panel), whereas GRK3 immunoreactivity appeared restricted to CMs (right panel). No immunostaining with nonimmune IgG could be detected (Fig. 1, left panel). Cardiac-specific Expression of GRK3ct in Transgenic Mice—Expression of GRK3ct mRNA (Fig. 2A) could only be detected in myocardial tissue from transgenic mice. Similarly, Western blot analysis revealed expression of GRK3ct only in CMs of Tg-GRK3ct mice (Fig. 2B). The contents of GRK3ct in CMs from the two transgenic lines Tg-GRK3ct(1) and Tg-GRK3ct(2) were similar and estimated by quantitative Western blot analysis to be 1–2 pmol of GRK3ct/mg of CM protein (data not shown; for methodology, see Ref. 3Vinge L.E. Andressen K.W. Attramadal T. Andersen G.Ø. Ahmed M.S. Peppel K. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Levy F.O. Skomedal T. Osnes J.B. Attramadal H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Characterization of the Phenotype of GRK3ct Transgenic Mice—Tg-GRK3ct mice had normal appearance, and no differences in body weight of Tg-GRK3ct mice and corresponding NLC mice were detected at any age group. Furthermore, no differences in mortality of Tg-GRK3ct versus NLC mice were detected within the initial observation period of 12 months. No significant differences in heart weight to body weight ratios (mg/g) could be discerned between NLC and Tg-GRK3ct mice (3.54 ± 0.08 versus 3.64 ± 0.10 for NLC versus Tg-GRK3ct, respectively). The latter observation was corroborated by echocardiographic analysis demonstrating similar end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness in Tg-GRK3ct mice and NLC mice (Table 1). However, 3-month-old Tg-GRK3ct mice displayed increased fractional shortening as compared with age-matched NLC mice (Table 1). Histological analysis of myocardial tissue sections (hematoxylin/eosin staining) did not reveal overt differences of myocardial structure at any age group (Fig. 3, A–D). Furthermore, staining with picrosirius red (van Gieson's solution) as shown in Fig. 3, E and F, did not disclose quantitative differences of extracellular matrix contents as determined by morphometric analysis.TABLE 1Blood pressure, heart rate, and echocardiographic parameters of male age-matched Tg-GRK3ct and NLC mice (3 and 9 months of age) Values are means ± S.E.; Tg-GRK3ct versus NLC mice. bpm indicates beats/min.3 months9 monthsNLCTg-GRK3ctNLCTg-GRK3ctTail-cuff plethysmographyn = 12n = 11n = 40n = 39 BP systolic, mm Hg118.3 ± 4.7136.8 ± 3.6ap < 0.05119.8 ± 3.1130.8 ± 3.0bp < 0.01 BP mean, mm Hg99.7 ± 4.1110.5 ± 3.5ap < 0.0595.6 ± 3.3104.9 ± 3.3bp < 0.01 Heart rate, bpm574 ± 14527 ± 16523 ± 8529 ± 11Echocardiographyn = 26n = 32n = 19n = 20 LVEDD, mm3.0 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.14.2 ± 0.14.4 ± 0.1 LVESD, mm1.8 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.1 IVST, mm0.82 ± 0.020.82 ± 0.021.04 ± 0.031.10 ± 0.02 Fractional shortening, %41.2 ± 1.146.2 ± 1.2bp < 0.0140.1 ± 1.541.0 ± 1.6a p < 0.05b p < 0.01 Open table in a new tab Analysis of Blood Pressure and Heart Rate in Conscious Mice—Analysis of blood pressure in conscious mice by tail-cuff plethysmography revealed significantly increased systolic blood pressure in Tg-GRK3ct mice as compared with NLC mice at both 3 and 9 months of age (Table 1). Similar elevations of systolic blood pressure were found in both GRK3ct transgenic lines. Blood pressure was elevated despite no alterations of heart rate in Tg-GRK3ct versus NLC mice. Radiotelemetric recording of blood pressure confirmed elevated blood pressure in Tg-GRK3ct compared with NLC mice, with normal diurnal variations in both groups (Fig. 4). Both diastolic and systolic blood pressures were significantly elevated in Tg-GRK3ct versus NLC mice despite no significant alterations of heart rate and activity (Table 2).

https://openalex.org/W2119692683,"Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is a key enzyme of sphingolipid biosynthesis and catalyzes the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent decarboxylative condensation reaction of l-serine with palmitoyl-CoA to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine. The binding of l-serine alone to SPT leads to the formation of the external aldimine but does not produce a detectable amount of the quinonoid intermediate.

NMR studies showed that the hydrogen-deuterium exchange at Cα of l-serine is very slow in the SPT-l-serine external aldimine complex, but the rate is 100-fold increased by the addition of S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA, showing a remarkable substrate synergism in SPT. In addition, the observation that the nonreactive palmitoyl-CoA facilitated α-deprotonation indicates that the α-deprotonation takes place before the Claisen-type C–C bond formation, which is consistent with the accepted mechanism of the α-oxamine synthase subfamily enzymes. Structural modeling of both the SPT-l-serine external aldimine complex and SPT-l-serine–palmitoyl-CoA ternary complex suggests a mechanism in which the binding of palmitoyl-CoA to SPT induced a conformation change in the PLP-l-serine external aldimine so that the Cα–H bond of l-serine becomes perpendicular to the plane of the PLP-pyridine ring and is favorable for the α-deprotonation. The model also proposed that the two alternative hydrogen bonding interactions of His159 with l-serine and palmitoyl-CoA play an important role in the conformational change of the external aldimine.

The identification of a new third SPT subunit, SPTLC3, and an octameric SPT structure model have been proposed (11Hornemann T. Richard S. Rutti M.F. Wei Y. von Eckardstein A. J. Biol.

However, further studies of the SPT reaction mechanism have not been carried out, because the instability and the hydrophobic nature of eukaryotic SPTs have precluded obtaining a sufficient amount of the enzyme for detailed observations of the reaction (13Ikushiro H.

These bacterial SPTs show about 30% identity in the amino acid sequence with eukaryotic SPT subunit proteins and conserve the amino acid residues of eukaryotic SPTs assumed to be involved in catalysis. All of the bacterial SPTs were successfully overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified as water-soluble active homodimers. Bacterial SPTs are considered to be a prototype of the eukaryotic membrane-bound enzymes, and this system was a major breakthrough that provided the first detailed mechanistic studies of the SPT reaction. The recent elucidation of a high resolution crystal structure of the S. paucimobilis SPT is expected to boost the structural/functional analysis of the catalytic reaction of this enzyme (17Yard B.A. Carter L.G. Johnson K.A. Overton I.M. Dorward M. Liu H. McMahon S.A. Oke M. Puech D. Barton G.J. Naismith J.H. Campopiano D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 870-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Fig. 1 shows the proposed reaction mechanisms of SPT. The first step of the SPT reaction cycle is the binding of the amino acid substrate l-serine to the enzyme and the formation of the external aldimine (II). In a previous paper (18Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1082-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we spectroscopically and kinetically analyzed this step using the purified SPT, l-serine, and its analogues. Through the study, it was found that the α-carboxyl group of the substrate l-serine is important for the recognition by the enzyme, and the Michaelis complex of SPT and l-serine readily undergoes transaldimination to form the external aldimine. As generally observed for the PLP-dependent enzymes, the formation of the quinonoid intermediate (carbanion) from the external aldimine is the critical step in the reaction cycle. In the early studies using a yeast cell free system, two contradictory mechanisms for the KDS formation have been proposed: formation of the quinonoid intermediate (A-III) by decarboxylation of the substrate l-serine, followed by acylation (A) and formation of the quinonoid intermediate (B-III) by α-deprotonation of l-serine, followed by acylation and subsequent decarboxylation (B) (19Braun P.E.

According to the report by Krisnangkura and Sweeley (21Krisnangkura K. Sweeley C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1597-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that deuterium was introduced into the α-position of KDS during the reaction in D2O using rat liver microsomes, mechanism B has been thought to be more appropriate. However, considering the microscopic reversibility at the equilibrium between VI and B-V, the introduction of deuterium into the C2 position of KDS is possible even if the reaction proceeds via mechanism A. Therefore, the above-mentioned deuterium exchange experiment does not deny mechanism A, and it has been elusive which mechanism operates in the formation of KDS.In this paper, we specifically studied the regulation of the α-deprotonation of the amino acid substrate l-serine and the involvement of the second substrate palmitoyl-CoA. We investigated using 1H NMR to study the exchange of the α-proton of l-serine with the solvent in the presence and absence of S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA, the structural analogue of palmitoyl-CoA. The results, together with the spectroscopic and kinetic studies, clearly demonstrated the presence of “substrate synergism,” in which the α-proton of l-serine is activated by the binding of the second substrate palmitoyl-CoA. Molecular modeling of SPT complexed with l-serine and palmitoyl-CoA provided a plausible mechanism consistent with the experimental findings.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Palmitoyl-CoA was obtained from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside and coenzyme A were from Sigma. The PD-10 columns were from Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare. E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS and plasmid pET21b were from Novagen. All other chemicals were of the highest commercially available grade.Expression and Purification of SPT—By the PCR amplification using pET21b/SPT1mod (18Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1082-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as the template, the eight amino acid residues from Ala2 to Pro9 of the SPT gene were deleted, and new restriction sites, NdeI and HindIII, were introduced into the gene at the translation initiation and termination sites, respectively. The mutation of His159 to phenylalanine (H159F) was introduced into the SPT gene by two-step PCR using the following mutagenic primers: 5′-GACTGTACGGAATTGCATATGACCGAAGCCGCCGCTCAGCCCCACGC-3′ (forward1), 5′-CCTCGACGCGACAGCTTTGCGTCGATCTATGACG-3′ (forward2), 5′-CGTCATAGATCGACGCAAAGCTGTCGGCGTCGAGG-3′ (reverse1), 5′-GACTGTACGGTCGACTCAGCCGATGACGCCGACCGCGCGG-3′ (reverse2) (mutated bases are italicized). As the first step, the two DNA fragments encoding Met1–Asp164 and Leu154–Gly420 of SPT were PCR-amplified using the primer pairs of forward1-reverse1 and forward2-reverse2, respectively, against pET21b/SPT1mod. Then the full-length SPT gene having the H159F mutation and the restriction site of NdeI or HindIII at each end was synthesized by the second PCR amplification against the mixture of former PCR products using the primer pair of forward1-reverse2. Each modified SPT gene was treated with both NdeI and HindIII, purified, and ligated into pET21b. Then these recombinant plasmids were used to transform the E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Expression of the protein was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside and continued for 6 h at 37 °C. The recombinant enzyme was purified as previously described (14Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18249-18256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The expression level of the N-terminal deleted construct was lower than that of the full-length SPT, but the activity and the physical characteristics of the purified enzyme were not significantly changed as summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of purified SPT at 25 °CKm(Ser)Km(palmitoyl-CoA)kcatmmmin-1Wild type SPT6.2 ± 0.61.0 ± 0.141.5 ± 1.7SPT_del93.5 ± 0.61.2 ± 0.148.2 ± 2.6 Open table in a new tab Synthesis of S-(2-Oxoheptadecyl)-CoA—1-Chloroheptadecan-2-one was synthesized from tetradecyl bromide and 1-chloro-2-methoxy-ethane. S-(2-Oxoheptadecyl)-CoA (Fig. 2) was synthesized from 1-chloroheptadecan-2-one and coenzyme A according to the method described by Rudnick et al. (22Rudnick D.A. McWherter C.A. Rocque W.J. Lennon P.J. Getman D.P. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9732-9739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rough product (70% purity) was purified using a Megabond Elute C18 cartridge (Varian), and then the eluate from the column was evaporated and freeze-dried. A final product of 410 mg was obtained from 800 mg of 1-chloroheptadecan-2-one (38.7% yield). The purity was determined to be 96% by high pressure liquid chromatography using a SUMIPAX ODS A-212 (5-mm) column (3.9-mm inner diameter × 150 mm; Sumika Chemical Analysis Service, Osaka). The chemical structure of the synthesized compound was confirmed by mass spectroscopy and 1H NMR: electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (on ThermoQuest LCQ) 1044 [(M + H)+]; fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (on JEOL SX102A) 1044[(M + H)+], 1038[(M-Li + 2H)+], 1032[(M-2Li + 3H)+]; 1H NMR (D2O, 400 MHz on a Varian UNITY 400) δ 0.70, 0.88 (6H, –CH(OH)–C(CH3)2–), 0.86 (3H, CH3CH2–), 3.42 (2H, –S–CH2–CO–), 6.09 (1H, C1′-H of adenosine), 8.05 (1H, C2), 8.46 (1H, C8-H of purine).FIGURE 2Structures of S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA (A) and palmitoyl-CoA (B).

The stopped-flow spectrophotometry was performed using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV system (Leatherhead, UK) at 25 °C. The dead time was 2.3 ms under a gas pressure of 500 kilopascals. The time-resolved spectra were collected by the SX.18MV system equipped with a photodiode array accessory and the XScan (version 1.08) control software. The absorption changes were analyzed using the program ProK-II (Applied Photophysics). The buffer solution for the spectrometric measurements contained 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. SPT was equilibrated with this buffer by gel filtration using a PD-10 (Sephadex G-25) column prior to the measurements.NMR Samples and Spectral Measurements—For the NMR spectroscopy, all exchangeable hydrogens of the enzyme, the ligands, and the buffer base were replaced with deuterium. Known amounts of the buffer base were dissolved in D2O and freeze-dried. After repeating this treatment twice, the buffer solutions were reconstituted in D2O. l-Serine, d-serine, and S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA were also subjected to the same pretreatment. They were each dissolved in 50 mm potassium pyrophosphate buffer (D2O, pH 7.5). SPT was equilibrated twice with deuterium-substituted buffer using a PD-10 column.The 1H NMR spectra were measured in Wilmad 5-mm NMR tubes kept at 23 °C by a Varian UNITY 400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz. A flip angle of 20° with a relaxation delay time of 5 s was used. To obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio, an exponential window function for 0.2- or 0.5-Hz line-broadening factor was applied to the free induction decays of NMR measurements. Chemical shifts are expressed as ppm relative to an external standard of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-d4.Structural Modeling—The modeling of S. paucimobilis SPT on the crystal structure of Rhodobacter capsulatus 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) complexed with succinyl-CoA (Protein Data Bank code 1BWO) was carried out using MOE (version 2005.06; Chemical Computing Group, Montréal, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amino acid sequence of SPT (GenBank™ number AB055142) was aligned to that of R. capsulatus ALAS (GenBank™ P18709) using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix with the gap start and gap extend penalties set to 7 and 1, respectively. The SPT sequence is slightly longer than that of ALAS, and these two sequences have 34% identity. After the alignment, the residues of SPT were fitted to the coordinates of subunits D and E of ALAS. Ten intermediates were generated using a coarse minimization, and the best intermediate was chosen for subsequent studies. The model consists of the residues Arg22– Ala415 of S. paucimobilis SPT. The N-terminal 21 and C-terminal 5 residues were not modeled. The cis peptide bonds between Gly149 and Glu150 of chain 2 and that between Arg319 and Glu320 of chain 1, which were considered to be artifacts during the modeling, were changed to trans and were locally energy-minimized. The crystal structure of ALAS (subunits D and E) was superimposed on the model, and by subtracting the ALAS protein, PLP and succinyl-CoA were incorporated into the SPT model. These ligand structures were used to model the PLP-l-serine aldimine and palmitoyl-CoA, respectively. The C3–C4–C4′–Nζ and C4′–Nα–Cα–H dihedral angles of the PLP-l-serine aldimine were set to 180 and 90°, respectively, so that the conformation resembles those of the external aldimine of most PLP enzymes that activates the α-proton. The aliphatic group of palmitoyl-CoA was extended from C3 of succinyl-CoA using the Molecular Builder of MOE. Two structures, one with the PLP-l-serine aldimine and the other with the PLP-l-serine aldimine plus palmitoyl-CoA, were energy-minimized using the MMFF94x force field with all of the atoms of SPT and the ligands allowed to move.Other Methods—The SPT activity was measured according to the previously described methods with minor modification (14Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18249-18256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted on silica gel 60 HPTLC plate (Merck), and [3-14C]KDS was separated from l-[3-14C]serine with a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 2 n NH4OH (40:10:1, v/v/v). The radioactivity of each KDS spot was quantified by a BAS2500 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan), using the intensity of the authentic l-[3-14C]serine. The protein concentration during the purification procedure was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The protein concentration of the purified SPT was spectrophotometrically determined using the molar extinction coefficient of 2.83 × 104 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm for the PLP form of the enzyme (14Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18249-18256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out using the SDS-Tris system with a 10% polyacrylamide gel according to the procedure described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar).RESULTSGeneration of the Quinonoid Intermediate from the External Aldimine by S-(2-Oxoheptadecyl)-CoA—Sphingomonas SPT has absorption bands at 338 and 426 nm, which arise from the enolimine and ketoenamine tautomers, respectively, of the PLP-Lys265 Schiff base. The addition of l-serine to SPT increased the 426 nm peak and concomitantly decreased the 338 nm peak, reflecting the transaldimination process from the PLP-Lys265 Schiff base to the PLP-l-serine Schiff base (i.e. the external aldimine) (Fig. 3, A and B, lines 1 and 2). No absorption was observed at around 490–500 nm, indicating that the binding of l-serine alone to SPT does not yield detectable amounts of the quinonoid intermediate. Thus, the majority of the SPT-l-serine complex exists as the external aldimine. However, when S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA, an analogue for palmitoyl-CoA, was added to the SPT-l-serine complex, a band emerged at 493 nm (Fig. 3, A and B, lines 3–7). The intensity of the 493 nm band showed a hyperbolic dependence on the concentrations of S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA (Fig. 3C), and the apparent dissociation constant (Kappd) for S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA was determined to be 35 μm. No spectral change of SPT was detected when only S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA was added to SPT. These results indicate that the binding of the palmitoyl-CoA analogue to the external aldimine complex induces the formation of the quinonoid intermediate.FIGURE 3Absorption spectra of SPT in the presence of l-serine and S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA. The buffer system was 50 mm HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm KCl and 0.1 mm EDTA. The measurements were done at 25 °C. The enzyme concentration was 5 μm. A, absorption spectra of SPT.

C, titration curve of the molar extinction coefficient at 493 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The 493-nm absorption band was stable; its intensity did not change for prolonged periods. In addition, no detectable amounts of CoA or condensation products were found in the solution (data not shown). This is consistent with the chemistry of the palmitoyl-CoA analogue. Thus, the acyl carbonyl group and the S atom, which form the thioester bond in palmitoyl-CoA, are separated by a methylene group in S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA, and, therefore, the analogue cannot undergo the Claisen-type condensation reaction with the carbanionic Cα of the quinonoid intermediate.Kinetic Analysis of the Spectral Transition of the SPT-l-Serine Complex upon Reaction with S-(2-Oxoheptadecyl)-CoA—In order to elucidate the process of the quinonoid formation in more detail, a transient kinetic analysis was carried out on the reaction described above. SPT (42 μm) was saturated in advance with 30 mm l-serine and reacted with S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA, and the spectral changes were followed in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. A time-dependent increase in the 493 nm absorbance was observed (Fig. 4, A and B). The reaction was followed at the S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA concentrations of 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 μm. At each concentration, the spectral change was a nearly single exponential process. However, since the S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA concentrations were of the same order as the enzyme concentration, a numerical analysis using the Pro-KII program was necessary. The spectra generated according to the following scheme were well fit by a global analysis to the experimentally obtained time-resolved spectra, ES1+S2⇄KdanalogES1S2⇄k−2k+2EQ1S2SCHEME 1 where E represents SPT, S1 is l-serine, ES1 is the SPT-l-serine external aldimine complex, S2 is S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA, ES1S2 is the ternary complex, and EQ1S2 is the SPT-l-serine quinonoid intermediate complexed with S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA. The kinetic parameters were obtained as follows: Kdanalog = 31.7 ± 1.1 μm, k+2 = 2.6 ± 4.8 s–1, and –2 = 64.4 ± 4.2 s–1. That the S.D. value of k+2 exceeds the mean value is the result of the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization and not that of the experimental errors. The calculated absorption spectrum of ES1S2 was very similar to the spectrum of ES1 and had no absorption at 493 nm (Fig. 4C, lines 1 and 2). On the other hand, the calculated absorption spectrum of EQ1S2 showed an intense absorption at around 493 nm with a shoulder at around 460 nm. The apparent dissociation constant (Kappd) obtained from the static spectroscopic analysis (Fig. 3C) is related to the above kinetic parameters as follows, Kdapp=k-2k+2+k-2Kdanalog(Eq. 1) The calculated value of Kappd using the transient kinetic parameters obtained as above was 30 μm, which was very close to the experimental value of 35 μm, thus supporting the validity of the above kinetic analysis. The apparent equilibrium constant for the ES1S2 ⇄ EQ1S2 reaction, k+2/k–2, is 0.04. This small value explains why the quinonoid peak in Fig. 3 is small.FIGURE 4Time-resolved spectra for the reaction of SPT-l-serine complex and S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA. A, time-resolved spectra for the reaction of the SPT-l-serine complex and palmitoyl-CoA at pH 7.5.

The heavy dotted line represents the spectrum of SPT-l-serine complex in the absence of S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA.

In D2O buffer at pH 7.5, l-serine gives four resonance peaks centered at 3.85 ppm and eight resonance peaks around 3.98 ppm, corresponding to three protons with the ABX spin system. The former peaks come from the α-proton, and the latter come from the β-methylene protons (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 51H NMR spectra of l-serine during the SPT-catalyzed hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction at Cα. A, 1H NMR spectrum of 10 mm l-serine in the presence of 5 μm SPT.

The spectrum of 1.4 mm S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA was subtracted as the background from each spectrum. The integration curve (red line) is plotted on each spectrum.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The interaction of the GCM DNA binding domains with their cognate octameric binding motif 5′-ATGCGGGT-3′ is mediated by contacts between amino acid residues of the β-sheets and the major groove of double-stranded DNA (3Akiyama Y.

All GCM family members are involved as master regulators in key steps of differentiation processes. The prototypical GCM protein of Drosophila melanogaster turned out to be mandatory for gliogenesis (7Vincent S. Vonesch J-L. Giangrande A. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 131-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jones B.W. Fetter R.D. Tear G. Goodman C.S.

Cell. 1995; 82: 1025-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Later, GCM in flies was also shown to be responsible for the specification of the plasmatocyte/macrophage lineage during hematopoiesis (10Lebestky T. Chang T. Hartenstein V. Banerjee U. Science. 2000; 288: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Apart from these main functions, fly GCM proteins are additionally important for neurogenesis in the developing visual system and the postembryonic brain and for terminal tendon cell differentiation (11Colonques J. Ceron J. Tejedor F.J. Mech. Dev. 2007; 124: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Chotard C. Leung W. Salecker I.

Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 4521-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Only two GCM proteins have been reported in mammals, GCMa/Gcm1 and GCMb/Gcm2. GCMa is necessary for the differentiation of trophoblasts to syncytiotrophoblasts during placental labyrinth formation (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consequently, GCMa knock-out mice die at mid-embryogenesis due to the failure of placental labyrinth formation and subsequent lack of nutrient and oxygen supply to the embryo. Accordingly, GCMa is the first transcription factor capable of initiating syncytiotrophoblast formation. The placental phenotype of the GCMa knockout mice resembles human placental pathologies such as pre-eclampsia or intrauterine growth restrictions associated with fetal to neonatal mortality and morbidity (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Pre-eclampsia, clinically defined by hypertension and proteinuria (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), is still one of the main causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity. In fact, both decreased and increased placental GCMa transcript amounts have been reported in mothers with pre-eclampsia (16Fujito N. Samura O. Miharu N. Tanigawa M. Hyodo M. Kudo Y. Hiroshima J. Med. Sci. 2006; 55: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chen C.P. Chen C.Y. Yang Y.C. Su T.H. Chen H. Placenta. 2004; 25: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In adult mice, additional GCMa expression sites have been reported in kidney, thymus, and brain (18Hashemolhosseini S. Hadjihannas M. Stolt C.C. Haas C.S. Amann K. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 2002; 118: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Iwasaki Y. Hosoya T. Takebayashi H. Ogawa Y. Hotta Y. Ikenaka K. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6027-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GCMb is required for the generation of parathyroid glands (20Günther T. Chen Z-F. Kim J. Priemel M. Rueger J.M. Amling M. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Anderson D.J. Karsenty G. Nature. 2000; 406: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Consequently, GCMb knock-out mice suffer from hypoparathyroidism characterized by affected calcium and phosphate homeostasis. To date, several target genes of GCM have been identified in flies and in mammals. In flies, three transcription factors, encoded by the loci repo, pointed, and tramtrack, are expressed in GCM-dependent fashion and are all required for terminal differentiation of lateral glia (21Yuasa Y. Okabe M. Yoshikawa S. Tabuchi K. Xiong W.C. Hiromi Y. Okano H. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2419-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Granderath S. Bunse I. Klämbt C. Mech.

In addition, fly GCM is able to regulate its own expression (24Alfonso T.B. Jones B.W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Kammerer M. Giangrande A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4664-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In flies, a number of further GCM target genes were identified by a genome-wide analysis (26Egger B. Leemans R. Loop T. Kammermeier L. Fan Y. Radimerski T. Strahm M.C. Certa U. Reichert H. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3295-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, only aromatase and syncytin are reported as placental targets of human GCMa (27Yu C. Shen K. Lin M. Chen P. Lin C. Chang G.D. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50062-50068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 28Yamada K. Ogawa H. Honda S. Harada N. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32279-32286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These targets have been of limited help for understanding placental abnormalities. To further understand how GCMa is involved in the process of placental labyrinth formation, we conducted a comparative analysis of placental genes in the absence of GCMa in mouse placenta tissue by microarray technology. This is the first genome-wide analysis for mammalian GCMa targets. A number of genes are up- or down-regulated in GCMa-ablated placenta. We further focused on those genes that were down-regulated in the absence of GCMa in the placenta. We proved their transcriptional down-regulation by quantitative RT-PCR. The two most down-regulated genes in placenta lacking GCMa were verified by promoter and in situ hybridization studies. Our data suggest that GCMa acts at a crucial step of placental development, and its further characterization might help to understand placental pathologies in humans. Primers Used for Quantitative RT-PCR and Plasmid Constructs—GCMa targets derived by microarray studies were verified by quantitative RT-PCR (LightCycler, Roche Applied Science) using the 5′- and 3′-primers listed in supplemental Table 1. For integrin-α4 reporter studies, an ∼6-kb EcoRV/HindIII integrin-α4 promoter fragment derived from a genomic clone (4H6-1; gift of Joy Yang, The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) was subcloned in SmaI/HindIII-digested pGL2-Basic (Promega). An Rb1 luciferase reporter construct was generated using a Bluescript plasmid containing an ∼6.4-kb Rb1 promoter fragment (pmRbP.(129).lacZ; gift of Eldad Zacksenhaus, University of Toronto, Canada). The Rb1 promoter was amplified by PCR primers 5′-ATA GGT ACC GAT CCC GTT CTT CAC AGC AG-3′ and 5′-TAT GGA TCC GAC GCG CAG CGC GGG CCG GC-3′ and subcloned in KpnI/BglII-digested pGL2-Basic (Promega). For promoter studies, different 5′-truncations of integrin-α4 and Rb1 promoters were created. For the integrin-α4 promoter region, a 3′-primer (5′-GAT CAA GCT TGC GCT CTT GGT GGA GAA CAT T-3′) was combined with the following 5′-primers: 5′-GAA GTA TGA TTC AGG ATA TC-3′ (–2009 to +235), 5′-GAT CGG ATC CAC TTT ATG GAG TAG GGA ACT-3′ (–1493 to +235), 5′-GAT CGG ATC CGC CTC CTG CTC CAG CGT GAA-3′ (–1022 to +235), 5′-GAT CGG ATC CGC AGC AGG TTT GGC TTC TGC-3′ (–513 to +235) to amplify 5′-truncated promoter fragments by PCR and subclone them in BglII/HindIII-digested pGL2-Basic (Promega). For the Rb1 promoter region, a 3′-primer (5′-TAT GGA TCC GAC GCG CAG CGC GGG CCG GC-3′) was used with the following 5′-primers: 5′-ATA GGT ACC GCA GTA CGT GAG ACT GAA TC-3′ (–2814 to +150), 5′-ATA GGT ACC TTG GTG GCG GTA GGT AGT TC-3′ (–827 to +150), 5′-ATA GGT ACC TCT CCA GAA GGC CAC CAA TG-3′ (–399 to +150). The PCR fragments were subsequently inserted into KpnI/BglII-digested pGL2-Basic (Promega). For the generation of an in situ probe, full-length GCMa subcloned in pBluescript (Stratagene) was linearized by EcoRI to generate an antisense and by SacI to make a sense riboprobe. For an Rb1 riboprobe, the 3′-part of the open reading frame was subcloned as a 969-bp PCR fragment into pGEM-Teasy (Promega) using primers 5′-GGA TGG AGA AGG ACC TGA TA-3′ and 5′-AGT TTC TGT TGG AAT TTG GA-3′ as described (29Spencer C. Pajovic S. Devlin H. Dinh Q.D. Corson T.W. Gallie B.L. Gene. Expr. Patterns. 2005; 5: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A plasmid for the generation of an in situ probe for integrin-α4 was kindly provided by Joy Yang (JHU, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Tissue Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes with 1 μg of luciferase reporter and 0.1 μg of cytomegalovirus-driven GCMa expression vector using DNA calcium phosphate precipitates. At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested for luciferase assays as described (30Schubert S.W. Kardash E. Khan M.A. Cheusova T. Kilian K. Wegner M. Hashemolhosseini S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50358-50365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated independently at least three times. Dissection of Placental Tissue, Genotyping, RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription, and LightCycler PCR—Previously, constitutive GCMa knock-out mice were generated by replacing exons 3–6 of GCMa by a complete lacZ open reading frame (15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). GCMalacZ/lacZ mice are embryonically lethal, representing GCMa-null mutants and trophoblast cells in pregnant mothers expressing β-galactosidase in place of GCMa. Here, we intercrossed GCMa+/lacZ mice and obtained GCMa+/+, GCMa+/lacZ, and GCMalacZ/lacZ genotypes according to Mendelian inheritance. Embryos were lysed and genotyped as described at E9.5, the time of dissection (15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). GCMa+/+ (wild-type) or GCMalacZ/lacZ (mutant) chorions were used for further experiments. A minimum of 40 either GCMa+/+ or GCMalacZ/lacZ chorions were pooled, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) (30Schubert S.W. Kardash E. Khan M.A. Cheusova T. Kilian K. Wegner M. Hashemolhosseini S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50358-50365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The total RNA was further purified by DNaseI digestion and column purification (Qiagen DNaseI-, Qiagen RNeasy kit) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After reverse transcription, first strand cDNA was used in PCR experiments. Amplification products were separated on 2% (w/v) agarose gels after 30 cycles (for β-actin) or 40 cycles for integrin-α4 and Rb1. PCR products were subcloned and verified by DNA sequencing. Quantitative PCR reactions were performed using the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green kit and the Light-Cycler thermal cycle system (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Densitometrical analysis of PCR fragment band intensities using conventional PCRs was performed using the Scion Image program (Scion Corp.). Microarray Analysis—RNA extraction and purification from a minimum of 40 placental tissues at stage E9.5 were performed as described (see above). Synthesis of double-stranded cDNA, generation of biotinylated cRNA, hybridization to Mouse Genome430_2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), washing, staining, and scanning in a GeneChip Scanner3000 of the arrays were done as recommended in the Affymetrix Expression_s2_manual (41Affymetrix Expression_s2_Manual, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CAGoogle Scholar). Signal intensities and expression changes were determined using the GCOS1.4 software (Affymetrix). A scaling across all probe sets of a given array to a target intensity of 1000 was included to compensate for variations in the amount and quality of the cRNA samples and other experimental variables. In Situ Hybridization Experiments—Extra-embryonic placental tissues from mice at E9.5 were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, deposited in 12-well plates, and hybridized with sense or antisense RNA specific for integrin-α4, Rb1, Dlx3, or GCMa according to protocols previously described (32Hashemolhosseini S. Schmidt K. Kilian K. Rodriguez E. Wegner M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Overview of Genes Differentially Expressed in the Absence of GCMa in the Placenta—To identify placental GCMa target genes, we decided to analyze the pattern of genes down-regulated in the absence of GCMa. To this end, we dissected chorions of murine GCMa+/+ or GCMalacZ/lacZ placentae and extracted RNA for further use in microarray studies. Previous reports demonstrated normal development of GCMa-ablated chorions until embryonic stage E9.0–9.5. Thereafter the labyrinth layer failed to form (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We collected RNA from wild-type and mutant (GCMalacZ/lacZ) chorions at E9.5. At this embryonic stage, syncytiotrophoblast differentiation and tissue morphogenesis were not impaired in mutant chorions (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We dissected >200 chorions, used the associated embryos for DNA isolation and genotyping (data not shown), and grouped the different chorions according to their genotype as GCMlacZ/lacZ, GCMa+/lacZ, or GCMa+/+. As shown before, the genotype of the chorions followed strictly Mendelian rules of inheritance (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although no haploinsufficiency was ever observed for GCMa heterozygotes, we decided to compare for further studies only RNAs derived from GCMalacZ/lacZ chorions with GCMa+/+ chorions. We used >40 chorionic tissues of each genotype, extracted RNA, and performed Affymetrix microarray studies. Using stringent analysis parameters for data mining analysis (signal log ratio >1.1 or <–1.1; p value <0.001 or >0.999), 66 genes were up-regulated, and 11 genes were down-regulated (Table 1; for up-regulated genes, see supplemental Table 2). Transcript amount of GCMa itself was significantly down-regulated in GCMa-deficient chorion tissue (Table 1). The down-regulation of GCMa transcript amount is explainable by loss of GCMa mRNA parts complementary to array probes as the array probes are directed against exon 6 of GCMa, whereas exons 3–6 are deleted in GCMlacZ/lacZ tissue (15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although integrin-α4 mRNA level was down-regulated by only 0.76-fold on the array, we decided to further examine its level because integrin-α4 is known to play a fundamental role during choriogenesis at E9.5 and might therefore be a target of GCMa (33Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 549-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Until now, all reported GCM targets were shown to be induced by GCMs (21Yuasa Y. Okabe M. Yoshikawa S. Tabuchi K. Xiong W.C. Hiromi Y. Okano H. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2419-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Granderath S. Bunse I. Klämbt C. Mech.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6316-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to focus only on the genes down-regulated in the absence of GCMa in the placenta as they might be induced as primary targets by GCMa.TABLE 1Given values represent changed transcript levels of genes down-regulated in murine GCMa-deficient placentae as detected by microarray technology and confirmed by quantitative RT-PCRGene titleGene symbol-Fold changeMicroarrayLightCyclerIntegrin alpha 4Itga40.76<0.01Retinol binding protein 1, cellularRbp10.460.38Vanin 1Vnn10.330.96Complement component factor iCfi0.30<0.01Glial cells missing aGCMa0.25<0.01Protocadherin 7Pcdh70.230.35Probeset id: 161438_r_atunknown0.18NDCholecystokinin A receptorCckar0.17NDSolute carrier family 30, member 3Slc30a30.170.98Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1Hapln10.150.94Retinoblastoma 1Rb10.040.32Syncytin AGm520.52 Open table in a new tab Analysis of Differentially Expressed GCMa Targets by Quantitative RT-PCR—To verify the GCMa target genes identified by microarray technology, we performed quantitative RT-PCR of all 11 down-regulated candidates. As template, we generated first strand cDNA from RNAs extracted from dissected chorions of GCMa+/+ or GCMa-deficient placentae. Most strongly down-regulated were transcript levels of integrin-α4 and retinoblastoma (Rb1) gene (0.01- and 0.32-fold, respectively; Table 1). Previously, it was reported that human GCMa regulates the transcription of the fusogenic syncytin gene important for syncytiotrophoblast formation. By quantitative RT-PCR studies, we also observed for the first time a significant down-regulation of murine syncytin A in GCMa-deficient chorions (0.52-fold; Table 1, Fig. 1A). Using conventional RT-PCR, we even failed to observe a PCR-amplified fragment for integrin-α4 after gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). In the case of Rb1, the amount of PCR-amplified fragment was significantly reduced (Fig. 1B). Further, we quantified the degree of down-regulation of integrin-α4 and Rb1 transcript levels by densitometrical analysis (Fig. 1C). Note that the degree of down-regulation of integrin-α4 and Rb1 is similar independent of using either microarray or quantitative RT-PCR experiments (compare Table 1 with Fig. 1C). Reporter Studies and Promoter Analysis Verify Integrin-α4 and Rb1 as Primary Targets of GCMa—Integrin-α4 and Rb1 belong to the most strongly down-regulated genes according to our quantitative and qualitative RT-PCR data. Both genes are known to play fundamental roles during syncytiotrophoblast formation and normal labyrinth architecture in the placenta (33Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 549-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wu L. De Bruin A. Saavedra H.I. Starovic M. Trimboli A. Yang Y. Opavska J. Wilson P. Thompson J.C. Ostrowski M.C. Rosol T.J. Woollett L.A. Weinstein M. Cross J.C. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2003; 421: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Hence, we decided to focus on the characterization of these two genes as GCMa targets. To this end, we investigated whether the promoters of these genes are regulated by GCMa. We fused an ∼6-kb region upstream of the ATG start codon of each gene to a luciferase reporter. After transient transfection of the reporter plasmids in cultured cells, GCMa stimulated the promoter of integrin-α4 and Rb1 by 20.9- and 15.9-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Assuming that integrin-α4 and Rb1 might be primary targets of GCMa, we addressed whether the promoters of both genes contain potential GCM binding sites. Although GCM proteins are known to interact with an octameric binding site composed of 5′-ATGCGGGT-3′, it was shown that only specific bases within the octamer are crucial for interaction (1Cohen S.X. Moulin M. Hashemolhosseini S. Kilian K. Wegner M. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1835-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Schreiber J. Enderich J. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2337-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Taking this into account, we searched for the presence of less stringent octameric motifs, namely 5′-NTGMKGGK-3′ (M = A, C; K = G, T) in the 6-kb regions upstream of the ATGs of integrin-α4 and Rb1 genes. In fact, several putative GCM binding sites are present within both promoters (Fig. 2, A and B). To find out which of these GCM binding sites are of importance for transcriptional activation, we created a series of consecutive 5′-deletions for each promoter, transiently transfected these reporter plasmids in cultured cells, and examined their inducibility by GCMa (Fig. 3, A–C). We detected for none of the four 5′-deletions of the integrin-α4 promoter reporters the same high transcriptional activation as for the whole 6-kb fragment observed (Figs. 2A and 3, A and B). Additionally, if we used only a 513-bp fragment upstream of the ATG of integrin-α4 for reporter studies, we measured an 8.3-fold induction. Accordingly, our data demonstrate that the relevant GCMa-dependent transactivation sites are located within the integrin-α4 promoter between–5022 and –2009 and down-stream of –513. For the Rb1 promoter, we generated three consecutive 5′-deletions of the used ∼6-kb promoter (Fig. 3A). GCMa induced all Rb1 reporter constructs except –399 to +150, indicating that GCMa-dependent transactivation of Rb1 gene requires the sites at –675 and –449 (Fig. 3C). Analysis of Spatial Expression of GCMa Targets Integrin-α4 and Rb1 by in Situ Hybridization of Murine Placentae—So far, our data proved the impact of integrin-α4 and Rb1 as potential placental GCMa targets by in vitro methodology. To verify both genes as GCMa targets in vivo, we decided to analyze their spatial transcription pattern by whole mount in situ hybridization of placentae. We used placentae of mice at E9.5. At this time point, no signs of impaired tissue development was observed in GCMa-deficient placentae (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat.

First, we proved the spatial transcription profile of GCMa and mammalian Distal-less homolog Dlx3, which is expressed in the labyrinthine layer in a subset of trophoblast cells (15Schreiber J.

As reported previously, in GCMa-deficient placentae, the transcription of Dlx3 was not affected (data not shown) (15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In placental tissue from GCMa+/+ mice, we detected GCMa in the layer of the placenta containing the labyrinthine trophoblasts as shown before (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In GCMa-ablated placentae, we failed to detect any signal for GCMa transcripts (Fig. 4, A and B). In agreement with our in vitro data, we also failed to detect transcripts of integrin-α4 and only a weak signal intensity of Rb1, arguing for rare transcription of the latter in the labyrinthine layer of placentae (Fig. 4B). We evaluated by densitometrical analysis the observed pattern and obtained less then 1% of the signal intensity found in GCMa+/+ placentae for integrin-α4 and 31.4% for Rb1 in GCMa-deficient placentae (Fig. 4C). The transcription factor GCMa has been shown to play a fundamental role as master regulator conducting trophoblast differentiation and syncytiotrophoblast formation (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Accordingly, GCMa is expected to be important in different human placental pathologies. In fact, several reports correlated changed GCMa expression levels with pre-eclampsia (16Fujito N. Samura O. Miharu N. Tanigawa M. Hyodo M. Kudo Y. Hiroshima J. Med. Sci. 2006; 55: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chen C.P. Chen C.Y. Yang Y.C. Su T.H. Chen H. Placenta. 2004; 25: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Additionally, GCMa was shown to induce gene expression of the human fusogenic syncytin gene, which plays a crucial role during differentiation of trophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast (27Yu C. Shen K. Lin M. Chen P. Lin C. Chang G.D. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50062-50068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In this respect, it fits that syncytin was also shown to be down-regulated in pre-eclampsia (36Lee X. Keith Jr., J.C. Stumm N. Moutsatsos I. McCoy J.M. Crum C.P. Genest D. Chin D. Ehrenfels C. Pijnenborg R. van Assche F.A. Mi S. Placenta. 2001; 22: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For better understanding of how GCMa is involved in placental pathologies, we decided to search for the first time by genome-wide analysis for mammalian placental GCMa target genes. We compared by array studies GCMa+/+ and GCMa-deficient murine chorionic tissue and identified 11 down-regulated genes in the absence of GCMa (Table 1). Human syncytin, a protein encoded by the envelope gene of a recently identified endogenous defective human retrovirus, human endogenous hetrovirus-W (HERV-W), is highly expressed in placental tissue, and as mentioned above, regulated by GCMa. Previously, a mouse syncytin homologue was not believed to exist, but recently, two murine genes of substantial homology were identified, and one of them (syncytin A) was shown to play a role in mouse placental development (37Gong R. Huang L. Shi J. Luo K. Qiu G. Feng H. Tien P. Xiao G. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 38Dupressoir A. Marceau G. Vernochet C. Benit L. Kanellopoulos C. Sapin V. Heidmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In fact, we confirmed by this study that murine syncytin A is also a GCMa target (Table 1). Aromatase as another described target of GCMa in humans could be neglected in this study as, curiously, aromatase is not expressed in mouse placenta (39Cross J.C. Anson-Cartwright L. Scott I.C. Recent Prog. Horm Res. 2002; 57: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Finally, we focused on the characterization of the two most strongly down-regulated genes in the absence of GCMa in murine placenta, namely integrin-α4 and Rb1. As a matter of fact, the promoters of both integrin-α4 and Rb1 contain a number of potential GCM binding sites. Our effort to map both promoters revealed that for integrin-α4, regions containing GCM binding sites at positions –3252, –2458, –2355, –317, and –225 are crucial for strong induction of integrin-α4 promoter activity (Fig. 3B). In the case of Rb1, two GCM binding sites at positions –675 and –449 are effectively regulating GCMa-dependent Rb1 gene expression as 5′-deletion of the region containing these two sites abolishes activation of Rb1 transcription by GCMa (Fig. 3C). Integrin-α4 plays a fundamental role in labyrinthine layer formation. Integrin-α4 null mutants show two defects that result in embryonic lethality. One of them is the failure of fusion of the allantois with the chorion during placentation (33Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 549-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the same ∼6-kb integrin-α4 promoter fragment used in this study was earlier fused to lacZ and shown to be expressed with the same spatial and temporal expression profile as GCMa (40Sengbusch J.K. He W. Pinco K.A. Yang J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Previously, it was found that drugs being used to block integrin-α4 function during inflammation might raise side effects such as abortions due to impaired placental integrin-α4 expression (33Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 549-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It might be worth considering whether other known drugs leading to abortions are causally associated with yet unknown impaired placental GCMa expression. Data from another study indicated that a VCAM1-integrin-α4 interaction is necessary for the induction of GCMa expression (31Stecca B. Nait-Oumesmar B. Kelley K.A. Voss A.K. Thomas T. Lazzarini R.A. Mech. Dev. 2002; 115: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In agreement with those previous data, our data suggest that GCMa and integrin-α4 regulate their expression in an interdependent manner. Recently, excessive proliferation of trophoblast cells and a severe disruption of the normal labyrinth architecture in the placenta were identified as the actual cause of the embryonic lethality of Rb1-deficient mice (35Wu L. De Bruin A. Saavedra H.I. Starovic M. Trimboli A. Yang Y. Opavska J. Wilson P. Thompson J.C. Ostrowski M.C. Rosol T.J. Woollett L.A. Weinstein M. Cross J.C. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2003; 421: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our studies identified Rb1 and integrin-α4 as targets of GCMa, placing GCMa in a very key position in development of trophoblast cells, reminiscent of its prototypical role as master regulator of gliogenesis in D. melanogaster. It appears that it is a common theme that GCM proteins regulate very important steps of developmental processes. Further studies are necessary to understand the role of GCMa in human placental pathologies.

We have used patch clamp recording to investigate the state-dependent accessibility of substituted cysteine residues in the CFTR channel pore to a range of cysteine-reactive reagents applied to the extracellular side of the membrane. Using functional modification of the channel current-voltage relationship as a marker of modification, we find that several positively charged reagents are able to penetrate deeply into the pore from the outside irrespective of whether or not the channels have been activated. In contrast, access of three anionic cysteine-reactive reagents, the methanesulfonate sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanesulfonate, the organic mercurial p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid, and the permeant anion Au(CN)2-, to several different sites in the pore is strictly limited prior to channel activation. This suggests that in nonactivated channels some ion selectivity mechanism exists to exclude anions yet permit cations into the channel pore from the extracellular solution. We suggest that activation of CFTR channels involves a conformational change in the pore that removes a strong selectivity against anion entry from the extracellular solution. We propose further that this conformational change occurs in advance of channel opening, suggesting that multiple distinct closed pore conformations exist.

CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of membrane transport proteins that functions as a Cl– channel in the apical membrane of many different epithelial cell types (2Sheppard D.N.

The CFTR protein contains 12 transmembrane (TM) α-helices that are presumed to form the pore region through which Cl– ions cross the membrane (1Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon A. Rozmahel R.

Physiol. 2006; 91: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Channel activity is regulated by cytoplasmic factors. Phosphorylation of the regulatory domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a prerequisite for channel opening (2Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 3Kidd J.F. Kogan I. Bear C.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2004; 60: 215-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation, channel opening and closing are controlled by ATP interactions with the two intracellular nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) (6Gadsby D.C. Vergani P. Csanády L.

How these cytoplasmic processes lead to a structural rearrangement of the TM regions that results in opening of the Cl– permeation pathway is not known. cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine 4-(N-maleimido)benzyl-α-trimethylammonium iodide methanesulfonate sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanesulfonate [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanesulfonate bromide nucleotide binding domain p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid transmembrane protein kinase A N-[2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-maleimide chloride current-voltage N-tris(hydroxymethyl)-methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonate. Once open, the CFTR channel pore allows rapid permeation of Cl– and other small anions but selects strongly against small cations (8Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The mechanism of anion selectivity is not known. One factor that likely contributes is the presence of positively charged arginine and lysine side chains in the permeation pathway. Indeed, several positively charged residues have been shown to be involved in attracting Cl– ions into the pore by an electrostatic mechanism (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10St. Aubin C.N. Linsdell P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The importance of charge at these positions can be demonstrated not only by mutagenesis to residues of different charge but also by mutation to cysteine followed by covalent modification by charged cysteine-reactive methanesulfonate (MTS) reagents. Such modification mimics the effects of mutagenesis, leading to side chain charge-dependent effects on the shape of the channel current-voltage relationship that reflect changes in unitary Cl– conductance (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10St. Aubin C.N. Linsdell P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the present study, we take advantage of charge-dependent changes in current-voltage relationship shape that result from the modification of introduced cysteines by charged reagents to report structural rearrangements of the channel pore that occur during the channel activation process. Experiments were carried out on baby hamster kidney cells transfected with wild type or mutant forms of human CFTR (11Gong X. Burbridge S.M. Cowley E.A. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 39-47Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Patch clamp recording from inside-out patches excised from these cells was performed as described previously (11Gong X. Burbridge S.M. Cowley E.A. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 39-47Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 673-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following patch excision and recording of background currents, CFTR channels were activated by exposure to PKA catalytic subunit (20 nm) plus MgATP (1 mm) in the cytoplasmic solution. Activated channels were then “locked” in the open state by addition of 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate (PPi) to ensure macroscopic currents reflect the open channel current-voltage relationship. Both intracellular (bath) and extracellular (pipette) solutions contained 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm TES (pH adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH). Channels were exposed to extracellular cysteine-reactive reagents in two different ways. First, these reagents were present in the pipette solution throughout the experiment. Second, cells were pretreated with reagents in normal bath solution for 5 min prior to the experiment. Pretreated cells were then washed with bath solution to remove these reagents prior to transfer to the recording chamber and immediate use. In some cases, cells were pretreated with cysteine-reactive reagents together with the cAMP-activating compounds forskolin (10 μm) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; 100 μm). Cysteine-reactive reagents used were the MTS reagents sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanesulfonate (MTSES) and [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanesulfonate bromide (MTSET), the maleimide derivatives 4-(N-maleimido)benzyl-α-trimethylammonium iodide (MBTA) and N-[2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]maleimide chloride (TMAEM), and the organic mercurial p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (pCMBS). These substances were initially prepared as high concentration stock solutions in distilled water and stored frozen as small volume aliquots until the time of use, when they were diluted in bath solution and used immediately. For experiments using Au(CN)2- to covalently modify an introduced cysteine, cells were pretreated with KAu(CN)2 in normal bath solution for 1–5 min either with or without cotreatment with forskolin plus IBMX. Following pretreatment, cells were washed with normal bath solution, transferred to the recording chamber, and used for patch clamp experiments immediately. Inside-out patches excised from cells pretreated in this way were then exposed to PKA, ATP, and PPi as usual to activate CFTR channel currents. Following attainment of full current amplitude, patches were then exposed to KCN (50 μm) in the bath solution to reverse covalent modification of cysteines by Au(CN)2- (13Serrano J.R. Liu X. Borg E.R. Alexander C.S. Shaw C.F. Dawson D.C. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1737-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We found that application of higher concentrations of KCN led to immediate loss of the gigaohm seal. All chemicals were from Sigma except for PKA (Promega, Madison, WI) and MTSES, MTSET, MBTA, and TMAEM (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, ON, Canada). Current traces were filtered at 100 Hz using an 8-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 250 Hz, and analyzed using pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Macroscopic current-voltage (I-V) relationships were constructed using depolarizing ramp protocols (8Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 687-693Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Background (leak) currents recorded before addition of PKA and ATP have been subtracted digitally, leaving uncontaminated CFTR currents (8Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 673-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Relative I-V shape under different conditions was compared by plotting current as a fraction of that recorded at –80 mV (IREL). Rectification of the I-V relationship was quantified as the “rectification ratio”: the slope conductance at –50 mV as a fraction of that at +50 mV (15Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 387-397Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Linsdell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8945-8950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out at room temperature, 21–24 °C. Values are presented as mean ± S.E. Unless stated otherwise, tests of significance were carried out using an unpaired t test, with p < 0.05 being considered statistically significant. Modification by MTS Reagents—Arg-334 contributes an important surface charge in the outer mouth of the CFTR channel pore (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C.

The importance of side chain charge at this position has been demonstrated previously by reaction with charged MTS reagents following mutation to cysteine (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Z.-R. Song B. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41997-42003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus side chain charge at this position, whether determined by mutation or by covalent modification of an introduced cysteine by charged reagents, plays an important role in controlling Cl– entry into the pore from the extracellular solution and hence the shape of the I-V relationship (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Z.-R. Song B. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41997-42003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similar effects have been observed for other surface charges in the CFTR pore (10St. Aubin C.N. Linsdell P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Indeed, when MTS reagents were included in the pipette solution, we found similar effects on I-V relationship shape in inside-out patches (Fig. 1, A–D) to those described previously in Xenopus oocytes (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown previously (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 387-397Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the R334C mutation itself induced inward rectification because of removal of the native positive charge and reduced electrostatic attraction of extracellular Cl– ions. Inclusion of the positively charged MTSET in the pipette solution then restored a near-linear I-V relationship, whereas the negatively charged MTSES significantly increased the degree of inward rectification. All of these results are consistent with changes in the electrostatic attraction of extracellular Cl– ions as a result of the deposition of charge near the outer mouth of the pore following modification of the introduced cysteine side chain, as proposed previously (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As described previously (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Z.-R. Song B. McCarty N.A. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), neither MTSET nor MTSES had any effect on wild type CFTR, which exhibited a near-linear I-V relationship under all conditions studied (Fig. 1, A and B). These changes in I-V relationship shape therefore serve as a convenient reporter of MTS modification of the introduced cysteine residue. In contrast to these results obtained with inclusion of MTS reagents in the pipette solution, we found that MTSES was apparently unable to modify R334C using a pretreatment protocol. Pretreatment with MTSET for 5 min prior to cell transfer to the recording chamber and removal of the MTS had a similar effect to inclusion of MTSET in the pipette; however, using the same protocol MTSES failed to alter I-V relationship shape (Fig. 1, E and F). This lack of effect could reflect that MTSES does not covalently label R334C and so must be present during the experiment to exert its effect, that covalent modification does occur but is relatively transient, or that covalent modification takes place during pipette application but not during pretreatment. We considered that the factor most likely to contribute to differential covalent modification under these two conditions was the state of the CFTR channels; during pretreatment the channels should be closed, whereas when it is present in the pipette solution during channel activation MTSES should have access to both closed and open channels. We therefore repeated the MTSES pretreatment in the presence of two cAMP-activating compounds, forskolin and IBMX, to activate the channels during the pretreatment period. Following cAMP stimulation, MTSES was able to modify R334C channels and induce increased inward rectification of the I-V relationship (Fig. 1, G and H), indicating that stable covalent modification of this introduced cysteine could take place but was somehow dependent on the activation state of the channels. This suggests that access of the negatively charged MTSES, but not the positively charged MTSET, to the CFTR pore was severely limited prior to channel activation. Next we asked if this apparent state-dependent access of MTSES was limited to R334C or if a similar effect could be seen with cysteines introduced at other sites in the pore. Previously it has been shown that cysteines introduced at a number of positions in the pore-lining TM6 region of CFTR were accessible to extracellular MTS reagents (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R.

An example is S341C; as shown in Fig. 2A, inclusion of MTS reagents in the pipette solution also gave charge-dependent changes in I-V shape in this mutant, indicating that deposition of charge at this position also alters anion movement in the pore. In fact, similar charge-dependent effects were observed in R334C, K335C, T338C, and S341C (Fig. 3). Another mutant, F337C, became significantly more inwardly rectified in the presence of MTSES but was apparently not affected by inclusion of MTSET in the pipette solution (Fig. 3). Thus, changes in I-V shape because of charge deposition by covalent modification of introduced cysteines seem to be a common feature of accessible side chains in TM6 that are presumably arranged along the axis of the CFTR pore.FIGURE 3Modification by charged MTS reagents induces rectification of the I-V relationship in different cysteine mutant forms of CFTR. Shown are mean rectification ratios estimated for different CFTR variants with or without MTS reagents in the pipette solution, plotted as a function of the predicted side chain charge caused by MTS modification (+1 with MTSET, 0 control, –1 with MTSES). It is presumed that in wild type no modification takes place, and here charge reflects only the charge of the modifying reagent applied. Side chain charge of the introduced cysteine may not in fact be zero, but slightly negative (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). •, wild type (both panels); ○, R334C (left); □, K335C (left); ▵, F337C (right); ▿, T338C (right); ♦, S341C (right) (mean of data from 3–9 patches). All MTS treatments led to significant changes in rectification ratio (p < 0.05) except MTSET-wild type, MTSES-wild type, and MTSET-F337C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The state dependence of modification of cysteines introduced at these sites was studied using the MTS pretreatment protocol described above for R334C. Again, results from the example mutant S341C are shown in Fig. 2. As with R334C (Fig. 1), MTSES induced inward rectification of the I-V relationship (indicating covalent modification of the substituted cysteine) when included in the pipette solution but not when preincubated with the cells. Results from all five reactive cysteine mutants studied using charged MTS reagents are summarized in Fig. 4. For each of the five, MTSET had similar effects on I-V shape when included in the pipette solution or when preincubated with cells (or, in the case of F337C, the same lack of effect) (Fig. 4A). In contrast, in each mutant MTSES was able to induce inward rectification of the I-V relationship when present in the pipette solution but had no significant effect following pretreatment (Fig. 4B). State-dependent modification by external MTSES, but not MTSET, therefore appears to be common to TM6 residues along the axis of the pore. Access of Other Charged Reagents to the Pore—The results with MTS reagents suggest that the positively charged MTSET can enter CFTR channels and covalently modify introduced cysteine residues prior to activation, whereas the negatively charged MTSES cannot enter the pore until activation takes place. To investigate if this reflected some unusual property of MTS reagents or if it was more generally applicable to charged reagents, we sought other non-MTS reagents that would covalently modify introduced cysteines to alter channel properties. Two positively charged maleimide derivatives, MBTA and TMAEM, had similar effects on R334C as those observed with MTSET (Fig. 5), leading to a more linear I-V relationship. In contrast, these reagents had no effect on I-V shape in wild type (data not shown). The similar functional effects of MTSET, MBTA, and TMAEM confirm that side chain charge is the important factor controlling I-V shape. As with MTSET, these other positively charged reagents appeared equally effective when present in the pipette solution or when used to pretreat cells. This result suggests that different kinds of cysteine-reactive reagents can be used to deposit a positive charge in the pore and that different kinds of organic cations can access the pore prior to channel activation. The effects of MTSES on R334C were mimicked by another negatively charged reagent, pCMBS (Fig. 6). As with MTSES, inclusion of pCMBS in the pipette solution led to increased inward rectification of the I-V relationship. In contrast, pCMBS had no effect on I-V shape when preincubated with cells, but modification could be restored under these conditions by cAMP stimulation. pCMBS had no effect on wild type under any of these conditions (data not shown). These results indicate that pCMBS exhibits the same state-dependent modification of R334C as MTSES, suggesting that it is the negative charge of the cysteine-reactive reagent that results in its exclusion from the pore prior to channel activation. Because MTSES and pCMBS are large organic anions, it is difficult to extrapolate their state-dependent access to the pore with smaller anions like Cl–. We therefore used Au(CN)2-, a highly permeant anion that has been shown to covalently modify the introduced cysteine in T338C-CFTR to block the permeation pathway (13Serrano J.R. Liu X. Borg E.R. Alexander C.S. Shaw C.F. Dawson D.C. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1737-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This blocking effect of Au(CN)2- is very stable but can be reversed using an excess of CN– ions (13Serrano J.R. Liu X. Borg E.R. Alexander C.S. Shaw C.F. Dawson D.C. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1737-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that if Au(CN)2- entered the pore to modify the introduced cysteine of T338C covalently, only very small currents could be activated by PKA, ATP, and PPi but that currents would subsequently be activated on exposure to CN–. Because Au(CN)2- is a permeant blocker (11Gong X. Burbridge S.M. Cowley E.A. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 39-47Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Smith S.S. Steinle E.D. Meyerhoff M.E. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 799-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) it could not be included in the pipette solution; however, we could investigate its state-dependent access to the pore by preincubation with and without cAMP stimulants. As shown in Fig. 7, pretreatment with Au(CN)2- did not appear to modify wild type CFTR either with or without cAMP stimulation. Thus, following pretreatment with 10 μm Au(CN)2- for 5 min, large currents could be activated by PKA, ATP, and PPi, and these were not significantly enhanced by exposure to 50 μm KCN in the bath solution (Fig. 7, A and B). In T338C, however, pretreatment with the same concentration of Au(CN)2- for only 1 min led to the appearance of a KCN-sensitive component of current (Fig. 7A). We interpret this to reflect CN– reversal of channel block caused by Au(CN)2- modification of the introduced cysteine in this mutant. Whereas this apparent modification did take place in the absence of cAMP stimulation, it can be seen that the degree of modification was greatly enhanced by cAMP stimulation (Fig. 7). Thus, without cAMP stimulation, KCN treatment increased CFTR Cl– conductance by 1.95 ± 0.24-fold (n = 6), whereas after cAMP stimulation KCN treatment increased conductance by 13.7 ± 1.2-fold (n = 4) (Fig. 7B). As shown in Fig. 7C, this dramatic increase in CFTR conductance induced by KCN in patches excised from cAMP-pretreated cells appears to reflect activation of channels that had been inhibited, presumably by Au(CN)2- covalent modification. Thus, although it appears that Au(CN)2- can modify T338C-CFTR with or without cAMP stimulation, the dramatic increase in the proportion of channels apparently modified by Au(CN)2- when cAMP stimulation is applied concurrently with Au(CN)2- exposure suggests that the rate of modification is far greater in activated channels than in nonactivated channels. Similar state-dependent inhibition by Au(CN)2- was also observed for other introduced cysteines (Fig. 7, D and E). For each of R334C, K335C, and S341C, like T338C, the apparent degree of Au(CN)2- modification as determined by the KCN-sensitive component of the current was significantly enhanced by cAMP stimulation (Fig. 7E). This confirms that Au(CN)2- access to different sites within the pore is greater in activated than in nonactivated channels. In contrast, F337C was only very weakly inhibited by Au(CN)2- either with or without cAMP prestimulation. Alteration of I-V shape in F337C by MTSES (Figs. 3 and 4B) confirms the previous report that the side chain at this position is in contact with the aqueous lumen of the pore (19Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, this mutant was not functionally modified either by MTSET (Fig. 4A) or Au(CN)2- (Fig. 7E). Currently it is not clear if this reflects relatively weak reactivity of the substituted cysteine at this position or if modification by MTSET and/or Au(CN)2- fails to alter the experimental parameters that we are measuring. Whatever the explanation, this lack of effect appears to be specific for F337C because the four other reactive cysteine mutants studied could be modified functionally by all reagents tested. Covalent modification of introduced cysteines has been used previously to illustrate the important surface charge roles played by native arginine residues at both the outer mouth (Arg-334 (9Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) and inner mouth (Arg-303 (10St. Aubin C.N. Linsdell P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) of the CFTR pore. Our results suggest that a similar approach can be used to introduce charge at other locations throughout the pore that do not normally have charged side chains and that these introduced charges appear to have similar electrostatic effects on Cl– movement in the pore (Fig. 3). In the present work we have used these functional effects as convenient markers of the covalent modification of introduced cysteine residues by different reagents and under different conditions. The main finding of the current work is that access of external anions to the CFTR channel pore is severely limited prior to channel activation. This applies both to the large negatively charged reagents MTSES and pCMBS and to the small, permeant anion Au(CN)2-. In contrast, large cations including MTSET, MBTA, and TMAEM are apparently able to enter into the pore prior to channel activation. In the case of MTSET at least, this large organic molecule is able to enter far enough into the pore of nonactivated channels to react with a cysteine substituted for Ser-341, purportedly located in the pore inner vestibule (22McDonough S. Davidson N. Lester H.A. McCarty N.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, MTSES cannot even modify R334C in the outer mouth of the pore under these conditions. This suggests that the activated and nonactivated channel pores are functionally distinct, presumably reflecting some change in pore conformation that accompanies channel activation. Reactivity of external MTSET and MTSES with R334C-CFTR has been studied previously, and it was shown that following channel activation both of these reagents modified this introduced cysteine only when the channel was closed (18Zhang Z.-R. Song B. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41997-42003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, in this case both MTSET and MTSES modified the same state of the channel. The crucial difference from our own study is that these channels were studied following activation by PKA, whereas we show that prior to channel activation, no modification by MTSES takes place. This result implies that a change in anion access to the pore occurs prior to channel opening during the activation process (Fig. 8). We propose that prior to cAMP stimulation the channel pore is in an “inactive” state that is separate from the “closed” state that separates openings during normal channel gating. Thus, at least two functionally distinct, nonconducting states of the CFTR channel pore exist. The switch from inactive to closed may involve, for example, phosphorylation by PKA. This would be consistent with the idea that activation of CFTR is a two-step process; the first step is controlled by phosphorylation of the regulatory domain, and the second step is controlled by ATP interactions with the NBDs (2Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 3Kidd J.F. Kogan I. Bear C.E. Curr. Top. Dev.

Aleksandrov L.A. Riordan J.R. Pflügers Arch. 2007; 453: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Once the channel has been “activated” it will cycle between the closed and open states because of ATP-dependent channel gating governed by the NBDs (6Gadsby D.C. Vergani P. Csanády L. Nature. 2006; 440: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 7Aleksandrov A.A. Aleksandrov L.A. Riordan J.R. Pflügers Arch. 2007; 453: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This gating cycle also appears to involve changes in accessibility to both MTSET and MTSES, at least as reported by a cysteine substituted for Arg-334 (18Zhang Z.-R. Song B. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41997-42003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although in this case there is no apparent charge dependence of accessibility. When the channel pore is in the inactive state (Fig. 8), pore-lining residues can be modified by cationic reagents (MTSET, MBTA, TMAEM) but not anionic MTSES or pCMBS. This distinction appears to hold for several accessible cysteines within the TM6 region that are presumably arranged along the axis of the pore, suggesting a global difference in access to the pore. Access of permeant Au(CN)2- ions to the pore also appears to increase dramatically on channel activation (Fig. 7). This implies that prior to channel activation some mechanism of charge selectivity exists that allows external cations, but not anions, to enter the channel pore. In contrast, size selectivity does not appear to be highly stringent because large cations (such as MTSET) can penetrate far into the pore of inactive channels. We propose that channel activation (which, we note, is separate from channel opening) is associated with a structural rearrangement of the pore that removes a charge-selective barrier and allows anions to enter from the extracellular solution. This may result from, for example, rearrangement of charged residues close to the outer mouth of the pore that influence entry of charged substances from the extracellular solution. Because modification of R334C, which is thought to be located at the outer mouth of the pore, is state-dependent, we suggest that the conformational change associated with channel activation must affect the very outermost part of the pore to influence access of external ions to Arg-334. Because this conformational change is presumably triggered by intracellular events at the regulatory domain and/or NBDs, it must be signaled across the entire membrane-spanning part of the CFTR protein. This structural rearrangement may represent a crucial early step in the formation of an anion-selective permeation pathway. A separate conformational change subsequently leads to opening of this pathway and permeation by Cl– ions. Currently nothing is known concerning the physical mechanism or structural basis of this second conformational change that opens the pore.

HD is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by involuntary movements, personality changes, and dementia. It is caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the first exon of the gene IT-15 (1The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7118) Google Scholar). A neuropathological hallmark of HD is intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that contain a mutant form of huntingtin (htt), the protein encoded by IT-15 (2DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O.

Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (called Lewy bodies) are also a prominent feature of PD, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor, and postural instability (3Goedert M.

Although amyloid or its formation is closely associated with the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, it has been a technical challenge to characterize protein aggregation in the brain noninvasively. The ocular lens is a unique immune-privileged tissue derived from neural ectoderm that contains the only transparent cells found in the entire body. Disruption of normal protein interactions in the lens leads to protein aggregation and cataract formation, which can be monitored easily and repetitively in living animals by highly sensitive noninvasive methods. The lens is an optically accessible tissue that would be ideal for the study of disease-relevant protein aggregation. We hypothesized that expression of disease-causing, aggregation-prone proteins in the lens would lead to cataract formation that could be measured in living mice. Generation of Transgenic Mice—To generate mice expressing mutant htt fragments with 25Q, 46Q, 72Q, and 97Q, the first exon of the IT-15 gene with DNA sequence encoding selected polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat lengths (25Q, 46Q, 72Q, or 97Q) fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the carboxyl terminus was excised from parental vectors (7Kazantsev A. Preisinger E. Dranovsky A. Goldgaber D. Housman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11404-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) with Bsp120I, filled in with Klenow, and gel-purified. Before ligation, a construct containing the murine αA-crystallin vector (8Mahon K.A. Chepelinsky A.B. Khillan J.S. Overbeek P.A. Piatigorsky J. Westphal H. Science. 1987; 235: 1622-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI, filled in with Klenow, and digested with HpaI. The digested vector was treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, gel-purified, and ligated to htt fragments. All constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing. Transgenes were excised from the vector with AatII and NgoMIV and gel-purified. DNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Transgenes were dialyzed for 2 h against 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) prepared from embryo-tested water (Sigma) on a 0.1-μm VCWP filter (Millipore). The dialyzed transgenes were used for pronuclear microinjection into B6C3 mouse embryos (75% C57BL/6 and 25% C3H) at the animal facilities of the Department of Comparative Medicine at the University of Washington. Founder mice were identified by DNA amplification with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) from tail biopsy material with primers directed against enhanced GFP. Positive mice were mated with C57BL/6 mice; the offspring were similarly identified. To generate GFP, wild-type α-synuclein (α-Syn-WT), and α-Syn-A53T mice, a vector containing the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter (9Taube J.R. Gao C.Y. Ueda Y. Zelenka P.S. David L.L. Duncan M.K. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), was digested with XbaI and XhoI, treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and gel-purified before DNA ligations. DNA sequences encoding α-Syn-WT and α-Syn-A53T fused to GFP were excised from p426GPD vectors (10Outeiro T.F. Lindquist S. Science. 2003; 302: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) with SpeI and XhoI and were gel-purified. A DNA sequence encoding GFP alone was amplified from p426GPD with primers that create XbaI (5′) and XhoI (3′) overhangs and was gel-purified. After ligation reactions, transgenes were excised with KpnI and BglI, gel-purified, and used for pronuclear microinjections as described above. Slit-lamp Ophthalmoscopy—3–12-week-old animals were analyzed by digital imaging coupled to a slit-lamp biomicroscope as described previously (11Seeberger T.M. Matsumoto Y. Alizadeh A. Fitzgerald P.G. Clark J.I. J. Biomed. Opt. 2004; 9: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The opacity from the heterogeneous protein aggregates in lens cells can be observed routinely using a slit lamp in the absence of filters. The incident light for slit-lamp observations included the excitation wavelengths for EGFP absorption and emission filters (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). Using the filters, it was possible to distinguish between the fluorescence from the expression of GFP proteins and light scattering from protein aggregates having a broad range of dimensions. An excitation filter allowed a narrow range of incident wavelengths (λ465–498 nm) to excite EGFP (excitation max: λ488 nm) expressed in the lens. An emission filter transmitted wavelengths (λ515–560 nm) originating from EGFP fluorescence (emission max: λ507 nm). Lastly, a barrier filter for EGFP emission (λ475–560 nm) was used to block EGFP emission and observe the scattering from protein aggregates. Quasielastic Laser Light Scattering Spectroscopy (QLS)—Unanesthetized mice were gently restrained by hand while a low power beam of an 0.3-milliwatt laser (λ = 780 nm) was focused in the lens. The intensity fluctuations of the scattered light were recorded for 1 s, and the autocorrelation function for the intensity fluctuations was plotted. Confocal Microscopy of Lens Sections—Eyes were removed from euthanized mice, embedded in OCT, and frozen in a dry ice, 95% ethanol bath. Sections (10–20-μm) were cut on a cryostat, picked up on Superfrost Plus slides (VWR International), air-dried overnight, and stored at -80 °C. Slides were fixed for 10 min with -20 °C acetone or for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. These fixatives gave similar results. Slides were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) between steps. Sections were labeled with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml in PBS, 1% BSA) for 30 min; with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothio-cyanate-dextran (Vector Laboratories) in PBS, 1% BSA for 60 min; with Nile Red (0.1–0.5 μg/ml in PBS) for 10 min; or with rabbit polyclonal antibody against β-catenin (1:500 in PBS, 1% BSA; Sigma) for 60 min. The latter was visualized with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Slides were coverslipped with VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and imaged with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope and Comos software or with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 MP confocal microscope and LaserSharp 2000 software. The images were analyzed with Adobe PhotoShop. Expression of Mutant htt Fragments or α-Synuclein in the Lens Causes Cataract Formation—We generated transgenic mice that express htt exon 1 with a polyQ repeat in the normal (25Q) and disease-causing (46Q, 72Q, 97Q) range fused at the carboxyl terminus to GFP under the control of the lens-specific αA-crystallin promoter (8Mahon K.A. Chepelinsky A.B. Khillan J.S. Overbeek P.A. Piatigorsky J. Westphal H. Science. 1987; 235: 1622-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We also generated transgenic mice that express GFP alone or wild-type (α-Syn-WT) or mutant (α-Syn-A53T) α-synuclein fused to GFP at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1A). The latter mice were generated with the lens-specific βB1-crystallin promoter (9Taube J.R. Gao C.Y. Ueda Y. Zelenka P.S. David L.L. Duncan M.K. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) due to the difficulty in obtaining founder lines with high expression levels using the αA-crystallin promoter (data not shown). The lenses of young (6–12-week-old) transgenic mice were evaluated for GFP expression and cataract formation by digital imaging with a slit-lamp biomicroscope (11Seeberger T.M. Matsumoto Y. Alizadeh A. Fitzgerald P.G. Clark J.I. J. Biomed. Opt. 2004; 9: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B–G). In 25Q mice, GFP fluorescence was diffusely distributed throughout the lens, and no opacity was observed in the slit-lamp views (Fig. 1B). In 46Q and 72Q mice, however, GFP fluorescence was localized in a discrete shell surrounding the center of the lens (defined anatomically as the nucleus) (Fig. 1, C and D). When GFP fluorescence in the 46Q and 72Q lenses was blocked with a GFP emission filter, a shell of light scattering in the supranuclear or deep cortical region of the lens was revealed (Fig. 1, C and D). Supranuclear opacities were observed in seven independently generated 72Q transgenic mouse lines (data not shown). Supranuclear opacities, although quite rare in the normal human population, may exist in the lenses of Alzheimer disease patients and serve as a biomarker for disease progression (12Goldstein L.E. Muffat J.A. Cherny R.A. Moir R.D. Ericsson M.H. Huang X. Mavros C. Coccia J.A. Faget K.Y. Fitch K.A. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Chylack Jr., L.T. Bush A.I. Lancet. 2003; 361: 1258-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In mice expressing GFP or α-Syn-WT/α-Syn-A53T fused to GFP, a strong fluorescent signal was observed in anterior views of the lenses (Fig. 1, E–G). In slit-lamp images, GFP fluorescence was in the lens epithelium and distributed throughout the fiber cells. Images captured when GFP emission was blocked with a filter revealed a dense lenticular opacity only in mice expressing α-Syn-WT or α-Syn-A53T (Fig. 1, F and G). Mice expressing GFP alone had no signs of opacity (Fig. 1E). Next, we analyzed immunoblots of protein lysates from the lens with antibodies that recognize expanded polyQ sequences or GFP. The polyQ-expressing mice (25Q–97Q) had similar levels of transgene expression (Fig. 2A). Importantly, as in transgenic mouse models of HD (13Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), SDS-insoluble aggregates that could not migrate into the gel matrix were observed in the pellet fraction of cellular lysates from 46Q, 72Q, and 97Q mice but not from 25Q mice (Fig. 2A). Thus, SDS-insoluble aggregates form in a polyQ length-dependent manner when htt exon 1 is expressed as a transgene in lens cells. Probing of immunoblots with anti-GFP antibody revealed GFP degradation products in lens lysates from 25Q–97Q mice. Expression of the htt exon 1 transgene with all polyQ lengths tested caused a significant fraction of GAPDH (the loading control in the gel) to shift to the pellet fraction (Fig. 2A). Since htt interacts directly with GAPDH in vitro (14Burke J.R. Enghild J.J. Martin M.E. Jou Y.S. Myers R.M. Roses A.D. Vance J.M. Strittmatter W.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), these results suggest that expression of htt exon 1 in lens cells mediates a redistribution of GAPDH to a particulate fraction by a physical interaction. Immunoblot analysis of protein lysates from the lenses with antibodies that recognize α-synuclein or GFP showed similar levels of transgene expression in GFP, α-Syn-WT, and α-Syn-A53T mice (Fig. 2B). As in 25Q–97Q mice, probing of immunoblots with an anti-GFP antibody showed some protein degradation in lens lysates from α-Syn-WT and α-Syn-A53T mice. Expression of a Mutant htt Fragment in the Lens Causes Supranuclear Inclusion Bodies—Lenses from 25Q and 72Q mice were analyzed in cryostat sections by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3). Consistent with the slit-lamp analyses (Fig. 1B), diffuse GFP fluorescence was observed in the lens nucleus in 25Q mice (Fig. 3A). However, sections from 72Q mice contained numerous distinct foci of GFP fluorescence resembling inclusion bodies that formed in a concentric shell around the nucleus; the thickness of the shell increased from ∼10 to 200 μm between 3 and 12 weeks of age (Fig. 3, B–D), which coincided with an increase in opacification observed by slit-lamp analyses (data not shown). The shell of inclusion bodies in 72Q mice was limited to a small region between the lens nucleus and cortex, also known as the supranuclear region or deep cortical region (Fig. 3, E–G). This region is composed of differentiated fiber cells that have lost all cellular organelles, including the nucleus. The molecular basis for the regional specificity of inclusion body formation in the lens is unclear but may be attributed to differences in the local concentration of chaperones and protein degradation machinery found in different regions of the lens. Some of the inclusion bodies could be labeled with an antibody against GFP (compare Fig. 3E with Fig. 3F). Although lens epithelial cells and differentiating fiber cells contain active proteasomes and ubiquitination machinery, the inclusion bodies in 72Q mice were deep to the layer of fiber cell differentiation (Fig. 3G) and did not react with ubiquitin antibodies (data not shown). The fluorescent foci were 3–5 μm in diameter (Fig. 4), similar in size to inclusion bodies found in the brains of HD patients (2DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar) and animal models (13Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The average diameters of the inclusion bodies increased in older cells located closer to the center of the lens, and inclusion bodies were typically observed adjacent to lens fiber cell membranes (Fig. 4, A–C). αB-Crystallin Suppresses Inclusion Body Formation in 72Q Mice—Since nearly 30% of protein in the lens is composed of a chaperone called α-crystallin, whose main function is to suppress protein aggregation (15Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we next tested whether reducing endogenous levels of αB-crystallin in lens cells would influence inclusion body formation in 72Q mice. Mice homozygous for a gene disruption in the Cryab locus (16Brady J.P. Garland D.L. Green D.E. Tamm E.R. Giblin F.J. Wawrousek E.F. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2924-2934PubMed Google Scholar) were bred with 72Q mice, and lens sections from 72Q mice lacking αB-crystallin (Cryab-/-;72Q) were analyzed by confocal microscopy. The thickness of the shell of inclusion bodies in lens sections from Cryab-/-;72Q mice aged 3 weeks was nearly the same as that in Cryab+/+;72Q mice aged 12 weeks in some lens regions (compare Fig. 3, H and I with Fig. 3D). The shell thickness in Cryab-/-;72Q mice was also more irregular than in Cryab+/+;72Q mice, with more inclusions observed in younger fiber cells in the lens cortex (compare Fig. 3, H and I with Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that αB-crystallin protects against 72Q inclusion body formation in vivo and suggest that regional variances exist in the expression level or functional capacity of αB-crystallin in the murine lens. Expression of α-Synuclein in the Lens Results in Membrane and Cytoplasmic Localization—Next, we analyzed cryostat sections of lenses from GFP (Fig. 5A), α-Syn-WT (Fig. 5K), and α-Syn-A53T mice (data not shown) by confocal microscopy. Dense GFP labeling was observed in all fiber cells, as predicted from previous characterization of the βB1-crystallin promoter (9Taube J.R. Gao C.Y. Ueda Y. Zelenka P.S. David L.L. Duncan M.K. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In lens sections from GFP mice analyzed at higher magnification, a diffuse GFP signal was observed on the epithelium (Fig. 5, B–D), a faint signal was observed on fiber cell membranes in the cortex (Fig. 5, E–G), and a prominent cytoplasmic localization was observed in the nuclear region (Fig. 5, H–J). The fluorescent signals from GFP expression in lens sections from α-Syn-WT (Fig. 5, K–T) and α-Syn-A53T mice (data not shown) were similar to that in mice expressing GFP alone. Unlike the 72Q mice, α-Syn-WT and α-Syn-A53T mice did not have large inclusion bodies. The mechanism for cataract formation in α-Syn-WT and α-Syn-A53T mice remains unclear. Since α-synuclein binds lipids and vesicles (17Rochet J.C. Outeiro T.F. Conway K.A. Ding T.T. Volles M.J. Lashuel H.A. Bieganski R.M. Lindquist S.L. Lansbury P.T. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 23: 23-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that cataracts in these mice arise from an impairment of the structure and function of fiber cell membranes in the lens nucleus. Expression of a Mutant htt Fragment in the Lens Results in Protein Aggregation—Laser light scattering has been used to noninvasively quantify protein aggregation leading to opacification over time in living mouse and human lenses (18Ansari R.R. King J.F. Seeberger T. Clark J.I. Proc. SPIE. 2003; 4951 (Ophthalmic Technology XIII): 168-176Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We used QLS to measure autocorrelation functions of the intensity fluctuations of light scattered from the supranuclear region, where opacities were observed to form first in slit-lamp views, from aged transgenic and control mice (Fig. 6). The QLS measurements suggested that the protein aggregates in the 72Q mice were larger than those that formed in the 25Q or WT mice. The QLS analysis (Fig. 6) was consistent with immunoblots of lens protein lysates that indicated that protein aggregates form in lenses from 72Q mice but not in 25Q and WT mice (Fig. 2). Expression of mutant htt fragments or α-synuclein in the murine lens results in protein aggregation and opacification that can be easily detected using a sensitive, noninvasive slit-lamp examination. The lens-specific models of disease-relevant protein aggregation described here have several advantages over conventional animal models of protein misfolding diseases that make them attractive for preliminary screens of drug bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. The first major advantage is the rapid pathological outcome. Protein aggregation/cataract formation is detectable by 3 weeks of age in 72Q/α-Syn-WT/α-Syn-A53T mice and increases >15-fold by 8 weeks of age. In contrast, aggregate deposition in the brains of current animal models of HD or PD does not occur until ∼2–15 months and progresses slowly (19Levine M.S. Cepeda C. Hickey M.A. Fleming S.M. Chesselet M.F. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 691-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of compounds on protein aggregation in our lens-specific models can be evaluated in trials that last as short as 2 weeks. The second advantage is that disease-relevant protein aggregation can be evaluated in live animals without anesthesia using a slit-lamp biomicroscope and QLS. The lens models therefore provide a disease-relevant biomarker that can be evaluated rapidly and repetitively in a highly sensitive, noninvasive manner, unlike the slow, labor-intensive process of analyzing postmortem brain tissue. The third advantage is that the lens-specific models may predict successful transport across the blood-brain barrier, an obstacle for potential therapeutic drugs for HD and PD. The ocular lens is neither vascularized nor innervated, and studies of drug permeability across the blood-lens barrier may identify drugs that are likely to cross the blood-brain barrier. Small compounds administered by various routes (oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, or by eye drops) can permeate the blood-lens barrier and inhibit cataracts (20Hiraoka T. Clark J.I. Li X.Y. Thurston G.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Hiraoka T. Clark J.I. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2550-2555PubMed Google Scholar). Although the lens-specific models will not be useful for studies of neuronal dysfunction or motor/behavioral/cognitive abnormalities relating to HD or PD, they should nonetheless be powerful tools to rapidly screen and identify compounds or genetic modifiers of disease-relevant protein aggregation that may prove efficacious in more physiologically relevant animal models of HD and PD.

https://openalex.org/W1993163599,"The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a key player in migraine. However, the transcription factors controlling CGRP expression in the migraine-relevant trigeminal ganglion neurons are unknown. Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that upstream stimulatory factor (USF) 1 and USF2 bind to the CGRP neuroendocrine-specific 18-bp enhancer, yet discrepant overexpression results in cell lines, and the ubiquitous nature of the USF cast doubts about its role. To test the functional role of USF, we first demonstrated that small interfering RNAs directed against USF1 and USF2 reduced endogenous CGRP RNA and preferentially targeted the USF binding site at the 18-bp enhancer in the neuronal-like CA77 cell line. In cultured rat trigeminal ganglion neurons, knockdown of either USF1 or USF2 reduced CGRP promoter activity. Conversely, overexpression of USF1 or USF2 increased promoter activity. The activation was even greater upon cotransfection with an upstream activator of mitogen-activated protein kinases and was synergistic in a heterologous cell line. To begin to address the paradox of how ubiquitous USF proteins might direct neuronal-specific activity, we examined USF expression and used a series of adenoviral reporters in the cultured ganglia. Unexpectedly, there was more intense USF immunostaining in neurons than nonneuronal cells. Importantly, the 18-bp USF enhancer driving a minimal promoter was sufficient for neuronal specificity, although it was not the only site that directed neuronal expression.

Headache. 2006; 46: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms underlying migraine remain controversial, there is a growing acceptance of the involvement of the trigeminal ganglion neurons, which express CGRP and relay nociceptive signals from the vasculature and dura to the brainstem (5Goadsby P.J. Lipton R.B. Ferrari M.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar, 6Pietrobon D. Striessnig J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Most notably, systemic administration of CGRP induces migraine-like symptoms among migraineurs (7Lassen L.H. Haderslev P.A. Jacobsen V.B. Iversen H.K. Sperling B. Olesen J. Cephalalgia. 2002; 22: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), and a CGRP receptor antagonist can attenuate migraine (8Olesen J.

The possibility that CGRP synthesis is elevated during migraine is suggested by elevation of serum CGRP levels during spontaneous migraine (9Goadsby P.J. Edvinsson L. Ekman R. Ann. Neurol. 1990; 28: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 10Juhasz G. Zsombok T. Jakab B. Nemeth J. Szolcsanyi J. Bagdy G. Cephalalgia. 2005; 25: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Given the generally long duration of migraine, it seems reasonable that these elevated CGRP levels might be sustained by increased transcription. Hence, an understanding of CGRP regulation in trigeminal neurons may provide clues regarding the pathophysiology of migraine. calcitonin gene-related peptide human CGRP upstream stimulatory factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase MEKK kinase reverse transcription quantitative PCR kilobase pair(s) green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline small interfering RNA thymidine kinase cytomegalovirus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. calcitonin gene-related peptide human CGRP upstream stimulatory factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase MEKK kinase reverse transcription quantitative PCR kilobase pair(s) green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline small interfering RNA thymidine kinase cytomegalovirus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We have previously reported that a heterodimer of the transcription factor USF1 and USF2 binds to the 18-bp enhancer of the CGRP gene in vitro (11Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition to the binding data, USF overexpression increased CGRP promoter activity in a lung carcinoma cell line (12Viney T.J. Schmidt T.W. Gierasch W. Sattar A.W. Yaggie R.E. Kuburas A. Quinn J.P. Coulson J.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49948-49955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the activation by USF was only observed in this non-neuronal cell line that does not express the endogenous CGRP gene. In contrast, in another non-neuronal cell line (COS7) and in the neuronal-like CA77 thyroid C cell line, USF overexpression failed to stimulate promoter activity. 3T. J. Viney and A. F. Russo, unpublished observations.3T. J. Viney and A. F. Russo, unpublished observations. Furthermore, the 18-bp enhancer is active only in neuroendocrine thyroid C cell lines (11Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), yet USF is ubiquitous (13Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These discrepancies raised the need to demonstrate whether USF is indeed a regulator of the CGRP 18-bp enhancer in neurons. USF was initially identified as a cellular transcription factor for the adenovirus-2 major late gene (14Hough P.V. Mastrangelo I.A. Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4826-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Moncollin V. Miyamoto N.G. Zheng X.M. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because of this initial finding, USF has been identified as a transcription factor for many genes involved in a range of cellular processes, including proliferation (16Luo X. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), stress responses (17Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and metabolism (18Read M.L. Clark A.R. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The two USF proteins, USF1 and USF2, share 44% identity overall and 70% identity within the C-terminal region, which includes basic-helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains (13Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The two proteins can form homodimers, although the heterodimer is usually the most abundant form (13Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 19Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 3758-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). USF1 and USF2 are ubiquitously expressed, including in the nervous system (13Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A paradox is that several helix-loop-helix proteins that are ubiquitously expressed, including USF, can also be involved in cell-specific expression (21Corre S. Galibert M.D. Pigm. Cell Res. 2005; 18: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The USF proteins can be regulated by phosphorylation. In vitro kinase assays have shown that p38 MAP kinase, but not Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylates threonine 153 of USF1 (17Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of USF1 by p38 MAP kinase is necessary for transcriptional activation of the tyrosinase promoter (17Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A physical interaction between phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and USF1 has been suggested (23Kutz S.M. Higgins C.E. Samarakoon R. Higgins S.P. Allen R.R. Qi L. Higgins P.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1093-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, ERK MAP kinase appears to act through USF to stimulate the Cox-2 promoter (24Juttner S. Cramer T. Wessler S. Walduck A. Gao F. Schmitz F. Wunder C. Weber M. Fischer S.M. Schmidt W.E. Wiedenmann B. Meyer T.F. Naumann M. Hocker M. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). USF1 and USF2 are also phosphorylated in response to phorbol ester and forskolin stimulation (25Sayasith K. Lussier J.G. Sirois J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28885-28893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Chen J. Malcolm T. Estable M.C. Roeder R.G. Sadowski I. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4396-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the CGRP 18-bp enhancer is stimulated by the ERK MAP kinase pathway (27Durham P.L. Russo A.F. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 807-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and probably other MAP kinases (28Bowen E.J. Schmidt T.W. Firm C.S. Russo A.F. Durham P.L. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is possible that MAP kinases may also activate the CGRP promoter via USF proteins in trigeminal neurons. In this report we demonstrate that USF proteins are activators of the CGRP promoter in cultured neurons derived from rat trigeminal ganglia. USF knockdown and overexpression resulted in a decrease and increase, respectively, of CGRP promoter activity. Moreover, overexpression of the MAP kinase activators, mitogen-activated/ERK kinase (MEK) kinase (MEKK) or MEK1, with USF1 or USF2 further increased CGRP promoter activation, whereas USF knockdown reduced MEKK activation of the CGRP promoter. Finally, immunocytochemistry showed that the 18-bp enhancer containing the USF site is sufficient for neuronal-specific CGRP promoter activity. Transfection of Cell Lines—Culture conditions for CA77 and NCI-H460 cells have been described (12Viney T.J. Schmidt T.W. Gierasch W. Sattar A.W. Yaggie R.E. Kuburas A. Quinn J.P. Coulson J.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49948-49955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). CA77 cells were transfected when they reached ∼80% confluence in a 12-well plate (Falcon), as described (12Viney T.J. Schmidt T.W. Gierasch W. Sattar A.W. Yaggie R.E. Kuburas A. Quinn J.P. Coulson J.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49948-49955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), with some modifications. CA77 cells (1 ml) were cotransfected with 20 nm nonspecific control, USF1, or USF2 siRNA duplexes and 0.25 μg of reporter plasmid. The plasmids 18-bp-TK-luc, TK-luc, 1.25-rCGRP-luc, and 1.25-rCGRP Bam mut have been described (12Viney T.J. Schmidt T.W. Gierasch W. Sattar A.W. Yaggie R.E. Kuburas A. Quinn J.P. Coulson J.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15965-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 48–96 h after cotransfection, cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using reagents from Promega. NCI-H460 cells were transfected by electroporation as described (12Viney T.J. Schmidt T.W. Gierasch W. Sattar A.W. Yaggie R.E. Kuburas A. Quinn J.P. Coulson J.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49948-49955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to protein using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and to β-galactosidase activity measured using Tropix Galacto-Light Plus Assay System (Tropix). For all transfections (CA77, NCI-H460, and primary cultures) plasmid concentrations were held constant with pSV40-β-galactosidase (30Wood J.L. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21262-21271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), pCMV5 (27Durham P.L. Russo A.F. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 807-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or pMyc-His (Invitrogen) as indicated. siRNA Duplexes—USF1 and USF2 siRNA duplexes were purchased from Invitrogen. Three different siRNA duplexes were initially transfected into CA77 cells and tested for their effects on CGRP promoter activity. Two USF1 siRNA duplexes decreased promoter activity, whereas the other duplex did not affect activity. The most potent duplex was used for later studies. Only one USF2 siRNA duplex decreased promoter activity. Rat USF1 siRNA is 5′-CCCAACGUCAAGUACGUCUUCCGAA-3′; rat USF2 siRNA is 5′-GCAUCCUGUCCAAGGCUUGCGAUUA-3′. Stealth™ RNAi Negative Control Medium GC Duplex (Invitrogen) was used as the nonspecific control siRNA duplex. Reverse Transcription (RT) and Quantitative PCR (qPCR)—Transfection of siRNA duplexes was performed as described above. A plasmid encoding cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) was cotransfected with either 5 nm nonspecific control siRNA or USF siRNA (2.5 nm USF1 siRNA and 2.5 nm USF2 siRNA) duplexes. After 72 h, GFP-positive cells were collected by flow cytometry, and RNA was extracted using a QIAshredder column and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). For each sample, about 500 ng of DNase I-treated RNA was applied per RT reaction using a random primer as recommended (Applied Biosystems). One-tenth of the cDNA was subjected to real-time qPCR using SYBR Green as described (31Zhang Z. Winborn C.S. Marquez de Prado B. Russo A.F. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2693-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) with 50 nm CGRP primers or 333 nm 18 S rRNA primers. For each sample qPCR was performed in triplicate. The PCR protocol was 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60.7 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR primers were: rat CGRP (GenBank M11597) sense, 5′-AACCTTAGAAAGCAGCCCAGGCATG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTGGGCACAAAGTTGTCCTTCACCA-3′; rat 18 S rRNA (GenBank V0127), sense, 5′-ATGGCCGTTCTTAGTTGGTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-AACGCCACTTGTCCCTCTAA-3′. Relative quantification of CGRP mRNA level was determined using the ΔΔCt method (32Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (120953) Google Scholar). Isolation and Culture of Neurons from Rat Trigeminal Ganglia—Ganglia were removed from Sprague-Dawley rat pups (2–4 days old) and cultured as previously described with some modifications (31Zhang Z. Winborn C.S. Marquez de Prado B. Russo A.F. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2693-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Four ganglia were used per sample. Cells were resuspended in complete medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml mouse 2.5 S nerve growth factor (Alomone Labs), L-15 medium (Leibovitz)) and plated onto laminin (Roche Applied Science)-coated coverslips placed in a 6-well dish. The laminin-coated coverslips were prepared by loading 4 μg of laminin dissolved in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) onto each 4-cm2 coverslip and subsequent overnight incubation at 4 °C. Transfection of Rat Trigeminal Ganglia Cultures—The 2.24-kb-human CGRP promoter-luciferase plasmid (hCGRP-luc) was generated by homologous recombination of pDestination C-Luc and pENTR-hCGRP. pDestination C-Luc was generated by subcloning the β-globin/IgG chimeric intron from pCI (Promega) into BamHI and PstI sites of pGEM®-4Z (Promega) to make pStec1 and firefly luciferase from pGL3-Basic (Promega) into XhoI and XbaI sites of pStec1. The resultant plasmid (pStec1-luc) was linearized by digestion with PstI, treated with mung bean nuclease, then ligated with Gateway® Reading Frame Cassette C.1 (Invitrogen). pENTR-hCGRP was generated by subcloning a PCR fragment of the 2.24-kb hCGRP promoter into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) then into the EcoRI site of Gateway® pENTR™11 vector (Invitrogen). Human USF1 and mouse USF2 expression vectors have been described (12Viney T.J. Schmidt T.W. Gierasch W. Sattar A.W. Yaggie R.E. Kuburas A. Quinn J.P. Coulson J.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49948-49955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The T153A and T153E mutant USF1 vectors were generated from the USF1 vector using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The MEKK (amino acids 380–672) plasmid from Stratagene has been described (30Wood J.L. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21262-21271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Within 24 h of culturing the dissociated cells in each well of a 6-well dish (Falcon) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (ratio, 1 μg to 1 or 2 μl) in warm L-15 medium. After incubation with transfecting solutions, cultured cells were scraped with 1 ml of PBS and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. Cell lysates were prepared with 50 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and subjected to freeze-thawing to aid lysis. For luciferase activity assays, 20 μl of lysate was mixed with reagents from Promega. Transfections of siRNA duplexes involved procedures similar to the plasmid transfections. After 48–72 h, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity and Western blotting. Adenoviral Infections of Trigeminal Ganglia Cultures—AdrCGRP-luc, an adenovirus containing the 1.25-rCGRP fused with firefly luciferase in pGL3 has been described (28Bowen E.J. Schmidt T.W. Firm C.S. Russo A.F. Durham P.L. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The AdrCGRP-Bam-luc adenoviral vector has a BamHI linker inserted into the 1.25-rCGRP. The 1.25-kb rCGRP-Bam mutant promoter fragment was obtained by digestion of the 1.25-kb rCGRP-Bam-luc plasmid (12Viney T.J. Schmidt T.W. Gierasch W. Sattar A.W. Yaggie R.E. Kuburas A. Quinn J.P. Coulson J.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49948-49955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with XbaI and SacI, then subcloned into the Nhe and SacI sites of the pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega) and transferred as an XbaI-KpnI fragment into pacAd5K-NpA adenoviral shuttle vector. Adenoviruses were generated and purified by the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Core Facility. An adenoviral vector containing a minimal TK promoter with three copies of the 18-bp enhancer and the β-galactosidase reporter gene (Ad18-bp-TK-lacZ) was generated from a lacZ shuttle plasmid and the previously described 18-bp-TK-luciferase plasmid (29Tverberg L.A. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15965-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AdCMV-β-galactosidase (AdCMV-lacZ) adenoviral vector has been described (33Durham P.L. Dong P.X. Belasco K.T. Kasperski J. Gierasch W.W. Edvinsson L. Heistad D.D. Faraci F.M. Russo A.F. Brain Res. 2004; 997: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Trigeminal ganglia cultures were infected with adenovirus 24 h after plating. Cultures were incubated with 200 μl of L-15 media containing 1.1 × 108 plaque-forming units of AdrCGRP-luc or AdrCGRP-Bam-luc per sample for 4-h at 37 °C and ambient CO2. Then 2 ml of the complete medium described above was added. After 24 h of incubation, cultures were subjected to immunocytochemistry. For infections of Ad18-bp-TK-lacZ and AdCMV-lacZ, 2 × 109 or 2.4 × 109 plaque-forming units, respectively, were used. After 36 h of incubation immunocytochemistry was performed. Immunocytochemistry—Cultures were rinsed in PBS and fixed in cold methanol for 10 min at –20 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. This was followed by 1 h of incubation with primary antibodies, a monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin III antibody (1:800 dilution, Sigma), and a polyclonal rabbit anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The primary antibodies were diluted in 1.5% bovine serum albumin containing PBS. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated in 10% bovine serum albumin containing PBS for 30 min. Then rhodamine anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were added to the cells. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with ToPro3 (1:1000 diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide, Molecular Probes) for 5 min. For USF1 and USF2 immunocytochemistry, a similar process was followed. Primary antibodies were rabbit IgG anti-USF1 (sc-229) and anti-USF2 (sc-861) used at a dilution of 1:50. For immunocytochemistry of NCI-H460 cells, cells were transfected with 20 μg of pCMV-GFP and 20 μg of USF expression vector. After 3 days of incubation, a similar process was performed using a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:800 dilution, G 6539, Sigma) and rabbit IgG anti-USF antibody (1:50–1:500 dilution). For luciferase immunocytochemistry, infected rat trigeminal ganglia cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with 1:1 (v/v) acetone:water for 3 min at 4 °C followed by acetone for 5 min at 4 °C. Then cells were incubated with 1:1 (v/v) acetone:water for 3 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS for 3 min, samples were blocked with 1% fetal bovine serum (diluted in PBS) for 15 min. Samples were incubated with a goat anti-luciferase antibody (1:50 dilution, Promega) and a mouse anti-β-tubulin III antibody (1:800 dilution) in 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 1 h. After washing 3 × 5 min with PBS, samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-goat IgG and rhodamine-anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 30 min. After 3 × 5 min washes with PBS, ToPro3 was added for 5 min. Images were taken by using confocal microscope (Zeiss). For analysis of nuclear versus cytoplasmic staining, USF1 and USF2 images were analyzed at different focal planes with z-stack program then compiled to generate one image for the figure. USF staining results were confirmed by blind analyses done by a second individual. Western Blotting—Cell lysates were analyzed as described (12Viney T.J. Schmidt T.W. Gierasch W. Sattar A.W. Yaggie R.E. Kuburas A. Quinn J.P. Coulson J.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49948-49955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except that transfers were done at 45 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilutions overnight at 4 °C, and secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5,000–10,000 for 0.5–1-h incubations. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with new primary antibody after blocking. The rabbit IgG anti-USF1 (sc-229) and anti-USF2 (sc-861), goat anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, sc-20357), and donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (used to detect the anti-GAPDH antibodies) were all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To detect the anti-USF antibodies, donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) were used. The mean value from the histogram analysis performed using the NIH ImageJ software was used for the quantification of protein band intensity. USF Knockdown Decreases CGRP mRNA Levels in CA77 Cells—Our first test was to determine whether USF proteins regulate the endogenous CGRP gene. This was particularly important because our previous evidence for USF activation of the CGRP promoter (12Viney T.J. Schmidt T.W. Gierasch W. Sattar A.W. Yaggie R.E. Kuburas A. Quinn J.P. Coulson J.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49948-49955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was not observed in the neuronal-like CA77 thyroid C cell line, which expresses CGRP. To resolve this issue, we used siRNA-mediated knockdown of USF proteins followed by RT-qPCR measurement of CGRP mRNA. The use of the CA77 cells was necessary because initial attempts to reduce endogenous CGRP RNA by USF1 and USF2 siRNAs in trigeminal ganglia cultures were not successful (data not shown). This may have been due to a more stable pool of CGRP mRNA in neurons than reported in a cell line (half-life about 17 h) (34Cote G.J. Gagel R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15524-15528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has been observed for the mRNAs of heavy and mid-sized neurofilament subunits (35Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another possible reason could have been the cellular heterogeneity of the cultures if siRNA duplexes were taken up by non-neuronal cells more easily than by neurons. To resolve these technical problems, we turned to the homogenous CA77 cell line to examine the endogenous CGRP gene. A combination of siRNAs targeting USF1 and USF2 was transfected into CA77 cells. The pCMV-GFP reporter plasmid was included to allow for the selection of transfected cells by flow cytometry before RNA extraction. CGRP mRNA levels in the samples were measured by RT-qPCR and were normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA levels in the same samples. The data were then compared with the signal obtained after treatment of the cells with nonspecific control siRNA duplexes. We found that the combined transfection of siRNAs targeting USF1 and USF2 decreased the level of the endogenous CGRP mRNA to about 60% that in controls (Fig. 1A). Likewise, the protein levels of USF1 and USF2 were reduced to 42 and 81%, respectively, that in samples transfected with the control siRNA (Fig. 1B). As a loading and specificity control, GAPDH levels were not affected (96–104% of the levels after transfection with control siRNA) (Fig. 1B). Overall, these results indicate that expression of the endogenous CGRP gene in CA77 cells requires USF proteins. Specificity of USF siRNA Duplexes—Given that the USF proteins regulate many genes, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of USF could potentially ind"

The GABAB receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), modulates neurotransmitter release from pre-synaptic neurons or hyperpolarization of post-synaptic membranes (1Bowery N.G. Hill D.R. Hudson A.L. Doble A. Middlemiss D.N. Shaw J. Turnbull M. Nature. 1980; 283: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 2Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Mosbacher J. Gassmann M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 835-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The GABAB receptor belongs to the class C GPCR, together with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1–8), a Ca2+-sensing receptor and some pheromone and taste receptors. Each class C GPCR member consists of three functional regions: a large N-terminal extracellular region (ECR) that binds ligands, a seven-spanning transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region. Another feature of these receptors is that they function as dimers. mGluRs and Ca2+-sensing receptor form functional homodimers, and the crystal structures of the homodimeric ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of mGluR1, mGluR3, and mGluR7 have been determined (3Kunishima N.

Jingami H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3759-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the GABAB receptor forms a heterodimer consisting of two subunits, GABAB1 receptor (GBR1) and GABAB2 receptor (GBR2).The two GBR subunits share ∼35% amino acid sequence similarity. The first GBR subunits, isolated by expression cloning using a specific synthetic radiolabeled ligand (5Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C.

Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), are two isoforms, named GBR1a and GBR1b. They differ in the N terminus, where GBR1a possesses a repeat of consensus sequences for the complement protein (also called Sushi domain), and it is missing in the GBR1b. Because no significant differences have been revealed about the two main GBR1 isoforms in a number of pharmacological studies, we focused on GBR1a to simplify the biochemical study (GBR1a is termed GBR1 hereafter). When a recombinant GBR1 is expressed by itself in COS cells, it remains intracellular, and the transfected cells lack ligand binding ability (7Couve A. Filippov A.K. Connolly C.N. Bettler B.

In further studies, the GBR2 subunit was discovered by several groups (8Jones K.A. Borowsky B. Tamm J.A. Craig D.A. Durkin M.M. Dai M. Yao W.-J. Johnson M. Gunwaldsen C. Huang L.-Y. Tang C. Shen Q.

Subsequently, when GBR1cDNA was co-transfected with GBR2cDNA simultaneously, both subunits were expressed on the cell surface, and the cells clearly showed ligand binding activity. Interestingly, GBR2 increased the affinities of agonists to GBR1, but not that of an antagonist (9White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A. Emson P. Foord S.M.

In addition, yeast two-hybrid experiments indicated that both subunits interact at their coiled-coil intracellular regions. Truncation and amino acid mutation experiments revealed that this association is involved in shielding an ER retention signal close to the coiled-coil region within the GBR1 intracellular region and enables the combined GBR subunits to transport to the cell surface (12Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 13Pagano A. Rovelli G. Mosbacher J. Lohmann T. Duthey B. Stauffer D. Ristig D.

However, this C-terminal interaction between both subunits is not essential for dimerizing the receptor complex per se, because removal of the GBR1 C terminus allows the assembly of a functional heterodimer (13Pagano A. Rovelli G. Mosbacher J. Lohmann T. Duthey B. Stauffer D. Ristig D. Schuler V. Meigel I. Lampert C. Stein T. Prézeau L. Blahos J. Pin J.-P. Froestl W. Kuhn R. Heid J. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. J.

Pangalos M.N. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments also showed that both subunits interact at the ECR on the cell surface (15Liu J. Maurel D. Etzol S. Brabet I. Ansanay H. Pin J.-P. Rondard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15824-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, these previous data indicated that GBR1 and GBR2 interact in the extracellular region and/or transmembrane region; however, the interaction manner at the molecular level has not been completely deciphered.The amino acids responsible for ligand binding in the GBR1 subunit have been postulated by homology modeling to the crystal structures of the mGluR1-LBD and amino acid mutagenesis experiments (16Kniazeff J. Galvez T. Labesse G. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7352-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acids that possibly participate in the ligand binding are well conserved among several species. However, the corresponding residues in the GBR2 subunit vary among species, and amino acid substitutions of these residues did not prevent GABA activation of the receptor (16Kniazeff J. Galvez T. Labesse G. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7352-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, GBR2 itself is considered not to bind ligands, whereas G-proteins interact with specific intracellular sites in GBR2 (17Galvez T. Duthey B. Kniazeff J. Blahos J. Rovelli G. Bettler B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3236-3241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The extracellular signals received by GBR1 are transmitted to the cytoplasmic region of GBR2 through an allosteric interaction between the two subunits. Thus, signal transmission in the GABAB receptor has been proposed to occur via initial ligand binding to the binding pocket within the GBR1 subunit, followed by allosteric conformational changes in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the GBR2 subunit, and, finally, G-protein activation. This scenario is consistent with experimental data to date; however, the mechanistic details remain elusive. As a first step toward understanding how the ligand-binding signal is propagated within a receptor protein, it is crucial to determine the LBD of the GABAB receptor and to obtain a sufficient amount of the purified protein for biophysical studies. Previously, Malitschek et al. (21Malitschek B. Schweizer C. Keir M. Heid J. Froestl W. Mosbacher J. Kuhn R. Henley J. Joly C. Pin J.-P. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) reported that the GBR1 extracellular region can be produced as a soluble protein and that it retains the binding pharmacology of wild-type GBR1, as determined by photoaffinity labeling.Here we report a method to express and partially purify a soluble form of the ECRs of both GBR subunits in the insect cell/baculovirus system. Although the obtained GBR1-ECR showed imperfect binding activity possibly due to incorrect folding component (see “Discussion”), interaction between the soluble GBR1-ECR and GBR2-ECR and its effect on agonist affinity have been proved using several biochemical assays. These results directly demonstrated the function of the interaction between the extracellular regions of the two subunits, which has been previously suggested only in a cell-based assay. We also detected homo-oligomerization states of these soluble proteins. These results provide insights for the interaction manner of the extracellular domains of the heteromeric GABAB subunits. Our method reported here would facilitate structural studies to further understand the activation mechanism at an atomic resolution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials–Baclofen, CGP54626, and [3H]CGP54626 (53.31 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Tocris (UK). GABA was purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Proligo (Japan).Construction of Expression Vectors for GBR1-ECRs and GBR2-ECR–To make expression plasmids for the ECRs of GBR1 and GBR2, we performed PCR with the full-length human GBR1 and GBR2 cDNAs, which were kindly provided by Prof. Bernhard Bettler (University of Basel), as templates. In the case of GBR1-ECR, a forward primer was designed with a BamHI site just after the 3′-end of the coding sequence of an endogenous GBR1 signal peptide. The reverse primer was designed with a stop codon, followed by an XbaI site. The PCR product was cloned using the BamHI and XbaI sites of pBlueScript, which contains a hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) tag just upstream of the BamHI site. The cDNA fragment was excised using the NotI and XbaI sites, which were in multiple cloning sites of pBlueScript, and the fragment was inserted into the pFastBac DUAL vector, resulting in the transfer vector pGBR1-ECR1. For the longer GBR1-ECR2 and -ECR3 constructs, PCRs were performed with a forward primer with an MfeI site and reverse primers designed at distinct positions with a stop codon followed by a NheI site. The two PCR products were replaced with the MfeI-XbaI fragment in pGBR1-ECR1, resulting in pGBR1-ECR2 and -ECR3. For GBR2-ECR, the forward primer was designed with an Eco47III site just after the coding region of the endogenous signal sequence, and the reverse primer was designed with a sequence encoding His6, followed by an XbaI site, at the putative 3′-end of the GBR2-ECRcDNA. The PCR product was exchanged with the mGluR1cDNA previously cloned into the pFastBac DUAL vector using the Eco47III and XbaI sites. Consequently, an artificial GBR2cDNA, containing a DNA sequence encoding the mGluR1 signal sequence instead of the original signal sequence, was prepared.Production of Baculoviruses for Protein Expression–Baculoviruses for protein expression were obtained by the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells were propagated in a monolayer at 27 °C in TNM-FH (Grace's powder medium, 0.4% yeastolate, 0.3% lactalbumin hydrolysate, 0.1% pluronic F-68, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B). The vector DNA was transformed into DH10Bac Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). The recombinant bacmid DNA purified from the DH10Bac cells was then transfected into Sf-9 insect cells, using the Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). After incubation for 72 h at 27 °C, the viruses were amplified by re-infecting the Sf-9 cells to enhance the viral titer. Finally, the viral titer was checked by a plaque formation assay, using an immobilized monolayer culture of Sf-9 cells.Protein Expression and Purification–HighFive cells were cultured in a monolayer at 27 °C in Express Five serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 18 mm l-glutamine. The GBR1-ECRs and GBR2-ECR proteins were expressed by inoculating the baculoviruses into the HighFive cells. The cell culture medium was collected 4 days after the inoculation. After the addition of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Purification of the protein was facilitated by the FLAG and His tags. In the case of the GBR1-ECRs, the supernatant was applied directly to anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) packed in a disposable column (Bio-Rad). After the column was washed with low salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 20 mm NaCl), the protein bound to the column was eluted by high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 118 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 4.7 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm CaCl2) containing the FLAG peptide at a concentration of 150 μg/ml. The supernatant containing the GBR2-ECR protein was directly applied to nickel-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) packed in a disposable column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with phosphate buffer (0.5 m NaCl and 20 mm sodium phosphate), and the protein bound to the column was eluted with the phosphate buffer containing 150 mm imidazole.Western Blotting–The culture medium was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with 3% bovine serum albumin and then was incubated for 1 h with anti-FLAG and anti-His antibodies at room temperature. The membrane was washed and then incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase at room temperature. Color development was done in ALP buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) using the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium Color Development Substrate (Promega).Ligand Binding Assay–The ligand binding assay was performed by the polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method, as previously described (22Tsuji Y. Shimada Y. Takeshita T. Kajimura N. Nomura S. Sekiyama N. Otomo J. Usukura J. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28144-28151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 3H-Labeled CGP54626, GABA, and the protein solution were mixed in 150 μl of the high salt buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, 6-kDa PEG was added to the sample to a final concentration of 15%, along with 3 mg/ml γ-globulin. After vortexing and centrifugation, the precipitated material was washed twice with 1 ml of 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 2.5 mm CaCl2 containing 8% 6-kDa PEG, and then was dissolved in 1 ml of water. After the addition of 14 ml of ClearsolII (Nacalai Tesque), the radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter.Density Gradient Centrifugation–The GBR1-ECR3 protein, partially purified by the anti-FLAG M2 column, the GBR2-ECR protein, partially purified by the nickel column, and a mixture of both proteins were sedimented through 15–35% sucrose gradients formed with the high salt buffer. The gradients were made using a Gradient Master (BioComp, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Samples were applied to the top of the sucrose gradient and were centrifuged in an SW41 (Beckman) rotor for 22 h at 40,000 rpm. After the centrifugation, the samples were fractionated into 150-μl aliquots by a piston gradient fractionator (BioComp, Inc.). The fractionated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-FLAG and anti-His antibodies. An anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was then applied. Proteins were visualized and quantified using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSExpression and Purification of the Extracellular Regions of the GABAB Receptor–Fig. 1 shows diagrams of the recombinant proteins of the GABAB receptor ECRs used in the baculovirus infection experiments. To determine the C-terminal ends of the soluble forms of the ECRs by analogy, we first aligned the amino acid sequences of the GABAB receptor ECR and the mGluR1-LBD, and then constructed transfer vectors for the expression of the three GBR1-ECRs (GBR1-ECR1–3) and the GBR2-ECR. Because we expected that efficient secretion was a key step to obtain these soluble proteins, we replaced the original signal peptides by exogenous signal peptides, which had been working well in our laboratory. As shown in Fig. 1, the signal peptide from influenza virus hemagglutinin was added to the N termini of the GBR1-ECRs, whereas that of mGuR1 was exploited for GBR2-ECR. Consequently, both proteins were secreted well and accumulated in the culture medium. We then purified these soluble proteins by affinity chromatography. The expression and purification of these extracellular fragments were confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and Western blotting as shown in Fig. 2. The three GBR1 fragments (GBR1-ECR1–3) migrated to positions, slightly lower than 75 kDa. Their sizes correspond to the molecular mass of 64 kDa calculated from the amino acid compositions. The GBR2-ECR was detected at a position around 50 kDa. This size also corresponds to the molecular mass of GBR2-ECR. Thus, all three GBR1-ECRs and GBR2-ECR were confirmed to have been secreted into the culture medium. The purified GBR1-ECR3 and GBR2-ECR proteins were concentrated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining, to assess the purity. Although a few extra bands were observed (Fig. 2, C and D), especially at the high molecular mass regions in the GBR1-ECR3 lane, each protein was pure enough to perform the following biochemical experiments.FIGURE 2Purification of the FLAG-tagged GBR1-ECRs and the His-tagged GBR2-ECR. GBR1-ECR1–3 were expressed and purified with anti-FLAG M2-agarose gel. Eluted samples were run on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by silver staining, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and Western blotting using specific antibodies, as shown. The arrows indicate bands corresponding to GBR1-ECR1 (A), GBR1-ECR2 (B), and GBR1-ECR3 (C). GBR2-ECR was expressed and purified with a nickel-Sepharose column. The arrows indicate bands corresponding to GBR2-ECR (D). Samples of 1.0 μg (GBR1-ECR3) and 0.4 μg (GBR2-ECR) were fractionated and silver stained. Concentrated samples of 4.5 μg (GBR1-ECR3) and 7.3 μg (GBR2-ECR) were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ligand Binding Assay of the GBR1-ECRs–We investigated the ligand-binding abilities of GBR1-ECR1–3, using 3H-labeled CGP54626 ([3H]CGP54626) by the PEG-precipitation method, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 3A). The final concentration of [3H]CGP54626 was 20 nm. Although [3H]CGP54626 did not bind to GBR1-ECR1 and -ECR2, its binding to GBR1-ECR3 was clear. Furthermore, in the presence of non-labeled GABA, the binding was displaced. This result was intriguing, because the difference between GBR1-ECR2 and GBR1-ECR3 was the five additional amino acid residues at the C terminus of GBR1-ECR3. As a result, these five amino acid residues were shown to be important for the proper protein folding required for ligand binding ability. However, the GBR2-ECR itself did not bind the ligand, consistent with previous reports (16Kniazeff J. Galvez T. Labesse G. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7352-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Ligand binding assays of the soluble GABAB receptor fragments. A, the amount of [3H]CGP54626 bound to the three GBR1-ECRs and one GBR2-ECR, in equilibrium with 20 nm [3H]CGP54626, was measured in the presence and absence of 1.0 mm non-labeled GABA. Each of the GBR1-ECR1–3 fragments (1.5 μg) and 10 μg of GBR2-ECR were used. Each binding experiment was performed in triplicate, and each bar shows mean ± S.E. B, saturation binding curves of [3H]CGP54626 to the GBR1-ECRs. Each of the GBR1-ECRs (1.5 μg) was incubated in the high salt buffer with increasing concentrations of [3H]CGP54626 (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40, and 100 nm). The results for GBR1-ECR3 and GBR1-ECR2 are shown in squares and triangles, respectively. Values are the means ± S.E. of at least three experiments performed in triplicate. C, dose-response curves of various agonists and an antagonist in inhibiting [3H]CGP54626 binding to the GBR1-ECR3. GBR1-ECR3 (1.5 μg) and 5 nm [3H]CGP54626 were used in the binding experiment. GABA (squares), baclofen (triangles), and the antagonist CGP54626 (inverted triangles) competed with 5 nm [3H]CGP54626 binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next investigated saturation binding. The amount of specific ligand binding to GBR1-ECR3 increased and plateaued at a concentration of ∼40 nm [3H]CGP54626 (Fig. 3B, squares), while significant binding to the GBR1-ECR2 was not observed (Fig. 3B, triangles). The dissociation constant (Kd) of this ligand for GBR1-ECR3 was 8.7 ± 2.3 nm. Bmax was 1.12 ± 0.154 nmol/mg of protein. This was 7% of the theoretical value, which was calculated on the assumption that all of the purified proteins had normal binding activity. Therefore only 7% of the obtained proteins were active. The other 93% were inactive probably because of incorrect protein folding (see “Discussion”). Although the incompleteness of protein purification can affect results of quantitative analyses, which need precise active protein concentration, it does not affect results of qualitative analyses such as a competition binding assay or detection of interaction with other proteins. Therefore we proceeded with the following qualitative analyses using this protein.The inhibition of [3H]CGP54626 binding by two agonists and an antagonist was examined. The dose-response curves are shown in Fig. 3C. The rank order of inhibition was CGP54626 ≫ GABA > baclofen (Table 1).TABLE 1Half-maximal inhibition (IC50) values of three ligands in [3H]CGP54626 binding to GBR1-ECR3 in the presence and absence of GBR2-ECR and mGluR1-LBDLigandIC50GABABaclofenCGP54626μmnmGBR1-ECR323.54 ± 0.344.44 ± 0.419.47 ± 0.8GBR1-ECR3 + GBR2-ECR6.71 ± 1.712.38 ± 0.227.45 ± 6.5GBR1-ECR3 + mGluR1-LBD19.43 ± 0.3NDaND, not determined.NDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Interaction between GBR1-ECR3 and GBR2-ECR–Because both the GBR1-ECR3 and GBR2-ECR proteins were successfully expressed in soluble forms, we investigated whether GBR1-ECR3 and GBR2-ECR interact with each other in vitro. The viruses encoding the two proteins were co-infected into the insect cells simultaneously. The supernatant of the culture medium was concentrated and loaded on the anti-FLAG M2 column. After washing with low salt buffer, the bound material was eluted with a FLAG peptide and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The membranes were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody and an anti-His antibody. The samples eluted from the column should contain GBR1-ECR3, because it was trapped by the FLAG peptide tag attached at the N terminus, but not the free GBR2 fragment, unless GBR2-ECR was associated with GBR1-ECR3. GBR1-ECR3 was detected with the anti-FLAG antibody, as shown in Fig. 4A, left, whereas a protein band of ∼50 kDa was detected with the anti-His antibody (Fig. 4A, right). This band is possibly GBR2-ECR, because the molecular mass of GBR2-ECR is 50 kDa and it contains the His tag at its C terminus. To confirm that this band was not due to nonspecific trapping by the anti-FLAG column, GBR2-ECR alone was expressed independently, and the culture medium was loaded onto the anti-FLAG column and eluted with the FLAG peptide. No protein band was detected in the elution by the anti-His antibody (Fig. 4B). Consequently, this indicates that the GBR2-ECR was bound to the anti-FLAG column through the interaction with the GBR1-ECR3, suggesting that the soluble GBR1 and GBR2 extracellular fragments interact with each other under these solution conditions.FIGURE 4Interaction between GBR1-ECR3 and GBR2-ECR.

https://openalex.org/W2006737672,"DNA and RNA polymerases use a common phosphoryl transfer mechanism for base addition that requires two or three acidic amino acid residues at their active sites. We previously showed, for the reverse transcriptase (RT) encoded by the yeast retrotransposon Ty1, that one of the three conserved active site aspartates (D211) can be substituted by asparagine and still retain in vitro polymerase activity, although in vivo transposition is lost. Transposition is partially restored by second site suppressor mutations in the RNAse H domain. The novel properties of this amino acid substitution led us to express the WT and D211N mutant enzymes, and study their pre-steady state kinetic parameters. We found that the kpol was reduced by a factor of 223 in the mutant, although the Kd for nucleotide binding was unaltered. Further, the mutant enzyme had a marked preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+. To better understand the functions of this residue within the Ty1 RT active site, we have now examined the in vitro properties of WT and D211N mutant Ty1 RTs in carrying out pyrophosphorolysis, the reverse reaction to polymerization, where pyrophosphate is the substrate and dNTPs are the product. We find that pyrophosphorolysis is efficient only when the base-paired primer template region is >14 bases, and that activity increases when the primer end is blunt-ended or recessed by only a few bases. Using pre-steady state kinetic analysis, we find that the rate of pyrophosphorolysis (kpyro) in the D211N mutant is nearly 320 fold lower than the WT enzyme, and that the mutant enzyme has an ∼170 fold lower apparent Kd for pyrophosphate. These findings indicate that subtle substrate differences can strongly affect the enzyme's ability to properly position the primer-end to carry out pyrophosphorolysis. Further the kinetic data suggests that the D211 residue has a role in pyrophosphate binding and release, which could affect polymerase translocation, and help explain the D211N mutant's transposition defect."
