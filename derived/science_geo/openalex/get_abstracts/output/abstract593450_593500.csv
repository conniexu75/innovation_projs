https://openalex.org/W2749613778,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, and there is great interest in understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of individual tumors. We used systems-level approaches to analyze the genome-wide transcriptome of the protein-coding genes of 17 major cancer types with respect to clinical outcome. A general pattern emerged: Shorter patient survival was associated with up-regulation of genes involved in cell growth and with down-regulation of genes involved in cellular differentiation. Using genome-scale metabolic models, we show that cancer patients have widespread metabolic heterogeneity, highlighting the need for precise and personalized medicine for cancer treatment. All data are presented in an interactive open-access database (www.proteinatlas.org/pathology) to allow genome-wide exploration of the impact of individual proteins on clinical outcomes."

Cao et al. developed a two-step combinatorial barcoding method to profile both single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes without requiring physical isolation of each cell. The authors profiled almost 50,000 single cells from an individual Caenorhabditis elegans larval stage and were able to identify and recover information from different, even rare, cell types.

https://openalex.org/W2748311674,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are age-related neurodegenerative disorders with shared genetic etiologies and overlapping clinical and pathological features. Here we studied a novel ALS/FTD family and identified the P362L mutation in the low-complexity domain (LCD) of T cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1 (TIA1). Subsequent genetic association analyses showed an increased burden of TIA1 LCD mutations in ALS patients compared to controls (p = 8.7 × 10−6). Postmortem neuropathology of five TIA1 mutations carriers showed a consistent pathological signature with numerous round, hyaline, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive inclusions. TIA1 mutations significantly increased the propensity of TIA1 protein to undergo phase transition. In live cells, TIA1 mutations delayed stress granule (SG) disassembly and promoted the accumulation of non-dynamic SGs that harbored TDP-43. Moreover, TDP-43 in SGs became less mobile and insoluble. The identification of TIA1 mutations in ALS/FTD reinforces the importance of RNA metabolism and SG dynamics in ALS/FTD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2747850876,"There is significant need to develop physiologically relevant models for investigating human astrocytes in health and disease. Here, we present an approach for generating astrocyte lineage cells in a three-dimensional (3D) cytoarchitecture using human cerebral cortical spheroids (hCSs) derived from pluripotent stem cells. We acutely purified astrocyte-lineage cells from hCSs at varying stages up to 20 months in vitro using immunopanning and cell sorting and performed high-depth bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to directly compare them to purified primary human brain cells. We found that hCS-derived glia closely resemble primary human fetal astrocytes and that, over time in vitro, they transition from a predominantly fetal to an increasingly mature astrocyte state. Transcriptional changes in astrocytes are accompanied by alterations in phagocytic capacity and effects on neuronal calcium signaling. These findings suggest that hCS-derived astrocytes closely resemble primary human astrocytes and can be used for studying development and modeling disease."

Despite recent advances in engaging the intrinsic mechanisms that control CST regrowth, it remains to be tested whether such methods can promote functional recovery in translatable settings. Here we show that post-lesional AAV-assisted co-expression of two soluble proteins, namely insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and osteopontin (OPN), in cortical neurons leads to robust CST regrowth and the recovery of CST-dependent behavioral performance after both T10 lateral spinal hemisection and a unilateral cortical stroke. In these mice, a compound able to increase axon conduction, 4-aminopyridine-3-methanol, promotes further improvement in CST-dependent behavioral tasks. Thus, our results demonstrate a potentially translatable strategy for restoring cortical dependent function after injury in the adult.

Thus, our results demonstrate a potentially translatable strategy for restoring cortical dependent function after injury in the adult. The axons of the corticospinal tract (CST) originate from corticospinal neurons (CSNs) in layer 5 of the motor and somatosensory cortex and innervate all segments of the spinal cord. The CST transmits cortical commands to the spinal cord, allowing willful intention to be translated into observable action. Disruption of CSNs and/or CST axons results in motor functional deficits after traumatic injuries like spinal cord injury and stroke. Therefore, a logical therapeutic approach is to promote CST regrowth in the hope of rebuilding functional connections (Maier and Schwab, 2006Maier I.C. Schwab M.E.

In general, recovery could be achieved either by regenerative growth of injured CST axons across the lesion site or by compensatory sprouting of spared axons that innervate the denervated areas. For both types of regrowth, the limited growth ability of adult CSNs is a formidable impediment (Maier and Schwab, 2006Maier I.C. Schwab M.E.

In exploring the molecular mechanisms that control the growth ability of CSNs, several important regulators have been identified, such as mTOR/PTEN (Liu et al., 2010Liu K. Lu Y. Lee J.K. Samara R.

We and others have shown that CSNs undergo a development-dependent and injury-triggered decline of mTOR activity and that activating this pathway by inhibiting the expression of its negative regulator PTEN elicits the regrowth of the adult CST after injury (Liu et al., 2010Liu K.

However, because PTEN is a tumor suppressor, clinical application may require other alternative methods to elevate the growth ability of CSNs. In seeking such alternatives, it is relevant that the PI3K/mTOR pathway plays several roles, one of which is to mediate the activity of neurotrophins and other growth factors. In cultured neonatal CSNs, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are able to promote the growth and branching of CST axons, respectively (Ozdinler and Macklis, 2006Ozdinler P.H. Macklis J.D. IGF-I specifically enhances axon outgrowth of corticospinal motor neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1371-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, direct administration of these factors has limited effects on promoting CST regrowth in adults (Giehl and Tetzlaff, 1996Giehl K.M. Tetzlaff W.

Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1496-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), suggesting that in comparison to immature neurons, mature CSNs have reduced responsiveness to growth factors. Hence, it would be desirable to develop a sensitizing strategy that enhances the response of mature CSNs to growth factors. A possible means to this end is suggested by our recent studies of optic nerve injury (Duan et al., 2015Duan X. Qiao M. Bei F. Kim I.J. He Z. Sanes J.R. Subtype-specific regeneration of retinal ganglion cells following axotomy: effects of osteopontin and mTOR signaling.Neuron. 2015; 85: 1244-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, Bei et al., 2016Bei F.

Frank E. et al.Restoration of visual function by enhancing conduction in regenerated axons.Cell. 2016; 164: 219-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We showed that although IGF1 or BDNF alone failed to promote regeneration, combining either trophic factor with osteopontin (OPN) allowed injured retinal ganglion cells to respond to these growth factors, exhibiting robust axon regeneration in an mTOR-dependent manner (Duan et al., 2015Duan X. Qiao M. Bei F. Kim I.J. He Z. Sanes J.R.

Frank E. et al.Restoration of visual function by enhancing conduction in regenerated axons.Cell. 2016; 164: 219-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be tested whether OPN can sensitize the responses of other types of neurons to these growth factors. Because of the unique importance of CST axons in controlling spinal cord function, we asked here whether OPN can sensitize CSNs’ responses to growth factors and promote CST regrowth and relevant functional recovery in clinically relevant injury models. Because multiple pathways are interrupted by such injuries, we first defined the behavioral defects that result from damage to the CST. Then, we tested the combinatorial treatment of OPN and IGF1 in two different CST-related injury models, spinal cord T10 lateral hemisection and unilateral cortical stroke. We discovered that this treatment indeed promoted robust CST regrowth with significant yet partial restoration of CST-dependent tasks. We also showed that an additional treatment of 4-aminopyridine-3-methanol (4-AP-MeOH) in these mice further increased functional recovery. Our results reveal a possibly translatable strategy of promoting CST-dependent functional restoration in adults. In the majority of patients of spinal cord injury or stroke, some CST axons are spared, leading to an “incomplete” injury (Raineteau and Schwab, 2001Raineteau O. Schwab M.E. Plasticity of motor systems after incomplete spinal cord injury.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Accordingly, an ideal model should involve incomplete injury with characterized tract-specific behavioral defects. We used thoracic lateral hemisection because the resultant lesions and behavioral deficits are reproducible and quantifiable (Figure 1A; Ballermann and Fouad, 2006Ballermann M. Fouad K.

In contrast, CST axons had limited sprouting in the same mice (Figures 1B and 1C). Next, we performed a variety of behavioral tests to define the functional deficits due to T10 lateral hemisection (Figures S1B–S1J, 1D, and 1E). Consistent with previous reports (Ballermann and Fouad, 2006Ballermann M. Fouad K.

Over the following weeks, recovery varied dramatically among tasks. For example, inter-limb coordination recovered almost completely (Figures S1E–S1H); weight support, protraction during walking, and speed tolerance on treadmill recovered partially (Figures S1B–S1D and S1I); and paw dragging of the denervated hindlimb on a treadmill showed no significant recovery (Figure S1J). In addition, we tested the ability of mice to walk on a horizontal ladder with irregularly spaced rungs (Metz and Whishaw, 2002Metz G.A. Whishaw I.Q.

Restoration of skilled locomotion by sprouting corticospinal axons induced by co-deletion of PTEN and SOCS3.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this task, mice need to continuously adjust their stepping movements by aiming their limbs toward a new rung and then perform an accurate placement. The hindlimbs on the intact side showed a transient defect but then achieved almost full recovery (Figures 1D and S1K). In contrast, the injured hindlimb often missed the rung (miss error) or contacted the rung with a few digits followed by a slip (slip error), thereby resulting in a significantly higher error rate even at 12 weeks post-injury (Figures 1E and S1L). Thus, despite spontaneous axonal reorganization and functional recovery, the mice with T10 lateral hemisection failed to show significant CST sprouting and still exhibited significant defects in several locomotor parameters, including paw dragging, speed tolerance on treadmill, and precision placement on irregular ladder. To investigate whether any of these persistent defects following T10 lateral hemisection resulted from loss of the CST, we selectively ablated the CSNs, which give rise to the CST axons that innervate the hindlimb, without damaging other descending tracts. To do this, we took advantage of the efficient retrograde properties of a pseudotyped lentiviral vector (HiRet) (Kinoshita et al., 2012Kinoshita M. Matsui R. Kato S. Hasegawa T. Kasahara H. Isa K.

In a pilot experiment, we injected GFP-expressing vector (HiRet-GFP) into the spinal cord segments (T12-L4) of mice at the age of postnatal day 12–14 (P12–P14), when most CST axons have reached their spinal targets (Bareyre et al., 2005Bareyre F.M.

As shown in Figure S2A, CSNs in the hindlimb area of the primary sensorimotor cortex were efficiently targeted. To examine the retrograde labeling efficiency, we co-injected HiRet-mCherry with another commonly used retrograde tracer, fluorescent microspheres (Kamiyama et al., 2015Kamiyama T. Kameda H. Murabe N. Fukuda S. Yoshioka N. Mizukami H. Ozawa K. Sakurai M. Corticospinal tract development and spinal cord innervation differ between cervical and lumbar targets.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and found that about 98% of green retrobeads labeled CSNs were co-labeled by mCherry, indicating a high efficiency of HiRet vectors in labeling CSNs (Figure S2B). Next, we injected HiRet vectors carrying flip-excision (FLEX) human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR; HiRet-FLEX-DTR) into the T12-L4 spinal cord of cortex-specific Emx1-Cre transgenic mice (Bareyre et al., 2005Bareyre F.M. Kerschensteiner M. Misgeld T. Sanes J.R. Transgenic labeling of the corticospinal tract for monitoring axonal responses to spinal cord injury.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (Figure 1F). Upon DT administration, CST axons were efficiently ablated in the lumbar, but not cervical, spinal cord, as indicated by immunostaining for PKCγ, a CST marker (Liu et al., 2010Liu K. Lu Y. Lee J.K. Samara R. Willenberg R. Sears-Kraxberger I. Tedeschi A. Park K.K. Jin D. Cai B. et al.PTEN deletion enhances the regenerative ability of adult corticospinal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) (Figures 1G and S2G). Consistent with this, the retrograde tracing at the lumbar spinal cord revealed less than 10% remaining CSNs in HiRet-FLEX-DTR-injected mice (Figures S2C–S2E). The DT-mediated CSN ablation did not induce significant inflammatory response (Figures S2D and S2F). In these mice, basic locomotor functions, like weight support, excursion length, and limb coordination during ground walking, were unperturbed (Figures S3A–S3D), consistent with the previous finding that basic locomotor function achieves almost complete recovery after CST lesions (Metz et al., 1998Metz G.A.

Complete locomotor recovery following corticospinal tract lesions: measurement of ground reaction forces during overground locomotion in rats.Behav.

In addition, these mice are capable of adjusting gait patterns without overt paw dragging toward changing velocities when stepping on the treadmill (Figures S3E–S3G). On the other hand, similar to the mice with lateral hemisection (Figures 1D and 1E), the performance of the hindlimbs, but not the forelimbs, of these mice is defective in the irregular walking assay permanently (Figures 1H and S3H). Based on these results, we propose that the defects in the irregular walking task, but not paw dragging and speed tolerance on the treadmill after T10 hemisection, are likely due to the lack of regrowth of spared CST axons and thus persistent CST denervation on the injured side of the lumbar spinal cord. Previous studies showed that IGF1 promotes axon growth by activating both PI3K and Erk/MAPK pathways in cultured CSNs isolated from neonatal mice (Ozdinler and Macklis, 2006Ozdinler P.H. Macklis J.D. IGF-I specifically enhances axon outgrowth of corticospinal motor neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1371-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether IGF1 triggers similar signaling activation in adult CSNs, and if so, whether it could be altered by OPN treatment. Thus, we labeled CSNs by spinal injection of HiRet-GFP, performed T10 lateral hemisection, and then bilaterally injected recombinant IGF1, OPN, or OPN/IGF1 proteins into the cortex (Figure 2A). In 3 days, the cortical sections from both injured and intact sides of adult mice were immunostained with anti-IGFR; anti-phospho-IGFRβ, an indicator for the activation of the IGF1-mediated signaling pathways (Hernández-Sánchez et al., 1995Hernández-Sánchez C.

Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the treatment gap among adults with depressive disorder (DD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) and to examine possible barriers to initiation and continuation of mental health treatment in Nepal. Methods A three-stage sampling technique was used in the study to select 1,983 adults from 10 Village Development Committees (VDCs) of Chitwan district. Presence of DD and AUD were identified with validated versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). Barriers to care were assessed with the Barriers to Access to Care Evaluation (BACE). Results In this sample, 11.2% (N = 228) and 5.0% (N = 96) screened positive for DD and AUD respectively. Among those scoring above clinical cut-off thresholds, few had received treatment from any providers; 8.1% for DD and 5.1% for AUD in the past 12 months, and only 1.8% (DD) and 1.3% (AUD) sought treatment from primary health care facilities. The major reported barriers to treatment were lacking financial means to afford care, fear of being perceived as “weak” for having mental health problems, fear of being perceived as “crazy” and being too unwell to ask for help. Barriers to care did not differ based on demographic characteristics such as age, sex, marital status, education, or caste/ethnicity. Conclusions With more than 90% of the respondents with DD or AUD not participating in treatment, it is crucial to identify avenues to promote help seeking and uptake of treatment. Given that demographic characteristics did not influence barriers to care, it may be possible to pursue general population-wide approaches to promoting service use."
https://openalex.org/W2747342617,"Excitatory hilar mossy cells (MCs) in the dentate gyrus receive inputs from dentate granule cells (GCs) and project back to GCs locally, contralaterally, and along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, thereby establishing an associative positive-feedback loop and connecting functionally diverse hippocampal areas. MCs also synapse with GABAergic interneurons that mediate feed-forward inhibition onto GCs. Surprisingly, although these circuits have been implicated in both memory formation (e.g., pattern separation) and temporal lobe epilepsy, little is known about activity-dependent plasticity of their synaptic connections. Here, we report that MC-GC synapses undergo a presynaptic, NMDA-receptor-independent form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that requires postsynaptic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB and presynaptic cyclic AMP (cAMP)/PKA signaling. This LTP is input specific and selectively expressed at MC-GC synapses, but not at the disynaptic inhibitory loop. By increasing the excitation/inhibition balance, MC-GC LTP enhances GC output at the associative MC-GC recurrent circuit and may contribute to dentate-dependent forms of learning and epilepsy."

There were several reports indicating racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes between African American (AA) and European American (EA) women. For example, the mortality rates of AA breast cancer patients were three times higher than of EA patients, even though, the incidence is lower in AA women. Our in vitro studies indicate that cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) derived from AA TNBC cell lines have significantly higher self-renewal potential (mammosphere formation) than CSCs derived from EA cell lines. TNBC tumors express high levels of Myc compared to luminal A or HER2 expressing breast cancers. We studied the effects of c-Myc overexpression on CSCs and chemotherapy in AA, and EA derived TNBC cell line(s). Overexpression of c-Myc in AA derived MDA-MB-468 (Myc/MDA-468) cells resulted in a significant increase in CSCs and with minimal changes in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) compared to the control group. In contrast, overexpression of c-Myc in EA derived MDA-MB-231(Myc/MDA-231) cells led to increased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with a minimal increase in CSCs compared to the control group. Myc/MDA-468 cells were resistant to standard chemotherapeutic treatments such as iniparib (PARP inhibitor) plus cisplatin, / iniparib, cisplatin, paclitaxel and docetaxel. However, Myc/MDA-231 cells, which showed EMT changes responded to iniparib with cisplatin, but were resistant to other drugs, such as iniparib, cisplatin, paclitaxel and docetaxel. Collectively, our results indicate that intrinsic differences in the tumor biology may contribute to the breast cancer disparities."

However, there has been minimal research into the addictive nature of these applications and the psychological characteristics associate with their excessive use. There is also no published scale available for assessing excessive use of WeChat and similar applications. In the current study, we collected data from 1,245 college students in China (715 females) and developed the WeChat Excessive Use Scale (WEUS). We then assessed the relationship between excessive use of WeChat and excessive use of a social networking application-Weibo, problematic use of mobile phones, external locus of control, and social interaction skills. Our 10-item scale featured three factors, namely- “mood modification,” “salience” and ‘‘conflict”- critical factors in assessing different forms of addiction. The WEUS was found to be a reliable instrument in assessing excessive use of WeChat as it showed good internal consistency and correlated with other measures of problematic use social networking and mobile phone addiction. Our results showed that excessive users of WeChat are more likely to excessively use Weibo than they are to problematically use mobile phones. Our study also showed that greater excessive use of WeChat is associated with higher external locus of control and greater online social interaction skills. These results reveal that WeChat has unique and strong appeal among college students in China. Further, practitioners should consider dealing with malleable factors like locus of control and real life social skills in treating people with problematic messaging and social networking."

https://openalex.org/W2748363581,"Transmission of polarity established early during cell lineage history is emerging as a key process guiding cell differentiation. Highly polarized neurons provide a fascinating model to study inheritance of polarity over cell generations and across morphological transitions. Neural crest cells (NCCs) migrate to the dorsal root ganglia to generate neurons directly or after cell divisions in situ. Using live imaging of vertebrate embryo slices, we found that bipolar NCC progenitors lose their polarity, retracting their processes to round for division, but generate neurons with bipolar morphology by emitting processes from the same locations as the progenitor. Monitoring the dynamics of Septins, which play key roles in yeast polarity, indicates that Septin 7 tags process sites for re-initiation of process growth following mitosis. Interfering with Septins blocks this mechanism. Thus, Septins store polarity features during mitotic rounding so that daughters can reconstitute the initial progenitor polarity."

https://openalex.org/W2745739499,"A major role for FcRn is the salvage of pinocytosed IgG and albumin from a degradative fate in lysosomes. FcRn achieves this by binding IgG in a pH-dependent manner in acidic endosomes and recycling it to the plasma membrane to be released at neutral pH. This is important in maintaining high serum IgG and albumin levels and has the potential to be exploited to modulate the pharmacokinetics of antibody-based therapeutics. Although FcRn is responsible for the recycling of IgG, the dynamic behaviour of endogenous FcRn is not well understood. Our data shows that the majority of endogenous receptor is distributed throughout the endosomal system and is present only at a low percentage on the plasma membrane at steady state. A significant fraction of FcRn at the cell surface appears to be endocytosis resistant while the remainder can undergo rapid endocytosis. To maintain surface levels of the receptor, endocytosed FcRn is replaced with FcRn from the internal pool. This unexpected complexity in FcRn cell surface dynamics has led us to propose a model for FcRn trafficking that should be taken into account when targeting FcRn at the cell surface for therapeutic purposes."

HIV-infected patients have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Impaired endothelial function is an early risk factor for CVD in the general population. It is presumed that HIV infection is associated with impaired endothelial function, but results have been inconsistent.


Objectives 
Our objectives were to determine the relationships between HIV infection, virologic suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART), in vivo measures of conduit artery and microvascular endothelial function, and circulating biomarkers of pathways associated with CVD.


Methods 
We performed a cross-sectional analysis of three prospectively enrolled groups from a single center: 28 were HIV-infected and virologically-suppressed on a regimen of FTC/TDF/EFV (HIV+ART+), 44 were HIV-infected but not on ART (HIV+ART-), and 39 were HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers (HIV-) matched to the HIV+ART- group for age, sex, smoking status, and height. None had diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, known CVD, or other pro-inflammatory condition. Flow mediated dilation (FMD), nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (NTGMD), reactive hyperemia velocity time integral (RHVTI), and FMD/RHVTI of the brachial artery were measured, as well as circulating biomarkers of systemic inflammation, metabolism, oxidative stress, and endothelial activation.


Results 
No significant differences were found amongst the three groups in FMD (P = 0.46), NTGMD (P = 0.42), RHVTI (P = 0.17), and FMD/RHVTI (P = 0.22) in unadjusted comparisons. Adjusted ANOVA models which included brachial artery diameter, demographics, and conventional CVD risk factors did not appreciably change these findings. In pairwise comparisons, the HIV+ART- group had significantly higher soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II, soluble CD163, β-2 microglobulin, interferon-γ- induced protein-10, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 compared to the other two groups (all p<0.05). Correlates of endothelial function differed between study groups.


Conclusion 
Although untreated HIV infection was associated with elevated levels of several biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial activation, we were unable to demonstrate differences in measures of conduit artery and microvascular endothelial function in this study population."

In this study, the decrease in sensitivity to lambda-cyhalothrin was observed in quercetin-fed Helicoverpa armigera larvae. In order to figure out the mechanisms underlying the decreased sensitivity of H. armigera larvae to lambda-cyhalothrin by quercetin induction, the changes in carboxylesterase activity and in-vitro hydrolytic metabolic capacity to lambda-cyhalothrin were examined. The LC50 value of quercetin-fed H. armigera larvae to lambda-cyhalothrin showed 2.41-fold higher than that of the control. S, S, S-Tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) treatment showed a synergism effect on lambda-cyhalothrin toxicity to quercetin-fed H. armigera. Moreover, the activity of carboxylesterase was significantly higher in quercetin-fed H. armigera larvae after fed on quercetin for 48 h. The in-vitro hydrolytic metabolic capacity to lambda-cyhalothrin in quercetin-fed H. armigera larvae midgut was 289.82 nmol 3-PBA/mg protein/min, which is significant higher than that in the control group (149.60 nmol 3-PBA/mg protein/min). The elevated CarE enzyme activity and corresponding increased hydrolytic metabolic capacity to lambda-cyhalothrin in quercetin-fed H. armigera contributed to the enhanced tolerance to lambda-cyhalothrin."
https://openalex.org/W2746290084,"Background The scarcity of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) cases reported in Saudi Arabia might be indicative of a lack of awareness of this common genetic disease among physicians. Objective To assess physicians’ awareness, practice, and knowledge of FH in Saudi Arabia. Methods This is a cross-sectional study conducted among physicians at four tertiary hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between March 2016 and May 2016 using a self-administered questionnaire. Results A total of 294 physicians completed the survey (response rate 90.1%). Overall, 92.9% of the participants have poor knowledge of FH while only 7.1% have acceptable knowledge. The majority (68.7%) of physicians rated their familiarity with FH as average or above average, and these had higher mean knowledge scores than participants with self-reported below average familiarity (mean 3.4 versus 2.6) (P < 0.001). Consultant physicians were 4.2 times more likely to be familiar with FH than residents or registrars (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.9–9.1, P < 0.001). Physicians who currently managed FH patients had higher mean knowledge scores compared to those without FH patients in their care (3.5 versus 2.9) (P = 0.006). In addition, there were statistically significant differences between physicians’ mean knowledge scores and their ages, levels of training, and years in practice. Moreover, a substantial deficit was identified in the awareness of various clinical algorithms to diagnose patients with FH, cascade screening, specialist lipid services, and the existence of statin alternatives, such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. Conclusion A substantial deficit was found in the awareness, knowledge, practice, and detection of FH among physicians in Saudi Arabia. Extensive educational programs are required to raise physician awareness and implement best practices; only then can the impact of these interventions on FH management and patient outcome be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2746267121,"An important consideration in the design of a practical system to restore walking in individuals with spinal cord injury is to minimize metabolic energy demand on the user. In this study, the effects of exoskeletal constraints on metabolic energy expenditure were evaluated in able-bodied volunteers to gain insight into the demands of walking with a hybrid neuroprosthesis after paralysis. The exoskeleton had a hydraulic mechanism to reciprocally couple hip flexion and extension, unlocked hydraulic stance controlled knee mechanisms, and ankles fixed at neutral by ankle-foot orthoses. These mechanisms added passive resistance to the hip (15 Nm) and knee (6 Nm) joints while the exoskeleton constrained joint motion to the sagittal plane. The average oxygen consumption when walking with the exoskeleton was 22.5 ± 3.4 ml O2/min/kg as compared to 11.7 ± 2.0 ml O2/min/kg when walking without the exoskeleton at a comparable speed. The heart rate and physiological cost index with the exoskeleton were at least 30% and 4.3 times higher, respectively, than walking without it. The maximum average speed achieved with the exoskeleton was 1.2 ± 0.2 m/s, at a cadence of 104 ± 11 steps/min, and step length of 70 ± 7 cm. Average peak hip joint angles (25 ± 7°) were within normal range, while average peak knee joint angles (40 ± 8°) were less than normal. Both hip and knee angular velocities were reduced with the exoskeleton as compared to normal. While the walking speed achieved with the exoskeleton could be sufficient for community ambulation, metabolic energy expenditure was significantly increased and unsustainable for such activities. This suggests that passive resistance, constraining leg motion to the sagittal plane, reciprocally coupling the hip joints, and weight of exoskeleton place considerable limitations on the utility of the device and need to be minimized in future designs of practical hybrid neuroprostheses for walking after paraplegia."

Psychological interventions are effective in treating fatigue in other conditions. This paper describes the development and evaluation of the feasibility of a psychological intervention for PSF.Based on psychological correlates of PSF and evidence-based psychological interventions for fatigue in other medical conditions, we developed a manualised psychological intervention for PSF, with input from stroke clinicians, psychological therapists, and stroke survivors. The intervention was delivered by a clinical psychologist to 12 participants with PSF to test its acceptability and feasibility. According to the feedback from participants and therapists, the intervention was refined for future use.The intervention consisted of six individual, face-to-face treatment sessions, and one follow-up, telephone-delivered booster session. It included psycho-education and discussion of strategies to promote physical and social activities and to challenge unhelpful thoughts. Four participants dropped out and the remaining eight participants completed the intervention. These eight participants also completed all assessments and feedback and reported fatigue levels as lower at the end of the study than at the baseline. All participants reported favourable opinions on the intervention and suggested that the last two treatment sessions be combined and the booster session be delivered in person as opposed to telephone.This psychological intervention was acceptable to stroke patients and was feasible in the local health service. These findings suggest that a randomised controlled trial to test efficacy is warranted."

https://openalex.org/W2749361257,"Successful propagation of HIV in the human host requires entry into a permissive cell, reverse transcription of viral RNA, integration into the human genome, transcription of the integrated provirus, and assembly/release of new virus particles. Currently, there are antiretrovirals against each of these viral steps, except for provirus transcription. An inhibitor of HIV transcription could both increase potency of treatment and suppress drug-resistant strains. Cellular cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) serves as a cofactor for the HIV Tat protein and is required for effective transcription of the provirus. Previous studies have shown that the CDK9 inhibitor Indirubin 3’-monoxime (IM) inhibits HIV transcription in vitro and in short-term in vivo studies of HIV acute infection in humanized mice (PBMC-NSG model), suggesting a therapeutic potential. The objective of this study is to evaluate the toxicity, pharmacokinetics and long-term antiviral activity of IM during chronic HIV infection in humanized mice (HSC-NSG model). We show that IM concentrations above EC50 values are rapidly achieved and sustained for > 3 h in plasma, and that non-toxic concentrations durably reduce HIV RNA levels. In addition, IM enhanced the antiviral activity of antiretrovirals from the reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase inhibitor classes in in vitro infectivity assays. In summary, IM may enhance current antiretroviral treatments and could help achieve a “functional cure” in HIV patients by preventing expression of proviruses."

These high-voltage gated channels function as integrators of different physical stresses (e.g. heat, protons, ATP). Additionally channel activation can be induced by capsaicin. Topically applied, capsaicin elicits burning pain, heat and mechanical hyperalgesia and serves as a human surrogate model for pain. It was suggested that the TRPV1-variant rs8065080 (1911A>G) plays a pivotal role in patients with neuropathic pain syndromes. We investigated the effect of this TRPV1-SNP on thermal sensitivity and superficial skin perfusion in 25 healthy subjects.Nine subjects being homozygous TRPV1 wild type (AA), 8 heterozygous (AG) and 8 homozygous variant (GG) carriers were selected out of a pool of genotyped healthy individuals. Under physiological conditions (no capsaicin application), there was no statistical significant difference in thermal thresholds or skin perfusion between carriers of different TRPV1 1199A>G genotypes. However, intra-individual calculations (Δ% pre vs. post capsaicin) revealed (1) less warm-detection in AA/AG (-82.1%) compared to GG (-13.1%) and (2) a gain of heat pain sensitivity in AA/AG (+22.2%) compared to GG carriers (+15.6%) after adjustment for perfusion measurements ((1)p = 0.009, (2)p = 0.021).Presence of homozygous variant TRPV1 genotype (GG) demonstrated less capsaicin-induced warm hypoesthesia in warm-detection and less capsaicin-induced heat pain sensitivity suggesting an altered channel function. This demonstrates not only the functional influence of TRPV1 rs8065080 polymorphism itself; it further more underpins the relevance of genotyping-based approaches in both patients and surrogate models of neuropathic pain in healthy volunteers."
https://openalex.org/W2746333576,"Vitamin B3 has been shown to play an important role during embryogenesis. Specifically, there is growing evidence that nicotinamide, the biologically active form of vitamin B3, plays a critical role as a morphogen in the differentiation of stem cells to mature cell phenotypes, including those of the central nervous system (CNS). Detailed knowledge of the action of small molecules during neuronal differentiation is not only critical for uncovering mechanisms underlying lineage-specification, but also to establish more effective differentiation protocols to obtain clinically relevant cells for regenerative therapies for neurodegenerative conditions such as Huntington's disease (HD). Thus, this study aimed to investigate the potential of nicotinamide to promote the conversion of stem cells to mature CNS neurons.Nicotinamide was applied to differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC; Sox1GFP knock-in 46C cell line) during their conversion towards a neural fate. Cells were assessed for changes in their proliferation, differentiation and maturation; using immunocytochemistry and morphometric analysis methods.Results presented indicate that 10 mM nicotinamide, when added at the initial stages of differentiation, promoted accelerated progression of ESCs to a neural lineage in adherent monolayer cultures. By 14 days in vitro (DIV), early exposure to nicotinamide was shown to increase the numbers of differentiated βIII-tubulin-positive neurons. Nicotinamide decreased the proportion of pluripotent stem cells, concomitantly increasing numbers of neural progenitors at 4 DIV. These progenitors then underwent rapid conversion to neurons, observed by a reduction in Sox 1 expression and decreased numbers of neural progenitors in the cultures at 14 DIV. Furthermore, GABAergic neurons generated in the presence of nicotinamide showed increased maturity and complexity of neurites at 14 DIV. Therefore, addition of nicotinamide alone caused an accelerated passage of pluripotent cells through lineage specification and further to non-dividing mature neurons.Our results show that, within an optimal dose range, nicotinamide is able to singly and selectively direct the conversion of embryonic stem cells to mature neurons, and therefore may be a critical factor for normal brain development, thus supporting previous evidence of the fundamental role of vitamins and their metabolites during early CNS development. In addition, nicotinamide may offer a simple effective supplement to enhance the conversion of stem cells to clinically relevant neurons."

OZ rats of 7 weeks (prediabetic stage), 12 weeks (early diabetic stage), and 20 weeks (late diabetic stage), and time-matched lean control rats, were studied. Segments of arcuate arteries (130 to 180 μm) were isolated, cannulated and pressurized. Vascular endothelial functions were tested using ACh-induced vasodilation. Our experiments demonstrated: (1) ACh-elicited vasodilation was impaired in OZ rats of 20 weeks, but not in rats of 7 and 12 weeks; (2) inhibition of NO or EDHF (contributed by epoxyeicosatrienoic acids [EETs]) production significantly decreased ACh-induced vasodilation in both lean and OZ rats of 20 weeks. The reduction of ACh-induced vasodilation by inhibition of NO or EDHF formation was less in OZ rats, as compared to lean rats; and (3) inhibition of KCa channels markedly reduced ACh-induced vasodilation in lean control rats, but not in OZ rats of 20 weeks. Our observations indicated that endothelium-dependent vasodilation in renal arcuate arteries is impaired in diabetes mellitus; NO and EDHF, mainly EETs, dominate the ACh-induced vasodilation in renal arcuate arteries; the contribution of NO and EETs is impaired in diabetic rats; KCa channels are involved in ACh-induced vasodilation; and the activity of KCa channels is downregulated in diabetes mellitus."

However, as new methodologies are developed, a critical question will need to be addressed: how do we monitor in vivo for functional success? In the present study, we developed novel behavioral assays to examine vision in a vertebrate model system. In the assays, zebrafish larvae are imaged in multiwell or multilane plates while various red, green, blue, yellow or cyan objects are presented to the larvae on a computer screen. The assays were used to examine a loss of vision at 4 or 5 days post-fertilization and a gradual recovery of vision in subsequent days. The developed assays are the first to measure the loss and recovery of vertebrate vision in microplates and provide an efficient platform to evaluate novel treatments of visual impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2728971136,"We significantly extend our earlier variant of the Schelling model, incorporating a neighborhood Potential function as well as an agent wealth gain function to study the long term evolution of the economic status of neighborhoods in cities. We find that the long term patterns of neighborhood relative economic status (RES) simulated by this model reasonably replicate the empirically observed patterns from American cities. Specifically, we find that larger fractions of rich and poor neighborhoods tend to, on average, retain status for longer than lower- and upper-middle wealth neighborhoods. The use of a Potential function that measures the relative wealth of neighborhoods as the basis for agent wealth gain and agent movement appears critical to explaining these emergent patterns of neighborhood RES. This also suggests that the empirically observed RES patterns could indeed be universal and that we would expect to see these patterns repeated for cities around the world. Observing RES behavior over even longer periods of time, the model predicts that the fraction of poor neighborhoods retaining status remains almost constant over extended periods of time, while the fraction of middle-wealth and rich neighborhoods retaining status reduces significantly over time, tending to zero."
https://openalex.org/W2746011079,"Group B streptococci (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) are the leading cause of neonatal invasive diseases and are also important pathogens for elderly adults. Until now, nearly all GBS with reduced penicillin susceptibility (PRGBS) have shown β-hemolytic activity and grow on sheep blood agar. However, we have previously reported three PRGBS clinical isolates harboring a CylK deletion that form small less hemolytic colonies. In this study, we examined the causes of small, less hemolytic colony formation in these clinical isolates. Isogenic strains were sequenced to identify the mutation related to a small colony size. We identified a 276_277insG nucleic acid insertion in the thiamin pyrophosphokinase (tpk) gene, resulting in premature termination at amino acid 103 in TPK, as a candidate mutation responsible for small colony formation. The recombinant strain Δtpk, which harbored the 276_277insG insertion in the tpk gene, showed small colony formation. The recombinant strain ΔcylK, which harbored the G379T substitution in cylK, showed a reduction in hemolytic activity. The phenotypes of both recombinant strains were complemented by the expression of intact TPK or CylK, respectively. Moreover, the use of Rapid ID 32 API and VITEK MS to identify strains as GBS was evaluated clinical isolates and recombinant strains. VITEK MS, but not Rapid ID 32 API, was able to accurately identify the strains as GBS. In conclusion, we determined that mutations in tpk and cylK caused small colonies and reduced hemolytic activity, respectively, and characterized the clinical isolates in detail."
https://openalex.org/W2746743954,"Jatropha curcas L. is an important biofuel plant with excellent tolerance of barren environments. However, studies on the regulatory mechanisms that operate in this plant in response to nitrogen (N) shortage are scarce. In this study, genome-wide transcriptional profiles of the roots and leaves of 8-week old physic nut seedlings were analyzed after 2 and 16 days of N starvation. Enrichment results showed that genes associated with N metabolism, processing and regulation of RNA, and transport predominated among those showing alterations in expression. Genes encoding transporter families underwent major changes in expression in both roots and leaves; in particular, those with roles in ammonia, amino acid and peptide transport were generally up-regulated after long-term starvation, while AQUAPORIN genes, whose products function in osmoregulation, were down-regulated. We also found that ASPARA−GINASE B1 and SARCOSINE OXIDASE genes were up-regulated in roots and leaves after 2 and 16 d N starvation. Genes associated with ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation were significantly up-regulated. In addition, genes in the JA biosynthesis pathway were strongly activated while expression of those in GA signaling was inhibited in leaves. We showed that four major classes of genes, those with roles in N uptake, N reutilization, C/N ratio balance, and cell structure and synthesis, were particularly influenced by long-term N limitation. Our discoveries may offer clues to the molecular mechanisms that regulate N reallocation and reutilization so as to maintain or increase plant performance even under adverse environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2746864510,"Finger enslaving is defined as the inability of the fingers to move or to produce force independently. Such finger enslaving has predominantly been investigated for isometric force tasks. The aim of this study was to assess whether the extent of force enslaving is dependent on relative finger movements. Ten right-handed subjects (22–30 years) flexed the index finger while counteracting constant resistance forces (4, 6 and 8 N) orthogonal to the fingertip. The other, non-instructed fingers were held in extension. EMG activities of the mm. flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor digitorum (ED) in the regions corresponding to the index, middle and ring fingers were measured. Forces exerted by the non-instructed fingers increased substantially (by 0.2 to 1.4 N) with flexion of the index finger, increasing the enslaving effect with respect to the static, pre-movement phase. Such changes in force were found 260–370 ms after the initiation of index flexion. The estimated MCP joint angle of the index finger at which forces exerted by the non-instructed fingers started to increase varied between 4° and 6°. In contrast to the finger forces, no significant changes in EMG activity of the FDS regions corresponding to the non-instructed fingers upon index finger flexion were found. This mismatch between forces and EMG of the non-instructed fingers, as well as the delay in force development are in agreement with connective tissue linkages being slack when the positions of the fingers are similar, but pulled taut when one finger moves relative to the others. Although neural factors cannot be excluded, our results suggest that mechanical connections between muscle-tendon structures were (at least partly) responsible for the observed increase in force enslaving during index finger flexion."

Therefore, social interest in the fields of health, longevity, and anti-aging has been increasing as well. However, the basic research results obtained from a reductionist approach in biology and a bioinformatic approach in genome science have limited usefulness for generating insights on future health, longevity, and anti-aging-related research on a case by case basis. We propose a new approach that uses our literature mining technique and bioinformatics, which lead to a better perspective on research trends by providing an expanded knowledge base to work from. We demonstrate that our approach provides useful information that deepens insights on future trends which differs from data obtained conventionally, and this methodology is already paving the way for a new field in aging-related research based on literature mining. One compelling example of this is how our new approach can be a useful tool in drug repositioning."

Class I restorations with resin composite fillings were polished either immediately (3 min) after setting or after one-day water storage. Interfacial gap formation (observed by vertical inspection) was assessed using 14 gap measurement points along the interface between the restoration and cavity walls and floor (n = 10 per resin composite; total points measured per time point = 140). For marginal gaps formed at cavosurface margins in Class I cavities and in Teflon molds, marginal gap formation (observed by horizontal inspection) was assessed by measuring the maximum gap-width and opposing width (if any). Effects on mechanical properties were assessed by measuring shear bond strengths to enamel and dentin, flexural strength and modulus. After one-day storage, marginal gap-widths in Class I restorations were significantly decreased for all composites, alongside a significant increase in shear bond strengths to enamel and dentin, flexural strength and modulus. Resin composite-filled Class I restorations which were polished after one-day delay presented lower gap formation compared with finishing immediately after setting."
https://openalex.org/W2750143090,"The punctum fixum-punctum mobile model has been introduced in previous publications. It describes general principles of intersegmental neuromuscular succession patterns to most efficiently generate specific movement intentions. The general hypothesis of this study is that these principles-if they really do indicate a fundamental basis for efficient movement generation-should also be found in intramuscular coordination and should be indicated by ""longitudinal sequencing"" between fibers according to the principles of the punctum fixum-punctum mobile model. Based on this general hypothesis an operationalized model was developed for the rectus femoris muscle (RF), to exemplarily scrutinize this hypothesis for the RF. Electromyography was performed for 14 healthy male participants by using two intramuscular fine wire electrodes in the RF (placed proximal and distal), three surface electrodes over the RF (placed proximal, middle, and distal), and two surface electrodes over the antagonists (m. biceps femoris and m. semitendinosus). Three movement tasks were measured: kicking movements; deceleration after sprints; and passively induced backward accelerations of the leg. The results suggest that proximal fibers can be activated independently from distal fibers within the RF. Further, it was shown that the hypothesized function of ""intramuscular longitudinal sequencing"" does exist during dynamic movements. According to the punctum fixum-punctum mobile model, the activation succession between fibers changes direction (from proximal to distal or inversely) depending on the intentional context. Thus, the results seem to support the general hypothesis for the RF and could be principally in line with the operationalized ""inter-fiber to tendon interaction model""."
https://openalex.org/W2745692343,"The use of isotopic signatures in animal tissues provides information on the environment where they are living and, notably, on their diet. Carbon and, whenever possible, nitrogen stable isotope analyses were performed in animal hairs, muscles and fat. Particularly, we analyzed both carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions (δ13C and δ15N) on wild boar samples across three different areas of central Italy (Latium region): Tyrrhenian Coast (TC), Maremma (MA) and Central Plains (CP). The agricultural habits of these areas imply that, in winter, no crops are available for wild boars, which feed mainly on acorns and natural feeds (tubers, earthworms etc.). In addition, the three areas were influenced by oak masting. One of these areas (CP) was characterised by the spreading of corn during the hunting season to attract the animals. For each area, we sampled 10 animals aged between 12 and 24 months and balanced by gender. Anenrichment of δ13C in CP area, where corn was used, was observed in all the analysed tissues in comparison to other areas (MA and TC). In CP area, enriched values of δ15N were also observed in all the tissues. The research demonstrates that both δ13C andδ15N in free-living wild boar tissues are influenced by sampling area. According to feeding habits of the species and wildlife management (feed supplementation), the differences observed in δ13C and δ15Nare based on the specific feeding regime; particularly the use of corn in wintertime. Furthermore, the research highlights and discusses diversities and relationships among δ13C and δ15N in the hair, fat and muscles of free-living wild boar."

It will be informative to understand the prevalence of multi drug resistance for a better drug regimen management in this geographical area. The Rifampicin resistance determining region (RRDR) sequencing was used to identify mutations associated with drug resistance in DNA extracts from 130 known multidrug resistant (MDR) cultured strains and compared with mutations observed in DNA extracts directly from 86 sputum samples from consecutive newly diagnosed cases in Lahore, Pakistan. These newly diagnosed samples were positive for smear microscopy, chest X-ray and presumed sensitive to first line drugs. In the known MDR group the most frequent mutations conferring resistance were found in rpoB531 (n = 51, 39.2%). In the newly diagnosed tuberculosis group with no history of MDR, mutations in rpoB531 were seen in 10 of the samples (11.6%). Collectively, all mutations in the RRDR region studied were observed in 80 (61.5%) of known MDR cases and in 14 (16.3%) of the newly diagnosed cases. Using the RRDR as a surrogate marker for MDR, sequences for the newly diagnosed (presumed sensitive) group indicate much higher levels of MDR than the 3.9% WHO 2015 global estimate and suggests that molecular screening directly from sputum is urgently required to effectively address the detection and treatment gaps to combat MDR in this high burden country."

What makes the human brain special? It has been proposed that it isn’t just the properties of neurons that are unique to the human brain but differences in the number and properties of non-neuronal glial cells that allow for unique human cognition. Glia encompass all cells in the brain that are not neurons. This includes oligodendrocytes, which wrap lipid-rich processes around axons and speed up action potential conduction; astrocytes, star-shaped cells that tile the brain and interact with neurons and synapses via thousands of fine processes; and microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells (Allen, 2014Allen N.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). There is an increase in the glia-to-neuron ratio with increasing brain size, with the human brain estimated to be half glial cells and half neurons (Allen, 2014Allen N.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In fact, Einstein was shown to have a higher ratio of glia to neurons than the average person, giving rise to the intriguing notion that glial cells provide more than just support and are actively involved in higher brain function (Diamond et al., 1985Diamond M.C. Scheibel A.B. Murphy Jr., G.M. Harvey T. Exp. Neurol. 1985; 88: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Astrocytes in particular perform many important roles that impact brain performance. These include maintaining brain homeostasis through potassium buffering, uptake of neurotransmitters, and supplying energy to neurons (Allen, 2014Allen N.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); inducing new synapses to form between neurons and eliminating excess synapses; and responding to neurotransmitters with increases in intracellular calcium and signaling back to neurons to regulate neurotransmission. On the flip side, increasing studies have shown that in neurological disorders as diverse as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease, alterations in glial cell function are contributing to the neuropathology (Blanco-Suárez et al., 2017Blanco-Suárez E. Caldwell A.L.M. Allen N.J. J. Physiol. 2017; 595: 1903-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Windrem et al., 2017Windrem M.S. Osipovitch M. Liu Z. Bates J. Chandler-Militello D. Zou L.

Therefore, having realistic models for studying human astrocyte maturation and function is important for understanding both healthy brain function and disease. The current paper focuses on developing a method to study the maturation of human astrocytes in vitro (Sloan et al., 2017Sloan S.A. Darmanis S. Huber N. Khan T. Birey F. Caneda C. Reimer R. Quake S.R. Barres B.A. Paşca S.P. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The study of human astrocytes has been limited by resource availability, but importantly, intriguing differences between rodent and human astrocytes have been identified in the work that has been done. For example, human astrocytes are larger than rodent astrocytes, a subset of human astrocytes have long processes that span the cerebral cortex, human astrocytes have differential gene expression when compared to rodent astrocytes, and when human astrocytes are transplanted into mouse brains, they enhance the performance of the mice in learning and memory tasks (Chandrasekaran et al., 2016Chandrasekaran A.

Ullian E.M. Brain Res. Bull. 2017; 129: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Currently available techniques to study human astrocytes include anatomical studies of human post-mortem tissue, derivation of iPSC astrocytes in two-dimensional culture that resemble immature human astrocytes, and engraftment of glial progenitors into mice to provide a more complex environment (Chandrasekaran et al., 2016Chandrasekaran A. Avci H.X. Leist M. Kobolák J. Dinnyés A. Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2016; 10: 215Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). What have been lacking are techniques to study the development and function of mature human astrocytes in a native environment. In this issue of Neuron, Sloan and colleagues take steps to address these issues by developing a long-term three-dimensional brain spheroid model that allows for the generation, development, and maturation of human astrocytes while in contact with human neurons (Sloan et al., 2017Sloan S.A. Darmanis S. Huber N. Khan T. Birey F. Caneda C. Reimer R. Quake S.R. Barres B.A. Paşca S.P. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). During brain development neurons are generated before astrocytes. By allowing human cerebral cortical spheroids (hCSs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (Paşca et al., 2015Paşca A.M. Sloan S.A. Clarke L.E. Tian Y. Makinson C.D. Huber N. Kim C.H. Park J.-Y. O’Rourke N.A. Nguyen K.D. et al.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) to develop and mature in vitro for months to years, Sloan and colleagues were able to track the development of astrocytes in hCSs and characterize their functional properties (Sloan et al., 2017Sloan S.A. Darmanis S. Huber N. Khan T. Birey F. Caneda C. Reimer R. Quake S.R. Barres B.A. Paşca S.P. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Characterization included monitoring gene expression as hCSs and astrocytes matured, and assaying functional properties of astrocytes, such as the ability to take up glutamate and to regulate neuronal synapse number and function at different stages of astrocyte maturation. An elegant aspect of this study is the purification of astrocytes and neurons from the hCS at different stages of development using antibodies that recognize specific cell-surface molecules on the two cell types, a technique known as immunopanning (see Figure 1 in Sloan et al., 2017Sloan S.A. Darmanis S. Huber N. Khan T. Birey F. Caneda C. Reimer R. Quake S.R. Barres B.A. Paşca S.P. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This then allows the culture of purified human astrocytes and neurons from different developmental stages, and for the authors to address questions about what properties of mature astrocytes are intrinsic and which require the continuous presence of neurons. The authors first asked, how do astrocyte morphology and gene expression change with time in vitro in the hCS, from 100 to 590 days in vitro (DIV) (see Figure 2 in Sloan et al., 2017Sloan S.A. Darmanis S. Huber N. Khan T. Birey F. Caneda C. Reimer R. Quake S.R. Barres B.A. Paşca S.P. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar)? These features were compared to known developmental and maturational properties of human astrocytes. For example, astrocytes acutely isolated from the hCS by immunopanning showed an increasingly complex morphology with age of the hCS, characteristic of mature astrocytes. Culturing these astrocytes for a week demonstrated that the morphological differences were maintained—the older the age at isolation, the more processes and branching complexity the astrocyte had, suggesting the cells had undergone irreversible maturational changes in the hCS. Next, the gene expression of acutely isolated hCS astrocytes of different stages was compared to existing RNAseq data from human fetal and adult astrocytes, focusing on the top 100 astrocyte-enriched genes in the fetal and adult cells. This analysis demonstrated that as the hCS matured, the astrocyte gene expression moved from overlapping with the fetal astrocytes at 100 DIV to overlapping with adult astrocytes at 500 DIV, with an intermediate gene expression at time points in between. Interestingly, a subset of the top 100 adult astrocyte genes were not upregulated in the hCS with age, suggesting that additional cues not present in this system regulate their expression in astrocytes in vivo in the human brain, which will be interesting to identify in future work. It is increasingly being appreciated that astrocytes are not one homogeneous cell type, but instead that they are a heterogeneous population of cells. One way to assess astrocyte heterogeneity is using single-cell RNAseq to determine the gene expression of individual astrocytes, the question next addressed (see Figure 3 in Sloan et al., 2017Sloan S.A. Darmanis S. Huber N. Khan T. Birey F. Caneda C. Reimer R. Quake S.R. Barres B.A. Paşca S.P. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Single astrocytes were isolated from hCS at different times in vitro, from 100 to 450 DIV, and RNAseq was performed. Clustering analysis placed the astrocytes into three groups which correlated with their in vitro age—most astrocytes isolated at 100 DIV were in cluster 1, which was enriched for genes involved in cell proliferation. Astrocytes of intermediate age (130–175 DIV) fell into cluster 2, and the oldest astrocytes (450 DIV) were mostly in cluster 3, associated with markers of mature astrocytes. This separation of individual astrocytes into clusters based on time in vitro in the hCS strengthens the bulk RNaseq data in Figure 2 from Sloan et al., 2017Sloan S.A. Darmanis S. Huber N. Khan T. Birey F. Caneda C. Reimer R. Quake S.R. Barres B.A. Paşca S.P. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, showing that astrocytes mature the longer they are in the hCS. In the future it will be interesting to determine if further clusters of astrocytes can be extracted from this data that are not related to maturational state and that can give insight into local astrocyte specialization—for example, cortical region-dependent gene expression. Having extensively validated that morphology and gene expression of astrocytes matures as the hCS matures in vitro, the authors next investigated whether known functions of astrocytes also change with time (see Figure 4 in Sloan et al., 2017Sloan S.A. Darmanis S. Huber N. Khan T. Birey F. Caneda C. Reimer R. Quake S.R. Barres B.A. Paşca S.P. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Both immature (153 DIV) and mature (419 DIV) hCS-derived astrocytes were able to take up glutamate via glutamate transporters, a key in vivo role of astrocytes. Immature astrocytes have been demonstrated to phagocytose synapses in the rodent brain, and this ability is important for removing excess synapses during development. Whether human astrocytes can phagocytose synapses is unknown, and was addressed using an in vitro phagocytosis assay. Astrocytes isolated from immature hCS (100 DIV) robustly phagocytosed rodent synaptosomes, whereas those isolated from mature hCS (590 DIV) displayed little phagocytic activity, showing that, like in mouse, this function of astrocytes is restricted to developmental stages. Another well-known function of developing rodent astrocytes is the ability to induce new synapses to form between neurons via the release of multiple secreted factors. The ability of hCS astrocytes to induce synapses to form between rodent neurons was assayed, and like rodent astrocytes, the hCS astrocytes also induced synapses to form. Surprisingly, the synapse-inducing property of astrocytes did not significantly change with the age of the astrocytes at isolation from the hCS, and was constant for both immature and mature astrocytes. It will be interesting to determine if the synaptogenic ability of astrocytes is due to the same astrocyte-derived signals at each age or if the signals vary between immature and mature cells. It would also be intriguing to carry out these experiments with age-matched human neurons, rather than juvenile rodent neurons, to determine if the ability of the neurons to respond to the synaptogenic cues changes with age. The final characterization was whether astrocytes of different ages differentially affect neuronal function, focusing on neuronal calcium signaling. This was assessed by isolating astrocytes from hCS at different stages (117–437 DIV) and culturing them with young hCS neurons (isolated at 83 DIV). Depolarization of the neurons by application of KCl led to a calcium rise in the neurons, which, interestingly, was larger when the neurons were cultured with mature astrocytes (437 DIV) compared to immature. As with synapse formation, it will be important to determine if these effects are seen in age-matched neurons. This work develops and characterizes hCS as an in vitro system for enabling human astrocyte maturation and provides a model system to track how human astrocytes develop over time. Future questions include asking how the generation of a more complex environment in the hCS, for example by the inclusion of more cell types, will affect astrocyte maturation and function. This is particularly important, as even though the astrocytes display many markers of maturation with prolonged time in the hCS, there are still significant differences between theses astrocytes and adult human astrocytes. This may be due to a lack of cues, or may be an issue of time—it will be difficult to test the latter without maintaining the hCS for many years to match human development. One way of introducing new cell types to the hCS (which mainly consists of excitatory glutamatergic neurons) would be by adding GABAergic inhibitory neurons using procedures just published by the same group (Birey et al., 2017Birey F. Andersen J. Makinson C.D. Islam S. Wei W. Huber N. Fan H.C. Metzler K.R.C. Panagiotakos G. Thom N. et al.Nature. 2017; 545: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), to determine if astrocytes mature in the same way in the presence of inhibition and altered neuronal network function. Other cell types that interact with astrocytes in the human brain, including microglia, oligodendrocytes, and vascular endothelial cells, may also be sources of signals that alter how astrocytes develop and mature, and studying how each of these alters astrocyte function will give important insight into cell-cell signaling that occurs in the developing human brain. Due to the large number of neurological disorders that have a glial component, an exciting use for the hCS will be in modeling human disease to determine to what extent altered astrocyte function contributes to disease onset and progression, and for testing of potential therapies. Human Astrocyte Maturation Captured in 3D Cerebral Cortical Spheroids Derived from Pluripotent Stem CellsSloan et al.NeuronAugust 16, 2017In BriefSloan et al. developed a method for generating and purifying astrocytes from 3D cerebral cortical spheroids derived from human pluripotent cells. Long-term culture (∼20 months in vitro) and direct comparison to human primary cells reveal transcriptional and functional astrocyte maturation. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"

https://openalex.org/W2745710363,"From exoplanet atmospheres to the dynamics of galaxies to the stretch marks left by the big bang, the three finalists in a $250 million astrophysics mission competition would tackle questions spanning all of space and time. Announced last week by NASA, the three missions—whittled down from nine proposals—will receive $2 million each to develop a more detailed concept over the coming 9 months, before NASA selects one in 2019 to be the next mid-sized Explorer. A launch would come after 2022. Explorer missions aim to answer pressing scientific questions more cheaply and quickly than NASA9s multibillion-dollar flagships, such as the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes, which can take decades to design and build. The missions are led by scientists, either from a NASA center or a university, and NASA has launched more than 90 of them since the 1950s."
https://openalex.org/W2749738361,"In March 2014, 130 million cubic meters of Colorado River water began pouring through the Morelos Dam near Yuma, Arizona, and into the river9s long-parched delta in northwestern Mexico. The 8-week flood was part of a massive ecological experiment, aimed at figuring out ways to restore some of the lush marshes and riverbank vegetation that once made the delta a haven for wildlife. Now, that experiment—which produced mixed results—is helping shape a new water sharing agreement between the United States and Mexico. As soon as next month, officials are expected to sign the deal, which will dedicate a small supply of Colorado River water to delta restoration work from 2018 through 2026. Researchers say it could allow managers to steer crucial trickles of water to specific restoration projects that are having a marked impact. Even a little water can bring real benefits to the delta, says conservation biologist Karl Flessa of the University of Arizona in Tuscon. But it takes a lot of hands-on management. Restoration requires much more than just putting water in the river channel and letting nature take its course, he says. What9s really going on is we9re farming nature."
