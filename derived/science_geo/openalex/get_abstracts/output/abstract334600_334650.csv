https://openalex.org/W2042246789,"Membranes containing cylindrical metal nanotubules that span the complete thickness of the membrane are described. The inside radius of the nanotubules can be varied at will; nanotubule radii as small as 0.8 nanometer are reported. These membranes show selective ion transport analogous to that observed in ion-exchange polymers. Ion permselectivity occurs because excess charge density can be present on the inner walls of the metal tubules. The membranes reject ions with the same sign as the excess charge and transport ions of the opposite sign. Because the sign of the excess charge on the tubule can be changed potentiostatically, a metal nanotubule membrane can be either cation selective or anion selective, depending on the potential applied to the membrane."

This ""cosuppression"" of homologous genes is an extremely nonlinear response to small increases in gene expression or dosage, inversely amplifying them into dramatic phenotypic alterations. Pigment transgenes elicit metastable cosuppression patterns organized by flower morphology. Pattern organization and metastability reflect regulatory states (probably transgene transcription states) that respond to morphological features and are labile to physiology and development. Shifts between regulatory states can be highly ordered; for example, a shift may be imposed on a population of cells defining a meristem, which then stably maintains and transmits the new state throughout growth."
https://openalex.org/W1998876185,"Genetic engineering of new storage oils and fats has produced oil crop plants with fatty acid compositions unattainable by plant breeding alone. The combination of classical breeding methods with molecular techniques provides new ways for designing oils for food and nonfood uses. Alterations in the position and number of double bonds, variation in fatty acid chain length, and the introduction of desired functional groups have already been achieved in model systems. Short-term prospects include crops such as rapeseed or soybean engineered to have greater than 70 to 80 percent medium-chain fatty acids by content, greater than 90 percent oleic acid, and high erucic acid content, and engineered to form ricinoleic acid in seed storage tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2076543604,"Understanding the natural variability of climate is important for predicting its near-term evolution. Models of the oceans' thermohaline and wind-driven circulation show low-frequency oscillations. Long instrumental records can help validate the oscillatory behavior of these models. Singular spectrum analysis applied to the 335-year-long central England temperature (CET) record has identified climate oscillations with interannual (7- to 8-year) and interdecadal (15- and 25-year) periods, probably related to the North Atlantic's wind-driven and thermohaline circulation, respectively. Statistical prediction of oscillatory variability shows CETs decreasing toward the end of this decade and rising again into the middle of the next."
https://openalex.org/W1977725816,"Recently, additional ozone production mechanisms have been proposed to resolve the ozone deficit problem, which arises from greater ozone destruction than production in several photochemical models of the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. A detailed ozone model budget analysis was performed with simultaneous observations of O(3), HCl, H(2)O, CH(4), NO, and NO(2) from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) under conditions with the strongest photochemical control of ozone. The results indicate that an ozone deficit may not exist. On the contrary, the use of currently recommended photochemical parameters leads to insufficient ozone destruction in the model."
https://openalex.org/W2147799760,"The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeter mission has measured global mean sea level every 10 days over the last 2 years with a precision of 4 millimeters, which approaches the requirements for climate change research. The estimated rate of sea level change is +3.9 ± 0.8 millimeters per year. A substantial portion of this trend may represent a short-term variation unrelated to the long-term signal expected from global warming. For this reason, and because the long-term measurement accuracy requires additional monitoring, a longer time series is necessary before climate change signals can be unequivocally detected."

https://openalex.org/W2002067104,"Experimental evidence suggest that higher carbon dioxide concentrations may be a boon for crops, leading to faster growth and higher yields. In natural ecosystems the effects are less clear. Results of sophisticated field and lab experiments have ramification far beyond the botanical world. If higher carbon dioxide levels stimulate plant growth, plants may absorb even more carbon dioxide from the air, buffering the world against additional atmospheric change. This article looks at the area of plant response to increasing CO2 concentrations from the point of view of agriculture, global carbon budget, and nutrient needs and limitation of growth."

https://openalex.org/W2091716674,"Concentrations of noble gases in samples of sea water obtained at depths to 3437 meters from a Pacific Ocean station were measured by mass spectrometry. An excess of helium, in relation to concentrations of the other noble gases, is attributed to influx of atoms of this gas from the sediments where it is produced by the natural radioactive decay of members of the uranium and thorium series. On the basis of a steady-state model, the escape of helium from the earth is calculated at 6.4 × 10 13 atoms per square centimeter per year."
https://openalex.org/W2040616599,"The rates of substitution of deuterium for hydrogen in homogeneous gas phase reactions between D 2 and HX (X = H, Cl, NH 2 , or HS) were measured at high temperatures by single-pulse shock tube techniques. The magnitudes observed and their dependency on concentration indicate that the rates of exchange are much faster than would be attainable were the deuterium to dissociate and the D atoms to react with HX by atomic displacement to produce H + DX. Also, these rates were not limited by methathesis through four-center transition states generated by sufficiently energetic collisions between the principal reactants. The results are compatible with the assumption that the rates are controlled by the populations of D 2 in about its 6th vibrational energy level."

In highly suscepti-ble Hartley animals this amount can be more than 10 times greater than in the resistant strain 2. Strain 2 and Hartley guinea pigs are equally susceptible to his-tamine toxicity, and their organs fix I(131)-labeled antibody equally well."

Conidia germinated on leaves infected with the virus but disintegrated following necrosis of the leaf tissue in the immediate area of the germinating conidia.

https://openalex.org/W1979332025,A report of the formation of octane when butyl bromide is passed over magnesium turnings at high temperatures should be amended. Such coupling does take place over pure magnesium at more moderate temperatures but yields 3-methylheptane and sec-butyl bromide in addition to octane. Sec-butyl bromide itself forms no coupling product under such conditions but admixed with butyl bromide markedly increases the 3-methyl-heptane:octane ratio in the product.
