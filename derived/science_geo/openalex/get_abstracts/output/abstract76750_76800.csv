https://openalex.org/W2004039849,"SINCE Leloir and Cardini1 showed that glycogen was synthesized from uridine diphosphate–glucose (UDPG) by liver extracts, it has become commonly accepted2,3 that the normal mechanism of glycogen synthesis in liver and muscle does not involve a reversal of the phosphorylase reaction but the following sequence of reactions:"

https://openalex.org/W2067920818,"DIPICOLINIC acid (DPA, pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) is synthesized during sporogenesis in spore-forming bacteria and excreted during germination as the calcium salt. Heat resistance of spores has long been thought to be associated with the presence of DPA. Church and Halvorson1 reported a quantitative relationship between heat resistance and DPA content in spores. Black et al.2 found that at a concentration of DPA greater than 50 µg/mg dry spores the heat susceptibility appears to remain constant and minimal."

https://openalex.org/W2070392884,"CERIUM-144 is a high yield (∼ 5 per cent) product of nuclear fission that can be readily detected in debris from fission reactions. From about the first to the fourth year after fission, cerium-144 contributes most to total radioactivity1. Because each nuclear disintegration of cerium-144 and its daughter praseodymium-144 can result in deposition of the effective equivalent of more than 6 MeV in bone2, cerium-144 ranks among the more hazardous fission products. Although cerium-144 is only poorly absorbed from the gut2,3, it has been detected at low concentrations in foods, including clams and animal bone4. Liebscher et al.5 detected it in both lung tissue and pulmonary lymph nodes from man. Other workers also identified cerium-144 in lung tissue ash6. A similar situation was observed for plutonium-239 by Bair7. To assess properly radiation protection guides, it is essential also to consider the bodily retention of the element in question. Virtually nothing is known about the retention of cerium-144 by mammals other than rodents. The purpose of this work was to study the long-term in vivo retention of cerium-144 following a single dose to adult beagles."

Other workers5–8, however, do not accept this thesis. They believe that as yet there is no authenticated case of a mole having become malignant as a result of trauma and that the local appearance of a malignant melanoma after incomplete removal of a supposed benign naevus indicates that the lesion was already malignant before removal."

https://openalex.org/W2071494316,"PREVIOUSLY it was found possible to identify the natural habitats of a limited number of species of larval trombiculid mites (chiggers) in Malaysia by recovering them from the ground on black ‘Formica’ plates1. In such habitats as were found, it was possible to observe with the naked eye chiggers both singly and in clusters. Only two species of chiggers have so far been subjected to intensive investigation using this recovery technique and both were vectors of scrub typhus, Leptotrombidium (Leptotrombidium) deliense (Walch, 1922) and L. (L.) akamushi (Brumpt, 1910). In the few localities studied by this means, the former was found in lalang grassland (Imperata cylindrica) and the latter on ground leaf-litter of secondary forest galleries2. In the course of current investigations of scrub typhus in the primary and secondary forests of Malaysia, we have collected a number of species of larval trombiculids—previously found only on small forest mammals—by insertion of a flat strip of black ‘Formica’ into ground holes."

https://openalex.org/W2070414536,"IT has been recently found that when 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and several other carcinogenic amines are administered to rats, N-hydroxylation of the compound occurs in vivo1,2. Using AAF, or several other amines, it has been shown that the N-hydroxy metabolite (N—OH—AAF) was a more active carcinogen than the parent compound3."

https://openalex.org/W2040606755,"RECENTLY I reported1 lysis of thrombi in the veins and arteries of animals with sodium gluconate and a dialysable constituent of fibrin extract or whole blood. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum of fibrin extract displayed a maximum at 275 mµ and a minimum at 247 mµ. These values happen to coincide closely with those recorded for tyrosine. This finding suggested that L-tyrosine might be successfully substituted for fibrin extract and, if this was so, that a peptide formed from the amino-acid and gluconic acid would also be fibrinolytic."

The pulmonary arterial vasa vasorum, arising from the coronary arteries, form an intramural capillary network in which it is suggested the blood may come into gaseous equilibrium with that in the lumen of the pulmonary artery itself. This network is said to drain into venae vasorum which supply the aortic bodies."
