https://openalex.org/W3000679864,"We have previously shown that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) represses the PTEN inducible kinase 1 (PINK1) in lung type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) reducing mitophagy and increasing the susceptibility to lung fibrosis. Although increased circulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been reported in chronic lung diseases, the contribution of mitophagy in the modulation of mitochondrial DAMP release and activation of profibrotic responses is unknown. In this study, we show that ER stress and PINK1 deficiency in AECII led to mitochondrial stress with significant oxidation and damage of mtDNA and subsequent extracellular release. Extracellular mtDNA was recognized by TLR9 in AECII by an endocytic-dependent pathway. PINK1 deficiency-dependent mtDNA release promoted activation of TLR9 and triggered secretion of the profibrotic factor TGF-β which was rescued by PINK1 overexpression. Enhanced mtDNA oxidation and damage were found in aging and IPF human lungs and, in concordance, levels of circulating mtDNA were significantly elevated in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients with IPF. Free mtDNA was found elevated in other ILDs with low expression of PINK1 including hypersensitivity pneumonitis and autoimmune interstitial lung diseases. These results support a role for PINK1 mediated mitophagy in the attenuation of mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns (DAMP) release and control of TGF-β mediated profibrotic responses."

The aim of this study was to develop prediction model to identify Korean adolescents of high risk suicide (= who have history of suicide ideation/attempt in previous year) using machine learning techniques. Methods A nationally representative dataset of Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS) was used (n = 59,984 of middle and high school students in 2017). The classification process was performed using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Results A total of 7,443 adolescents (12.4%) had a previous history of suicidal ideation/attempt. In the multivariable analysis, sadness (odds ratio [OR], 6.41; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 6.08–6.87), violence (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 2.01–2.67), substance use (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.52–2.45), and stress (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.40–1.86) were associated factors. Taking into account 26 variables as predictors, the accuracy of models of machine learning techniques to predict the high-risk suicidal was comparable with that of LR; the accuracy was best in XGB (79.0%), followed by SVM (78.7%), LR (77.9%), RF (77.8%), and ANN (77.5%). Conclusions The machine leaning techniques showed comparable performance with LR to classify adolescents who have previous history of suicidal ideation/attempt. This model will hopefully serve as a foundation for decreasing future suicides as it enables early identification of adolescents at risk of suicide and modification of risk factors."

However, the physiological changes in bee due to high temperature and high humidity remain poorly understood. In this study, we explored the effects of higher temperature and humidity on the epiphysiology of bees by evaluating the survival, tolerance and body water loss in two bee species (Apis cerana and Apis mellifera). We also evaluated the changes in the activity of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes in their body. We observed that under higher temperature and humidity conditions, the survival rate of A. mellifera was higher than that of A. cerana. On the other hand, a comparison of water loss between the two species revealed that A. mellifera lost more water. However, under extremely high temperature conditions, A. cerana was more tolerant than A. mellifera. Moreover, under higher temperature and humidity conditions, the activity of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes in bees was significantly increased. Overall, these results suggest that high temperatures can adversely affect bees. They not only affect the survival and water loss, but also stimulate oxidative stress in bees. However, unlike our previous understanding, high humidity can also adversely affect bees, although its effects are lower than that of temperature."

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the in situ IFN-β response in the lungs of stable COPD and non-COPD patients. Lung samples from 70 subjects (9 control never smokers, 19 control smokers without COPD, 21 patients with moderate COPD and 21 patients with very severe COPD) were studied for the expression of IFN-β, its main transcription factor, IRF-7, and two products of its autocrine function, namely RIG-I and MDA-5, by immunohistochemical techniques and quantitative real-time PCR. IFN-β, IRF-7, RIG-I and MDA-5 were widely detected in most lung cell types. In epithelial tissues and alveolar macrophages, IFN-β and IRF-7 labeling scores were decreased up to 65% and 74%, respectively, for COPD patients, paralleling an analogous reduction (43% and 65%, respectively) in the amount of their lung mRNA. Moreover, this decreased production of IFN-β in COPD patients correlated with a similar decrease in the expression of RIG-I and MDA-5, two essential members of the innate immune system. Our study indicates that most lung cells from stable COPD patients show a constitutive decreased expression of IFN-β, IRF-7, RIG-I and MDA-5, suggesting that this deficiency is the main cause of their acute viral exacerbations."
https://openalex.org/W2948125296,"The deteriorative effect of low birth weight (LBW) on the mucosal permeability of the small intestine in piglets has been widely confirmed. However, whether the hindgut epithelial barrier function in LBW pigs is deteriorated during the growing stage is still unclear. Our study investigated differences in the hindgut epithelial barrier function between LBW and normal birth weight pigs during the growing stage (d 90). Our data demonstrated that the hindgut epithelium of LBW pigs has a high histopathological score, accompanied by decreased antioxidant capacity and increased apoptosis rate, as well as elevated expression and activity of caspase-3. In addition, the number of intestinal goblet cells and gene expression of mucin 2 were significantly down-regulated in LBW pigs. The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) was markedly inhibited by the LBW. The mRNA abundance of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 was significantly increased in the hindgut mucosa of LBW pigs. Furthermore, our data revealed that LBW altered the intestinal microbial community in the hindgut mucosa of pigs. Collectively, these finding add to our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for hindgut epithelial barrier dysfunction in LBW pigs during the growing stage and facilitate the development of nutritional intervention strategies.-Tao, S., Bai, Y., Li, T., Li, N., Wang, J. Original low birth weight deteriorates the hindgut epithelial barrier function in pigs at the growing stage."
https://openalex.org/W2969594192,"Elephants experience a number of health issues that can contribute to their well-being and survival. In managed populations, housing conditions and management practices can influence individual health, so potential risk factors associated with morbidity or mortality should be identified to ensure the best possible standards of care. The goal of this study was to determine if the number of clinical events experienced could be a useful welfare indicator in zoo elephants, and to determine factors associated with key pathologies. We used an epidemiological approach to investigate how intrinsic (species, sex, age) and extrinsic (housing, management) factors were associated with both the total number of clinical events, and each of the four most prevalent pathology types (gastrointestinal issues, skin lesions, lameness, foot lesions), over a 12-month period. The study included 220 (127 African; 93 Asian) elephants housed at 61 facilities across North America. More than 1100 clinical events were identified. Species and sex differences were apparent in the types of pathology encountered, and unsurprisingly, the number of clinical events was positively correlated with age. Factors relating to housing (percent time with indoor/outdoor choice, space experience inside, number of unique environments an elephant was housed in, percent time on soft substrate) and management (enrichment diversity, spread of feeding opportunities) were also related to the number of clinical events. However, relationships were often counter to our initial hypotheses, highlighting caution in assuming cause and effect from correlational analyses such as these. Other welfare indicators such as serum and fecal glucocorticoids and serum prolactin were also associated with health status, being higher or more variable in individuals with a greater number of events. This approach provides insight into housing and management factors related to the health of these species in zoos, and in some cases, may reflect management changes that have already been made to mitigate existing or anticipated health concerns."
https://openalex.org/W2960213319,"The current study evaluated the efficacy of self-chosen music listening for the function of affect regulation comparing effects in younger and older adults. Forty younger (18–30 years, M = 19.75, SD = 2.57, 14 males) and forty older (60–81 years, M = 68.48, SD = 6.07, 21 males) adults visited the laboratory and were randomised to either the intervention (10 minutes of listening to self-chosen music) or the active control condition (10 minutes of listening to an experimenter-chosen radio documentary). Negative affect (NA) was induced in all participants using a speech preparation and mental arithmetic task, followed by the intervention/control condition. Measures of self-reported affect were taken at baseline, post-induction and post-intervention. Controlling for baseline affect and reactivity to the NA induction, in comparison with the active control group the music listening group demonstrated greater reduction in NA. Supporting developmental theories of positive ageing, analyses also found significant main effects for age, with older adults experiencing greater reduction of NA than younger adults, regardless of condition. Results of the current study provide preliminary insights into the effects of self-chosen music on induced NA, however, additional experimental control conditions comparing self-chosen and experimenter-chosen music with self-chosen and experimenter-chosen active controls are needed to fully understand music listening effects for affect regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2966009146,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cancer worldwide. MicroRNAs have been shown to be correlated with biological processes of various tumors. In this study, we observed that the expression of miR-582-5p was lower in NSCLC tissues than that in para-carcinoma tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-582-5p significantly inhibited NCI-H358 cell proliferation and invasion. Knockdown of miR-582-5p showed the opposite results, with cell growth rate and the invasive capacity of PC-9 cells enhanced. Furthermore, we elucidated that NOTCH1 is a target of miR-582-5p and there is an inverse correlation between miR-582-5p and NOTCH1 expression in NSCLC tissues. Overexpression of NOTCH1 in miR-582-5p-overexpressing NCI-H358 cells could partially reverse the inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion by miR-582-5p. Thus, our research demonstrated that miR-582-5p suppresses NSCLC cell lines' growth and invasion via targeting oncoprotein NOTCH1 and restoration of miR-582-5p might be feasible therapeutic strategy for NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2952124047,"Marker-less video-based pose estimation promises to allow us to do movement science on existing video databases. We revisited the old question of how people synchronize their walking using real world data. We thus applied pose estimation to 348 video segments extracted from YouTube videos of people walking in cities. As in previous, more constrained, research, we find a tendency for pairs of people to walk in phase or in anti-phase with each other. Large video databases, along with pose-estimation algorithms, promise answers to many movement questions without experimentally acquiring new data."
https://openalex.org/W2953582976,"Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5I) have demonstrated improvement in disease symptoms and quality of life for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Despite these benefits, reported adherence to PDE-5I therapy is sub-optimal. Clinical pharmacists at an integrated practice site are in a unique position to mitigate barriers related to PAH therapy including medication adherence and costs. The primary objective of this study was to assess medication adherence to PDE-5I therapy within an integrated care model at an academic institution. The secondary objective was to assess the impact of out-of-pocket (OOP) cost, frequency of dosing, adverse events (AE) and PAH-related hospitalizations on medication adherence. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients with PAH who were prescribed PDE-5I therapy by the center’s outpatient pulmonary clinic and who received medication management through the center’s specialty pharmacy. We defined optimal medication adherence as proportion of days covered (PDC) ≥ 80%. Clinical data including AEs and PAH-related hospitalizations were extracted from the electronic medical record, and financial data from pharmacy claims. Of the 131 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 94% achieved optimal adherence of ≥ 80% PDC. In this study population, 47% of patients experienced an AE and 27% had at least one hospitalization. The median monthly OOP cost was $0.62. Patients with PDC<80% were more likely to report an AE compared to patients with PDC≥ 80% (p = 0.002). Hospitalization, OOP cost, and frequency of dosing were not associated with adherence in this cohort. Patients receiving PDE-5I therapy through an integrated model achieved high adherence rates and low OOP costs."
https://openalex.org/W2948950388,"Neonatal hypothermia is one of the main underlying factors associated with neonatal deaths.The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with neonatal hypothermia on admission to neonatal intensive care units in Southwest Ethiopia.Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed between February to September 2017 at intensive care units of Arba Minch and Jinka General Hospitals. All neonates admitted to the two neonatal intensive care units during the study period were included in the study. Data were collected by four nurses who were working in the units of the hospitals through semi-structured pre-tested questionnaire and checklist. Multi-variable logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between the dependent and independent variables using odds ratio with a confidence interval of 95% and a p-value of 0.05.The prevalence of neonatal hypothermia on admission to the neonatal intensive care units in this study area was 50.3%. Admission weight below 2500 gm. (AOR = 3.61, 95% CI: 2.10, 6.18), delay in initiation of breastfeeding (AOR = 2.42, 95% CI: 1.45, 4.02), early bathing (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.23, 5.63), admissions during cold season (AOR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.84), and presence of obstetrical complication(s) during pregnancy/labor (AOR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.07, 5.66) were factors significantly associated with hypothermia on admission to the neonatal intensive care units.The prevalence of neonatal hypothermia on admission to the intensive care units was high. There is a need to create awareness among the community members about the dangers of early bathing and late initiation of breastfeeding. It is also important to give attention to the newborns of mothers with obstetric complications, low-birth-weight babies and babies delivered during the cold season."
https://openalex.org/W2994706204,"The role of the microenvironment in driving connective tissue disease is being increasingly appreciated. Matricellular proteins of the CCN family are signaling modifiers that are secreted by cells into the extracellular matrix microenvironment where they have profound, context-dependent effects on organ development, homeostasis and disease. Indeed, CCN proteins are emergent targets for therapeutic intervention. Recent evidence suggests that, in vivo, CCN3 has effects opposing CCN2. Moreover, when CCN3 expression is high, CCN2 expression is low. That is, they appear to be regulated in a yin/yang fashion, leading to the hypothesis that the CCN2:CCN3 ratio is important to control tissue homeostasis. To begin to test the hypothesis that alterations in CCN2:CCN3 expression might be important in skin biology in vivo, we evaluated the relative ex vivo effects of the profibrotic protein TGFbeta1 on dermal fibroblasts on protein and RNA expression of CCN3 and CCN2, as well as the related protein CCN1. We also used signal transduction inhibitors to begin to identify the signal transduction pathways controlling the ability of fibroblasts to respond to TGFbeta1. As anticipated, CCN1 and CCN2 protein and mRNA were induced by TGFbeta1 in human dermal fibroblasts. This induction was blocked by TAK1, FAK, YAP1 and MEK inhibition. Conversely, TGFbeta1 suppressed CCN3 mRNA expression in a fashion insensitive to FAK, MEK, TAK1 or YAP1 inhibition. Unexpectedly, CCN3 protein was not detected in human dermal fibroblasts basally. These data suggest that, in dermal fibroblasts, the profibrotic protein TGFbeta1 has a divergent effect on CCN3 relative to CCN2 and CCN1, both at the mRNA and protein level. Given that the major source in skin in vivo of CCN proteins are fibroblasts, our data are consistent that alterations in CCN2/CCN1: CCN3 ratios in response to profibrotic agents such as TGFbeta1 may play a role in connective tissue pathologies including fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2980289659,"Background and aims Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with insulin resistance, which may lead to type 2 diabetes and its complications. Although HCV infects mainly hepatocytes, it may impair insulin sensitivity at the level of uninfected extrahepatic tissues (muscles and adipose tissue). The aim of this study was to assess whether an interferon-free, antiviral therapy may improve HCV-associated hepatic vs. peripheral insulin sensitivity. Methods In a single-arm exploratory trial, 17 non-diabetic, lean chronic hepatitis C patients without significant fibrosis were enrolled, and 12 completed the study. Patients were treated with a combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks, and were submitted to a 2-step euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with tracers, together with indirect calorimetry measurement, to measure insulin sensitivity before and after 6 weeks of antivirals. A panel of 27 metabolically active cytokines was analyzed at baseline and after therapy-induced viral suppression. Results Clamp analysis performed in 12 patients who achieved complete viral suppression after 6 weeks of therapy showed a significant improvement of the peripheral insulin sensitivity (13.1% [4.6–36.7], p = 0.003), whereas no difference was observed neither in the endogenous glucose production, in lipolysis suppression nor in substrate oxidation. A distinct subset of hepatokines, potentially involved in liver-to-periphery crosstalk, was modified by the antiviral therapy. Conclusion Pharmacological inhibition of HCV improves peripheral (but not hepatic) insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic, lean individuals with chronic hepatitis C without significant fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2994710898,"Chlamydia trachomatis infections are the leading cause of sexually transmitted infections of bacterial origin. Lower genital tract infections are often asymptomatic, and therefore left untreated, leading to ascending infections that have long-term consequences on female reproductive health. Human pathology can be recapitulated in mice with the mouse adapted strain C. muridarum. Eight years into the post-genetic era, significant advances to expand the Chlamydia genetic toolbox have been made to facilitate the study of this important human pathogen. However, the need for additional tools remains, especially for C. muridarum. Here, we describe a new set of spectinomycin resistant E. coli-Chlamydia shuttle vectors, for C. trachomatis and C. muridarum. These versatile vectors allow for expression and localization studies of Chlamydia effectors, such as Inc proteins, and will be instrumental for mutant complementation studies. In addition, we have exploited the differential expression of specific Chlamydia genes during the developmental cycle to engineer an omcA::gfp fluorescent transcriptional reporter. This novel tool allows for monitoring RB to EB conversion at the bacterial level. Spatiotemporal tracking of GFP expression within individual inclusions revealed that RB to EB conversion initiates in bacteria located at the edge of the inclusion and correlates with the time post initiation of bacterial replication and inclusion size. Comparison between primary and secondary inclusions potentially suggests that the environment in which the inclusions develop influences the timing of conversion. Altogether, the Chlamydia genetic tools described here will benefit the field, as we continue to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Chlamydia-host interaction and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2980835950,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are required for the maintenance of immune tolerance and adoptive Treg infusion therapy has become a promising approach to suppress immune responses in diseases such as autoimmunity and transplant rejection. However, one critical challenge of Treg therapy is the requirement of in vitro expansion of functionally stable Tregs while preventing either the contamination of T effector and/or emergence of unstable pathogenic Tregs. Recent studies showing distinct metabolic requirements of T effectors and Tregs suggest that manipulation of cell metabolism may be an attractive strategy to achieve this goal. Here we show that human thymically derived Tregs (tTregs) and in vitro induced Tregs (iTregs) from naive T cells engage glycolysis equivalently upon activation. However, inhibiting glucose metabolism via 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) has distinct effects on each of these subsets. While 2DG treatment at the onset of activation significantly reduced the proliferation and expression of suppressive molecules such as ICOS and CTLA-4 in tTregs, its effect on FOXP3 expression was small. In contrast, 2DG treatment during iTreg induction modestly decreased their proliferation but strongly reduced both ICOS and FOXP3 expression. Importantly, both Treg subsets became insensitive to 2DG after day 3 post activation with little effect on either proliferation or FOXP3 expression while T conventional Th0 cells showed reduced proliferation under the same conditions. Moreover, 2DG treatment at day 3 did not impair the suppressive capabilities of Treg subsets. Collectively, these findings suggest that there is a distinct temporal requirement of glycolysis in each of the activated human Treg subsets and T conventional cells. Furthermore, 2DG treatment at the onset as a strategy to impair contaminating T effector cell proliferation is unfavorable for optimal Treg generation as well."
https://openalex.org/W2981053352,"Virus-free, transient gene expression (TGE) in High Five cells was recently presented as an efficient protein production method. However, published TGE protocols have not been standardized to a general protocol. Therefore, reproducibility and implementation of the method in other labs remains difficult. The aim of this study is to analyse the parameters determining the reproducibility of the TGE in insect cells. Here, we identified that using linear 40 kDa PEI instead of 25 kDa PEI was one of the most important aspects to improve TGE. Furthermore, DNA amount, DNA:PEI ratio, growth phase of the cells before transfection, passage number, the origin of the High-Five cell isolates and the type of cultivation medium were considered. Interestingly, a correlation of the passage number to the DNA content of single cells (ploidy) and to the transfection efficacy could be shown. The optimal conditions for critical parameters were used to establish a robust TGE method. Finally, we compared the achieved product yields in High Five cells using our improved TGE method with both the baculoviral expression system and TGE in the mammalian HEK293-6E cell line. In conclusion, the presented robust TGE protocol in High Five cells is easy to establish and produces ample amounts of high-quality recombinant protein, bridging the gap in expression level of this method to the well-established mammalian TGE in HEK293 cells as well as to the baculoviral expression vector system (BEVS)."
https://openalex.org/W2954501720,"Given the growing burden of cardiovascular diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, global donors and governments are exploring strategies for integrating evidence-based cardiovascular diseases prevention into HIV clinics. We assessed the capabilities, motivations and opportunities that exist for HIV clinics to apply evidence-based strategies for hypertension control among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Nigeria.We used a concurrent Quan-Qual- study approach (a quantitative first step using structured questionnaires followed by a qualitative approach using stakeholder meetings).We invited key stakeholders and representatives of HIV and non-communicable disease organizations in Lagos, Nigeria to 1) assess the capacity of HIV clinics (n = 29) to, and; 2) explore their attitudes and perceptions towards implementing evidence-based strategies for hypertension management in Lagos, Nigeria (n = 19)The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS whereas responses from the stakeholders meeting were coded and analyzed using thematic approach and an implementation science framework, the COM-B (Capabilities, Opportunities, Motivations and Behavior) model, guided the mapping and interpretation of the data.Out of the 29 HIV clinics that participated in the study, 28 clinics were public, government-owned facilities with 394 HIV patients per month with varying capabilities, opportunities and motivations for integrating evidence-based hypertension interventions within their services for PLHIV. Majority of the clinics (n = 26) rated medium-to-low on the psychological capability domains, while most of the clinics (n = 25) rated low on the physical capabilities of integrating evidence-based hypertension interventions within HIV clinics. There was high variability in the ratings for the opportunity domains, with physical opportunities rated high in only eight HIV clinics, two clinics with a medium rating and nineteen clinics with a low rating. Social opportunity domain tended to be rated low in majority of the HIV clinics (n = 21). Lastly, almost all the HIV clinics (n = 23) rated high on the reflective motivation domain although automatic motivations tended to be rated low across the HIV clinics.In this study, we found that with the exception of motivations, the relative capabilities whether physical or psychological and the relative opportunities for integrating evidence-based hypertension intervention within HIV clinics in Nigeria were minimal. Thus, there is need to strengthen the HIV clinics in Lagos for the implementation of evidence-based hypertension interventions within HIV clinics to improve patient outcomes and service delivery in Southwest Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W2972181549,"Many women experience anxiety or sleep disorders during pregnancy and require pharmacological treatment with benzodiazepines (BZDs) or z-hypnotics. Limited information is currently available on how prenatal exposure to these medications affects behavioral problems in children over the long term. Therefore, from a public health perspective, this issue is highly important. The present study aimed to determine whether prenatal exposure to BZDs and z-hypnotics affected externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in children at age 5 years. This study was based on The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and The Medical Birth Registry of Norway. The final study population included data for 36 401 children, from questionnaires completed by the mothers throughout the 5-year follow up. Children’s behaviors were measured at age 5, based on parental responses to The Child Behavior Checklist. Children T-scores of 63 or above were considered to indicate clinically relevant behavior problems. We applied inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and log-binomial regression models to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with censoring weights to account for loss during follow-up. Several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the main results. The final sample included 273 (0.75%) children that were exposed to BZDs and/or z-hypnotics during pregnancy. The main, IPTW and censoring weighted analyses showed that prenatal exposure to BZD and/or z-hypnotics increased the risks of internalizing behavioral problems (RR: 1.35, 95% CI: 0.73–2.49) and externalizing behavioral problems (RR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.86–2.64). However, based on sensitivity analyses, we concluded that the risks of displaying externalizing and internalizing problems at 5 years of age did not significantly increase after prenatal exposure to BZDs and/or z-hypnotics. Instead, the sensitivity analyses suggested that residual confounding and selection bias might explain the increased risks observed in the main analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2949030050,"Myoglobin (Mb) maturation involves heme incorporation as a final step. We investigated a role for heat shock protein (hsp) 90 in Mb maturation in C2C12 skeletal muscle myoblasts and cell lines. We found the following: 1) Hsp90 directly interacts preferentially with heme-free Mb both in purified form and in cells. 2) Hsp90 drives heme insertion into apoprotein-Mb in an ATP-dependent process. 3) During differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes, the apo-Mb-hsp90 complex associates with 5 cell cochaperons, Hsp70, activator of hsp90 ATPase protein 1 (Aha1), alanyl-tRNA synthetase domain containing 1 (Aarsd1), cell division cycle 37 (Cdc37), and stress induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) in a pattern that is consistent with their enabling Mb maturation. 4) Mb heme insertion was significantly increased in cells that had a functional soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC)-cGMP signaling pathway and was diminished upon small interfering RNA knockdown of sGCβ1 or upon overexpression of a phosphodiesterase to prevent cGMP buildup. Together, our findings suggest that hsp90 works in concert with cochaperons (Hsp70, Aha1, Aarsd1, STIP1, and Cdc37) and an active sGC-cGMP signaling pathway to promote heme insertion into immature apo-Mb, and thus generate functional Mb during muscle myotube formation.

Recombinant chimeric proteins (SAG2-GRA1-ROP1-AMA1N, AMA1N-SAG2-GRA1-ROP1, AMA1C-SAG2-GRA1-ROP1, and AMA1-SAG2-GRA1-ROP1) obtained by genetic engineering were tested for their reactivity with specific IgM and IgG antibodies from sera of experimentally infected mice and humans with T. gondii infection using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In total 192 serum samples from patients with acquired T. gondii infection and 137 sera from seronegative individuals were examined. The reactivity of chimeric antigens with antibodies generated during T. gondii invasion was measured and compared to the results obtained in assays based on whole-cell Toxoplasma antigen. Chimeric proteins proved effective in differentiation between T. gondii-infected and uninfected individuals (100% sensitivity and specificity in the IgG ELISAs) which shows their potential usefulness as a replacements for TLA in standardized commercial tests for the serodiagnosis of toxoplasmosis. In addition, the chimeric proteins were tested for use in avidity determination. Obtained results were comparable to those of the corresponding commercial assays, suggesting the utility of these proteins for avidity assessment. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the AMA1-SAG2-GRA1-ROP1 chimeric protein has the potential to distinguish specific antibodies from serum samples of individuals with the early and chronic phase of T. gondii infection."
https://openalex.org/W3003275084,"Candida albicans, a species of fungi, can thrive in diverse niches of its mammalian hosts; it is a normal resident of the GI tract and mucosal surfaces but it can also enter the bloodstream and colonize internal organs causing serious disease. The ability of C. albicans to thrive in these different host environments has been attributed, at least in part, to its ability to assume different morphological forms. In this work, we examine one such morphological change known as white-opaque switching. White cells are the default state of C. albicans, and most animal studies have been carried out exclusively with white cells. Here, we compared the proliferation of white and opaque cells in two murine models of infection and also monitored, using specially constructed strains, switching between the two states in the host. We found that white cells outcompeted opaque cells in many niches; however, we show for the first time that in some organs (specifically, the heart and spleen), opaque cells competed favorably with white cells and, when injected on their own, could colonize these organs. In environments where the introduced white cells outcompeted the introduced opaque cells, we observed high rates of opaque-to-white switching. We did not observe white-to-opaque switching in any of the niches we examined."
https://openalex.org/W3007853906,"Background Currently, there is a lack of clear definition for neonatal sepsis. The Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) developed consensus criteria to ensure a standardization for neonatal sepsis definition. However, there is no evidence supporting the accuracy of the EMA sepsis criteria in neonatal sepsis diagnosis. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EMA sepsis criteria for proven neonatal sepsis. Methods A multicenter prospective cohort study was conducted from October 2015 to November 2018. Infants with a gestational age over 34th weeks, diagnosed with clinical sepsis and received antibiotics according to the EMA criteria or experienced neonatologists’ opinion were included. Blood culture or multiplex real time-PCR or 16S-rRNA positive infants were accepted as “proven sepsis”. The predictive performance of EMA criteria for proven sepsis was evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve measures of receiver operator characteristic curves. Data-mining methods were used for further analysis. Results Among the 245 included infants, the EMA criteria were positive in 97 infants (39.6%), while proven sepsis was diagnosed in 113 infants (46.1%). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the EMA criteria for proven sepsis were 44.2% (95%CI: 34.9–53.9), 64.4% (95%CI: 55.6–72.5), 55.1% (95%CI: 46.6–59.4) respectively. None of the clinical and laboratory parameters had sufficient performance individually in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy measures. The diagnostic performance was similar when different clinical findings were added to the EMA sepsis criteria or assessment of the score was interpreted in different ways. Conclusions Results highlighted that clinician opinion and standard laboratory tests are limited in the neonatal sepsis diagnosis. The EMA criteria also did not efficiently meet the diagnostic accuracy measures for neonatal sepsis. A predictive sepsis definition and rapid bedside point-of care tests are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2794828524,"Understanding the mechanisms behind human mobility patterns is crucial to improve our ability to optimize and predict traffic flows. Two representative mobility models, i.e., radiation and gravity models, have been extensively compared to each other against various empirical data sets, while their fundamental relation is far from being fully understood. In order to study such a relation, we first model the heterogeneous population landscape by generating a fractal geometry of sites and then by assigning to each site a population independently drawn from a power-law distribution. Then the radiation model on this population landscape, which we call the radiation-on-landscape (RoL) model, is compared to the gravity model to derive the distance exponent in the gravity model in terms of the properties of the population landscape, which is confirmed by the numerical simulations. Consequently, we provide a possible explanation for the origin of the distance exponent in terms of the properties of the heterogeneous population landscape, enabling us to better understand mobility patterns constrained by the travel distance."
https://openalex.org/W2948720170,"Background Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are administered in fixed doses without monitoring. There is still little published data on the impact of the absence of monitoring on adherence to medication and stability of DOAC plasma levels over time. Objectives To explore adherence and stability of DOAC plasma levels over time in patients with atrial fibrillation (NVAF) recently started on DOAC therapy. Patients and methods A prospective observational cohort study with structured follow up including assessment of adherence to medication, plasma levels at baseline, 3,6 and 12 months and adverse events. Results We included 164 patients; 89% were previous users of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). One-year adherence was reasonably good: Morisky adherence measurement scores of 6–8 in 92%. The majority of DOAC plasma levels were within reported on-therapy ranges; dabigatran (median 104.4 ng/ml, IQR 110.2), rivaroxaban (median 185.2 ng/ml, IQR 216.1) and on average levels were not different for full and adjusted doses. There was significant variation between patients, but no significant differences over time within individuals. A substantial proportion of patients starting in the upper-or lower 20th percentiles remained there during the entire follow up. Seventeen bleedings (16 minor, 1 major) were reported, no ischemic events and bleeding or thrombotic events were not associated with DOAC plasma levels. Conclusions Adherence was reasonably good in the majority of patients. Our data confirm the stability of DOAC plasma levels over time. Knowledge of such data may, in the individual patient, contribute to optimal drug and dose selection."
https://openalex.org/W2966641364,"Background HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are produced in India at low cost. However, concerns surrounding reinfection and budgetary impact limit treatment scale-up in India. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of HCV treatment in India, including reinfection. Methods A closed cohort Markov model of HCV disease progression, treatment, and reinfection was parameterized. We compared treatment by fibrosis stage (F2-F4 or F0-F4) to no treatment from a health care payer perspective. Costs (2017 USD$, based on India-specific data) and health utilities (in quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) were attached to each health state. We assumed DAAs with 90% sustained viral response at $900/treatment and 1%/year reinfection, varied in the sensitivity analysis from 0.1–15%. We deemed the intervention cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) fell below India’s per capita GDP ($1,709). We assessed the budgetary impact of treating all diagnosed individuals. Results HCV treatment for diagnosed F2-F4 individuals was cost-saving (net costs -$2,881 and net QALYs 3.18/person treated; negative ICER) compared to no treatment. HCV treatment remained cost-saving with reinfection rates of 15%/year. Treating all diagnosed individuals was likely cost-effective compared to delay until F2 (mean ICER $1,586/QALY gained, 67% of simulations falling under the $1,709 threshold) with 1%/year reinfection. For all scenarios, annual retesting for reinfection was more cost-effective than the current policy (one-time retest). Treating all diagnosed individuals and reinfections results in net costs of $445–1,334 million over 5 years (<0.25% of total health care expenditure over 5 years), and cost-savings within 14 years. Conclusions HCV treatment was highly cost-effective in India, despite reinfection. Annual retesting for reinfection was cost-effective, supporting a policy change towards more frequent retesting. A comprehensive HCV treatment scale-up plan is warranted in India."
https://openalex.org/W2969783126,"Pallet is a very important innovation in logistics industry. Pallets are so widely used that we can find them in nearly every logistical operation scenario. In order to manage pallets efficiently, researchers have developed several pallet management strategies (PMS). The most common and widely accepted PMS includes extensive management of pallets (EMP), transfer of pallet’s ownership (TPO), and pallet rent (PR). This paper addresses mainly on how to help pallet managers choose a certain kind of PMS from the perspective of supply chain cost. Firstly, cost models of three kinds of PMS are presented. Secondly, all parameters involved in the models are valued based on data that is collected from industry survey. The results show that the cost of PR is constantly lower than EMP, and also lower than TPO when the operation period is no more than 37 months. Finally, the effect of several important parameters on the cost is studied by sensitivity analysis. The selection strategies of PMS are proposed based on the results."
https://openalex.org/W2955607362,"Railways are classic instances of complex socio-technical systems, whose defining characteristic is that they exist and function by integrating (continuous-time) interactions among technical components and human elements. Typically, unlike physical systems, there are no governing laws for describing their dynamics. Based purely on micro-unit data, here we present a data-driven framework to analyze macro-dynamics in such systems, leading us to the identification of specific states and prediction of transitions across them. It consists of three steps, which we elucidate using data from the Dutch railways. First, we form a dimensionally reduced phase-space by extracting a few relevant components, wherein relevance is proxied by dominance in terms of explained variance, as well as by persistence in time. Secondly, we apply a clustering algorithm to the reduced phase-space, resulting in the revelation of states of the system. Specifically, we identify ‘rest’ and ‘disrupted’ states, for which the system operations deviates respectively little and strongly from the planned timetable. Third, we define an early-warning metric based on the probability of transitions across states, predict whether the system is likely to transit from one state to another within a given time-frame and evaluate the performance of this metric using the Peirce skill score. Interestingly, using case studies, we demonstrate that the framework is able to predict large-scale disruptions up to 90 minutes beforehand with significant skill, demonstrating, for the railway companies, its potential to better track the evolution of large-scale disruptions in their networks. We discuss that the applicability of the three-step framework stretches to other systems as well—i.e., not only socio-technical ones—wherein real-time monitoring can help to prevent macro-scale state transitions, albeit the methods chosen to execute each step may depend on specific system-details."
https://openalex.org/W2993148195,"Italian baseball played by visually impaired and blind athletes is an adapted team sport which maintains the peculiar fast-moving features of this popular sport. It is also a mixed team game played together with sighted subjects. Here, we performed a national survey aimed at assessing the differences in psychological well-being (PWB) and quality of life (QoL) between visually impaired baseball players from Italian teams and non-players using a structured online questionnaire. Forty-three visually impaired baseball players and thirty-four visually impaired sedentary individuals completed a structured self-report survey including the validated 18-item Italian versions of the PWB (PWB-18) scale and the Short Form-12 (SF-12) questionnaire to assess the QoL. PWB-18 and SF-12 reference data from the Italian normally sighted population were also employed for comparison with the visually impaired baseball player group. Visually impaired baseball players reported better scores in all dimensions of the PWB-18 scale and significant higher scores in both physical and mental QoL evaluated by SF-12 than the non-player group. In addition, PWB-18 scale findings revealed significant differences between visually impaired baseball players and the reference normally sighted population consisting in lower scores for autonomy, environmental mastery, positive relations with others and purpose in life dimensions. Conversely, the mean scores for PWB-18 personal growth and self-acceptance dimensions were not significantly different between the two groups. The SF-12 questionnaire results demonstrated a significantly higher physical score in visually impaired players compared with the reference population. Instead, the SF-12 mental score of visually impaired athletes tended to be lower, though this difference was not statistically significant. Collectively, our findings suggest that the practice of Italian baseball may have a positive impact on PWB and QoL of visually impaired individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3009587352,"Purpose To assess the prediction accuracy of four variations of total corneal refractive power (TCRP) by the ray tracing method in determining corneal power in eyes after myopic small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). Methods Forty eyes of forty patients who had undergone myopic SMILE were enrolled in this prospective study. Manifest refraction and Pentacam HR were performed preoperatively and three months or more postoperatively. Mean keratometry (Km), true net power (TNP), equivalent keratometry readings (EKR) and 4 subtypes of TCRP (pupil centered or apex centered within a ring or a zone)—TCRPpupil,ring, TCRPpupil,zone, TCRPapex,ring and TCRPapex,zone—were recorded and compared to the theoretical postoperative keratometry value using the clinical history method (CHM). Results The only keratometric values that showed no statistically significant differences from the CHM were 4.0 mm and 4.5 mm EKR, 6.0 mm TCRPpupil,zone and TCRPapex,zone. Pearson’s correlation test revealed that 4.0 mm TCRPpupil,zone exhibited the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.974) followed by TCRPapex,zone 4.0 mm (0.972) and EKR 4.5 mm (0.970). The 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of the 4.0 mm EKR and CHM, the 4.5 mm EKR and CHM, the 6.0 mm TCRPpupil,zone and CHM, the 6.0 mm TCRPapex,zone and CHM were (-1.27 to 1.22 D), (-1.04 to 0.98 D), (-1.39 to 1.08 D) and (-1.38 to 0.96 D), respectively, while the modified 4.0 mm TCRPpupil,zone (TCRPpuil,zone + 0.70 D) and TCRPapex,zone (TCRPapex,zone+0.70 D) yielded the narrowest 95% LOA of (-0.96 to 0.95 D) and (-0.96D, 1.05 D). Conclusions Total corneal refractive power using the ray tracing method could predict corrected corneal power derived from the CHM in eyes following SMILE surgery after simple modification."
https://openalex.org/W2948266269,"This study presents an integrative bioacoustics approach to discriminate eight species of odontocetes found on the outer continental shelf and slope of the western South Atlantic Ocean. Spinner, Atlantic spotted, rough-toothed, Risso’s, bottlenose, short-beaked common dolphins, killer and long-finned pilot whales were visually confirmed during recordings with a 3-element omnidirectional hydrophone array. Spectral and time parameters of whistles and echolocation clicks were used in a discriminant function analysis and a classification tree model. As a first step, whistles and clicks were analysed separately; a further analysis consisted of both vocalisations jointly classified. All species showed species-specific properties in their vocalisations. Whistles had greater misclassification rates when compared to clicks. The correct classification was enhanced by the joint step, given the 5.8% error in the discriminant function analysis and a misclassification rate of 18.8% in the tree model. In addition, Receiver Operating Characteristic curves resulting from the tree algorithm analysis exhibited better model efficiency for all species in the joint classification. These findings on acoustical discrimination of such abundant and cosmopolitan species contribute to delphinid classification systems."
https://openalex.org/W2966454026,"Turnip (Brassica rapa spp. rapa) is an important vegetable species, with a unique physiology. Several plant parts, including both the turnip tubers and leaves, are important for human consumption. During the development of turnip plants, the leaves function as metabolic source tissues, while the tuber first functions as a sink, while later the tuber turns into a source for development of flowers and seeds. In the present study, chemical changes were determined for two genotypes with different genetic background, and included seedling, young leaves, mature leaves, tuber surface, tuber core, stalk, flower and seed tissues, at seven different time points during plant development. As a basis for understanding changes in glucosinolates during plant development, the profile of glucosinolates was analysed using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). This analysis was complemented by a gene expression analysis, focussed on GLS biosynthesis, which could explain part of the observed variation, pointing to important roles of specific gene orthologues for defining the chemical differences. Substantial differences in glucosinolate profiles were observed between above-ground tissues and turnip tuber, reflecting the differences in physiological role. In addition, differences between the two genotypes and between tissues that were harvested early or late during the plant lifecycle. The importance of the observed differences in glucosinolate profile for the ecophysiology of the turnip and for breeding turnips with optimal chemical profiles is discussed."

In vitro methods to examine protein-protein interactions are generally categorized into two classes: in-solution and surface-based methods. Here, using the multivalent interactions between nucleocytoplasmic transport factors and intrinsically disordered FG repeat containing nuclear pore complex proteins as a model system, we examined the utility of three surface-based methods: atomic force microscopy, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, and surface plasmon resonance. Although results were comparable to those of previous reports, the apparent effect of mass transport limitations was demonstrated. Additional experiments with a loss-of-interaction FG repeat mutant variant demonstrated that the binding events that take place on surfaces can be unexpectedly complex, suggesting particular care must be exercised in interpretation of such data."
https://openalex.org/W2948091236,"Purpose Men in Botswana present with more advanced cancer than women, leading to poorer outcomes. We sought to explain sex-specific differences in time to and stage at treatment initiation. Methods Cancer patients who initiated oncology treatment between October 2010 and June 2017 were recruited at four oncology centers in Botswana. Primary outcomes were time from first visit with cancer symptom to treatment initiation, and advanced cancer (stage III/IV). Sociodemographic and clinical covariates were obtained retrospectively through interviews and medical record review. We used accelerated failure time and logistic models to estimate standardized sex differences in treatment initiation time and risk differences for presentation with advanced stage. Results were stratified by cancer type (breast, cervix, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, anogenital, head and neck, esophageal, other). Results 1886 participants (70% female) were included. After covariate adjustment, men experienced longer excess time from first presentation to treatment initiation (8.4 months) than women (7.0 months) for all cancers combined (1.4 months, 95% CI: 0.30, 2.5). In analysis stratified by cancer type, we only found evidence of a sex disparity (Men: 8.2; Women: 6.8 months) among patients with other, non-common cancers (1.4 months, 95% CI: 0.01, 2.8). Men experienced an increased risk of advanced stage (Men: 67%; Women: 60%; aRD: 6.7%, 95% CI: -1.7%, 15.1%) for all cancers combined, but this disparity was only statistically significant among patients with anogenital cancers (Men: 72%; Women: 50%; aRD: 22.0%, 95% CI: 0.5%, 43.5%). Conclusions Accounting for the types of cancers experienced by men and women strongly attenuated disparities in time to treatment initiation and stage. Higher incidence of rarer cancers among men could explain these disparities."
https://openalex.org/W2948282167,"The meroplanktonic larvae of benthic organisms are an important seasonal component of the zooplankton in temperate coastal waters. The larvae of the reef-building polychaete Lanice conchilega contribute up to 15% of the summer zooplankton biomass in the North Sea. Despite their importance for reef maintenance (which positively affects the benthic community), little is known about the trophic ecology of this meroplanktonic larva. Qualitative and quantitative estimates of carbon (C) transfer between trophic levels and of fatty acid (FA)-specific assimilation, biosynthesis, and bioconversion can be obtained by compound-specific stable isotope analysis of FA. The present work tested the hypothesis that the concept of fatty acid trophic markers (FATM), widely used for studies on holoplankton with intermediate to high lipid contents, is also applicable to lipid-poor organisms such as meroplanktonic larvae. The incorporation of isotopically-enriched dietary C by L. conchilega larvae was traced, and lipid assimilation did not follow FA-specific relative availabilities in the diet. Furthermore, FAs that were unavailable in the diet, such as 22:5(n-3), were recorded in L. conchilega, suggesting their bioconversion by the larvae. The results indicate that L. conchilega larvae preferentially assimilate certain FAs and regulate their FA composition (lipid homeostasis) independently of that of their diet. Their quasi-homeostatic response to dietary FA availability could imply that the concept of FATM has limited application in lipid-poor organisms such as L. conchilega larvae."
https://openalex.org/W2965415045,"The concentration of nitrogen can generate different strategies in plants in response to stress. In this study, we investigated how nitrogen concentration interferes with the defense system of Annona emarginata. Low concentrations of nitrogen increased the allocation of photosynthetic resources to carbon metabolism, resulting in an increase in the synthesis of volatile substances involved in signaling and defense that contributed to antioxidant enzymes in overcoming stress. The availability of nitrogen at 5.62 mM concentration might have helped to induce increased resistance in the plants because at this concentration, signaling substances and defense substances (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) were observed. Plants cultivated with the highest nitrate concentration displaced energy for the reduction of this ion, likely forming nitric oxide, a signaling molecule. This condition, together with the decrease in carbon skeletons, may have contributed to the lower synthesis of volatile substances of the specialized metabolism that are also involved with signaling. Varying the nitrogen in Annona emarginata cultivation revealed that depending on the concentration, volatile substances show higher or lower synthesis and participation in the system of signaling and defense in the plant. These results may suggest that volatile substances participate in resistance to pests and diseases, which is a necessary condition for Annona emarginata to be preferentially used as rootstock for Annona x atemoya."
https://openalex.org/W2965552528,"Leptospira spp. are re-emerging zoonotic pathogens. Previous research has found that Blanding’s turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) experimentally infected with Leptospira interrogans shed leptospires in their urine, suggesting that they could play a role in transmitting pathogen within an aquatic ecosystem. This study investigated whether a population of wild Blanding’s turtles known to be exposed to Leptospira spp. actively shed the pathogen under natural conditions. Blood samples were collected for serologic testing and to assess the health of the turtles. Free catch urine was collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. All turtles were seropositive for Leptospira spp. and 73.5% (25/34) of the urine samples were PCR positive. All animals appeared clinically healthy and showed no apparent signs of disease. This study confirms that wild Blanding’s turtles can actively shed Leptospira spp. in their urine and suggests that they may play a role in the epidemiology of this disease in habitats in which they reside."
https://openalex.org/W2984776208,"Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri are two sympatric human malaria species prevalent in Africa, Asia and Oceania. The reported prevalence of both P. ovale spp. was relatively low compared to other malaria species, but more sensitive molecular detection techniques have shown that asymptomatic low-density infections are more common than previously thought. Whole genome sequencing of both P. ovale spp. revealed genetic dissociation between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri suggesting a species barrier. In this study we further evaluate such a barrier by assessing polymorphisms in the genes of three vaccine candidate surface protein: circumsporozoite protein/ thrombospondin-related anonymous-related protein (ctrp), circumsporozoite surface protein (csp) and merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1). The complete coding sequence of ctrp and csp, and a partial fragment of msp1 were isolated from 25 P. ovale isolates and compared to previously reported reference sequences. A low level of nucleotide diversity (Pi = 0.02-0.10) was observed in all three genes. Various sizes of tandem repeats were observed in all ctrp, csp and msp1 genes. Both tandem repeat unit and nucleotide polymorphism in all three genes exhibited clear dimorphism between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri, supporting evidence of non-recombination between these two species."
https://openalex.org/W2991416225,"Background Patient-reported outcomes are increasingly used in evaluations of joint replacement surgery, but it is unclear if symptoms of osteoarthritis (i.e., pain and dysfunction) influence health perceptions similarly before and after surgery. Methods In this prospective study based on a hospital-based arthroplasty registry, patients with primary total hip or knee arthroplasty (THA, N = 990, and TKA, N = 907) completed the WOMAC Pain and Function scales, and the SF12 Physical and Mental Component Scores (PCS and MCS), before surgery and one year later. Associations between WOMAC and SF12 scales were examined using mixed linear regression models. Results All patient-reported outcomes improved following total joint arthroplasty, but the associations between symptom scales and global health perceptions were altered. Mental health scores at a given level of pain or function were lower after surgery than before, by about 4–5 points, a clinically meaningful and statistically significant difference. In contrast, the associations between WOMAC scales and the PCS remained stable. These findings were observed in both cohorts of patients. Conclusions After total joint arthroplasty, mental health scores were lower than would have been expected given the symptomatic improvement. This suggests that relationships between patient-reported outcomes are context-dependent, and that care should be exerted when interpreting changes in patient-reported outcomes over time."
https://openalex.org/W2991480153,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality used in longitudinal cell tracking. Previous studies suggest that MagA, a putative iron transport protein from magnetotactic bacteria, is a useful gene-based magnetic resonance contrast agent. Hemagglutinin-tagged MagA was stably expressed in undifferentiated embryonic mouse teratocarcinoma, multipotent P19 cells to provide a suitable model for tracking these cells during differentiation. Western blot and immunocytochemistry confirmed the expression and membrane localization of MagA in P19 cells. Surprisingly, elemental iron analysis using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed significant iron uptake in both parental and MagA-expressing P19 cells, cultured in the presence of iron-supplemented medium. Withdrawal of this extracellular iron supplement revealed unexpected iron export activity in P19 cells, which MagA expression attenuated. The influence of iron supplementation on parental and MagA-expressing cells was not reflected by longitudinal relaxation rates. Measurement of transverse relaxation rates (R2* and R2) reflected changes in total cellular iron content but did not clearly distinguish MagA-expressing cells from the parental cell type, despite significant differences in the uptake and retention of total cellular iron. Unlike other cell types, the reversible component R2′ (R2* ‒ R2) provided only a moderately strong correlation to amount of cellular iron, normalized to amount of protein. This is the first report to characterize MagA expression in a previously unrecognized iron exporting cell type. The interplay between contrast gene expression and systemic iron metabolism substantiates the potential for diverting cellular iron toward the formation of a novel iron compartment, however rudimentary when using a single magnetotactic bacterial gene expression system like magA. Since relatively few mammalian cells export iron, the P19 cell line provides a tractable model of ferroportin activity, suitable for magnetic resonance analysis of key iron-handling activities and their influence on gene-based MRI contrast."
https://openalex.org/W2918519287,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder associated with impairment in functioning. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to help individuals with this health condition, and psychological interventions are considered a priority. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) offers a theoretical framework for assessing functioning and disability. The ICF Core Sets for schizophrenia are a list of ICF categories describing the most common problems in functioning of persons affected by this health condition. This study aimed to explore the content validity of these ICF Core Sets and to identify the most common problems in people with schizophrenia from the perspective of psychologists. Psychologists with experience of schizophrenia treatment were recruited for a three-round Delphi study in order to gather their views regarding the problems commonly presented by these patients. A total of 175 psychologists from 46 countries covering the six WHO regions answered the first-round questionnaire, and 137 completed all three rounds. The 7,526 concepts extracted from first-round responses were linked to 412 ICF categories and 53 personal factors. Consensus (≥75% agreement) was reached for 76 ICF categories and 28 personal factors. Seventy-three of the 97 ICF categories that form the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for schizophrenia achieved consensus, and only three categories that yielded consensus do not feature in this Core Set. These results support the content validity of these ICF Core Sets from the perspective of psychologists. This provides further evidence of the suitability of the ICF framework for describing functioning and disability in persons with schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2948545859,"Anti-prion protein (PrP) monoclonal antibody 132, which recognizes mouse PrP amino acids 119–127, enables us to reliably detect abnormal isoform prion protein (PrPSc) in cells or frozen tissue sections by immunofluorescence assay, although treatment with guanidinium salts is a prerequisite. Despite the benefit of this mAb, the mechanism of PrPSc-specific detection remains unclear. Therefore, to address this mechanism, we analyzed the reactivities of mono- and bivalent mAb 132 to recombinant mouse PrP (rMoPrP) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In ELISA, binding of the monovalent form was significantly weaker than that of the bivalent form, indicating that bivalent binding confers a higher binding stability to mAb 132. Compared with other anti-PrP mAbs tested, the reactivity of bivalent mAb 132 was easily affected by a decrease in antigen concentration. The binding kinetics of mAb 132 assessed by SPR were consistent with the results of ELISA. The dissociation constant of the monovalent form was approximately 260 times higher than that of the bivalent form, suggesting that monovalent binding is less stable than bivalent binding. Furthermore, the amount of mAb 132 that bound to rMoPrP decreased if the antigen density was too low to allow bivalent binding. If two cellular PrP (PrPC) are close enough to allow bivalent binding, mAb 132 binds to PrPC. These results indicate that weak monovalent binding to monomeric PrPC diminishes PrPC signals to background level, whereas after exposure of the epitope, mAb 132 binds stably to oligomeric PrPSc in a bivalent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2948768510,"Hepatic steatosis is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries. Both genetic and environmental factors are known as causes of the disease although their underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood. This study investigated the association of DNA methylation with oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis. It also examined effects of food components on DNA methylation in hepatic steatosis. Genome-wide DNA methylation of oleic acid (OA)-induced lipid accumulation in vitro cell model was investigated using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Changes of DNA methylation were also analyzed after treatment with food components decreasing OA-induced lipid accumulation in the model. We identified total 81 regions that were hypermethylated by OA but hypomethylated by food components or vice versa. We determined the expression of seven genes proximally located at the selected differentially methylated regions. Expression levels of WDR27, GNAS, DOK7, MCF2L, PRKG1, and CMYA5 were significantly different between control vs OA and OA vs treatment with food components. We demonstrated that DNA methylation was associated with expression of genes in the model of hepatic steatosis. We also found that food components reversely changed DNA methylation induced by OA and alleviated lipid accumulation. These results suggest that DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms causing the hepatic steatosis and its regulation by food components provides insights that may prevent or alleviate lipid accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2964284026,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the 9th leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. Patients live in a complex health care system with both formal and informal providers, and it is important that a TB diagnosis is not missed at the first interaction with the health care system. In this study, we highlight the health seeking behavior of patients and missed opportunities for early TB diagnosis for which interventions could be instituted to ensure early TB diagnosis and prompt TB treatment initiation.This study was nested in a cross-sectional study that assessed the accuracy of different Xpert MTB/Rif implementation strategies in programmatic settings at the referral hospitals in Uganda. We documented the symptom profile of presumptive TB patients and assessed the health seeking behavior of those with chronic cough by calculating proportion of patients that visited each type of health facility and further calculated the odds of being TB positive given the type of health facility initially visited for consultation.A total of 1,863 presumptive TB patients were enrolled of which 979 (54.5%) were male, and 1795 (99.9%) had chronic cough. A total of 1352 (75.4%) had previously sought care for chronic cough, with 805 (59.6%) seeking care from a public health facility followed by private health facility (289; 21.4%). Up to 182 (13.5%) patients visited a drug store for chronic cough. Patients whose first contact was a private health facility were more likely to have a positive GeneXpert test (adjOR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.9; p = 0.047).Chronic cough is a main symptom for many of the presumptive TB patients presenting at referral hospitals, with several patients having to visit the health system more than once before a TB diagnosis is made. This suggests the need for patients to be thoroughly evaluated at first interface with the health care system to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation. Improved TB diagnosis possibly with the GeneXpert test, at first contact with the health care system has potential to increase TB case finding and break the transmission cycle in the community."
https://openalex.org/W2991584582,"The Nankai Trough in Japan has been identified as a geological feature that could cause extensive damage in the event of a major earthquake. In this study, we investigated the impact of effective guidance signs for hearing-impaired individuals requiring special care when escaping to a tsunami evacuation building (emergency evacuation location) using geographical information system (GIS) and viewshed analysis. We selected an area we considered would suffer severe damage following a major earthquake and tsunami; we identified difficulties in the provision of escape routes. Using GIS, we determined the time required for escape and tsunami arrival time if effective signs were installed; we undertook such analysis using the height data of buildings in the target area. With effectively installed guidance signs, the average required evacuation time was 36.88 minutes; without such signs (which is currently the case in the target area), the average time was 47.10 minutes: that would result in citizens getting caught by the tsunami. Installing effective guidance signs would allow hearing-impaired individuals to escape to an evacuation building before being hit by the tsunami."
https://openalex.org/W2955591294,"Recently the anti-viral effects of prophylactic treatment with the low-molecular-weight heparan sulfate mimetic PG545 in Ross River virus (RRV) infected mice were reported. We further investigated the related, transient pathophysiology of PG545 drug treatment in RRV-infected and mock-infected PG545-treated mice. PG545 treatment resulted in mild lethargy and piloerection, on days after the drug administration. Mice were treated with two or three doses of PG545 within a ten-day period and were subsequently culled at peak disease or at disease resolution. The treatment responses of the spleen and liver were assessed through histology, flow cytometry, gene arrays and serum biochemistry. Microscopy showed an expanded red pulp in the spleen following either two or three treatments with PG545. The red pulp expansion was further demonstrated by the proliferation of megakaryocytes and erythrocyte precursors within the spleen. In addition, flow cytometry and gene array analyses revealed a reduction of lymphocytes within the spleens of PG545-treated mice. Previously unreported, RRV-induced elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) enzymes and creatinine were also noted in the RRV-infected mice. However, PG545 only reduced AST and ALT levels but not the creatinine levels in infected mice during treatment. Mice treated with three doses of PG545 also showed hepatosplenomegaly and anaemia, which were reversed upon discontinuation of the treatment. In summary, this study demonstrates that dose and frequency related haemopoietic pathophysiology such as hepatosplenomegaly and anaemia, occurred in C57BL/6 mice treated with PG545. However, this effect was reversible once drug administration is terminated."
https://openalex.org/W2981240700,"Although QRS duration (QRSd) is an important determinant of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response, non-responder rates remain high. QRS fragmentation can also reflect electrical dyssynchrony. We hypothesized that quantification of abnormal QRS peaks (QRSp) would predict CRT response.Forty-seven CRT patients (left ventricular ejection fraction = 23±7%) were prospectively studied. Digital 12-lead ECGs were recorded during native rhythm at baseline and 6 months post-CRT. For each precordial lead, QRSp was defined as the total number of peaks detected on the unfiltered QRS minus those detected on a smoothed moving average template QRS. CRT response was defined as >5% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction post-CRT.Sixty-percent of patients responded to CRT. Baseline QRSd was similar in CRT responders and non-responders, and did not change post-CRT regardless of response. Baseline QRSp was greater in responders than non-responders (9.1±3.5 vs. 5.9±2.2, p = 0.001) and decreased in responders (9.2±3.6 vs. 7.9±2.8, p = 0.03) but increased in non-responders (5.5±2.3 vs. 7.5±2.8, p = 0.049) post-CRT. In multivariable analysis, QRSp was the only independent predictor of CRT response (Odds Ratio [95% Confidence Interval]: 1.5 [1.1-2.1], p = 0.01). ROC analysis revealed QRSp (area under curve = 0.80) to better discriminate response than QRSd (area under curve = 0.67). Compared to QRSd ≥150ms, QRSp ≥7 identified response with similar sensitivity but greater specificity (74 vs. 32%, p<0.05). Amongst patients with QRSd <150ms, more patients with QRSp ≥7 responded than those with QRSp <7 (75 vs. 0%, p<0.05).Our novel automated QRSp metric independently predicts CRT response and decreases in responders. Electrical dyssynchrony assessed by QRSp may improve CRT selection and track structural remodeling, especially in those with QRSd <150ms."
https://openalex.org/W2980031855,"The distribution of silent comic illustrations can facilitate the communication and transfer of scientific recommendations about sustainable land management (SLM) to local communities in countries where many people are illiterate. However, since there are cross-cultural differences in “visual languages”, visualization styles need to be carefully selected as well as locals’ comprehension of the illustrated recommendation evaluated systematically. Three agricultural recommendations were chosen for comic-style illustrations, distributed to six communities in the Mahafaly region of southwestern Madagascar and evaluated using a three-step, interdependent approach. The silent comics illustrated (i) composting of manure and its application to improve soil fertility; (ii) cautious utilization of succulent silver thicket as supplementary forage; and (iii) sustainable harvesting practices of wild yam. Results revealed that general understandability strongly depended on the community that was surveyed and on the environmental subject that was illustrated. We found a strong relationship between the general understandability of comics and the divergence that exist in communities’ socio-economic structure. Education level was an important factor that explained a better understanding of respondents for the comic illustrating compost production, but not for comics that illustrated sustainable usage of silver thicket and wild yam harvest. Willingness to follow the recommended practice was impaired when respondents valued no change to the improved technique compared to the common one. Effects of respondents’ socio-economic characteristics on the implementation of the recommended practice could not be clarified within this study due to the small subset of data. Based on the evaluation of recurring comments made by respondents and interviewers, we conclude that comics can be a useful communication tool to increase locals’ awareness and comprehension for SLM practices. This, however, requires that drawing details used to facilitate farmers’ ability to adopt a point-of-view inside the comic story are used thoughtfully as they might interfere with the central message."
https://openalex.org/W2962759206,"To analyze trends in external mortality in Hungary between 1995 and 2014 by sex.Data on the numbers of deaths due to external causes were obtained from the published nationwide population register. Negative binomial regression was applied to investigate the yearly trends in external-cause mortality rates. Cyclic trends were investigated using the Walter-Elwood method.Suicide and accidents accounted for approximately 84% of the all-external-cause of deaths in Hungary. Annual suicide, unintentional falls and traffic accidents mortality declined significantly (p-value for annual trend: p < 0.001) from 30.5 (95% CI: 29.5-31.5) to 15.8 (15.1-16.5), from 31.2 (30.2-32.2) to 12.2 (11.7-12.8) and from 17.2 (16.4-18) to 5.4 (5-5.8) per 100 000 persons per year, respectively, during the study period. A significant declining trend in annual mortality was also found for assault, cold/heating-related accidents and accidents caused by electric current. However, the declining trend for drowning-related accidents was significant only for males. Significant winter-peak seasonality was found in the mortality rates from accidental falls, cold/heat-related accidents, other accidents caused by submersion/obstruction and other causes. Seasonal trends with a peak from June to July were observed in death rates from suicide/self-harm, accidental drowning/submersion and accidents caused by electric current. A significant seasonal variation with a peak in September was revealed in the mortality due to traffic accidents.This Hungarian study suggests that there was a significant seasonal effect on almost all kinds of deaths from external causes between 1995 and 2014. Environmental effects are involved in the aetiology of suicide and accidents."
