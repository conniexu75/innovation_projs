We were able to transfer 60 watts with ∼40% efficiency over distances in excess of 2 meters. We present a quantitative model describing the power transfer, which matches the experimental results to within 5%. We discuss the practical applicability of this system and suggest directions for further study."

https://openalex.org/W2144154026,"A global decrease in microRNA (miRNA) levels is often observed in human cancers, indicating that small RNAs may have an intrinsic function in tumour suppression. To identify miRNA components of tumour suppressor pathways, we compared miRNA expression profiles of wild-type and p53-deficient cells. Here we describe a family of miRNAs, miR-34a-c, whose expression reflected p53 status. Genes encoding miRNAs in the miR-34 family are direct transcriptional targets of p53, whose induction by DNA damage and oncogenic stress depends on p53 both in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of miR-34 induces cell cycle arrest in both primary and tumour-derived cell lines, which is consistent with the observed ability of miR-34 to downregulate a programme of genes promoting cell cycle progression. The p53 network suppresses tumour formation through the coordinated activation of multiple transcriptional targets, and miR-34 may act in concert with other effectors to inhibit inappropriate cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2100443415,"A genome-wide association scan in individuals with Crohn's disease by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium detected strong association at four novel loci. We tested 37 SNPs from these and other loci for association in an independent case-control sample. We obtained replication for the autophagy-inducing IRGM gene on chromosome 5q33.1 (replication P = 6.6 × 10−4, combined P = 2.1 × 10−10) and for nine other loci, including NKX2-3, PTPN2 and gene deserts on chromosomes 1q and 5p13."
https://openalex.org/W2056564376,"Teleosts comprise more than half of all vertebrate species and have adapted to a variety of marine and freshwater habitats. Their genome evolution and diversification are important subjects for the understanding of vertebrate evolution. Although draft genome sequences of two pufferfishes have been published, analysis of more fish genomes is desirable. Here we report a high-quality draft genome sequence of a small egg-laying freshwater teleost, medaka (Oryzias latipes). Medaka is native to East Asia and an excellent model system for a wide range of biology, including ecotoxicology, carcinogenesis, sex determination and developmental genetics. In the assembled medaka genome (700 megabases), which is less than half of the zebrafish genome, we predicted 20,141 genes, including approximately 2,900 new genes, using 5'-end serial analysis of gene expression tag information. We found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at an average rate of 3.42% between the two inbred strains derived from two regional populations; this is the highest SNP rate seen in any vertebrate species. Analyses based on the dense SNP information show a strict genetic separation of 4 million years (Myr) between the two populations, and suggest that differential selective pressures acted on specific gene categories. Four-way comparisons with the human, pufferfish (Tetraodon), zebrafish and medaka genomes revealed that eight major interchromosomal rearrangements took place in a remarkably short period of approximately 50 Myr after the whole-genome duplication event in the teleost ancestor and afterwards, intriguingly, the medaka genome preserved its ancestral karyotype for more than 300 Myr."

https://openalex.org/W2092284040,"Forming distinct representations of multiple contexts, places, and episodes is a crucial function of the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus subregion has been suggested to fulfill this role. We have tested this hypothesis by generating and analyzing a mouse strain that lacks the gene encoding the essential subunit of the N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR1, specifically in dentate gyrus granule cells. The mutant mice performed normally in contextual fear conditioning, but were impaired in the ability to distinguish two similar contexts. A significant reduction in the context-specific modulation of firing rate was observed in the CA3 pyramidal cells when the mutant mice were transferred from one context to another. These results provide evidence that NMDA receptors in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus play a crucial role in the process of pattern separation."
https://openalex.org/W2130434635,"Mitochondria in cells comprise a tubulovesicular reticulum shaped by dynamic fission and fusion events. The multimeric dynamin-like GTPase Drp1 is a critical protein mediating mitochondrial division. It harbors multiple motifs including GTP-binding, middle, and GTPase effector (GED) domains that are important for both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. As for other members of the dynamin superfamily, such interactions are critical for assembly of higher-order structures and cooperative increases in GTPase activity. Although the functions of Drp1 in cells have been extensively studied, mechanisms underlying its regulation remain less clear. Here, we have identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Drp1 within the GED domain at Ser637 that inhibits Drp1 GTPase activity. Mechanistically, this change in GTPase activity likely derives from decreased interaction of GTP-binding/middle domains with the GED domain since the phosphomimetic S637D mutation impairs this intramolecular interaction but not Drp1-Drp1 intermolecular interactions. Using the phosphomimetic S637D substitution, we also demonstrate that mitochondrial fission is prominently inhibited in cells. Thus, protein phosphorylation at Ser637 results in clear alterations in Drp1 function and mitochondrial morphology that are likely involved in dynamic regulation of mitochondrial division in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1992752531,"During cytokinesis, as dividing animal cells pull apart into two daughter cells, the final stage, termed abscission, requires breakage of the midbody, a thin membranous stalk connecting the daughter cells. This membrane fission event topologically resembles the budding of viruses, such as HIV-1, from infected cells. We found that two proteins involved in HIV-1 budding—tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101), a subunit of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT-I), and Alix, an ESCRT-associated protein—were recruited to the midbody during cytokinesis by interaction with centrosome protein 55 (Cep55), a centrosome and midbody protein essential for abscission. Tsg101, Alix, and possibly other components of ESCRT-I were required for the completion of cytokinesis. Thus, HIV-1 budding and cytokinesis use a similar subset of cellular components to carry out topologically similar membrane fission events."
https://openalex.org/W2067187286,"Adipocyte fatty-acid-binding protein, aP2 (FABP4) is expressed in adipocytes and macrophages, and integrates inflammatory and metabolic responses. Studies in aP2-deficient mice have shown that this lipid chaperone has a significant role in several aspects of metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. Here we demonstrate that an orally active small-molecule inhibitor of aP2 is an effective therapeutic agent against severe atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes in mouse models. In macrophage and adipocyte cell lines with or without aP2, we also show the target specificity of this chemical intervention and its mechanisms of action on metabolic and inflammatory pathways. Our findings demonstrate that targeting aP2 with small-molecule inhibitors is possible and can lead to a new class of powerful therapeutic agents to prevent and treat metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W2050761448,"Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are a ubiquitous component of the nuclei of galaxies. It is normally assumed that after the merger of two massive galaxies, a SMBH binary will form, shrink because of stellar or gas dynamical processes, and ultimately coalesce by emitting a burst of gravitational waves. However, so far it has not been possible to show how two SMBHs bind during a galaxy merger with gas because of the difficulty of modeling a wide range of spatial scales. Here we report hydrodynamical simulations that track the formation of a SMBH binary down to scales of a few light years after the collision between two spiral galaxies. A massive, turbulent, nuclear gaseous disk arises as a result of the galaxy merger. The black holes form an eccentric binary in the disk in less than 1 million years as a result of the gravitational drag from the gas rather than from the stars."

https://openalex.org/W2021436633,"Fibrocytes are a distinct population of fibroblast-like progenitor cells in peripheral blood that have recently been shown to possess plasticity to differentiate along mesenchymal lineages, including commitment to myofibroblast and adipocyte cells. Here, we demonstrated that transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 drives fibrocyte-to-myofibroblast differentiation through activating Smad2/3 and SAPK/JNK MAPK pathways, which in turn stimulates α-smooth muscle actin expression. We determined that SAPK/JNK signaling acts in a positive feedback loop to modulate Smad2/3 nuclear availability and Smad2/3-dependent transcription. Conversely, fibrocyte-to-adipocyte differentiation is driven by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ agonist troglitazone, which is associated with cytoplasmic lipid accumulation and induction of aP2. Treatment with troglitazone also disrupted TGFβ1-activated SAPK/JNK signaling, leading to decreased Smad2/3 transactivation activity and α-smooth muscle actin expression. Interestingly, TGFβ1 was demonstrated to have reciprocal inhibition on fibrocyte differentiation to adipocytes. By activating SAPK/JNK signaling, which is normally suppressed during adipogenesis, PPARγ-dependent transactivation activity and induction of aP2 expression were disrupted. Taken together, within the context of the local microenvironmental niche, the delicate balance of PPARγ and TGFβ1 activation drives the selection of an adipocyte or myofibroblast differentiation pathway through SAPK/JNK signaling.

A large body of evidence now supports the existence of adult stem cells. Although they are predominantly found in the bone marrow, they have also been isolated from muscle, adipose tissue, connective tissue, and in peripheral circulation. Adult stem cells are characterized by their ability to differentiate along multiple lineages, giving rise to fully differentiated cells with distinct function. Multiple signaling networks orchestrate the development and differentiation of adult stem cells into functional mesenchymal, neuronal, and epithelial lineages. We recently characterized the plasticity of an adult progenitor cell found in circulation, termed fibrocytes, which can differentiate into myofibroblast, osteoblast, and adipocyte lineages (1Hong K.M.

Fibrocytes are a distinct population of fibroblast-like cells in peripheral blood with a unique cell surface phenotype, expressing CD45RO, CXCR4, and collagen I (3Abe R. Donnelly S.C. Peng T.

Med. 1994; 1: 71-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are distinct from tissue fibroblasts, monocyte/macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, or their precursors, as well as epithelial and endothelial cells (5Metz C.N. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1342-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 6Chesney J. Metz C. Stavitsky A.B. Bacher M. Bucala R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 419-425PubMed Google Scholar). Known functions of fibrocytes include potent stimulation of T cells in antigen-specific immunity (7Chesney J. Bacher M. Bender A. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6307-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), wound healing following injury (4Bucala R. Spiegel L.A. Chesney J. Hogan M. Cerami A. Mol.

The human transforming growth factor-β isoforms constitute extracellular signaling molecules that have pleiotropic functions. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ) 2The abbreviations used are: TGFβ1, transforming growth factor β1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SBE, Smad binding element; TGZ, troglitazone; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response elements; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; αSMA, smooth muscle actin; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. serves as a key fibrogenic mediator that initiates signaling by binding to type I and type II receptor kinases (TβR). This activates receptor-associated Smads such as Smad2 and Smad3, allowing them to complex with Smad4 for translocation to the nucleus. Alternatively, TβR can also signal through other pathways, the most prominent being mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (8Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 628-633PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the MAPK family include ERK as well as two stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK): the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the p38 pathway. The mechanism whereby TGFβ1 induces activation of MAPK pathways was recently elucidated and involved activation through the upstream mediators Ras, RhoA, and TGF-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) (10Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 11Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Adipocyte differentiation is a complex process regulated by extracellular hormones and cytokines. Appropriate environmental exposure leads to up-regulation of specific transcription factors that serve as master regulators in the activation of adipocyte-specific genes, such as leptin and aP2 (12Gregoire F.M. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2001; 226: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). One such transcription factor is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Following binding to natural ligands (i.e. 15-deoxy-PGJ2) or synthetic agonists (i.e. troligtazone), PPARγ becomes activated and forms a heterodimer with RXRα (13Miyata K.S. McCaw S.E. Marcus S.L. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). The complex then translocates to the nucleus and binds to specific PPAR response elements (PPREs) in the promoter region of its target genes, such as aP2, and contributes to differentiation (15Schachtrup C. Emmler T. Bleck B. Sandqvist A. Spener F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the role of TGFβ1 in activating distinct signaling pathways that lead to the stimulation of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression during myofibroblast differentiation. Under different environmental cues, fibrocytes can differentiate into adipocytes, a process that involves activation of the PPARγ pathway leading to induction of aP2 expression. TGFβ1 signaling in fibrocytes activates both Smad 2/3 and MAP kinases, specifically the ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK pathways. PPARγ agonists can negatively regulate this process, through a PPARγ-independent pathway. A blockade of the SAPK/JNK pathway either by troglitazone or by chemical treatment (JNK inhibitor) inhibited TGFβ1-induced αSMA expression. Conversely, we found that TGFβ1 signaling suppressed PPARγ activity and aP2 expression. TGFβ1-induced SAPK/JNK phosphorylation leads to downstream signaling that negatively affects the transactivation activity of PPARγ. Taken together, SAPK/JNK signaling affected the divergence of adipogenic and myofibrogenic differentiation of fibrocytes. This is important because it provides a therapeutic target whereby through the use of a synthetic PPARγ agonist we are able to block a key TGFβ1-mediated pro-fibrotic effect, which has exciting implications for therapy of currently untreated fibrotic diseases. Fibrocytes Isolation—Fibrocytes were harvested from peripheral blood mononuclear cells according to previously published methods (2Phillips R.J. Burdick M.D. Hong K. Lutz M.A. Murray L.A. Xue Y.Y. Belperio J.A. Keane M.P. Strieter R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 3Abe R. Donnelly S.C. Peng T. Bucala R. Metz C.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7556-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from human leukopheresis packs by gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences). Following culturing on fibronectin-coated flasks for 72 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 20% fetal bovine serum and 4% l-glutamine, non-adherent cells were removed. The adherent cells were supplemented with new media and remained incubated for 7-10 days. The cells were then gently detached from flasks by incubation with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies, San Diego, CA) for 10 min at 37 °C. This crude fibrocyte preparation was purified of contaminating monocytes/macrophages, T cells, and B cells by magnetic immunodepletion using anti-CD14; pan-T, anti-CD2; and pan-B, anti-CD19 Dynabeads, respectively (Dynal Inc., Brown Deer, WI). Myofibroblast and Adipocyte Differentiation—For myofibroblast differentiation, enriched fibrocytes were treated with serum-depleted Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml TGFβ1. Culture media was changed every 48-72 h. For adipocyte differentiation, fibrocytes were treated with PBM culture media (Cambrex, Charles City, IA) supplemented with 10 μm troglitazone. Culture media was changed every 48 h. All reagents with the exception of TGFβ1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were purchased from Sigma. Oil Red O Staining—Cells were stained with Oil Red O to assess for lipid accumulation, as previously described (16Ramirez-Zacarias J.L. Castro-Munozledo F. Kuri-Harcuch W. Histochemistry. 1992; 97: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells are washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 10% formalin solution for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by wash with 60% isopropyl alcohol for 5 min. Cells are then stained with Oil Red O solution for 90 min, followed by a gentle rinse with water. Cells are counterstained with hematoxylin for 3 min and washed with water before microscopic visualization. Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as previously described (1Hong K.M. Burdick M.D. Phillips R.J. Heber D. Strieter R.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 2029-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Phillips R.J. Burdick M.D. Hong K. Lutz M.A. Murray L.A. Xue Y.Y. Belperio J.A. Keane M.P. Strieter R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR analysis, 2.0 μg of RNA was converted to cDNA utilizing random hexamer primers and reverse transcriptase from Maloney murine leukemia virus. Real time PCR was performed using a ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector and SDS analysis software (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The following specific oligonucleotide primers were used in experiments: αSMA, forward, 5′-CGGGCTTTGCTGGTGATG-3′, reverse, 5′-CCCTCGATGGATGGGAAA-3′; aP2, forward, 5′-GGAAAATCAACCACCATAAAGA-3′, reverse, 5′-GGAAGTGACGCCTTTCATGAC-3′. Immunocytochemistry—Fibrocyte-derived myofibroblast or adipocyte cell monolayers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h and then stained for αSMA or aP2 antibodies using the Vectastain ABC system (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Briefly, cells were incubated with a 1:1 mixture of 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PowerBlock (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA) for 30 min, washed, and overlaid with either control or species-specific anti-human antibody. Slides were then rinsed and overlaid with secondary biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG and incubated for 30 min. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, slides were overlaid with Vectastain ABC systems peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and incubated for 30 min. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride reagent was used for chromogenic localization of antibody. After optimal color development, sections were immersed in sterile water, counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin, neutralized in 10% ammonia, and coverslipped with Permount solution after drying overnight. Last, for immunostaining experiments that examined the role of TGFβ1 in activating Smad2/3, we treated fibrocytes with 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 60 min. The cells were stained with either appropriate isotype control or Smad2/3 antibody to monitor for nuclear localization of Smad2/3 proteins. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblotting was performed based on 50 μg of protein from cellular nuclear/cytoplasmic fractions as previously described (1Hong K.M. Burdick M.D. Phillips R.J. Heber D. Strieter R.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 2029-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Phillips R.J. Burdick M.D. Hong K. Lutz M.A. Murray L.A. Xue Y.Y. Belperio J.A. Keane M.P. Strieter R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In brief, cell monolayer in flasks were washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution and then treated with lysis buffer, after which lysates were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and clarified by centrifugation. Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were then loaded onto 10% gradient gels (Amersham Biosciences) and electrophoresed at 100 V until the dye-front reached the end of the gel. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. The membranes are blocked using 5% (w/v) evaporated milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.001% (v/v) Tween 20. The membranes were probed with primary antibody overnight using antibodies against the targets listed: ERK1/2, pERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, pSAPK/JNK, p38 MAPK, pp38 MAPK (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danver, MA), αSMA (R&D Systems), PPARγ (Upstate, Billerica, MA), aP2 (Hycult Biotechnology, Uden, Netherlands), and GAPDH. Appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used based on species-specific requirements; final chemiluminescence detection is based on the ECL+ kit (Amersham Biosciences) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Vector Transfection—Fibrocytes were transfected using Amaxa Nucleofection Technology™ (Amaxa, Koeln, Germany). Cells were re-suspended in solution from a nucleofector kit, also available as part of the Amaxa cell optimization kit, following Amaxa guidelines for cell line transfection (see Amaxa literature). We have optimized this kit for use with fibrocytes. Briefly, 100 μl of 5 × 106 fibrocyte suspension mixed with 2 μg of cDNA was transferred to the provided cuvette and nucleofected with an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa). Cells were transfected using the U023 pulsing parameter and immediately transferred into wells containing 37 °C pre-warmed serum-starved culture medium in 6-well plates. After transfection, cells were cultured from 8 h before treatment with appropriate parameters. PPRE (17Polikandriotis J.A. Mazzella L.J. Rupnow H.L. Hart C.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1810-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and Smad binding element (SBE) luciferase reporter gene plasmid as well as PPARγ overexpression vector (pCMV-PPARγ) were obtained from Panomics Inc. (Fremont, CA). PPRE (PPRE3X-Lux) and SBE (SBE3X-Lux) luciferase reporter constructs were used to monitor PPARγ and SMAD transactivation activities, respectively, with each vector containing multiple repeat-specific consensus binding sites. Twelve hours after transfection, fibrocytes were subjected to treatment based on specific experimental design. Cells were then harvested and luminescence was measured in a microplate luminometer. RNA Interference—RNA duplex siRNA for JNK1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A control scramble siRNA duplex was also used. 8 × 106 cells were plated into a 6-well plate with fresh media without antibiotics 24 h before testing. siRNA transfection was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, except for modifications as noted below. Briefly, 160 pmol of siRNA was used per 100 μl of siRNA duplex medium. The cells were incubated for 3.5 h with siRNA duplex solution, followed by treatment in growth media containing 15% fetal calf serum. After siRNA transfection, the cells were incubated for three additional days at 37 °C before additional treatment and analysis. To assess and optimize transfection efficiency, GAPDH siRNA was used to examine appropriate GAPDH gene silencing in fibrocytes. Statistical Analysis—Differences between groups were compared using either the Mann-Whitney U test if the data were not normally distributed, or the Student’s t test if the observations were consistent with a sample from a normally distributed population. Data were analyzed on an IBM PC computer using GraphPad Prism 4 version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA). Results were determined to be statistically significant if p < 0.05 unless otherwise specified. Fibrocytes Possess the Ability to Differentiate to Myofibroblasts and Adipocytes—Fibrocytes were extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Fig. 1A). After 10 days of expansion in vitro, contaminating T cells, B cells, and monocytes were removed using negative selection with magnetic beads (1Hong K.M. Burdick M.D. Phillips R.J. Heber D. Strieter R.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 2029-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Phillips R.J. Burdick M.D. Hong K. Lutz M.A. Murray L.A. Xue Y.Y. Belperio J.A. Keane M.P. Strieter R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The purified fibrocyte population expressed CXCR4, Col I, and CD45RO. These cells do not express myofibroblast marker αSMA or the mature adipocyte marker, adipocyte lipid-binding protein (aP2, also known as FABP4). To induce fibrocyte differentiation to myofibroblasts, the cells were cultured in media supplemented with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) for 3 weeks. To evaluate the phenotype of fibrocytes following differentiation, we performed immunocytochemical staining for the mature myofibroblast protein αSMA. As compared with the isotype control, the majority of fibrocytes treated with TGFβ1 markedly expressed cytoplasmic αSMA (Fig. 1B). No appreciable change in cell morphology was seen with myofibroblasts as compared with untreated fibrocytes. In cells maintained in media without TGFβ1 supplementation, a small population of cells (∼15%) underwent spontaneous differentiation to myofibroblast with associated expression of αSMA. We previously demonstrated the ability of fibrocytes to undergo differentiation to adipocytes when exposed to cyclic treatment of adipogenic induction media containing indomethacin, dexomethasone, 3-isomethylxanthine, and insulin (1Hong K.M. Burdick M.D. Phillips R.J. Heber D. Strieter R.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 2029-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An up-regulation of PPARγ was seen in fibrocyte-derived adipocytes. Here we demonstrate that treatment of fibrocytes with a synthetic PPARγ ligand, troglitazone (TGZ), induced similar fibrocyte to adipocyte differentiation. Following 21 days in culture, the cells were observed to accumulate lipids in intracellular vacuoles, as evidence by extensive Oil Red O Staining (Fig. 1C). Unlike differentiation to myofibroblasts, fibrocytes treated with TGZ transformed into cells of rounder morphology (Fig. 1C). To confirm differentiation into adipocytes, we performed immunocytochemical staining for the mature adipocyte marker aP2. As compared with isotype controls, fibrocyte-derived adipocytes stained extensively for aP2, localized in proximity to intracellular lipid vesicles (Fig. 1C). Whereas a small population of fibrocytes underwent spontaneous differentiation of αSMA expressing myofibroblasts, untreated cells did not express aP2 even after 6 weeks (data not shown). Not all treated cells underwent differentiation to adipocytes, as only ∼45% of the cells committed to the adipose lineage. No increase in adipogenic differentiation was observed even with extended treatment. TGFβ1 Induces αSMA Expression in Fibrocytes and Promotes Its Differentiation to Myofibroblast—We next examined the role of TGFβ1 in induction of αSMA expression. We assessed the kinetics and dose-dependence effect of TGFβ1 activation in fibrocytes. Fibrocytes were treated with varying concentrations of TGFβ1 (0.3-100 ng/ml) for different time periods (1-48 h). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that TGFβ1, at concentrations of 10-100 ng/ml, was able to induce αSMA transcription (Fig. 2A). The maximal induction was observed with 10 ng/ml TGFβ1, with αSMA mRNA level increasing 7-fold as compared with unstimulated cells. We also performed kinetic evaluation of αSMA expression using TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml). The αSMA mRNA transcript was elevated within 8 h after treatment, with an increase of 4.1-fold (Fig. 2B). It was increased to a maximal of 7.3-fold by 24 h. Sustained increase in TGFβ1-stimulated αSMA transcripts were seen even at 48 h. To confirm our findings, we next looked at protein expression of αSMA following TGFβ1 treatment. Fibrocytes were treated with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) for 1-72 h, and protein whole cell extracts were obtained. When we analyzed for αSMA expression on Western blot, we observed a time-dependent increase in the expression of αSMA protein, with significant levels seen at 48 and 72 h following treatment (Fig. 2C). The augmented αSMA protein level was sustained up to 4 days following treatment. Fibrocyte Differentiation to Adipocytes Is Dependent on Activation of PPARγ and Associated with an Induction of aP2 Expression—We had previously demonstrated that fibrocytes differentiate into adipocytes when cells were exposed to a permissive microenvironmental niche (1Hong K.M. Burdick M.D. Phillips R.J. Heber D. Strieter R.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 2029-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined in greater detail the role of PPARγ in mediating this process. PPARγ is well documented as a critical transcription factor in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation. Upon activation, PPARγ binds to common consensus PPRE sites on promoters of specific adipocyte genes in the nucleus, including that of aP2 (15Schachtrup C. Emmler T. Bleck B. Sandqvist A. Spener F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Rival Y. Stennevin A. Puech L. Rouquette A. Cathala C. Lestienne F. Dupont-Passelaigue E. Patoiseau J.F. Wurch T. Junquero D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). aP2 is often used as a mature adipocyte marker because its expression parallels the degree of adipogenic differentiation. To activate PPARγ in fibrocytes, we treated the cells with troglitazone (10 μm) for varying lengths of time (1-72 h) and monitored the kinetics of aP2 transcript activation using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. When compared with untreated cells, an up-regulation of the aP2 mRNA transcript was seen within 12 h, with maximal expression of 13.8-fold at 24 h, and with a sustained response at 48 h (Fig. 3A). To verify the role of PPARγ in aP2 induction in fibrocytes, we examined protein expression of PPARγ and aP2 following TGZ treatment. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared for Western blot analysis. A low basal level of PPARγ was detected in unstimulated fibrocytes (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Following TGZ treatment, there was a significant time-dependent increase in accumulation of PPARγ in the nucleus of cells within 4 h (lane 3) and with maximal stimulation 24 h (lane 4). As for aP2, no basal expression was seen in untreated cells (Fig. 3B). In response to PPARγ activation, we observed a significant, but delayed, increase in aP2 level starting at 24 h (Fig. 3B). The protein level remained elevated at 72 h (lane 6). To corroborate this finding, we pretreated the cells with GW9662, a specific PPARγ antagonist. As shown in Fig. 3C, the ability of TGZ to induce aP2 expression was eliminated in the presence of GW9662. Taken together, these findings advocate that TGZ-mediated induction of aP2 in fibrocytes is dependent upon PPARγ activation. As further verification, we examined the ability of TGZ to promote PPARγ transactivation activity in fibrocytes. We first transfected the cells with a luciferase reporter gene containing 3 PPREs (PPRE3x-Lux) (17Polikandriotis J.A. Mazzella L.J. Rupnow H.L. Hart C.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1810-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which was used as an index of PPARγ transactivation. They were then either treated with TGZ or were co-transfected with a construct encoding PPARγ under the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV-PPARγ). PPRE-driven luciferase activity was then monitored and normalized to Renilla luciferase. As shown in Fig. 3D, use of null vector (lane 2) did not result in spontaneous activation. Conversely, TGZ was able to induce a 5.9-fold increase in luciferase reporter activity (lane 6). Co-transfection with the pCMV-PPARγ expression construct also resulted in robust up-regulation (7.8-fold increase) of PPARγ transactivation in the absence of TGZ (lane 7). Taken together, these results strongly suggest the role of PPARγ as a key regulatory molecule in the activation of fibrocyte-to-adipocyte differentiation. TGFβ1-mediated Induction of αSMA Expression Is Negatively Regulated by Troglitazone via a PPARγ-independent Mechanism—We have now demonstrated the ability of fibrocytes to differentiate along two different lineages. This plasticity is dependent on the presence of specific growth factors such as TGFβ1 for myofibroblast differentiation or PPARγ signaling for adipocyte differentiation. Here, we examined the effects of TGZ on TGFβ1-mediated myofibroblast differentiation. Fibrocytes were treated with TGFβ1 (1-100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of TGZ (10-30 μm). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that TGZ, at a concentration of 30-100 μm, was able to suppress the induction of αSMA transcription activated by TGFβ1 (Fig. 4, A, lanes 8 and 9; B, lane 7). Interestingly, whereas TGZ at 10 μm was sufficient to activate fibrocyte adipogenesis, a higher concentration was needed to effectively suppress the expression of αSMA. We next tested whether the effects of TGZ in inhibiting αSMA was mediated through the activation of PPARγ. Although it is well documented that PPARγ ligands can influence transcription of genes in a PPAR-dependent manner, recent research has revealed that these drugs also elicit “nongenomic” PPAR-independent effects (19Han S. Roman J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For example, PPARγ ligands can rapidly induce phosphorylation of members of the MAPK family or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (20Li M. Lee T.W. Mok T.S. Warner T.D. Yim A.P. Chen G.G. J. Cell Biochem. 2005; 96: 760-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To examine this, we pretreated fibrocytes with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 before treatment with TGFβ1 or TGZ, either alone or in combination. As shown in Fig. 4B, GW9662 (3-10 μm) did not reverse the inhibitory effects of TGZ on αSMA transcript expression (lanes 8 and 9). Even higher concentrations of GW9662 did not improve on this effect (date not shown). We also looked at the effect of TGZ on αSMA protein expression. Again, fibrocytes were pretreated with or without GW9662, then incubated in TGFβ1 (10 μm) and/or TGZ (30 μm) for 72 h. The expression of αSMA was assessed by Western blot. Consistent with mRNA findings, treatment with TGZ inhibited TGFβ1-induced αSMA expression (Fig. 4C, lane 5). The inhibitory effect of TGZ was no"

Systemic administration of antitransforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) antibody has shown some promise in mouse models of DN. However, chronic blockade of the multifunctional TGB-beta could be problematic. Several downstream effects of TGF-beta are mediated by connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which is up-regulated in several renal cells and secreted in the urine in the diabetic state. Using murine models of DN (type 1 and type 2) and a CTGF antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) of novel chimeric chemistry, we evaluated the specific role of this target in DN. In the type 1 model of DN, C57BL6 mice were made diabetic using streptozotocin injections and hyperglycemic animals were treated with CTGF ASOs (20 mg/kg/2 qw) for 4 months. ASO, but not mismatch control oligonucleotide, -treated animals showed significant reduction in target CTGF expression in the kidney with a concomitant decrease in proteinuria and albuminuria. Treatment with the CTGF ASO for 8 wk reduced serum creatinine and attenuated urinary albuminuria and proteinuria in diabetic db/db mice, a model of type 2 DN. The ASO also reduced expression of genes involved in matrix expansion such as fibronectin and collagen (I and IV) and an inhibitor of matrix degradation, PAI-1, in the renal cortex, contributing to significant reversal of mesangial expansion in both models of DN. Pathway analyses demonstrated that diabetes-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and its downstream target CREB was also inhibited by the ASO. Our results strongly suggest that blocking CTGF using a chimeric ASO holds substantial promise for the treatment of DN."

PtdIns(3,5)P2 appears to be up-regulated by various stimuli, the most prominent of which is the hyperosmotic stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plant cells, or mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes (13Michell R.H.

Although the mechanism is still elusive, the action of the PtdIns(3,5)P2-synthesizing enzymes is apparently indispensable in multicellular organisms, as evidenced by the recent findings for embryonic lethality of the loss-of-function Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster mutants (15Nicot A-S.

The main difference among the species studied so far is related to the identity of the endosomal compartment where PtdIns(3,5)P2 function is required. Thus, whereas in lower organisms, i.e. S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, the loss of Fab1/PIKfyve function affects the later stages of the endocytic pathway, at the level of the lysosomes (15Nicot A-S.

Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). They are so called for their distinctive ultrastructure, characterized by numerous intraluminal membranes with a vesicular and/or lamellar appearance. MVE is therefore a generic term for any early, intermediate, or late endocytic compartment in the degradation pathway as proposed previously (23Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). It is now clear that intraluminal membrane invaginations in MVEs are mechanistically coupled to protein sorting into the degradation pathway. Components of the molecular machinery, first identified in yeast and found conserved in mammals, form three protein complexes, ESCRT I, II, and III, which act sequentially in cargo inclusion in the internal vesicles of MVEs (24Babst M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 25Hurley J.H. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 277-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 26Raiborg C.

In addition to protein sorting, MVEs possess the ability to emanate cargo-loaded endosome transport intermediates. According to the vesicle-transport model, endosome carrier vesicles (ECV) or multivesicular bodies (MVBs) arise by budding/detachment from early endosomes (23Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

An alternative model views early endosome maturation as a means of cargo transport (31Luzio J.P. Poupon V. Lindsay M.R. Mullock B.M. Piper P.C. Pryor P.R. Mol. Membr.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A recent study appears to reconcile both models by adapting elements of each one (34Rink K. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Cell. 2005; 122: 735-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Regardless of their mode of biogenesis, there is a consensus that endosome transport intermediates (for which we retain herein the acronym ECV/MVBs) are a subpopulation of endosome vesicles with characteristics distinct from both early and late endosomes (23Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Although the underlying molecular mechanism of ECV/MVB biogenesis is still elusive, it appears that, at least in mammalian cells, it is distinct from the inward invagination of the MVE limiting membrane. Specifically, membrane receptor sorting into the MVE pathway is affected by perturbations in membrane PtdIns(3)P or depletion of annexin1, whereas the ECV/MVB formation remains intact under these conditions (35Petiot A. Fauré J. Stenmark H. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36White I.J. Bailey L.M. Aghakhani M.R. Moss S.E. Futter C.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). By contrast, ECV/MVB formation/detachment, but not the inward invagination of the MVE limiting membrane, is reportedly dependent on annexin2 (37Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J.

It should be emphasized, however, that regulation of PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels could occur by both synthesis and turnover. Concordantly, a Sac domain-containing 5-phosphatase, Fig4, has been recently characterized in budding yeast and found to turn over PtdIns(3,5)P2 to PtdIns(3)P both in vitro and in vivo (11Rudge S.A.

It is unknown whether a similar coordination of PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis and turnover operates in mammalian cells and whether the uncharacterized mammalian Sac domain phosphatase, Sac3, or KIAA0274 (42Minagawa T. Ijuin T. Mochizuki Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22011-22015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), is the true Fig4 ortholog. In the present study we have characterized Sac3 as the mammalian counterpart of the yeast PtdIns(3,5)P2-specific phosphatase Fig4. Sac3 assembles with PIKfyve and ArPIKfyve in a stable ternary complex and controls PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels. We further demonstrate a key function for each of the three proteins in the biogenesis of ECV/MVB transport intermediates from early endosomes. These data indicate a tight control of mammalian PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels, which is coordinated through a physical association of a core protein machinery for PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis and turnover to regulate membrane exit from early endosomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHuman Sac3 and Other Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal Sac3 antibodies were directed against the C-terminal region of human Sac3 (amino acids 610–907).

Coverslips were mounted on slides using the Slow Fade antifade kit (Molecular Probes) and observed on a motorized inverted confocal microscope (model 1X81, Olympus, Melville, NY) by a ×60 UplanApo objective. GFP signals were captured by a standard green fluorescence filter. Images were captured by a cooled charge-coupled device 12-bit camera (Hamamatsu). In some experiments fluorescence microscopy in live COS cells was performed by Nikon Eclipse TE200 (Tokyo, Japan) using a ×40 objective. In this case, images were captured by a SPOT RT Slider charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments) and processed by SPOT 3.2 software.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm benzamidine) and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 2 mm NaVO3).

Excitotoxicity and stroke can induce neural progenitor (NP) proliferation and differentiation as an attempt of neuroregeneration after damage. Here we investigated the mechanism of hippocampal progenitor cell engagement upon excitotoxicity induced by kainic acid administration and the putative involvement of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in this process. Adult NPs express kainate receptors that mediate proliferation and neurosphere generation in vitro via CB1 cannabinoid receptors. Similarly, in vivo studies showed that excitotoxicity-induced hippocampal NPs proliferation and neurogenesis are abrogated in CB1-deficient mice and in wild-type mice administered with the selective CB1 antagonist rimonabant (N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazolecarboxamide; SR141716). Kainate stimulation increased basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) expression in cultured NPs in a CB1-dependent manner as this response was prevented by rimonabant and mimicked by endocannabinoids. Likewise, in vivo analyses showed that increased hippocampal expression of bFGF, as well as of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and epidermal growth factor, occurs upon excitotoxicity and that CB1 receptor ablation prevents this induction. Moreover, excitotoxicity increased the number of CB +1bFGF+ cells, and this up-regulation preceded NP proliferation. In summary, our results show the involvement of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in NP proliferation and neurogenesis induced by excitotoxic injury and support a role for bFGF signaling in this process.

However, the role of the eCB system in the response of NPs that ensues upon brain injury is as yet unknown. In the present study, we therefore investigated the possible involvement of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in NP proliferation in the context of the neuroregenerative response that follows excitotoxic brain injury. Materials—Rimonabant (N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazolecarboxamide; SR141716) was kindly provided by Sanofi-Aventis (Montpellier, France), and polyclonal anti-mouse CB1 receptor antibody was kindly provided by K. Mackie. Mouse monoclonal anti-nestin and anti-Sox2 antibodies as well as polyclonal anti-musashi-1 antibody were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). URB597 (cyclohexylcarbamic acid 3′-carbamoyl-biphenyl-3-yl ester), URB754 (6-methyl-2((4-methylphenyl)amino)-4H-3,1-benzoxaxin-4-one), and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG) were from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Accutase, anandamide (AEA), kainic acid (KA), and mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin III and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies were from Sigma. Neural Progenitor Cell Culture—Multipotent hippocampal adult NPs were obtained from 8-week-old mice after dissociation of the tissue located between 1.2 and 3.0 mm, relative to bregma, from which the midbrain was removed, and then the hippocampus, as a whole, was separated gently from the corpus callosum. The tissue was digested by papain and DNase I treatment and further cultured in chemically defined medium consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s and F12 media supplemented with N2 (Invitrogen), 0.6% glucose, non-essential amino acids, 50 mm Hepes, 2 μg/ml heparin, 20 ng/ml EGF, and 20 ng/ml bFGF. Primary neurospheres were cultured at clonal density (1,000 cells/ml) and employed for in vitro experiments. Neurosphere generation experiments (see Fig. 2A) were performed in 96-well dishes with 100 μl of medium, and the number of wells with neurospheres was quantified. Cell proliferation (see Fig. 2B) was determined by quantifying 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd)-positive cells. Neurospheres were dissociated by incubation with Accutase for 10 min and subsequent mild mechanical dissociation, treated for 16 h with 10 μg/ml BrdUrd and, after plating in polyornithine-coated wells, immunostained with rat monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody from AbCam (Cambridge, MA). NPs were characterized for neural markers (see Fig. 1) in proliferating conditions (as above), and after differentiation as ensued by growth factor deprivation of adherent NPs in chemically defined medium, supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and 20 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Analyses of multipotentiality (supplemental Table 1) were performed in 35 single cell-derived neurospheres after differentiation in growth factor-deprived chemically defined medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and the action of 500 nm KA or 20 ng/ml BDNF when compared with vehicle.FIGURE 1Characterization of adult neural progenitors and kainate receptor expression.

CB –/–1 mice (8 weeks old) and their respective wild-type littermates were treated with vehicle or KA (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), injected with 50 mg/kg of BrdUrd daily for 5 days, and perfused 1, 7, or 30 days later (n = 4, n = 4, n = 6 for each group, respectively). In other experiments, rimonabant (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or the corresponding vehicle (100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5 mg of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 4% dimethyl sulfoxide) was co-administered with BrdUrd to wild-type mice (n = 3 for each group). Animal procedures were performed according to the European Union guidelines (86/609/EU) for the use of laboratory animals. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Brains were perfused, and immunostaining was performed in 30-μm coronal free-floating sections (16Rueda D. Navarro B. Martiínez-Serrano A. Guzmán M.

Sections were incubated with rat monoclonal anti-BrdUrd, mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN (Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal anti-S100β (Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) antibodies followed by secondary staining for rat, mouse, and rabbit IgGs with highly cross-adsorbed Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa Fluor 488, and Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), respectively. A minimum of five coronal sections per animal was examined. A 1-in-6 series of hippocampal sections located between 1.3 and 2.1 mm posterior to bregma was analyzed using the TCS-SP2 Leica software (Wetzlar, Germany) and SP2 AOBS microscope with ×63 objective, two passes with a Kalman filter, and a 1,024 × 1,024 collection box. Positive cells were normalized to the dentate gyrus area determined with ×10 objective. The absolute number of positive cells was considering the total hippocampal volume as determined by the sum of the areas of the sampled sections multiplied by the distances between them. Additional immunofluorescence experiments were performed with rabbit monoclonal anti-Ki-67 (clone SP6) antibody (LabVision, Fremont, CA) and monoclonal anti-bFGF clone bFM2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology – Millipore, Dundee UK). Immunofluorescences were also performed with polyclonal EGF antibody (Upstate Biotechnology – Millipore) and rabbit antiserum against recombinant mouse BDNF. Sections were co-stained with DNA-intercalating agent TOTO-3 (Invitrogen). Growth factor immunoreactivity was determined with Metamorph-Offline software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). In vitro immunofluorescence was performed with antibodies against neural progenitor (nestin, Sox2, musashi-1), neuronal (β-tubulin III), and the corresponding secondary fluorescent antibodies (as above). In addition, Cy3-conjugated glial (GFAP) antibody was employed. Total cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33258. Confocal immunofluorescence and image analyses were performed with the support and assistance of the Microscopy Imaging Research Unit (Complutense University, Madrid, Spain) and the Confocal Microscopy Unit (Centro Biologiía Molecular Severo Ochoa, Universidad Autónoma, Madrid, Spain). mRNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription-PCR, and Quantification—mRNA was extracted with the RNeasy Protect kit (Qiagen) using the RNase-free DNase kit. cDNA was subsequently obtained using the SuperScript first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science, Welwyn Garden City, UK), and amplification of cDNA was performed with primers for mouse neural genes and KA receptor primers (supplemental Table 2). The following PCR conditions were used for most of the analyzed genes: 35 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 75 s at 72 °C). β-Tubulin III and S100β were performed with an extension temperature of 55 and 65 °C, respectively, whereas glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was determined with 20 cycles (as above). Finally, after a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min, PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with TaqMan probes for bFGF, EGF, and BDNF obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Amplifications were run in a 7700 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), and obtained values were adjusted using 18 S RNA levels as reference. Statistical Analysis—Results shown represent the means ± S.D. of the number of experiments indicated in every case. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance.

Hippocampal progenitors formed primary neurospheres and expressed a variety of progenitor markers including nestin, Sox2, and musashi-1 (Fig. 1, A and B). After differentiation in the presence of serum and BDNF, NPs gave rise to the different neural cell lineages and expressed neuronal (β-tubulin III and MAP2) and glial markers (GFAP, S100β, and myelin basic protein) (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas neurotrophin deprivation abolished their neuronal potential (supplemental Table 1). Next, we characterized the expression of KA receptors in NPs, which showed the presence of KA1R, KA2R, GluR6, and GluR7 but not GluR5 (Fig. 1C). Neurosphere generation assays were then performed in the presence of KA, and the role of the CB1 receptor was investigated. KA increased neurosphere generation in a dose-dependent manner, and blockade of CB1 receptors with the selective antagonist rimonabant prevented this action (Fig. 2A). NPs were subsequently incubated in the presence of the eCBs AEA and 2AG, as well as the selective inhibitors of their degradation URB597 and URB754, respectively (24Kathuria S. Gaetani S. Fegley D. Valiño F. Duranti A. Tontini A. Mor M. Tarzia G. La Rana G. Calignano A. Giustino A. Tattoli M. Palmery M. Cuomo V. Piomelli D. Nat.

Results derived from neurosphere generation assays were confirmed in cell proliferation experiments by the quantification of BrdUrd incorporation. Thus, both KA and AEA increased NP proliferation (Fig. 2B). The CB1 Cannabinoid Receptor Is Involved in Excitotoxicity-induced Neurogenesis—As the aforementioned data point to the involvement of CB1 receptor activation in KA-induced NP proliferation in vitro, we investigated the involvement of the eCB system in adult neurogenesis in an in vivo model of excitotoxic epileptiform seizures induced by KA injection. The response of hippocampal NPs was analyzed at different time points by quantifying the number of cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus expressing the endogenous proliferative marker Ki-67. Increased NP proliferation was observed in wild-type mice 24 h and 7 days after KA injection (Fig. 3, A and B), and this increase was, however, no longer detectable at day 30 after excitotoxicity (data not shown). The excitotoxicity-induced proliferative response was severely impaired in CB1-deficient mice (Fig. 3, A and B). This observation was corroborated by quantification of BrdUrd incorporation, which further supported that CB –/–1 mice have lost injury-induced hippocampal proliferation (Fig. 3C). Consistently, the induction of nestin, a characteristic neuroepithelial progenitor cell marker, was blunted in CB1-deficient mice after KA treatment (Fig. 3D). To determine whether CB1-dependent hippocampal proliferation results in effective neurogenesis, immunostaining for the presence of BrdUrd-labeled cells that co-express the phenotypic markers NeuN and S100β for mature neurons and astroglia, respectively, was performed one month after injury. Newly generated cells induced by excitotoxicity were detectable at this time point (Fig. 4A), and increased neurogenesis (NeuN-BrdUrd double-positive cells) was observed in KA-treated wild-type animals (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, this neurogenic response was mostly lost in CB1-deficient mice. Excitotoxicity also induced astrogliogenesis (S100β-BrdUrd double-positive cells), and CB1 deletion prevented this response (data not shown). Further support for the role of the CB1 receptor in KA-induced neurogenesis was obtained by pharmacological regulation with the administration of rimonabant to wild-type mice. In line with the data derived from genetically modified mice, KA-induced hippocampal NP proliferation (Fig. 5A) and neurogenesis (Fig. 5B) were strongly inhibited by CB1 pharmacological blockade. Overall, these findings support the existence of a CB1-mediated regulatory process that promotes neurogenesis after brain excitotoxicity.FIGURE 5CB1 antagonist rimonabant inhibits kainate-induced cell proliferation and neurogenesis.

Real-time PCR analyses showed that bFGF was produced at significant levels in adult NP clonal cultures, whereas BDNF and EGF were not present at detectable amounts (Fig. 6A). Likewise, KA and eCBs increased bFGF transcript levels in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner (Fig. 6B), whereas BDNF and EGF remained undetectable. The involvement of bFGF in the CB1-mediated response of NPs to excitotoxicity was analyzed in vehicle and KA-treated mice. Under basal conditions, bFGF expression was lower in CB –/–1 mice than in their wild-type littermates, and excitotoxicity increased bFGF expression in wild-type animals but not in CB1-deficient mice (Fig. 7A). EGF and BDNF expression in vivo was also up-regulated after excitotoxicity, but the reduction of their protein levels in CB1-deficient mice was minor when compared with bFGF repression (Fig. 7, B and C, and supplemental Fig. 1). These observations suggest that bFGF is involved in CB1-dependent cell proliferation upon excitotoxicity. We quantified CB1 expression after excitotoxicity and observed a significant up-regulation (Fig. 8A) that correlated with an increased number of double-labeled CB +1-bFGF+ hippocampal cells after KA administration (Fig. 8, B and C). The quantification of bFGF+-proliferating (Ki-67+) progenitor cells supported that bFGF expression precedes NP proliferation (Figs. 3A and 8D). In addition, the involvement of the CB1 receptor in bFGF induction in progenitor cells was revealed by the analysis of CB –/–1 mice in which KA-triggered increase of bFGF+-Ki-67+ cells was impaired (Fig. 8D).FIGURE 7Increased bFGF expression after excitotoxicity involves the CB1 cannabinoid receptor.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play important roles in this infiltration of leukocytes. The roles of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and heat shock proteins (HSPs) in the development of IBD are unclear. In this study, we examined the roles of HSF1 and HSPs in an animal model of IBD, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The colitis worsened or was ameliorated in HSF1-null mice or transgenic mice expressing HSP70 (or HSF1), respectively. Administration of DSS up-regulated the expression of HSP70 in colonic tissues in an HSF1-dependent manner. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CAMs and the level of cell death observed in colonic tissues were increased or decreased in DSS-treated HSF1-null mice or transgenic mice expressing HSP70, respectively, relative to control wild-type mice. Relative to macrophages from control wild-type mice, macrophages prepared from HSF1-null mice or transgenic mice expressing HSP70 displayed enhanced or reduced activity, respectively, for the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Suppression of HSF1 or HSP70 expression in vitro stimulated lipopolysaccharide-induced up-regulation of CAMs or ROS-induced cell death, respectively. This study provides the first genetic evidence that HSF1 and HSP70 play a role in protecting against DSS-induced colitis.

Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis have become substantial health problems with an actual prevalence of 200–500 cases/100,000 people in western countries, which almost double every 10 years (1Cuzzocrea S. Expert Opin. Emerg. Drugs. 2003; 8: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the etiology of IBD is not yet fully understood, recent studies suggest that IBD involves chronic inflammatory disorders in the intestine because of “a vicious cycle.” Infiltration into intestinal tissues causes intestinal mucosal damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are released from the activated leukocytes, and this intestinal mucosal damage further stimulates the infiltration of leukocytes (2Podolsky D.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of IBD and to develop new types of clinical drugs for IBD, identification of endogenous factors that positively or negatively affect the development of IBD is important. For this purpose, various experimental animal colitis models, in particular the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis models, have been used (3Jurjus A.R. Khoury N.N. Reimund J.M. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2004; 50: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the activation and infiltration of leukocytes that are associated with IBD. This conclusion is supported by a range of evidence. Increases in the levels of various pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6) in intestinal tissues has been reported in both IBD patients and animal models of IBD (4Reinecker H.C.

TNF-α-deficient mice or transgenic mice with enhanced production of TNF-α show a phenotype of resistance to trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis or the spontaneous development of an IBD-like disorder, respectively (6Kinoshita K.

Because TNF-α secondarily stimulates the production of many other pro-inflammatory cytokines (9Tomita N. Morishita R. Tomita S. Gibbons G.H. Zhang L. Horiuchi M. Kaneda Y. Higaki J. Ogihara T. Dzau V.J. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1326-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), TNF-α is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) also play an important role in the infiltration of leukocytes associated with IBD, as is suggested by the following evidence. CAMs expressed on vascular endothelial cells (such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)) bind to counterparts expressed on leukocytes, and this binding is an essential step in the recruitment of blood circulating leukocytes into inflamed tissues (10Danese S.

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are induced by various stressors (such as ROS) to provide cellular resistance to these stressors (14Mathew A. Morimoto R.I. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3602) Google Scholar). This up-regulation of HSP expression by stressors is achieved at the level of transcription through a consensus cis-element (heat shock element) and a transcription factor (heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)) that specifically binds to a heat shock element located upstream of the hsp genes (17Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). An essential role for HSF1 in the stressor-induced up-regulation of HSPs was demonstrated by the observation that disruption to the activity of HSF1 leads to the loss of stressor-induced HSP up-regulation (17Morimoto R.I.

HSPs and HSF1 also have attracted considerable attention as candidates for endogenous factors that affect the development of IBD because some HSPs, including HSP70, were reported to be overexpressed in the intestinal tissues of IBD patients and in an animal model of IBD (19Ludwig D.

The expression of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase-1, which is protective against IBD, is positively regulated by HSF1 (26Segui J. Gironella M. Sans M. Granell S. Gil F. Gimeno M. Coronel P.

All these previous results suggest that HSPs and HSF1 have negative roles in the development of IBD (i.e. protective roles against IBD); however, there is no direct evidence (such as genetic evidence) to support this idea. Furthermore, there are some data that suggest positive roles for HSPs and HSF1 in the development of IBD: HSF1 positively regulates expression of the IL-6 gene; extracellular HSPs elicit an inflammatory response; and autoantibodies and reactive T-cells against HSPs have been found in IBD patients (28Singh-Jasuja H.

Therefore, the effects of genetic alteration of HSPs and HSF1 on the development of colitis in animal models of IBD should be examined to understand the exact role (positive or negative) of HSPs and HSF1 in IBD. In this study, we used HSF1-null mice and transgenic mice expressing HSP70 or HSF1 to examine the role of HSF1 and HSPs in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis. The results clearly show that HSF1 and HSP70 contribute to the protection of colonic tissues against DSS-induced colitis. Furthermore, the results suggest that HSF1 and HSP70 achieve this protective role though various mechanisms, such as inhibition of intestinal mucosal cell death induced by ROS and suppression of DSS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, and CAMs in intestinal tissues.

Development of DSS-induced Colitis and Measurement of Colon Length and the Disease Activity Index (DAI)—Colitis was induced in mice by the addition of 3% (w/v) DSS (final concentration) to their drinking water. The animals were allowed free access to the DSS-containing water for 7 days. After 7 days, the animals were placed under deep ether anesthesia and killed; the colons were dissected and measured from the ileocecal junction to the anal verge. The DAI was determined macroscopically by an observer unaware of the treatment the mice had received according to previously reported criteria (34Rumi G. Tsubouchi R. Nishio H. Kato S. Mozsik G. Takeuchi K. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2004; 55: 823-836PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the DAI was calculated as the sum of the diarrheal stool score (0, normal stool; 1, mildly soft stool; 2, very soft stool; and 3, watery stool) and the bloody stool score (0, normal color stool; 1, brown color stool; 2, reddish color stool; and 3, bloody stool). Myeloperoxidase Activity—Myeloperoxidase activity in the colonic tissues was measured as described previously (35Rumi G. Tsubouchi R. Okayama M. Kato S. Mozsik G. Takeuchi K. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2004; 49: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 36Krawisz J.E. Sharon P. Stenson W.F. Gastroenterology. 1984; 87: 1344-1350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). After 7 days of DSS treatment, animals were placed under deep ether anesthesia and killed. Colons were dissected, rinsed with cold saline, and cut into small pieces. Samples were homogenized in 50 mm phosphate buffer, freeze-thawed, and centrifuged. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase activity was determined in 10 mm phosphate buffer with 0.5 mm o-dianisidine, 0.00005% (w/v) hydrogen peroxide, and 20 μgof protein. Myeloperoxidase activity was obtained from the slope of the reaction curve, and its specific activity was expressed as the number of hydrogen peroxide molecules converted per min/mg of protein. Lipid Peroxidation Measured by Thiobarbituric Acid-reactive Substances (TBARS)—The amounts of TBARS in the colonic tissues were measured as described previously (35Rumi G. Tsubouchi R. Okayama M. Kato S. Mozsik G. Takeuchi K. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2004; 49: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23305) Google Scholar). After 7 days of DSS treatment, animals were placed under deep ether anesthesia and killed. Colons were dissected, rinsed with cold saline, cut into small pieces, and weighed. Samples were homogenized in 1.15% KCl solution and centrifuged. Supernatants were mixed with 20 μl of 8.1% SDS solution, 150 μl of 20% acetic acid solution, and 5 μl of 0.8% butylated hydroxytoluene solution; shaken vigorously for 1 min; mixed with 150 μl of 0.8% thiobarbituric acid solution; shaken vigorously for 1 min; and finally boiled for 1 h. Samples were mixed with 500 μl of 1-butanol and pyridine (15:1), shaken vigorously for 1 min, and centrifuged. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm, and the amount of TBARS was expressed as the number of TBARS molecules/g of tissue. Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from colonic tissues using the RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples (2.5 μgof RNA) were reverse-transcribed using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Synthesized cDNA was used in real-time reverse transcription-PCR (Chromo 4 system, Bio-Rad) experiments using iQ SYBR Green Supermix and analyzed with Opticon Monitor software according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The real-time PCR cycle conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, followed by 90 °C for 10 min, and finally 45 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and at 63 °C for 60 s. Specificity was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of the reaction products and by inclusion of template- or reverse transcriptase-free controls. To normalize the amount of total RNA present in each reaction, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or actin cDNA was used as an internal standard. Primers were designed using the Primer3 website (frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi). The primers used for detection of mouse cDNA included the following: hsp25, 5′-cctcttccctatcccctgag-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttggctccagactgttcaga-3′ (reverse); hsp60, 5′-cgttgccaataacacaaacg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cttcaggggttgtcacaggt-3′ (reverse); hsp70, 5′-tggtgctgacgaagatgaag-3′ (forward) and 5′-aggtcgaagatgagcacgtt-3′ (reverse); TNF-α, 5′-cgtcagccgatttgctatct-3′ (forward) and 5′-cggactccgcaaagtctaag-3′ (reverse); IL-1β, 5′-gatcccaagcaatacccaaa-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggggaactctgcagactcaa-3′ (reverse); IL-6, 5′-ctggagtcacagaaggagtgg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggtttgccgagtagatctcaa-3′ (reverse); superoxide dismutase-1, 5′-ccagtgcaggacctcatttt-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttgtttctcatggaccacca-3′ (reverse); very late antigen-4 (vla-4), 5′-cagagccacacccaaaagtt-3′ (forward) and 5′-tgaaatgtcgtttgggtcttt-3′ (reverse); mac-1, 5′-tgtgagcagcactgagatcc-3′ (forward) and 5′-atggctccactttggtctct-3′ (reverse); L-selectin, 5′-attcctgtagccgtcatggt-3′ (forward) and 5′-catcctttcttgagatttcttgc-3′ (reverse); vcam-1, 5′-ctcctgcacttgtggaaatg-3′ (forward) and 5′-tgtacgagccatccacagac-3′ (reverse); icam-1, 5′-tcgtgatggcagcctcttat-3′ (forward) and 5′-gggcttgtcccttgagtttt-3′ (reverse); mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (madcam-1), 5′-gcaggctgggagctactct-3′ (forward) and 5′-tccctcttgtggtaggttgc-3′ (reverse); and hsf1, 5′-tgctggacattcaggagctt-3′ (forward) and 5′-tgtagtgcaccagctgcttt-3′ (reverse). The primers used for detection of human cDNA included the following: HSP70, 5′-aggccaacaagatcaccatc-3′ (forward) and 5′-tcgtcctccgctttgtactt-3′ (reverse); and HSF1, 5′-gaaaagtgcctcagcgtagc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctcagcatggtctgcaggt-3′ (reverse). Histological and Immunohistochemical Analyses—Colonic tissue samples were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound, and cryosectioned. For histological examination (hematoxylin and eosin staining), sections were stained first with Mayer’s hematoxylin and then with 1% eosin alcohol solution. Samples were mounted with malinol and inspected using an Olympus IX70 or BX51 microscope. For histological evaluation of the tissue damage (damage score) and areas of lesions (extent of lesion), sections were evaluated microscopically by an observer unaware of the treatment the animals had received and quantified as described (39Ohkawara T.

Investig. 1993; 69: 238-249PubMed Google Scholar). Colonic damage was categorized into 6 groups (0, normal mucosa; 1, infiltration of inflammatory cells; 2, shortening of the crypt by <50%; 3, shortening of the crypt by >50%; 4, crypt loss; and 5, destruction of epithelial cells (ulceration and erosion)). The extent of lesions in the total colon was categorized into six grades (0, 0%; 1, 1–20%; 2, 21–40%; 3, 41–60%; 4, 61–80%; and 5, 81–100%). For immunohistochemical analysis, sections were treated in a microwave oven with 0.01 m citric acid buffer for antigen activation and incubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for removal of endogenous peroxidase. Sections were blocked with 2.5% goat serum for 10 min, incubated for 12 h with antibody against HSP70 (1:200 dilution) in the presence of 2.5% bovine serum albumin, and then incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-labeled polymer conjugated to goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine was applied to the sections, which were then incubated with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Samples were mounted with malinol and inspected using an Olympus IX70 or BX51 fluorescence microscope. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Targeting of Genes—The HSF1- and HSP70-specific siRNAs were purchased from Qiagen Inc. HCT-15 and bEnd.3 cells were transfected with siRNA using HiPerFect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Non-silencing siRNA (5′-uucuccgaacgugucacgudTdT-3′ and 5′-acgugacacguucggagaadTdT-3′) was used as a negative control. Preparation of Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Mouse peritoneal macrophages were prepared as described previously (41Salimuddin Nagasaki A. Gotoh T. Isobe H. Mori M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277 (–E117): E110PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were given 2 ml of 10% proteose peptone by intraperitoneal injection, and peritoneal cells were harvested 3 days later. The cells were seeded in 35-mm culture dishes at 1 × 106 cells/dish in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. After incubation for 4 h, non-adherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were cultured for use in the experiments. Virtually all of the adherent cells were macrophages, as described previously (41Salimuddin Nagasaki A. Gotoh T. Isobe H. Mori M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277 (–E117): E110PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted into the medium were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated Biotinylated UTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—Colonic tissue samples were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound, and cryosectioned. Sections were incubated first with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, then with terminal nucleotidyltransferase and biotin-14-ATP for 1 h at 37 °C, and finally with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (5 μg/ml) for 2 h. Samples were mounted with VECTASHIELD and inspected using an Olympus IX70 or BX51 fluorescence microscope. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Two-way analysis of variance, followed by Scheffe’s multiple comparison test or Tukey’s test, was used to evaluate differences between groups. Student’s t test for unpaired results was used to evaluate differences between two groups. Differences were considered to be significant for p values <0.05. DSS-induced Colitis and Expression of HSPs in HSF1-null Mice—The severity of DSS-induced colitis can be monitored by various indexes, such as body weight, DAI, colon length, myeloperoxidase activity, TBARS amount, and histological indexes. We compared the time course of development of colitis induced by 3% DSS administration in HSF1-null mice and wild-type mice (ICR) by monitoring body weight and the DAI. Administration of 3% DSS caused a mild increase in the DAI, but did not affect the body weight of the wild-type mice. In contrast, administration of 3% DSS resulted in a higher DAI score and loss of body weight in HSF1-null mice (Fig. 1, A and B). DSS-induced colon shortening, used as a morphometric measure for the degree of inflammation, was more severe in HSF1-null mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 1C). Colonic myeloperoxidase activity, an indicator of leukocyte infiltration, was much higher in DSS-administered HSF1-null mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 1D). Colonic TBARS, an index of lipid peroxidation associated with inflammation, was also higher in DSS-administered HSF1-null mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 1E). Fig. 1F shows the results of histological analysis of colonic tissues prepared from DSS-administered and untreated HSF1-null and wild-type mice. More extensive crypt loss, epithelial destruction, and leukocyte infiltration were observed in sections from DSS-administered HSF1-null mice than in those from wild-type mice. Histological score analysis revealed that the histological differences were statistically significant (Fig. 1, G and H). The results in Fig. 1 show that HSF1-null mice are more sensitive to DSS-induced colitis than their wild-type counterparts. We monitored the expression of hsp mRNAs in the colonic tissues of DSS-administered and untreated HSF1-null and wild-type mice by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The expression of hsp70 (but not hsp25 or hsp60) mRNA was significantly lower in DSS-treated HSF1-null mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 2A). DSS administration clearly up-regulated the expression of hsp70 mRNA (Fig. 2A). On the basis of these results, we subsequently focused on HSP70. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that DSS administration increased the levels of HSP70 in colonic mucosa and around colonic vessels in wild-type mice, but not in HSF1-null mice (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2 (C and D) shows the protein level of HSP70 as assessed by the immunoblotting assay. The level of HSP70 was clearly lower in DSS-administered HSF1-null mice than in wild-type mice. The"
https://openalex.org/W2001555860,"The role of Dscam2 (an immunoglobin superfamily protein) in regulating formation of precise patterns of synaptic connections in the Drosophila visual system is described, and shows for the first time that Dscam2 limits connections through a tiling mechanism that involves homotypic repulsion. Sensory processing centres in both the vertebrate and the invertebrate brain are often organized into reiterated columns, thus facilitating an internal topographic representation of the external world. Cells within each column are arranged in a stereotyped fashion and form precise patterns of synaptic connections within discrete layers. These connections are largely confined to a single column, thereby preserving the spatial information from the periphery. Other neurons integrate this information by connecting to multiple columns. Restricting axons to columns is conceptually similar to tiling. Axons and dendrites of neighbouring neurons of the same class use tiling to form complete, yet non-overlapping, receptive fields1,2,3. It is thought that, at the molecular level, cell-surface proteins mediate tiling through contact-dependent repulsive interactions1,2,4,5, but proteins serving this function have not yet been identified. Here we show that the immunoglobulin superfamily member Dscam2 restricts the connections formed by L1 lamina neurons to columns in the Drosophila visual system. Our data support a model in which Dscam2 homophilic interactions mediate repulsion between neurites of L1 cells in neighbouring columns. We propose that Dscam2 is a tiling receptor for L1 neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2052223356,"Recent studies have determined that mTOR mediates the activation of the protein kinase Akt in several cell types, but little is known about the association between mTOR and Akt in vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, the functional significance of mTOR/Akt signaling has not been characterized in the endothelium. In these studies we treated endothelial cells with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, and we found that it decreases Akt phosphorylation and activity, as determined by phosphorylation of its substrate glycogen synthase kinase-3. This effect of rapamycin on Akt phosphorylation could not be demonstrated in endothelial cells transfected with a rapamycin-resistant mTOR construct. Also, in the presence of rapamycin, vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor, and insulin failed to phosphorylate Akt, further indicating that mTOR regulates Akt activation in endothelial cells. The activation of Akt is well established to mediate pro-survival signals. In part this is mediated via the phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic Akt substrates Foxo1 and Foxo3a. We find that rapamycin totally blocks vascular endothelial growth factor and Akt-inducible phosophorylation of these transcription factors in endothelial cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Akt activity by rapamycin increased the number of endothelial cells undergoing apoptosis after serum withdrawal as well as after stimulation by vascular endothelial growth factor or tumor necrosis factor. Taken together these observations demonstrate first, that mTOR regulates the phosphorylation and activation of Akt in endothelial cells and, second, that a major effect of mTOR inhibition in endothelial cells is to suppress Akt-inducible pro-survival signals.

Moreover, intracellular signals leading to Akt activation are conserved across species (6Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7391-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Woodgett J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The binding of cytokines and growth factors to vascular EC increases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, resulting in the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphates and the recruitment and activation of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 within the cell membrane. Akt is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) at a threonine residue (Thr-308) in the activation loop and by another putative PDK2 kinase at a serine residue (Ser-473) in the carboxyl-terminal domain. Although several candidates have been proposed to function as the putative phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 2 (PDK2) kinase, including PDK1, integrin-linked kinase 1, ataxia telangiectasia mutant, and DNA-dependent protein kinase, recent studies have demonstrated that the rapamycin-insensitive Sin-1·Rictor·mTOR complex functions as PDK2 (8Sarbassov D.D.

Upon activation Akt mediates pro-survival and anti-apoptosis in part via the phosphorylation and inhibition of the Bcl-2 homolog BAD, the phosphorylation and inactivation of the FoxO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors, and the transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (11Datta S.R.

Rapamycin is a well established immunosuppressive agent that has recently been found to possess anti-angiogenic activities (19Vignot S. Faivre S. Aguirre D. Raymond E. Ann. Oncol. 2005; 16: 525-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 20Sawyers C.L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 343-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Studies of its mechanism of action have shown that when bound to its intracellular receptor, the immunophilin FK506-binding protein-12, rapamycin interacts and inhibits the formation of a complex composed of mTOR, raptor, and mLST8 (called mTORC1) (21Chiu M.I. Katz H. Berlin V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12574-12578Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Inhibition of mTORC1 results in the hypophosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, which are involved in the control of the translation initiation, ribosome biogenesis, and other growth and proliferation events (22Burnett P.E.

Another mTOR complex consisting of mTOR, rictor, Sin1, and mLST8 (called mTORC2) has been found to regulate Akt activity and actin polymerization (8Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M.

Although mTORC2 is rapamycin-insensitive, in several studies it has been found that prolonged exposure to rapamycin may inhibit mTORC2 function by blocking the assembly of the newly synthesized complex within the cell (26Sarbassov dos D.

Thus, depletion of available intracellular mTOR by rapamycin may biologically result in an inhibition of mTORC2 and, thus, inhibition of phosphorylation and activation of Akt. In this study we have evaluated mTOR-Akt interactions and signaling pathways in EC using rapamycin to regulate mTOR activity. We find that a major biological effect of rapamycin is to inhibit Akt phosphorylation and Akt-induced anti-apoptotic signaling. Moreover, we find that the ability of rapamycin to inhibit the migration and proliferation of EC is independent of its effects on mTORC2 activity. Reagents and Plasmids—Rapamycin was gifted to the laboratory by Wyeth-Ayerst Research (Princeton, NJ). Antibodies used for Western blot were anti-phospho-Ser-473 Akt, anti-phospho-Thr-308 Akt, anti-phospho-Ser-256 Foxo1, anti-phospho-Ser-253 Foxo3a, anti-phospho 4E-BP1 (Ser-65), anti Foxo1, anti Foxo3a, anti-4E-BP1, and anti-mTOR all purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Anti-Rictor antibody was purchased from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX), and anti-Akt was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The rapamycin-resistant mTOR plasmid (RRmTOR) was kindly gifted to the laboratory by Robert Abraham (27Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), and the wild type myr-Akt plasmid (WT Akt) was obtained from D. Mukhopadhyay (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The dominant active mutant of Akt (S473D/T308D) (2DART) was obtained by directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with Akt as a backbone (William Sellers, Addgene, plasmid 9021, Cambridge, MA) (28Hsieh A.C.

Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated from umbilical cords as previously described (29Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1976; 3: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in M199 (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% EC growth factor, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine. EC were used for the experiments between passages 2 and 5. Transfection—EC were transfected with the WT Akt, a constitutively active form of the kinase, 2DAkt, and RRmTOR constructs using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described (30Flaxenburg J.A. Melter M. Lapchak P.H. Briscoe D.M. Pal S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7503-7509Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Transfected cells were rested for an additional 12 h before initiation of the experiment. In all assays we used an empty vector (pcDNA3) as a control for the Akt or mTOR constructs. Western Blot Analysis—EC were washed one time with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Boston Bioproducts, Worcester, MA) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm pyrophosphate. Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min, and samples containing 30-50 μg of proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gel with Tris-glycine-SDS running buffer (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 for 1 h and incubated overnight with the primary antibody. Membranes were washed and incubated with a secondary peroxidase-linked antibody, and the reactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—EC were grown in 10-cm cell culture plates, treated with rapamycin or vehicle for 12 h, rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (containing 0.3% CHAPS, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min, and supernatants were collected. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 500 μg of total protein incubated with 3 μg of anti-mTOR antibody for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were captured with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed four times in CHAPS-containing buffer, resuspended in protein loading buffer containing SDS (Boston Bioproducts), and boiled for 5 min. Finally, immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot. Apoptosis Assay—EC were serum-starved overnight by reducing the concentration of fetal bovine serum to 5%. Subsequently, the cells were treated with rapamycin, TNF or VEGF as indicated. After treatment, floating cells and attached EC were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline before incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and RNase A (100 μg/ml). Propidium iodide staining was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter using Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). In some experiments, EC were transfected with an empty vector (pcDNA3), WT Akt, or with 2DAkt as indicated. Akt Kinase Assay—Akt kinase activity was assessed using an in vitro Akt kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Briefly, EC were treated with rapamycin for the indicated time period, and cells were collected in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 200 μg of protein lysate was incubated overnight with the anti-Akt antibody provided in the kit. Captured Akt was incubated with 1 μg of recombinant glycogen synthase kinase-3β in the reaction buffer and run on a polyacrylamide gel, and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 was analyzed by Western blot. Migration Assay—Migration assays were performed as previously described (31Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lower surface of a Transwell filter (8-μm pores, Corning Costar, Nagog Park, MA) was coated with fibronectin (10 mg/ml) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. EC were used untransfected or transfected with an empty vector (pcDNA3) or the 2DAkt construct and were rested in cell culture medium for 12 h (as above). The cells were subsequently untreated or treated with rapamycin for an additional 24 h before the migration assay. 4 × 104 EC were added to the upper chamber of the Transwell, and after 3 h the filters were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and stained in 0.5% crystal violet. Migrated cells on the lower side of the filter were counted by light microscopy in three high-power fields (count/high-power field). Proliferation Assay—EC were transfected with an empty vector or 2DAkt as above. Subsequently, 5 × 103 cells were plated in 96-well cell culture plates in serum starvation medium (5% serum) for 36 h in the absence or presence of rapamycin. Proliferation of EC was assessed by [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) incorporation in the final 12 h of cell culture. Radioactivity (cpm) was measured using a Tomtec automated cell harvester (Hamden, CT). Statistics—Data were analyzed by Student’s t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Rapamycin Reduces Akt Phosphorylation and Activity in EC—Accumulating evidence suggests that rapamycin can decrease Akt activity by inhibiting mTORC2-mediated Akt phosphorylation of the Ser-473 site (9Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40406-40416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 26Sarbassov dos D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P. Bagley A.F.

Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the association between mTOR and Akt in vascular EC. Moreover, the functional significance of mTOR/Akt signaling has not been characterized in EC. To evaluate the function of this signaling pathway, we first treated serum-starved EC with rapamycin (0.1-10 ng/ml), and Akt phosphorylation was determined by Western blot. We observed that rapamycin significantly blocked Akt phosphorylation at both 1 and 10 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). This decrease in Akt (Ser-473) phosphorylation started at 4 h and was maximal 12 h after exposure of EC to rapamycin (Fig. 1B), suggesting that rapamycin targets mTORC2 in EC. Furthermore, these observations suggest that mTORC2 inhibition by rapamycin requires prolonged exposure to the drug, as described in other cell types (26Sarbassov dos D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P. Bagley A.F. Markhard A.L. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). We also found that treatment of EC with rapamycin for shorter times (20, 40, and 60 min) resulted in an increase in Akt(Ser-473) phosphorylation, similar to that previously reported in non-EC (26Sarbassov dos D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P. Bagley A.F. Markhard A.L. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar, 33Tremblay F.

Sci. 2005; 30: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as expected, this brief exposure to rapamycin (20-60 min) inhibited mTORC1 and resulted in hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in EC (Fig. 1C). In these studies rapamycin also decreased Akt(Thr-308) phosphorylation (Fig. 1B), which we interpret to indicate that Ser-473 phosphorylation is required for Thr-308 phosphorylation and, thus, for full Akt kinase activity (as suggested by others (35Scheid M.P. Marignani P.A. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6247-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 36Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar)). Because the phosphorylation of both Akt(Ser-473) and Akt(Thr-308) is necessary for the activation of Akt-induced signaling (37Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar), we next wished to examine if prolonged exposure of EC to rapamycin would decrease Akt kinase activity. EC were treated with rapamycin (10 ng/ml) for 1-12 h, and Akt activity was examined using a commercial kinase activity assay. As illustrated in Fig. 1D, we found that brief exposure to rapamycin (1 h) slightly increased Akt activity, but longer treatment for greater than 4 h markedly inhibited Akt activity (p < 0.005). These findings are consistent with our observations by Western blot in Fig. 1, A and B. To further confirm that mTOR mediates Akt phosphorylation in EC, we transfected EC with a plasmid encoding a rapamycin-resistant form of mTOR (RRmTOR) (27Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), and we treated these transfected cells with rapamycin (as above). As illustrated in Fig. 1E, we found that overexpression of RRmTOR in EC prevented the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on the phosphorylation of Akt. Finally, to evaluate whether rapamycin targets mTORC2 in EC, by immunoprecipitation we assessed the co-expression and association between mTOR and rictor in untreated or rapamycin-treated EC (Fig. 1F). As illustrated, we found that mTOR formed a complex with rictor in untreated EC and that rapamycin inhibited co-precipitation of both proteins. Taken together these findings show that prolonged exposure of EC to rapamycin reduces Akt phosphorylation and its kinase activity and that this effect is mediated through the inhibition of mTORC2. Rapamycin Prevents VEGF-, TNF- and Insulin-mediated Akt Phosphorylation—Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and growth factors such as VEGF and insulin are well established to induce Akt activity and its associated downstream signaling (3Gerber H.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We next wished to examine if rapamycin could inhibit cytokine- and growth factor-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. Serum-starved EC were treated for 12 h with rapamycin before exposure to VEGF, TNF, or insulin, and Akt phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot. As expected, the phosphorylation of the Akt(Ser-473) and Akt-(Thr-308) was induced when EC were exposed to all three agonists (Fig. 2). However, we found that this effect was totally blocked by pretreatment of the cells with rapamycin. These findings are suggestive that rapamycin has significant effects to inhibit cytokine- and growth factor-mediated biological effects in EC. Rapamycin Inhibits Akt-mediated Prosurvival Signaling in EC—Next we analyzed whether mTOR-regulated activation of EC results in downstream effects on known Akt substrates such as those mediating its classical pro-survival function. VEGF is well established to protect EC from undergoing apoptosis, and this function is reported to be mediated by Akt (3Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). Downstream of Akt, the FoxO subfamily of transcription factors Foxo1 and Foxo3a are known to regulate apoptosis (12Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5412) Google Scholar). As expected, we found that VEGF induced the phosphorylation of Foxo1 and Foxo3a in EC; however, pretreatment of cells with rapamycin decreased base-line as well as inducible Foxo1 and Foxo3a phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). We interpret these findings to suggest that the ability of rapamycin to inhibit Akt phosphorylation in EC has biological effects to inhibit the pro-survival function of growth factors such as VEGF. To examine whether mTOR- and Akt-induced inhibition of the FoxO pro-apoptotic pathway is of physiological significance, we treated EC with rapamycin and assessed apoptosis using propidium iodide staining in the absence or presence of serum withdrawal. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, in untreated EC, serum withdrawal resulted in 21% of cells undergoing apoptosis after 24 h, 35% of cells undergoing apoptosis after 48 h, and 49% after 72 h. In contrast, in the presence of rapamycin, apoptosis of EC was augmented after 48 and 72 h (Fig. 4A, p < 0.001 in n = 3 experiments). Consistent with this finding, we also observed by Western blot that the inhibition of Akt, Foxo1, and Foxo3a phosphorylation persisted for 48 and 72 h after prolonged treatment with rapamycin (Fig. 4B). To further confirm an effect of Akt on cell survival, we transiently transfected EC with an expression vector in which the Ser-473 and Thr-308 sites of Akt are mutated to encode a constitutively active form of the kinase (called 2DAkt, Fig. 4C) (37Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). As controls, we also transfected EC with a wild type Akt construct or an empty vector. Transfection efficiency was determined by Western blot (Fig. 4D). After transfection, EC were serum-starved and treated with rapamycin, and after 48 h cell death was determined by propidium iodide staining (Fig. 4C). Consistent with its known pro-survival effects, we found that the transfection of EC with wild type Akt reduced apoptosis after serum starvation but that rapamycin markedly enhanced apoptosis in these Akt-transfected cells (Fig. 4C). However, overexpression of the 2DAkt mutant not only suppressed apoptosis induced by serum starvation but also prevented the pro-apoptotic function of rapamycin. Transfection of EC with the rapamycin-resistant mTOR plasmid (RRmTOR) also protected cells from the pro-apoptotic effects of rapamycin (Fig. 4C). We interpret these observations to indicate that the ability of rapamycin to inhibit the assembly of the mTORC2 complex and the subsequent inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and activity results in apoptosis of EC. To next determine whether VEGF- or TNF-mediated survival of EC involves mTOR-dependent regulation of pAkt, serum-starved EC were stimulated with VEGF or TNF alone in the absence or presence of rapamycin. Apoptosis of EC was determined by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (as above). As illustrated in Fig. 5A, we observed that both VEGF and TNF protected EC from undergoing apoptosis and that this effect was totally blocked by rapamycin. Finally, we transiently transfected EC with the constitutively active mutant of Akt (2DAkt). As illustrated in Fig. 5B, we observed that this mutant prevented rapamycin from inducing apoptosis in the presence of TNF. Collectively, these results demonstrate that mTOR-Akt-induced signals are critical for the survival of EC and for protection from apoptosis. Inhibition of EC Migration and Proliferation by Rapamycin—Our findings indicate that mTOR mediates upstream Akt-dependent activation responses in EC. Other signals resulting from mTOR-Raptor interactions (mTORC1) have been reported to be functional in EC proliferation and migration (14Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 15Fosbrink M. Niculescu F. Rus V. Shin M.L. Rus H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19009-19018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the effect of mTORC2 on this response is not known. We next performed proliferation and migration assays using EC transfected with the dominant active mutant of Akt (2DAkt). We found that overexpression of 2DAkt resulted in an increase in EC proliferation and that rapamycin significantly inhibited this proliferative response (Fig. 6A). Similarly, the augmented effects of 2DAkt on EC migration were inhibited by rapamycin (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these findings indicate that proliferative and migratory responses in EC are regulated by mTORC1 downstream of Akt. In this study we observed that mTOR regulates Akt activity in EC. We found that rapamycin potentiated serum withdrawal-mediated apoptosis and also attenuated the protective effects of cytokine and growth factor-inducible responses in EC. These effects were mediated via upstream inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, presumably by inhibition of mTORC2 complex formation. Rapamycin also inhibited the proliferation and migration of EC, which was a result of inhibition of mTORC1-mediated signaling. The interrelationship between Akt and mTOR involves positive and negative regulatory feedback loops (39Hay N. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 179-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). As discussed earlier, mTORC2 is composed of a protein complex among Rictor, Sin-1, and mTOR that regulates the phosphorylation of Akt via the Ser-473 residue in the carboxyl domain. Although mTORC2 is insensitive to rapamycin, our study is in agreement with others (26Sarbassov dos D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P. Bagley A.F. Markhard A.L. Sabatini D.M. Mol.

In contrast, mTORC1 mediates biological effects downstream of Akt but also facilitates a negative feedback loop to inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated Akt activation. Our data suggest that this negative feedback loop exists in EC in as much as we found that short exposure of EC to rapamycin inhibits mTORC1-mediated signals while increasing Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, long-term exposure of EC to rapamycin inhibits the association between mTOR and rictor and inhibits Akt phosphorylation (8Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5223) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanisms involved in this negative feedback loop have not been fully characterized (34Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Lamb R.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), but it is postulated that p70 S6 kinase can in part phosphorylate and inactivate downstream effectors of the pathway (40Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Gray A. Tolkacheva T. Wigfield S. Rebholz H. Barnett J. Leslie N.R. Cheng S. Shepherd P.R. Gout I. Downes C.P. Lamb R.F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Several reports have documented that the anti-angiogenic properties of rapamycin result from its effects to inhibit mTORC1-mediated EC proliferation. Moreover, rapamycin has been shown to inhibit VEGF expression and VEGF-mediated EC proliferation (41Guba M. von Breitenbuch P. Steinbauer M. Koehl G. Flegel S. Hornung M. Bruns C.J. Zuelke C.

Steinbauer M. Koehl G. Flegel S. Hornung M. Bruns C.J. Zuelke C. Farkas S. Anthuber M. Jauch K.W. Geissler E.K. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar, 43Hudson C.C.

EXS (Basel). 1997; 79: 233-269PubMed Google Scholar). We find that rapamycin also inhibits upstream Akt-induced signaling in EC, suggesting that its effect as an anti-angiogenic agent may relate to its ability to inhibit both upstream and downstream Akt-induced responses. Furthermore, we find that rapamycin inhibits the prosurvival functions of Akt and sensitizes EC to serum withdrawal-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, the effects of rapamycin on EC are most likely related to its ability to inhibit several Akt-inducible responses. Akt is typically recognized as a major pro-survival signal, and its ability to protect cells from undergoing apoptosis is well established (3Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M.

Biol. 2004; 15: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The FoxO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors as well as BAD are known substrates of Akt that in part facilitate its anti-apoptotic effects. Foxo1 and Foxo3a are known to be expressed by mature EC (47Potente M. Urbich C. Sasaki K. Hofmann W.K. Heeschen C. Aicher A. Kollipara R. DePinho R.A. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2382-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The stimulation of EC with VEGF results in the phosphorylation and inactivation of Foxo factors in EC, indicating a potential major role for these anti-apoptotic genes in VEGF-inducible EC survival. To this end, the overexpression of an active mutant of Foxo3a has been found to inhibit VEGF-inducible EC survival (48Abid M.R. Guo S. Minami T. Spokes K.C. Ueki K. Skurk C. Walsh K. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We observed that treatment of EC with rapamycin induced hypophosphorylation of base line as well as VEGF-inducible phosphorylation of Foxo1 and Foxo3. Although we could not detect BAD in EC by Western blot (data not shown), we also found that rapamycin inhibited the phosphorylation and inactivation of another apoptotic gene, the YES-associated protein (YAP protein, data not shown). Together, these data are suggestive that mTOR may regulate EC survival via Akt-inducible inactivation of the FoxO transcription factors. Indeed, consistent with this interpretation, Foxo1-deficient mice are embryonic lethals and show impaired vascular development (47Potente M. Urbich C. Sasaki K. Hofmann W.K. Heeschen C. Aicher A.

Finally, although Akt plays an important role in VEGF-mediated EC migration (14Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), we observed that the inhibition of EC migration by rapamycin may be independent of its effect on mTORC2. We found that overexpression of a dominant active mutant of Akt resulted in EC proliferation and migration, which was inhibitable by rapamycin. Therefore, the effect of rapamycin on cell motility likely involves inhibition of downstream p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 (50Liu L. Li F. Cardelli J.A. Martin K.A. Blenis J. Huang S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7029-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similarly, the inhibition of EC proliferation by rapamycin was independent of its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt and is likely associated with the ability of mTOR to control cell cycle progression through p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 (51Fingar D.C. Richardson C.J. Tee A.R. Cheatham L. Tsou C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 200-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because rapamycin also inhibits upstream activation of Akt, we cannot rule out the possibility that it inhibits migration and proliferation via inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in vivo under physiological conditions. To this end it is noteworthy that it was recently found that high doses of rapamycin in vivo can inhibit the phosphorylation of pAkt (32Phung T.L. Ziv K. Dabydeen D. Eyiah-Mensah G. Riveros M. Perruzzi C. Sun J. Monahan-Earley R.A. Shiojima I. Nagy J.A. Lin M.I. Walsh K. Dvorak A.M. Briscoe D.M. Neeman M. Sessa W.C. Dvorak H.F. Benjamin L.E. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In summary, these studies define mTOR as a novel regulatory kinase in EC that is of critical importance in EC survival, migration, and cell proliferation. We show that rapamycin inhibits the upstream phosphorylation and activation of Akt in EC as well as downstream Akt-inducible responses. These data suggest that mTOR is a key kinase involved in Akt-inducible EC activation and survival responses. Our results are among the first to demonstrate that the inhibition of Akt-inducible signals in EC by rapamycin results in enhanced apoptosis. The ability of rapamycin to inhibit these signals identifies this agent as a potent drug to target EC in vivo.

These mutations lead to an increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio that correlates with the onset of disease. However, it remains unknown how these mutations affect γ-secretase, a protease that generates the termini of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Here we have determined the reaction mechanism of γ-secretase with wild type and three mutated APP substrates. Our findings indicate that despite the overall outcome of an increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, these mutations each display rather distinct reactivity to γ-secretase. Intriguingly, we found that the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 is variable with substrate concentration; increased substrate concentrations result in higher ratios of Aβ42/Aβ40. Moreover, we demonstrated that reduction of γ-secretase substrate concentration by BACE1 inhibition in cells decreased the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. This study indicates that biological factors affecting targets such as BACE1 and APP, which ultimately cause an increased concentration of γ-secretase substrate, can augment the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and may play a causative role in sporadic AD. Therefore, strategies lowering the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio through partial reduction of γ-secretase substrate production may introduce a practical therapeutic modality for treatment of AD.

Aβ peptides are believed to be a major causative factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) (1Hardy J. Allsop D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 383-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). Aβ42 is more prone to aggregation than Aβ40 (2Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 695: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and therefore biological or environmental factors that promote increased Aβ42 production accelerate the pathological cascade leading to AD. Expression of Aβ42, rather than Aβ40, in Drosophila and mice leads to the formation of Aβ plaques (3Iijima K. Liu H.P. Chiang A.S. Hearn S.A. Konsolaki M. Zhong Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, mouse model studies suggest that the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40, rather than total amount of Aβ, correlates with the load of characteristic AD plaques in the brain (5Deng Y. Tarassishin L.

Dickson D.W. Golde T. McGowan E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence suggests Aβ40 may play a beneficial role in that it antagonizes Aβ42 aggregation (5Deng Y. Tarassishin L. Kallhoff V. Peethumnongsin E. Wu L. Li Y.M. Zheng H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3845-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Kim J. Onstead L. Randle S. Price R. Smithson L. Zwizinski C. Dickson D.W. Golde T. McGowan E. J.

Therefore, inhibition of γ-secretase activity that specifically generates Aβ42 or reduction of the Ab42/Aβ40 ratio would be an appealing strategy for treatment of AD. However, despite intensive studies on γ-secretase, the mechanism of cleavage specificity for γ-secretase is still unknown. APP was the first gene found to be linked with inherited AD (7Goate A. Chartier-Harlin M.C. Mullan M. Brown J. Crawford F. Fidani L. Giuffra L. Haynes A. Irving N. James L. Mant R. Newton P. Rooke K. Roques P. Talbot C. Pericak-Vance M. Roses A. Williamson R. Rossor M. Owen M. Hardy J. Nature. 1991; 349: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (3811) Google Scholar). Each mutation surrounding the γ-secretase cleavage site appears to alter the production of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Suzuki et al. (8Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science (N.

An increased ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 was also observed with other mutations (9De Jonghe C. Esselens C. Kumar-Singh S. Craessaerts K. Serneels S. Checler F. Annaert W. Van Broeckhoven C. De Strooper B.

Therefore, secretion of Aβ from APP mutation-transfected cells is affected by a multitude of factors. How these mutations affect APP binding and reaction with γ-secretase remains unknown. In this study, we have developed a simplified system using small peptide substrates that allow for the mechanistic characterization of APP FAD mutations. Kinetic analyses (kcat/Km) suggest that all of these APP mutations enhance the preference of γ-secretase for the 42-site over the 40-site cleavage and these changes are generally caused by kcat, rather than Km. Importantly, we have revealed that the amount of γ-secretase substrate governs the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 in vitro and in cells. Increased substrate concentrations result in higher ratios of Aβ42/Aβ40. Peptide and Compound Synthesis—Wild type (WT) and mutant APP-TM peptides were synthesized and purified by Midwest Biotech (Fig. 1). Biotinylated standard peptides (P40 and P42) were synthesized in our laboratory using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase chemistry on a peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Inc.). Peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a semi-preparative C18 column. The identity of these peptides was confirmed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis (Agilent Technologies). Compound 3 was synthesized as described (13Stachel S.J. Coburn C.A.

Briefly, the wild type or mutant APP-TM peptides were incubated with HeLa cell membrane in the presence of CHAPSO (0.25%) in buffer A (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5mm CaCl2, 150 mm KCl) at 37 °C for 2.5 h. The reactions were stopped by adding radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Then the reaction mixtures were incubated with ruthenylated G2-10 or G2-11 antibody, which specifically recognizes products P40 and P42, respectively. The antibody reactions were detected by electrochemiluminescence (ECL). The G2-10 and G2-11 antibodies were ruthenylated with ruthenium (II) tris-bipyridine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Biovarice Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentrations of P40 and P42 were determined using synthetic peptide standards. The Km and Vmax were determined from the Michaelis-Menten equation Michaelis-Menten kinetics (ν = Vm [S]/(Km + [S]) where ν is initial rate, Vm is maximum velocity, Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant, and S is substrate). p values were calculated from Student’s t-test. Cell-based Assay for Aβ Production—N2A cells that stably express APP Swedish mutation were incubated with γ-secretase or BACE1 inhibitors. Twenty-four hours later, the conditioned medium was removed and assayed for Aβ production. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detected with biotinylated 6E10 paired with ruthenylated G2-10 or G2-11 antibodies, respectively. Aβx40 and Aβx42 were detected with biotinylated 4G8 paired with ruthenylated G2-10 or G2-11 antibodies, respectively (15Lai M.T. Chen E. Crouthamel M.C. DiMuzio-Mower J. Xu M. Huang Q. Price E.

Concentration of Aβ peptides is calculated from standard curves that are generated using synthetic Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides using the ECL assay. βCTF, a β-secretase-generated C-terminal fragment of APP, has been utilized as a substrate of γ-secretase to biochemically characterize this protease (14Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Prior studies suggest that this substrate binds to the active site and docking site of γ-secretase (17Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C.D. Zysk J. Liu X. Birr C. Sylvester M.A. Edwards P.D. Scott C.D. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31499-31505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To elucidate the reaction mechanism, we developed a sensitive in vitro assay in which the substrate solely interacts with the active site of γ-secretase. We chose a biotinylated peptide substrate that contains a transmembrane domain (APP-TM) plus three lysine residues of APP (Fig. 1A). Similar experimental conditions as used for the C100 FLAG assay were used in this APP-TM substrate assay (14Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Our peptide substrate was incubated with HeLa cell membrane in the presence of 0.25% CHAPSO, and the P40 and P42 products (reference to products resulting from the cleavage at the 40 and 42 sites) were detected with G2-10 and G2-11 antibodies, respectively. The γ-secretase activity against this substrate was characterized to determine optimal conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). In our assay both the substrate and products are biotinylated. To eliminate the possibility of signal saturation under high concentrations of substrate due to the lack of streptavidin magnetic beads, we assayed 5, 10, and 25 μl of total γ-secretase reaction mixture, each containing increasing amounts of biotinylated peptide. All three assay conditions resulted in the same substrate dependence (supplemental Fig. 1C), demonstrating that streptavidin beads are not limited under our assay conditions. Therefore, the γ-secretase cleavage reaction with APP-TM as a substrate displayed a steady state kinetic mechanism. P42 production was 11.5% of the total sum of P40 and P42. γ-Secretase activity for production of both P40 and P42 was inhibited by L-685,458, with an IC50 of 1.5 and 1.3 nm, respectively. The three products, P38, P40, and P42, were confirmed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis (supplemental Fig. 2). Under current assay conditions, our mass spectrometry analysis was not able to detect ξ- and ɛ-cleavages (18Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y. Cui M.Z. Kim S.H. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this study focuses on γ-cleavage sites (P40 and P42) that have been well characterized in association with AD. Hence, this novel assay using the APP-TM substrate recapitulates native characteristics and is a suitable assay to characterize γ-secretase activity for Aβ40 and Aβ42 production. We examined the inhibition patterns of L-685,458 and Compound E, which represent two classes of structurally distinct γ-secretase inhibitors, against this peptide substrate. Double reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burke) analyses (Fig. 1, B and C) showed that the plots of L-685,458 intersect on the 1/v axis, whereas the plots of Compound E interface on the left of the 1/[s], which are indicative of competitive and non-competitive inhibition, respectively. In other words, L-685,458, an expected transition state analog, is a competitive inhibitor against substrate APP-TM (Fig. 1B), whereas Compound E, which contains a benzodiazepine moiety, displays non-competitive behavior (Fig. 1C). These findings strongly suggest that this small peptide substrate (APP-TM) solely binds to the active site of γ-secretase. This differs from the C100 substrate (17Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C.D. Zysk J.

Furthermore, it suggests that l-685,458 and Compound E bind to different sites on γ-secretase, as previously reported (20Tian G. Ghanekar S.V. Aharony D. Shenvi A.B. Jacobs R.T. Liu X. Greenberg B.D.

This study provides experimental evidence that L-685,458 is a transition state inhibitor, further validating prior conclusions that the presenilins contain the active site of γ-secretase (22Li Y.M.

Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). We next evaluated the effect of APP mutations on P40 and P42 production. Three APP mutant substrates were selected (Fig. 1). Among them, two were FAD mutants that reside at positions 44 (V44M, named French mutation V715M) and 45 (I45V, named Florida mutation I716V) (Fig. 1A). The V45F mutation is a non-natural mutant discovered by phenylalanine mutagenesis of the transmembrane domain of APP (23Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H. Uljon S.N. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). At a concentration of 0.5 μm, each substrate was incubated with HeLa cell membrane and the initial rate of P40 and P42 production was determined (Table 1). Our findings indicate that two mutations (I45F and I45V) reduced P40 production and increased P42 production, whereas the V44M mutation augmented the production of both P40 and P42. Interestingly, the I45F mutation led to production of higher quantities of P42 than P40, which is in contrast to all other mutations. Nevertheless, the overall outcome of each of these mutations is an increased ratio of P42/P40.TABLE 1Effect of substrate mutation on γ-secretase rate for P40 and P42 productionSubstrateP40 rateaThe amounts of P40 and P42 were determined by the ECL assay using standard curves that were generated with synthetic P40 and P42 peptides.

Mean ± S.E.; n ≥ 3. Open table in a new tab To elucidate the mechanism of γ-secretase catalysis, the kinetic parameters of γ-secretase for these substrates were determined (Table 2). Surprisingly, there were different Km values for P40 and P42 production and all these substrates exhibited a higher apparent Km for P42 than that for P40. If these differences truly reflect the affinity between substrate and γ-secretase, we predict that the ratio of P42 to P40 will be altered as substrate concentration is varied. In other words, a substrate concentration that saturates for P40 production, but not for P42, will lead to a higher ratio of P42 to P40. Thus, we determined the ratio of P42 to P40 at different substrate concentrations of WT and I45F-mutated APP-TM. Ratios of P42 to total product for WT substrate were 13 and 22% at concentrations of 0.5 and 2 μm, respectively, and for the I45F substrate were 57 and 75%, respectively (Fig. 2A). This observation strongly suggests that γ-secretase has distinct affinities to the same substrate for P40 and P42 production. There was no significant difference between Km values of WT and the mutated substrates for P40 and P42 activities. These mutations significantly influence Vmax (maximum velocity) for both P40 and P42 production (Table 2). Vmax values for I45F, V44M, and I45V substrates for production of P40 are 0.25-, 1.15-, and 0.70-fold of WT, respectively. For P42, they are 1.96-, 4.56-, and 2.73-fold of WT, respectively. These point mutations conclusively affect catalysis, rather than affinity for substrate.TABLE 2Vmax and Km values of γ-secretase against various APP-TM substratesSubstratesVmaxKmkcat/Km (mutant) kcat/Km (WT)kcat/Km (P40)/kcat/Km (P42)P40P42P40P42P40P42pm, min−1μmWT27.64 ± 1.1615.85 ± 0.050.97 ± 0.065.16 ± 1.251.001.009.21I45F6.98 ± 0.37**31.09 ± 5.25*1.04 ± 0.154.69 ± 0.350.242.161.01V44M31.76 ± 3.1**72.23 ± 8.09**0.53 ± 0.226.53 ± 0.542.123.605.42I45V19.48 ± 0.87**43.22 ± 1.31**0.89 ± 0.205.00 ± 1.510.782.822.53 Open table in a new tab Importantly, we next examined the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km or Vmax/Km) of γ-secretase against each substrate. kcat/Km is a second-order rate constant that informs how the enzyme performs when the substrate concentration is low and indicates an enzyme’s preference for different substrates (also called specificity constant). Considering that Vmax = kcat * E]total (total concentration of γ-secretase) and the same concentrations of γ-secretase were used for each substrate, the ratio of Vmax/Km (mutation) to Vmax/Km (WT) are equal to the ratio of their kcat/Km. We analyzed the Vmax/Km of these substrates from two perspectives. First, we compared mutated substrate versus WT. For P40 production V44M was a better substrate (2.12-fold) than WT, while both I45F (0.24-fold) and I45V (0.78-fold) were poorer substrates. For P42, all three mutations were better substrates, ranging from 2.12- to 3.60-fold compared with WT. Although each mutation displays a unique effect on P40 and P42 production, the overall tendency for all three mutations was to increase the relative specificity for P42 production. Secondly, we determined the relative kcat/Km for each substrate for P40 and P42 production. The relative specificity for P40 over P42 is 9.21, 1.01, 5.42, and 2.53 for WT, I45F, V44M, and I45V, respectively. These studies indicate that γ-secretase generally prefers the 40-site cleavage when the WT substrate concentration is low and suggest that γ-secretase is responsible for the 40-site processing under physiological conditions. Mutations alter the preference of γ-secretase for 40- versus 42-site cleavage, and these changes are generally attributable to kcat rather than Km. Moreover, we calculated the overall effect on the rate of γ-secretase for P40 and P42 production based on the Vmax and Km values of WT (Fig. 2B). This analysis revealed that an increase in substrate concentration not only results in generation of more total amount of Aβ but also leads to an increased ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40, which may be directly related to the pathogenesis of AD. The next critical question is whether substrate concentration correlates with the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 at the cellular level. BACE1 is responsible for generation of βCTF, a γ-secretase substrate; therefore, we chose to control the βCTF level through inhibition of BACE1 activity. N2A cells that stably express APP Swedish mutation were treated with a BACE1 inhibitor, Compound 3 (13Stachel S.J. Coburn C.A. Steele T.G. Jones K.G. Loutzenhiser E.F. Gregro A.R. Rajapakse H.A.

Chem. 2004; 47: 6447-6450Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A) at 1 and 3 μm. The amounts of secreted Aβ40, Aβx40 (that includes Aβ1-40 and Aβ17-40), Aβ42, and Aβx42 were estimated using an ECL assay with synthetic peptides as standards. Compound 3 at 1 and 3 μm inhibits 33 and 39% of Aβ40 and 47 and 55% of Aβ42, respectively (Fig. 3B). Similarly, this inhibitor at 1 and 3 μm suppresses 44 and 52% of Aβx40 and 61 and 72% of Aβx42, respectively. Treatment of APP Swedish mutation cells with BACE1 inhibitor at 1 and 3 μm reduced the relative ratio (compared with “no treatment” assigned a value of 1) of Aβ42/Aβ40 to 0.81 and 0.73 and Aβx42/Aβx40 to 0.70 and 0.58, respectively (Fig. 3C). Western analysis confirmed that this compound has no effect on the level of APP (supplemental Fig. S3). These cellular studies therefore reinforce our assertion that the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is dependent on the substrate concentration of γ-secretase. This finding corroborates other studies showing that up-regulation of BACE1 activity by Par4 elevates the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 (24Xie J. Guo Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13824-13832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our discovery illustrates that the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is variable with γ-secretase substrate concentration and provides critical insight into the pathogenesis of sporadic AD. Any biological or environmental factors that promote increased levels of γ-secretase substrate likely will result in an increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, which is similar to the effect of presenilin-1, presenilin-2, and APP mutations (25Selkoe D.J.

Recent studies have shown that BACE1 activity is increased in sporadic AD brains and is correlated with Aβ load (28Yang L.B. Lindholm K. Yan R. Citron M. Xia W. Yang X.L. Beach T. Sue L. Wong P. Price D. Li R. Shen Y. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 29Fukumoto H. Cheung B.S. Hyman B.T. Irizarry M.C. Arch. Neurol. 2002; 59: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that higher BACE1 activity in AD patients increases the production of βCTF and ultimately leads to a higher ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40, which is associated with the pathological state of the disease. A slight increase in βCTF production resulting from BACE1 cleavage leads to a mild elevation of the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (see Fig. 2B) and could chronically be detrimental to neuronal cells. Multiple factors have been found to regulate BACE1 expression and activity, such as Par4 (24Xie J. Guo Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13824-13832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and HIF-1α (30Zhang X. Zhou K. Wang R. Cui J. Lipton S.A. Liao F-F. Xu H. Zhang Y.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10873-10880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The role of these proteins in regulation of BACE activity in AD patients needs to be investigated. In summary, this study demonstrates that in addition to the clinical mutations of presenilin-1, presenilin-2, and APP, γ-secretase substrate concentration can increase the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40, which may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of sporadic AD (Fig. 4). Moreover, BACE inhibitors that reduce βCTF production are capable of lowering the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 in addition to reducing the total amount of Aβ. Partial inhibition of BACE1 activity could reduce the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and represent a practical strategy for AD therapies.

To examine the amyloidogenic potential of mouse Aβ, we studied several lines of transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type mouse amyloid precursor protein (moAPP) either alone or in conjunction with mutant PS1 (PS1dE9). Neither overexpression of moAPP alone nor co-expression with PS1dE9 caused mice to develop Alzheimer-type amyloid pathology by 24 months of age.

The triple transgenic animals (moAPP × APPswe/PS1dE9) produced 20% more Aβ but formed amyloid deposits no faster and to no greater extent than APPswe/PS1dE9 siblings. Instead, the additional mouse Aβ increased the detergent solubility of accumulated amyloid and exacerbated amyloid deposition in the vasculature.

The reason for rodents’ relative resistance to amyloid pathology remains unknown, although several hypotheses have been proposed, including the importance of amino acid sequence differences in the peptide (10Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 463-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the short lifespan of rodents relative to other animals (11Jankowsky J.L. Fadale D.J. Anderson J. Xu G.M.

Only 17 amino acid differences distinguish moAPP from its human homolog; however, three of these differences are located within the N-terminal domain of the Aβ peptide (Fig. 1; Arg-5 → Gly, Tyr-10 → Phe, and His-13 → Arg). This region is thought to be important for the specificity of interaction between Aβ peptides, whereas the hydrophobic C-terminal sequence governs the rate of Aβ aggregation (13Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 14Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Despite these three amino acid substitutions, in vitro studies using synthetic Aβ peptides revealed no difference in the ability of rodent and human peptides to form congophilic filaments in aqueous buffers (16Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Fung J. Frost D. Chakrabartty A. McLaurin J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Peptides from the two species can also co-aggregate in solution to form mixed Aβ fibers (17Fung J. Frost D. Chakrabartty A. McLaurin J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The sequence differences are not completely without consequence, however. The replacement of His-13 for Arg in rodent Aβ disrupts a metal coordination site, which renders the rodent peptide much less prone to zinc-induced aggregation in vitro (18Yang D.S. McLaurin J.

BACE1 is responsible for releasing the N terminus of Aβ from APP at either of two cleavage sites within the peptide sequence: +1 or +11. When murine BACE1 encounters human APP, the human protein is processed to generate Aβ starting predominantly at the +1 site. In contrast, murine BACE1 preferentially cleaves endogenous APP at the +11 site (12Cai H. Wang Y. McCarthy D. Wen H. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Wong P.C. Nat.

The effect of this truncation on the aggregation of Aβ is subject to debate: published reports describe both enhanced and reduced aggregation (oligomerization or sedimentation) in vitro of N-terminally truncated Aβ (26Pike C.J.

In addition, these mice harbor low levels of mouse Aβ beginning at both +1 and +11. Pype et al. (28Pype S. Moechars D. Dillen L. Mercken M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) show that the amount of mouse Aβ extracted from the brains of transgenic mice increased dramatically with the formation of human Aβ deposits, suggesting that the mouse peptide was co-depositing in the amyloid. However, mouse peptide comprised only about 5% of the total Aβ recovered from the oldest animals tested. Moreover, Calhoun et al. (29Calhoun M.E. Burgermeister P. Phinney A.L. Stalder M. Tolnay M.

To date, only one study has addressed the effects of elevating murine Aβ in vivo by overexpressing wild-type moAPP (30Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C. Yunis W. Xu S.

This study examined animals only 3.5-4 months of age and, therefore, did not test whether overexpression of moAPP would induce late onset amyloid formation. A complicating factor in this initial study was the FVB background strain used to generate the transgenic lines. Transgenic mice of this strain are prone to premature death when human APP is expressed via the hamster prion protein promoter (PrP) vector (30Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R.

We have subsequently moved one of these original moAPP transgenic lines out of the FVB background by crossing onto a hybrid C3H/HeJ × C57BL/6J strain for more than five generations.

We further demonstrate that mouse Aβ does not accelerate the deposition of human Aβ in transgenic mice overexpressing both peptides, but reveal that high levels of mouse peptide alter the solubility of the resulting Aβ aggregates and increase the prevalence of vascular deposits. We further find that Aβ11-40/42, predicted to be the predominant form of Aβ produced from mouse APP, does not appear to be a major co-depositing peptide. These findings provide insight into the potential role of specific Aβ sequences in modulating the solubility and distribution of amyloid deposits in rodent models. Generation of Transgenic Mice—All transgenic mice used in this study have been described and fully characterized in earlier publications. All transgenes were expressed under control of the mouse prion protein promoter (MoPrP.Xho), which drives high protein expression in neurons and astrocytes of the central nervous system (31Lesuisse C.

Line 85, co-expressing human PS1dE9 and mouse/human (mo/hu) chimeric APP695 (humanized Aβ domain) harboring the Swedish (K594M/N595L) mutation, is described in Jankowsky et al. (11Jankowsky J.L.

Genet. 2004; 13: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Unlike lines S-9 and 1874, line 85 was created by co-injecting two transgenes, each driven by their own prion promoter element. The two transgenes co-integrated and co-segregate as a single locus (34Jankowsky J.L. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Borchelt D.R. Biomol. Eng. 2001; 17: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Lines 85 and S-9 have been deposited with Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) for distribution (Stock numbers 004462 and 005866, respectively). After these experiments were completed, line 1874 was lost through accidental mistyping of breeding stock. Line 85 and line S-9 animals used in this study were maintained on a hybrid background by backcrossing to C3HeJ × C57BL/6J F1 animals obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Line 1874 was backcrossed to C57BL/6J for two generations after it was originally generated on the FVB background. After discovering premature lethality in the offspring, the line was crossed back to the hybrid C3HeJ × C57BL/6J F1 strain for two additional generations, which restored normal longevity to the line. Offspring from the second C3/B6 backcross were used as breeders to generate the cohorts described in this study. Offspring were genotyped for the presence of the transgene by PCR amplification of genomic DNA extracted from 1-cm tail clippings as described previously (34Jankowsky J.L. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Borchelt D.R. Biomol. Eng. 2001; 17: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Reactions contained three primers, one antisense primer matching sequence within the vector that is also present in mouse genomic PrP (5′: GTG GAT ACC CCC TCC CCC AGC CTA GAC C), one sense primer specific for the transgene cDNA (PS1: 5′: CAG GTG GTG GAG CAA GAT G, huAPP: 5′: CCG AGA TCT CTG AAG TGA AGA TGG ATG, moAPP: 5′: CCT TCA GGA TTT GAA GTC CGC), and a second sense primer specific for the genomic PrP coding region, which has been removed from the MoPrP vector (5′: CCT CTT TGT GAC TAT GTG GAC TGA TGT CGG). All reactions give a 750-bp product from the endogenous PrP gene as a control for DNA integrity and successful amplification; transgene-positive samples have an additional band at 400 bp (huAPP), 350 bp (moAPP) or 1.3 kb (PS1). Animals were housed in microisolator cages with free access to food and water. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Western Blotting—Mice of each genotype (NTg and 1874, n = 3-5; lines 85 and 1874 × 85, n = 10-15) were harvested at 8 months of age for assessment of amyloid pathology and APP/Aβ biochemistry. One-half of the brain was immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde and used for histology as described below. The remaining hemisphere was frozen on dry ice and prepared as a 20% homogenate that was used for Western blotting, filter trap assay, and ELISA. Frozen hemi-brain samples were sonicated in 5 volumes of 1× PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Mammalian cell mix, Sigma). Homogenates were further diluted 1:1 with additional PBS/EDTA/protease inhibitor and centrifuged at high speed for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for analysis. Approximately 50 μg of protein homogenate per sample (5 μg for 22C11) was loaded onto 4-12% BisTris Novex gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed at 175 V for 1.5-2 hin1× MES buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred for 1 h at 100 V to 0.45-μm Optitran nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) in 1× NuPAGE transfer buffer made with 10% methanol and 1% antioxidant solution (Invitrogen). Blots were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk powder for 30-60 min at room temperature. After blocking, blots were incubated with primary antibody for either 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: 6E10 mouse anti-human Aβ monoclonal (Signet Laboratories, Dedham, MA) 1:2000; rabbit anti-rodent APP purified polyclonal antibody (AB5571P, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) 1:2000; 22C11 mouse anti-APP N terminus monoclonal, kind gift of Drs. Konrad Beyreuther and Andreas Weidemann, 1:2000 (35Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar); m/hSOD1 rabbit anti-SOD1 polyclonal, 1:4000 (36Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.S. Wong P.C.

After incubation with primary antibody, the blots were washed several times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated with either goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:2500 to 1:5000 in blocking solution. After washing several times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences/GE Biosciences) and exposed to film. Intensity of immunostaining was quantified from digitally scanned films with ImageJ by first inverting to create a negative image and then measuring the integrated density of each band. Background values calculated from a blank portion of the gel were subtracted manually from each sample before assessing the average signal intensity for the genotype. Aβ Immunoprecipitation—50 μl of the 20% PBS homogenate described above was diluted 10-fold in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (0.2% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, in 1× PBS) and boiled for 10 min. After cooling, protease inhibitors were added, and the solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μl of purified 4G8 (Signet Laboratories). The antibody was recovered with protein A-agarose beads (1 h at 4 °C), and nonspecific binding was removed by several washes with additional radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer at 4 °C. The beads were heated to 95 °C for 5 min in 2× Tricine-SDS sample buffer, and the entire reaction was loaded onto 10-20% Tricine gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were pre-run for 10 min prior to loading, and then run in 15-min voltage steps of 25, 50, and 100, before running the gel to completion at 150 V. Protein was transferred to 0.45-μm Optitran nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) in 1× Tris-glycine/20% methanol/0.1% SDS, after which the blot was boiled 5 min in 1× PBS and blocked in 2% ECL Advance blocking reagent (Amersham Biosciences/GE Biosciences)/1× TBS/0.1% Tween-20. Blots were incubated overnight at room temperature with 4G8 diluted 1:10,000 in Advance block with 0.1% sodium azide. After washing several times in blocking reagent, blots were incubated for 2-3 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:20,000 in block. Blots were washed thoroughly with TBS/0.1% Tween-20, developed with ECL Advance (Amersham Biosciences/GE Biosciences), and exposed to film ∼1 h after developing with ECL. To demonstrate that 4G8 was capable of binding Aβ11-42, several reactions were run using 15 μl of 20% homogenate spiked with 10-50 ng of synthetic human Aβ11-42 (kindly provided by Dr. David Teplow, UCLA). Aβ ELISA: Steady-state Levels (7-24 Weeks of Age)—Brain tissue used for ELISA was harvested from female mice prior to the onset of amyloid pathology (lines 1874, 85, and 1874 × 85: 7-10 weeks of age; line 1874 × S-9: 9-24 weeks of age). Frozen mouse hemi-brains (n = 4-6 per genotype) were extracted by sonication in 0.2% diethylamine (DEA)/50 mm NaCl at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed and saved as the DEA extract. The pellet was then sonicated in 70% formic acid (FA) diluted in water, using a volume equal to the original volume of DEA. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, the supernatant was removed and saved as the FA extract. The DEA extracts were neutralized by adding a 1/10 volume of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The FA extracts were neutralized and prepared for ELISA by diluting 1:20 in 1 m Tris-phosphate buffer, pH 11. The samples were then assayed by sandwich ELISA as described below. Aβ ELISA: Amyloid Solubility (8 Months of Age)—An aliquot of PBS 20% homogenate generated for Western analysis described above was subjected to a three-step sequential extraction using PBS, 2% SDS, and 70% formic acid (NTg and line 1874, n = 4; lines 85 and 1874 × 85, n = 8). At each step, the sample was sonicated in appropriate buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed for analysis, and the pellet was sonicated in an equal volume of the next solution in sequence. The 2% SDS extracts were diluted at least 1:40 in EC buffer (0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.4% BlockAce (Dainippon Pharmaceuticals), 0.05% NaN3), prior to testing to bring the SDS concentration below 0.05%; the FA extracts were neutralized with 1 m Tris-phosphate buffer, pH 11, and then diluted with EC buffer prior to testing. Brain extracts were measured by sandwich ELISA as described previously (37Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

Human Aβ was measured in each fraction using BAN50 for capture (epitope Aβ1-16) and BA27 and BC05 for detection (Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively). Total Aβ (mouse plus human) was measured in each fraction using BNT77 for capture (epitope Aβ 11-28) and BA27 and BC05 for detection. Although BNT77 recognizes both mouse and human Aβ 1-x and 11-x, it does not bind α-secretase processed APP (40Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and measurements with BNT77 therefore do not include p3. All values were calculated as picomoles per g based on the initial weight of brain tissue. Filter Trap Assay—An aliquot of 20% PBS protein homogenate from each 8-month-old animal was partially solubilized by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 1%. Serial 1:1 dilutions were made with 1× PBS/1% SDS, and 90 μl of each dilution was then vacuum-filtered through a pre-wet 0.22-μm cellulose acetate membrane (OE66, Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH). Each well was washed several times with PBS, after which blots were blocked for an hour in 1× TBS plus 5% nonfat dry milk powder. Blots were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with polyclonal anti-Aβ peptide antibody (71-5800, Zymed Laboratories) diluted 1:600 in blocking solution. After washing the blots several times in 1× TBS/0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with an IRDye 800-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) diluted 1:5000 in blocking solution. The membranes were again washed three times with 1× TBS/0.1% Tween 20, given a final rinse in 1× TBS, and then imaged with an Odyssey fluorescence imager (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Staining intensity for each well was quantified using Odyssey analysis software, from which the linear range of the dilution series was determined and used for all genotype comparisons. Histology—Brains from lines 1874, 85, and 1874 × 85 were harvested for histological analysis at 4 months (n = 3-4 per genotype) and at 8 months (n = 5-14 per genotype) of age. Mice were euthanized by ether inhalation, and the brain was removed for analysis. One half was used for biochemical analysis described above; the remaining hemisphere was used for histology. After immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde/1× PBS for 48 h at 4 °C, the fixed hemi-brains were transferred to PBS, dehydrated in an alcohol series, treated with cedar wood oil and methylsalicylate, and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. Hirano Silver Stain—Silver impregnation histology was performed on 10-μm paraffin-embedded sections by Hirano’s modification of the Bielschowsky method (41Hirano A. Zimmermann H.M. Arch. Neurol. 1962; 6: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 42Yamamoto T. Hirano A. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1986; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were deparaffinized through xylene and alcohols into tap water before being placed into fresh 20% silver nitrate solution for 20 min. After washing thoroughly with distilled water, slides were immersed in 20% silver nitrate solution titrated with fresh ammonium hydroxide. After 20 min, slides were washed with ammonia water before being individually developed with 100 μl of developer (20 ml of 37% formaldehyde, 100 ml of distilled water, 50 μl of concentrated nitric acid, and 0.5 g of citric acid) added to 50 ml of titrated silver nitrate solution. Slides were then rinsed in tap water, fixed in 5% sodium thiosulfate, and dehydrated through alcohols and xylene. Campbell-Switzer Silver Stain—A detailed protocol for this stain was kindly provided by Dr. Bob Switzer of NeuroScience Associates. Thioflavine-S Staining—Following deparaffinization of sections through xylene and alcohols, amyloid impregnation with thioflavine-S was performed according to the Guntern modification of the standard protocol. Slides were washed twice in distilled water, then immersed for 5 min in a 0.25% potassium permanganate solution, followed by 5 min in a 1% potassium metabisulfate/1% oxalic acid solution. After this preparation, slides were placed into a filtered aqueous 0.02% thioflavine-S solution (Chroma-Gesellschaft, Schmid GmbH and Co., Kongen, Germany) for 8 min. Excess stain was removed by two brief rinses in 80% ethanol, then two in distilled water, after which slides were finished in aqueous mounting medi"
https://openalex.org/W2018468842,"Telaprevir (VX-950) is a highly selective, potent inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3·4A serine protease. It has demonstrated strong antiviral activity in patients chronically infected with genotype 1 HCV when dosed alone or in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a. Substitutions of Arg155 of the HCV NS3 protease domain have been previously detected in HCV isolates from some patients during telaprevir dosing. In this study, Arg155 was replaced with various residues in genotype 1a protease domain proteins and in genotype 1b HCV subgenomic replicons. Characterization of both the purified enzymes and reconstituted replicon cells demonstrated that substitutions of Arg155 with these residues conferred low level resistance to telaprevir (<25-fold). An x-ray structure of genotype 1a HCV protease domain with the R155K mutation, in a complex with an NS4A co-factor peptide, was determined at a resolution of 2.5Å. The crystal structure of the R155K protease is essentially identical to that of the wild-type apoenzyme (Protein Data Bank code 1A1R) except for the side chain of mutated residue 155. Telaprevir was docked into the x-ray structure of the R155K protease, and modeling analysis suggests that the P2 group of telaprevir loses several hydrophobic contacts with the Lys155 side chain. It was demonstrated that replicon cells containing substitutions at NS3 protease residue 155 remain fully sensitive to interferon α or ribavirin. Finally, these variant replicons were shown to have reduced replication capacity compared with the wild-type HCV replicon in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1991512077,"In this report, we explore the interaction of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) at regulatory sites within both the Cyp24a1 and the Trpv6 genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques in a mouse model in vivo. We show that exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 induces rapid VDR and RXR (retinoid X receptor) binding to the Cyp24a1 gene in both the kidney and the intestine and to the Trpv6 gene in the intestine. Separate studies of Trpv6 in vitro suggest that VDR binding occurs directly to VDR response elements located –2 and –4 kb upstream of the TSS. VDR binding is dose-dependent, demonstrating EC50 values that are comparable with those for the induction of both Cyp24a1 and Trpv6 mRNA. Importantly, interaction of the VDR with these targets results in rapid changes in histone 4 acetylation as well as the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. The presence of both VDR and RNA polymerase II at these sites declines between 3–6 h, whereas the changes observed in acetylation decrease more slowly. Finally, we show that whereas mediator protein 1 is recruited to the Cyp24a1 promoter in the intestine, this coactivator is apparently not required for Trpv6 activation. These studies provide the first evidence for 1,25(OH)2D3-induced VDR interaction at key target genes in vivo, revealing the consequences of that interaction on the Cyp24a1 and Trpv6 genes.

Like other hormones of this class, the biological effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 are achieved through the regulation of gene expression and mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a latent transcription factor that when activated by 1,25(OH)2D3 binds DNA, recruits coregulators, and modulates transcriptional output. Numerous VDR target genes have been identified and regulatory elements (VDREs) described (4Jiang H. Lin J. Su Z.Z. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Fisher P.B.

Cyp24a1, a gene in which the catabolic enzyme product controls intracellular levels of hormonal 1,25(OH)2D3, represents a particularly well characterized VDR target. It is induced in virtually all vitamin D3-sensitive tissues via two VDREs located immediately proximal to the transcriptional start site (TSS) (6Zierold C. Darwish H.M. DeLuca H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1675-1678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This information, coupled with additional studies on the dynamics of Cyp24a1 activation by 1,25(OH)2D3 at the molecular level, makes it a particularly attractive candidate for further molecular analysis in vivo (9Kim S. Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Experimentation over several decades has firmly established a role for the soluble calcium-binding proteins calbindins D9K and D28K, the basolateral calcium ATPase PMCA1b, and the sodium calcium exchanger NCX1 in vitamin D3-regulated calcium uptake across the intestinal and renal epithelia (10Bronner F.

Indeed, it is now widely believed that the regulatory activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 at these latter genes may be central to the ability of the hormone to orchestrate the multiple events associated with vertebrate calcium homeostasis. Trpv6 is the most striking calcium-regulating ion channel target of 1,25(OH)2D3 action, undergoing a substantial down-regulation in the intestine during the course of vitamin D depletion or in the absence of a functional VDR and a dramatic up-regulation in response to supplemental 1,25(OH)2D3 (14Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

Indeed, our most recent studies in vitro have shown that the human TRPV6 gene is induced in human colon cancer cell lines via at least five individual VDREs, each located within the first 6 kilobases of the TSS (23Meyer M.B. Watanuki M. Kim S. Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1447-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This interaction is accompanied by co-localization of retinoid X receptor (RXR), the recruitment of coregulators such as steroid receptor coregulator-1 (SRC-1), and the induction of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II). These studies provide unequivocal support for the idea that Trpv6 is a direct target of vitamin D action and is involved in mediating biological actions of 1,25(OH)2D3. In the present study, we explored the molecular events associated with the activation of renal Cyp24a1 and both intestinal Cyp24a1 and Trpv6 by 1,25(OH)2D3 in the mouse in vivo. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we show that 1,25(OH)2D3 rapidly induces localization of both VDR and RXR at these gene targets in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We also show that VDR localization at these sites leads to broad histone 4 (H4) acetylation and rapid recruitment of RNA pol II. Many of these early events associated with Cyp24a1 and Trpv6 up-regulation are similar. Surprisingly, unlike Cyp24a1, Trpv6 activation by 1,25(OH)2D3 does not require recruitment of MED1 (DRIP205). Reagents—1,25(OH)2D3 was obtained from Solvay (da Weesp, The Netherlands). Minimum Eagle’s medium was purchased from Cellgro (Herndon, VA). Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from IDT (Coralville, IA). Anti-VDR (C-20, sc-1008), RXR (DN-197, sc-774), and MED1 (DRIP205/TRAP220) (M-255, sc-8998) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-acetyl lysine H4 (tetra, 06-866) antibody was obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Anti-RNA pol II (8WG16) was obtained from Covance Research Products (Dover, PA). Lipofectamine Plus was obtained from Invitrogen. Plasmids—The pCH110-βgal β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was described previously (25Yamamoto H. Shevde N.K. Warrier A. Plum L.A. DeLuca H.F. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31756-31765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Construction of hTrpv6 (–7Kb/+160) was also documented earlier (23Meyer M.B. Watanuki M. Kim S. Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1447-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). All additional reporter plasmids were prepared by cloning Trpv6 DNA fragments obtained through amplification of mouse genomic or BAC clone DNA into the pGL3-basic vector as indicated. All reporter plasmid numbering begins with the most 5′ nucleotide found in the mRNA transcript (225 base pairs from the start site of translation based on the University of California at Santa Cruz mouse genome build (February 2006)). Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (San Diego, CA). All inserts were sequenced for verification. Recombineering—Methods have been described previously (26Liu P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Additional information regarding this methodology can be found online (recombineering.ncifcrf.gov). Briefly, primers were designed to amplify 300–500-bp fragments located 5′ and 3′ of the desired region of the mouse Trpv6 promoter. Amplified fragments were cloned into pGL3(basic) (Promega, Madison, WI) to create “retrieval vectors.” Bacterial Artificial Chromosome clone RP24-368G11 (CHORI) was authenticated via sequence and digestion analyses and then electroporated into EL350 Escherichia coli (26Liu P.

BAC-containing EL350 were grown overnight at 32 °C, induced at 42 °C for 15 min, and then electroporated with linearized retrieval vector. Retrieved plasmids were digested and sequenced for verification. Cell Culture—LS180 cells were cultured in minimum Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% non-heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin from Invitrogen. Transfection Analysis—LS180 cells were seeded into 24-well plates by dilution (single cell suspensions are difficult to obtain) and transfected using Lipofectamine Plus as described by the manufacturer. Individual wells received 300 ng of DNA comprising 250 ng of specific TRVP6 promoter reporter plasmid and 50 ng of pCH110-βgal. After transfection, the cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with or without 1,25(OH)2D3. Cells were harvested 24 h after stimulation and the lysates assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described (25Yamamoto H. Shevde N.K. Warrier A. Plum L.A. DeLuca H.F. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31756-31765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized in all cases using β-galactosidase activity. RNA Isolation and Analysis—C57BL6 wild-type female mice, 8–9 weeks of age, were fed diet TD.06198 for 7 days (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). This diet is vitamin D-deficient and contains 0.8% Sr2+, 0.42% Phosphorus, and 0.5% Ca2+. Its application leads to modest reductions in serum 1,25(OH)2D3 and serum Ca2+ levels (data not shown). Mice were treated by intraperitoneal injection with either ethanol or doses of an increasing concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 in propylene glycol (Gallipot, St. Paul, MN). Animals were anesthetized with ether, and 2 cm of the proximal duodenum and one kidney were isolated and snap-frozen in TRI reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH). Total RNA was isolated via the TRI reagent protocol, and 2 μg of the product was reverse-transcribed using a SuperScript III RNase H reverse transcriptase kit obtained from Invitrogen. The cDNA was subjected to amplification using standard methods (see also ChIP analysis). Primer sequences are available upon request. Animal experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Research Animals Resource Center (University of Wisconsin, Madison). In Vivo Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—ChIP was performed as described previously (9Kim S. Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. J. Bone Miner.

C57BL6 wild-type female mice, 8–9 weeks of age, were treated by intraperitoneal injection with either ethanol vehicle or the indicated concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3/g body weight (bw) as described above. 7 cm of proximal duodenum or the kidneys were isolated, rinsed with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to a cross-linking reaction for 10 min with 1.5% formaldehyde. After the fixative was neutralized for 5 min with glycine (0.125 m final concentration), the intestinal or kidney tissue was homogenized briefly in phosphate-buffered saline using a loose fitting Dounce pestle, and the cells were collected via 70-μm nylon cell strainers (BD Falcon). Cells were then subjected to ChIP analysis as described previously. DNA fragments were purified from chromatin using Qiagen QIA-quick spin kits (Valencia, CA), and the precipitated DNA was then evaluated either by traditional PCR or by a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) method using primers designed to amplify individual fragments of the target gene promoters of interest. For traditional PCR, analyses for each primer set were carried out in a predetermined linear range of DNA amplification, and the PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels. DNA acquired prior to precipitation was used as input. Densitometric quantitation was carried out using Kodak One-dimensional Image Analysis software (version 3.5). qPCR was accomplished using an Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real-time PCR instrument and Power SYBR Green Master Mix. Primer sequences are available upon request. All samples were quantitated using an external standard curve and corrected for input variations. In all cases, each point represents the average ± S.E. evaluated statistically using unpaired t test analysis (*, p < 0.05). 1,25(OH)2D3 Induces Cyp24a1 in the Kidney in a Time- and Dose-dependent Manner—1,25(OH)2D3 represents a primary inducer of Cyp24a1 in virtually all vitamin D target tissues in vivo (2Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). This inductive activity is mediated by the VDR and its partner RXR, which bind to a regulatory region as a heterodimer and direct a series of events that facilitate enhanced transcriptional output. To establish a kinetic basis for exploring this induction in vivo, we first examined the ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to induce Cyp24a1 in the kidney following a single injection of the hormone into mice. As seen in Fig. 1A, 1,25(OH)2D3 induced a striking up-regulation of Cyp24a1 transcripts at 6 h with an EC50 of ∼1 ng/g bw. Induction (at 10 ng/g bw) peaked at 6 h and descended thereafter (Fig. 1B). A complete return to base line, however, was not achieved at 24 h. These experiments established parameters of Cyp24a1 induction in the mouse kidney and provided the basis for all of our subsequent molecular studies of Cyp24a1 activation. 1,25(OH)2D3 Promotes VDR and RXR Localization to the Cyp24a1 Promoter in Kidney and Fosters Both RNA pol II Recruitment and H4 Acetylation—To explore the underlying mechanism whereby Cyp24a1 is induced in mice, we utilized an in vivo ChIP approach, focusing first on the kidney. Mice were treated with either vehicle or 1,25(OH)2D3 (10 ng/g bw) as indicated above; the kidneys were harvested after 1 h, and the samples were then subjected to ChIP analysis using antibodies to VDR, RXR, RNA pol II, and acetylated H4 as outlined in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitated fragments were evaluated for the enrichment of Cyp24a1 using both conventional PCR and qPCR techniques with primer sets located at the mouse Cyp24a1 locus (documented in Fig. 1C). Supplemental Fig. S1A illustrates the results of such an experiment utilizing direct PCR analysis wherein 1,25(OH)2D3 strongly induced accumulation of VDR at the Cyp24a1 promoter but not at a downstream coding region. VDR accumulation at the promoter was accompanied by an equivalent increase in RXR and by the recruitment of RNA pol II, which was also detected within the coding region. We also observed a significant increase in the level of H4 acetylation (data not shown). No enrichment of DNA fragments was observed when the immunoprecipitations were carried out using IgG. Fig. 1D depicts a qPCR analysis of these data using related sets of DNA primers. This quantitative assessment of levels of DNA enrichment suggests that 1,25(OH)2D3 induced a 6–8-fold increase in VDR and RXR at the Cyp24a1 promoter and a substantial increase in RNA pol II as well. A more modest 3-fold increase in H4 acetylation was observed. These findings indicate that Cyp24a1 induction is mediated by the VDR, in which binding to the Cyp24a1 promoter likely precedes changes in mRNA output. Early Events Associated with Activation of Cyp24a1 Are Dose- and Time-dependent and Differentially Sensitive to 1,25(OH)2D3—Having established an assay for the early events associated with Cyp24a1 gene activation in the kidney in vivo, we next explored the kinetics of these events and their sensitivity to 1,25(OH)2D3. Mice were treated with increasing concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 analogous to those used to induce Cyp24a1 mRNA, and the kidneys were harvested after 1 h and subjected to ChIP using antibodies to VDR, RNA pol II, and tetraacetylated H4. Fig. 2 documents the results, revealing that the EC50 for both VDR binding and RNA pol II recruitment at the Cyp24a1 promoter are similar to that observed for RNA induction. Although VDR does not appear within the coding region, RNA pol II is strongly evident, suggesting enhanced transcriptional activity consistent with mRNA production. H4 acetylation is broad and is detectable at both the Cyp24a1 promoter and within the coding region. Perhaps most interesting is the high level of sensitivity of acetylation to 1,25(OH)2D3. Indeed, maximal induction is achieved at the lowest dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 administered, suggesting that changes in chromatin structure initiated by this chemical change at the Cyp24a1 promoter may require a substantially reduced level of VDR occupancy. The results in Fig. 3 document the time-sensitive nature of these changes with respect to both VDR and RXR binding as well as H4 acetylation. As can be seen, localization of VDR and RXR occur in parallel, peaking at 3 h and remaining partially elevated 24 h later. H4 acetylation at the Cyp24a1 promoter occurs within 1 h, however, possibly because of the increase insensitivity of the response to VDR DNA occupancy. Interestingly, this modification appears to remain fully intact for almost 24 h. These results suggest that VDR and RXR binding initiates a rapid and highly sensitive change in gene structure following treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 in vivo that results in the recruitment of RNA pol II and the initiation of Cyp24a1 transcription.FIGURE 3VDR/RXR binding to the Cyp24a1 gene promoter in the kidney is rapid and accompanied by H4 acetylation. Mice were treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for the times indicated, and then the kidneys were harvested and subjected to ChIP analysis using antibodies to VDR (A), RXR (B), and acetylated H4 (C). Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed via PCR using the primers depicted in Fig. 1C. Each point represents 3 samples ± S.E. (n = 3) with an unpaired t test analysis compared with the 0 h time point (*, p < 0.05). These results are representative of at least three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 1,25(OH)2D3 Induces Cyp24a1 and Trpv6 Expression in the Intestine in a Time- and Dose-dependent Manner—Based upon these studies of Cyp24a1 induction in the kidney, we turned next to an investigation of the properties of Cyp24a1 activation by 1,25(OH)2D3 in the intestine. We also explored the activation of Trpv6 by 1,25(OH)2D3 as well, as this gene is believed to be central to the regulation of calcium homeostasis by 1,25(OH)2D3 (17Bianco S.D. Peng J.B. Takanaga H. Suzuki Y. Crescenzi A. Kos C.H. Zhuang L. Freeman M.R. Gouveia C.H. Wu J. Luo H. Mauro T. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; Google Scholar). Because the regulatory elements of this latter gene have not been precisely defined, we utilized both an in vivo ChIP scanning analysis and then an in vitro evaluation to identify the functional elements. We first established a kinetic basis for exploring Cyp24a1 and Trpv6 activation in the intestine by assessing induction profiles at the mRNA level in mice as described earlier for renal Cyp24a1. 1,25(OH)2D3 induces both Cyp24a1 and Trpv6 gene expression (Fig. 4, A and B) with EC50 values slightly lower than that seen for Cyp24a1 in the kidney, although these differences are not statistically significant given the level of variability. The time course for the induction of both genes is similar, however, with both peaking at 6 h (Fig. 4, C and D). Interestingly, although the basal activity of Cyp24a1 was measurable and the activation of the gene sustained at 24 h in the kidney, basal levels of Cyp24a1 expression in the intestine were undetectable in the absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 and returned rapidly to base-line levels 24 h after induction. Trpv6 was also strongly induced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Its activity, unlike that of Cyp24a1, remained substantially up-regulated at 24 h. 1,25(OH)2D3 Promotes VDR Localization to a Proximal Promoter Site at the Cyp24a1 Gene and to a Broad Region Upstream of the Trpv6 Gene Promoter—We next explored the localization of VDR at the Cyp24a1 and Trpv6 promoters following a single injection of 1,25(OH)2D3 into mice. The experimental protocol was similar to that described earlier. The locations of the primer sets used to identify DNA gene fragments are depicted schematically for Cyp24a1 and Trpv6 in Figs. 1C and 4E, respectively. Because the regulatory elements of the mouse Trpv6 gene remained unidentified, we employed a PCR scanning approach that enabled us to search for VDR binding activity up to 6 kilobases upstream of the Trpv6 TSS at a resolution of ∼1 kb. The direct PCR results, depicted in supplemental Fig. S1, B and C, reveal that 1,25(OH)2D3 induces VDR binding in the intestine to a single upstream region of the Cyp24a1 gene and to a broad stretch of DNA 2–4 kb upstream of the Trpv6 TSS. Neither gene demonstrated significant 1,25(OH)2D3-induced VDR binding within its coding region. Fig. 4, E and F, depicts qPCR quantitation of a similar experiment, demonstrating that 1,25(OH)2D3 induces an ∼4–5-fold increase in VDR at the Cyp24a1 promoter, and a 3–5-fold increase in VDR binding at potentially multiple sites upstream of the Trpv6 promoter. These observations suggest that early events associated with 1,25(OH)2D3 activity can be measured at target genes in the intestine and point to the location of possible VDR regulatory sites at the Trpv6 gene locus. Several Upstream Regions of the Human Trpv6 Gene Are Highly Conserved at the Mouse Trpv6 Locus—Previous studies have identified five regulatory regions containing seven VDREs that have the potential to mediate the actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the human Trpv6 gene (23Meyer M.B. Watanuki M. Kim S. Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1447-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Five of these VDREs have been shown to retain functional activity. Of these five regions in the human gene, two (regions 2 and 4) are particularly well conserved, as illustrated in supplemental Fig. S2, and three (regions 1, 3, and 5) are not. Indeed, the primary 1,25(OH)2D3-inducing activity in the human gene is located in these two conserved regions and mediated by two pairs of VDREs for which the sequences are shown in the figure. Interestingly, whereas regions 2 and 4 are highly conserved overall in both rat and mouse, only two of the four VDREs located therein retain significant sequence identity, as shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Accordingly, VDRE a in region 2 of the mouse gene appears to contain a single base pair deletion that reduces the interval between the two key half-sites to 2 rather than 3 base pairs, thus reducing the likelihood that this element might mediate 1,25(OH)2D3 action. VDRE b in region 4, on the other hand, contains several base pair changes relative to the human gene that also have the potential of altering functionality. These differences suggest that the regulation of the mouse Trpv6 gene by 1,25(OH)2D3 might be quite different from that of the human gene. Identification of the Vitamin D Regulatory Elements Located in the Mouse Trpv6 Gene—To confirm the functionality of potential regulatory components in the mouse Trpv6 gene, we cloned several large fragments (–4.1, –5.5, and –10 kb) into a luciferase expression vector using a recombineering approach and assessed the activity of these constructs in response to increasing concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 following transfection into a human colon cancer cell line, LS180. We also introduced the human version of the TRPV6 (i) promoter (hTRPV6 (–7 kb/+160)) for comparison. As seen in Fig. 5A, 1,25(OH)2D3 induced a dose-dependent up-regulation of activity in all of the TRPV6 (i) promoter constructs examined whereas the parent vector was inactive. Interestingly, although the comparable human TRPV6 construct was inducible by 12–14-fold, the mouse versions of the Trpv6 gene were less active, manifesting a 4-fold induction at best. These differences appear inherent to the constructs and may reflect differing regulatory activities"
https://openalex.org/W2076568661,"Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) is a tumor suppressor gene disorder characterized by skin hamartomas, cystic lung disease, and renal cell carcinoma. The fact that hamartomas, lung cysts, and renal cell carcinoma can also occur in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) suggests that the BHD and TSC proteins may function within a common pathway. To evaluate this hypothesis, we deleted the BHD homolog in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Expression profiling revealed that six permease and transporter genes, known to be down-regulated in Δtsc1 and Δtsc2, were up-regulated in Δbhd, and levels of specific intracellular amino acids known to be low in Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 were elevated in Δbhd. This “opposite” profile was unexpected, given the overlapping clinical phenotypes. The TSC1/2 proteins inhibit Rheb in mammals, and Tsc1/Tsc2 inhibit Rhb1 in S. pombe. Expression of a hypomorphic allele of rhb1+ dramatically increased permease expression levels in Δbhd but not in wild-type yeast. Loss of Bhd sensitized yeast to rapamycin-induced increases in permease expression levels, and rapamycin induced lethality in Δbhd yeast expressing the hypomorphic Rhb1 allele. In S. pombe, it is known that Rhb1 binds Tor2, and Tor2 inhibition leads to up-regulation of permeases including those that are regulated by Bhd. Our data, therefore, suggest that Bhd activates Tor2. If the mammalian BHD protein, folliculin, similarly activates mammalian target of rapamycin, it will be of great interest to determine how mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition in BHD patients and mammalian target of rapamycin activation in TSC patients lead to overlapping clinical phenotypes.

Inactivating mutations of the remaining allele have been identified in renal carcinomas from BHD patients, indicating that BHD is a tumor suppressor gene (8Vocke C.D. Yang Y. Pavlovich C.P.

Germline nonsense mutations in BHD can also cause isolated hereditary spontaneous pneumothorax with lung cysts (6Painter J.N. Tapanainen H. Somer M. Tukiainen P. Aittomaki K. Am. J. Hum.

Consistent with the role of BHD as a tumor suppressor gene, somatic BHD mutations have also been detected in endometrial carcinomas (9Fujii H. Jiang W. Matsumoto T. Miyai K. Sashara K. Ohtsuji N. Hino O. J. Pathol. 2006; 209: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Disease-causing BHD mutations have also been noted in animals. A 1-base pair insertion mutation in the BHD rat homolog resulting in premature truncation causes renal carcinoma in the Nihon rat (10Okimoto K. Sakurai J. Kobayashi T. Mitani H. Hirayama Y.

Birt-Hogg-Dube tuberous sclerosis complex mammalian target of rapamycin essential minimal medium reverse transcriptase human embryonic kidney Skin hamartomas, lung cysts, pneumothorax, and renal tumors, the clinical hallmarks of BHD, also occur in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins heterodimerize and inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) via the small GTPase Rheb, which is the target of the highly conserved GTPase activating domain of TSC2 (12Inoki K.

Similar to the mammalian pathway, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Tsc1/Tsc2 function as a complex to regulate Rhb1, the S. pombe Rheb homolog. S. pombe mutants in which Tsc1 or Tsc2 is deleted have a distinctive phenotype, with low levels of amino acid permease expression, low intracellular amino acid levels (particularly ornithine and citrulline), and resistance to canavanine, a toxic analog of arginine. Deletion of rhb1+ in S. pombe results in increased sensitivity to canavanine (19Yang W. Urano J. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and a mutagenesis screen for rescue of the amino acid uptake phenotype of yeast lacking Tsc1 or Tsc2 yielded a mutant allele of rhb1+ (Rhb1G63D/S165N) (20van Slegtenhorst M. Mustafa A. Henske E.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), consistent with a conserved relationship between Tsc1, Tsc2, and Rheb in S. pombe. Similar to mammalian cells Rhb1 is known to interact with Tor2, one of the two Tor proteins in yeast homologous to mTOR (21Uritani M. Hidaka H. Hotta Y. Ueno M. Ushimaru T. Toda T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Urano J. Sato T. Matsuo T. Otsubo Y. Yamamoto M. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetics. 2007; 175: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Tor2 is an essential gene. Down-regulation of Tor2 activity leads to up-regulation of nitrogen responsive genes including membrane transporters and amino acid permeases (24Matsuo T. Otsubo Y. Urano J. Tamanoi F. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3154-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of Tor1 protein leads to down-regulation of amino acid permeases (25Weisman R. Roitburg I. Nahari T. Kupiec M. Genetics. 2005; 169: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and the combination with Tsc1/Tsc2 deletion leads to even lower levels of permease expression (23Weisman R. Roitburg I. Schonbrun M. Harari R. Kupiec M. Genetics. 2007; 175: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) indicating that these proteins function in parallel pathways. Folliculin, the BHD protein, has no significant homology to any other human proteins, and very little is known about how BHD mutations lead to renal tumorigenesis or the lung disease. The clinical similarities between TSC and BHD patients led us to hypothesize that BHD and the TSC proteins function within a common cellular pathway. To address this, we identified the S. pombe BHD ortholog, SPBC24C6.08c+, here called bhd+, and used homologous recombination to generate a novel deletion strain, Δbhd. Unexpectedly, we found that multiple amino acid permeases and transporters that are down-regulated in Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 are up-regulated in Δbhd, and that Δbhd S. pombe have elevated intracellular levels of specific amino acids that are low in Δtsc1 and Δtsc2. Yeast lacking Bhd demonstrated hypersensitivity to rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR. These data strongly support an opposing role of Bhd to that of Tsc1/Tsc2 in regulating amino acid homeostasis in S. pombe. If this relationship is conserved in mammals, it will implicate a surprising mechanism in which both inappropriate mTOR inhibition in BHD and inappropriate mTOR activation in TSC lead to renal tumorigenesis and cystic lung disease. Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—CHP428 and CHP429 were constructed by Charlie Hoffman (Boston College, MA) and were a gift from Janet Leatherwood (Stony Brook University of New York, New York). Wild-type strain 972 (26Leupold U. Methods Cell Physiol. 1970; 4: 169-177Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and ura4-D18 (27Grimm C. Kohli J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 215: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were gifts from J. Bähler (Sanger Institute). The methionine auxotrophic strain 1945h+ was obtained from the National Collection of Yeast Cultures, UK. S. pombe cells were grown in essential minimal medium (EMM; Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) at 30 °C unless otherwise stated. Transformations were performed with Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II kit (Zymol Research, Orange, CA). Where indicated, cells were treated with rapamycin (100 ng/ml) for 3 h prior to harvest. Construction of bhd+, bhd+tor1+, and bhd+tsc1+-deficient Strains—The entire open reading frame of bhd+ was deleted from the genome of the haploid strain 972h, using double fusion PCR homologous recombination and replaced by the kanamycin cassette to create DK1. Correct integration was confirmed by PCR. Δbhd was crossed into the ura4-D18 strain to generate DK2 (ura4Δbhd) using random spore analysis on selective plates. Tsc1+-deficient strain MVS3 was used to generate Δtsc1Δbhd by isolating spores and using PCR to identify double mutants, which were verified by Northern blot. The Δtor1Δbhd-deficient strain was generated by crossing TA99 (gift from R. Weisman) and DK2 using random spore analysis on selective plates. During mating, Tor1 was being expressed in TA99 from a plasmid to compensate for sterility of this mutant strain. Construction of Plasmids—The bhd+ gene was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the pREP4X expression vector. After sequence verification, bhd+ was inserted in-frame into the hemagglutinin-tagged pSLF173/273/373 series with different nmt (no message in thiamine) promoter strength (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The BHD H352R mutation was introduced into the pSLF373 constructs using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate Bhd-H352 and was verified by sequencing. Human BHD was amplified from cDNA (the generous gift of Laura Schmidt) using BHD-specific oligos and inserted in-frame into the hemagglutinin-tagged yeast pSLF173. BHD Plasmid Construction and Transfection—Myc-BHD plasmid DNA was created by amplifying human cDNA (the generous gift of Laura Schmidt) using BHD-specific oligos. PCR product was ligated into myc-tagged pCMV-Tag3 vector (Stratagene). The Myc-BHD-H255R plasmid DNA was created using site-directed mutagenesis of the myc-BHD plasmid and was verified by sequencing. Two μg of myc-BHD or myc-BHD-H255R DNA was transfected into HEK 293 cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Sciences). After 48 h cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-folliculin or anti-actin antibodies. Expression Profiling—Yeast were grown overnight in EMM to early log phase (A595 = 0.2–0.3) and total RNA was isolated by phenol extraction and purified using RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA from two independent biological samples was pooled (10 μg of each sample), reverse transcribed into cDNA, and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridizations were carried out overnight at 42 °C. The slides were scanned with a GMS 428 Scanner (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and spot quantification was performed with the ImaGene software (BioDiscovery, Marina del Rey, CA). Each S. pombe gene was present in duplicate on each slide, and the experiments were repeated using opposite labels (dye-flip), resulting in a total of eight measurements for each gene per sample. Genes were considered expressed when all eight measurements exceeded a threshold of 3.5 times above the background. A linear regression normalization was applied to the data and fold changes were calculated. Genes were grouped and annotated on the basis of predicted function in the Sanger Institute S. pombe Gene Data base. Western and Northern Blot Analyses—For Western blots, 20 μg of each sample was run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose using standard methods. The immobilized proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For Northern blots, 10 μg of total RNA was run on a 1% formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon membrane overnight in 20× SSC. Probes for bhd+, c869.10+, isp4+, isp5+, and gpd3+ were PCR amplified from cDNA, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and hybridized using standard methods. Canavanine and dl-Ethionine Sensitivity—Cells were grown overnight to midlog phase (A595 = 0.4–0.6) and A595 was adjusted to 0.4 (10,000 cells/μl). 4 μl of 1, 10, and 100 times dilutions was spotted onto EMM as a growth control, or EMM containing canavanine (60 μg/ml) or dl-ethionine (30 μg/ml) (both from Sigma) and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)—Contaminating DNA from RNA preparations was removed using TURBO DNA-free™ (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA was quantified using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer in combination with a RNA 6000 Nano LabChip. RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Ambion) and a mixture of anchored oligo(dT) and random decamers. For each sample, 2 RT reactions were performed with inputs of 50 and 10 ng. A–RT control reaction with 50 ng of input was also performed for each sample. 5′-Nuclease assays using TaqMan chemistry were run on a 7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). TaqMan sets were designed using Primer Express™ version 2.0 software from Applied Biosystems. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the probes were labeled with the reporter dye 6-FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) (Glen Research, Sterling, VA) and the quencher dye BHQ1 (Black Hole Quencher) (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA), respectively. Cycling conditions were 95 °C, 15 min followed by 40 (two steps) cycles (95 °C, 15 s; 60 °C, 60 s). Ct (cycle threshold) values were converted to quantities (in arbitrary units) using a standard curve (5 points, 5-fold dilutions) established with a calibrator sample. For each sample, the 2 values of relative quantity (from 2 PCR) were averaged. Measurements of Intracellular Amino Acid Pools—100 μg of protein extract (1 μg/μl) was precipitated by treatment with 100 μl of 10% 5-sulfosalicylic acid at 4 °C for 1 h. The pH value of the supernatant was adjusted to 2.2 with 3 m LiOH. 100 μlof sample was injected into the Biochrom 30 amino acid analyzer (Biochrom, Cambridge, United Kingdom) including a standard amino acid mixture of 10 nm (Sigma). Deletion of the S. pombe Homolog of BHD—Comparison of the human BHD with the fission yeast genome identified a single homologous gene, SPBC24C6.08c+, referred to as bhd+. Bhd+ encodes a 367-amino acid protein with 21% identity and an additional 36% similarity to the human BHD gene. The entire open reading frame of bhd+ was deleted by homologous recombination and replaced with a kanamycin cassette, to generate a haploid bhd+ deletion strain, Δbhd (Table 1). The Δbhd strain had no evident defects in growth, proliferation, or mating.TABLE 1S. pombe strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSource972h-LeupoldDK1h-, bhd::kan+This studyMVS1h-, tsc1::kan+van SlegtenhorstK2h-, bhd::kan+, tsc1::kan+This studyDK3h+, bhd::kan+, ura4-D18This studyMVS9h-, Rhb1G63D,S165Nvan SlegtenhorstMVS10h+, bhd::kan+, Rhb1G63D,S165NThis study1945h+h+, met3-1NCYCDK4h+, bhd::kan+, met3-1This studyDK5h+, tsc1::kan+, met-1This studyTA99h-, tor1::ura+, ura4-D18, leu1-32, ade6-M216WeismanDK6h+, tor1::ura+, ura4-D18This studyDK7h-, tor1::ura+, bhd::kan+This study Open table in a new tab Δbhd Is Resistant to dl-Ethionine, but the Mechanism of Resistance Is Different Than in Δtsc1—We previously found that Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 have decreased uptake of arginine, and are therefore resistant to l-canavanine, a toxic analog of arginine (28van Slegtenhorst M. Carr E. Stoyanova R. Kruger W.D. Henske E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12706-12713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 are also resistant to the toxic methionine analog, dl-ethionine (20van Slegtenhorst M. Mustafa A. Henske E.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine whether Δbhd has a similar phenotype, the Δbhd strain was incubated with 60 mg/liter l-canavanine or 30 mg/liter dl-ethionine. Δbhd yeast were not resistant to l-canavanine (unlike Δtsc1), but they were resistant to dl-ethionine, similar to Δtsc1 (Fig. 1A). A Δtsc1Δbhd double mutant strain was resistant to canavanine and dl-ethionine. This partial phenotypic overlap between Δtsc1 and Δbhd suggested that the Tsc1, Tsc2, and Bhd proteins may function in a common pathway. Next, to determine whether the dl-ethionine resistance observed in Δbhd and Δtsc1 was due to decreased uptake of methionine, we crossed the Δtsc1 and Δbhd strains into a methionine auxotrophic strain, 1945h+, referred to as Δmet, which is unable to synthesize methionine and is therefore dependent on methionine uptake for growth, and tested growth on essential minimal medium plates with and without 50 mg/liter methionine. The Δtsc1/Δmet strain was unable to grow with this low level of supplemented methionine, consistent with a methionine uptake defect, but the Δbhd/Δmet grew similarly to wild-type (Fig. 1B). Therefore, despite the similar phenotype of resistance to the toxic analog of methionine, the mechanism of dl-ethionine resistance appeared to be different between Δtsc1 and Δbhd. Δtsc1 and Δbhd Have Opposite Expression Profiles for Transporters and Permeases—Because these results did not support a role of Bhd in the Tsc/Rhb pathway, as we had originally hypothesized, we next compared the transcriptional expression profile of 2 separate colonies of Δbhd with wild-type yeast, using a dye-flip design, for a total of four arrays. A linear regression normalization was applied to the data and fold changes were calculated (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using a threshold of 1.5-fold change, 10 genes were down-regulated and 30 genes were up-regulated in Δbhd in at least 2 of the 4 arrays (supplemental materials Tables S1 and S2). Remarkably, 10 of the up-regulated genes in Δbhd were previously found to be down-regulated in Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 (Table 2 and Fig. 2A). Of particular interest, SPAC869.10+ (which will be referred to as 869.10), SPAP7G5.06+ (referred to as 7G5.06), SPAC11D3.18c+, ptr2+, isp4+, and isp5+ are permeases or transporters that are down-regulated in Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 strains (28van Slegtenhorst M. Carr E. Stoyanova R. Kruger W.D. Henske E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12706-12713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Northern blotting confirmed the expression change for four of the genes (Fig. 2B). The ΔbhdΔtsc1 double mutant had intermediate mRNA expression levels for these permeases, comparable with wild type. These data suggested, unexpectedly, that Tsc1/Tsc2 and Bhd have opposing functions in S. pombe.TABLE 2Genes up-regulated in Δbhd and down-regulated in Δtsc1 + Δtsc2Gene namePredicted functionSPAC896.10c+Amino acid permeaseSPAP7G5.06+Amino acid permeaseisp5+Amino acid permeaseisp4+Oligopeptide transporterptr2+Oligopeptide transporterSPAC11D3.18c+Membrane transporterSPAC11D3.14+5-Oxoprolinase, proline metabolismSPAC1223.09+Urate oxidaseSPAC5H10.01+Mitochondrial precursorSPAC1039.10+Mitochondrial precursor Open table in a new tab The Permease Expression Defect in Δbhd Is Rescued by Wild Type bhd+—Three regions of homology to the human and Drosophila melanogaster BHD proteins are shown in Fig. 3A. The histidine residue that is mutant in the German shepherd hereditary renal cancer syndrome (H255R) is conserved in S. pombe and flies (Fig. 3A). To determine whether this mutant also disrupts the function of bhd+ in S. pombe, we generated the mutant, Bhd-H352R, in the hemagglutinin-tagged pSLF373-ura4+ expression vector. The Bhd and Bhd-H352R expression constructs were transformed into uraΔbhd and cells were plated on EMM plates without uracil. Relative expression of the permeases was studied by real time PCR. Wild-type Bhd expression decreased the expression of four permeases (Fig. 3B), confirming that the permease expression defect in the Δbhd yeast is Bhd dependent. The permease expression levels were not completely normalized, perhaps reflecting the level of expression of BHD, or indicating that the hemagglutinin tag partially interferes with the protein function. In contrast, the Bhd-H352R construct did not decrease permease expression. However, Western blot analysis showed that the dog mutant expressed at a lower level (Fig. 3C). The lack of correction by Bhd-H352R is of interest given the high degree of evolutionary conservation of this residue (Fig. 3A), but the lower expression level makes it impossible to distinguish an effect of this residue on the function versus the stability of the protein. To determine whether BHD H255R is also expressed at lower levels in mammalian cells we transfected HEK 293 cells with either wild-type BHD or BHD H255R. We found that BHD H255R was consistently expressed at a lower level than wild-type BHD (Fig. 3D). The Δbhd strain overexpressing Bhd-H352R did not show canavanine resistance (Fig. 3E), consistent with the fact that Δbhd is not resistant to canavanine. To determine whether introduction of human BHD could revert the permease expression levels in the Δbhd yeast strain we cloned the human BHD into yeast pSLF173 expression vector. Expression was confirmed by Western blot. Human BHD did not decrease permease expression levels, indicating that the human gene does not complement for the yeast gene (data not shown). Intracellular Concentrations of Specific Amino Acids Are Increased in Δbhd—Previously we found that S. pombe lacking tsc1+ or tsc2+ have low intracellular levels of specific amino acids (28van Slegtenhorst M. Carr E. Stoyanova R. Kruger W.D. Henske E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12706-12713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), particularly those in the arginine metabolic pathway (ornithine, citrulline, arginine, and glutamate). To further test the hypothesis that Tsc1-Tsc2 and Bhd have opposing functions, we measured the intracellular amino acid concentrations in Δbhd. Levels of specific amino acids were elevated in Δbhd, including glutamate, ornithine, and citrulline (Fig. 4), which are decreased in S. pombe lacking Tsc1 or Tsc2 (28van Slegtenhorst M. Carr E. Stoyanova R. Kruger W.D. Henske E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12706-12713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Notably, ornithine, which showed the highest fold increase in Δbhd, was previously shown to have the highest fold decrease in Δtsc1 and Δtsc2. Permease Expression in Bhd Mutants Is Increased by Expression of a Hypomorphic Rhb1 Allele and Rapamycin—To determine whether permease expression in Δbhd is regulated by Rhb1, we analyzed permease expression in Δbhd/Rhb1GS using real time RT-PCR. Levels of the permeases isp4+, isp5+, 7G5.06+, and 869.10+ were increased by 3–8-fold in the Δbhd strain compared with wild-type, with the greatest increase in isp5+ (Fig. 5A). The Rhb1GS strain had levels similar to wild-type for all 4 permeases. However, the Δbhd/Rhb1GS strain showed permease expression levels that were substantially higher than Δbhd, ranging from 10- to 51-fold (relative to wild-type), with the highest fold change for isp5+. These data suggest that loss of Bhd acts synergistically with decreased Rhb1 activity to regulate permease expression. Rapamycin is a highly specific inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 in mammalian cells. In S. pombe, the effects of rapamycin are not well understood, but it is believed to inhibit both Tor1- and Tor2-related functions and to inhibit the expression of isp5+, 7G5.06+, and 869.10+ permeases (25Weisman R. Roitburg I. Nahari T. Kupiec M. Genetics. 2005; 169: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Weisman R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the previously demonstrated rapamycin inhibition of permease expression is Bhd dependent, we treated wild-type and Δbhd S. pombe with the same dose of rapamycin used by Weisman et al. (100 ng/ml), and measured the expression of the four permeases (869.10+, 7G5.06+, isp4+, and isp5+) using real-time RT-PCR. In contrast to the work of Weisman et al. (25Weisman R. Roitburg I. Nahari T. Kupiec M. Genetics. 2005; 169: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we found that in wild-type cells, rapamycin increase"
https://openalex.org/W1988621327,"Inverse agonists of the constitutively active human estrogen-related receptorα (ERRα, NR3B1) are of potential interest for several disease indications (e.g. breast cancer, metabolic diseases, or osteoporosis). ERRα is constitutively active, because its ligand binding pocket (LBP) is practically filled with side chains (in particular with Phe328, which is replaced by Ala in ERRβ and ERRγ). We present here the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of ERRα (containing the mutation C325S) in complex with the inverse agonist cyclohexylmethyl-(1-p-tolyl-1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-amine (compound 1a), to a resolution of 2.3Å. The structure reveals the dramatic multiple conformational changes in the LBP, which create the necessary space for the ligand. As a consequence of the new side chain conformation of Phe328 (on helix H3), Phe510(H12) has to move away, and thus the activation helix H12 is displaced from its agonist position. This is a novel mechanism of H12 inactivation, different from ERRγ, estrogen receptor (ER) α, and ERβ. H12 binds (with a surprising binding mode) in the coactivator groove of its ligand binding domain, at a similar place as a coactivator peptide. This is in contrast to ERRγ but resembles the situation for ERα (raloxifene or 4-hydroxytamoxifen complexes). Our results explain the novel molecular mechanism of an inverse agonist for ERRα and provide the basis for rational drug design to obtain isotype-specific inverse agonists of this potential new drug target. Despite a practically filled LBP, the finding that a suitable ligand can induce an opening of the cavity also has broad implications for other orphan nuclear hormone receptors (e.g. the NGFI-B subfamily).

Despite a practically filled LBP, the finding that a suitable ligand can induce an opening of the cavity also has broad implications for other orphan nuclear hormone receptors (e.g. the NGFI-B subfamily). In mammals, the nuclear hormone receptor (NR) 2The abbreviations used are: NR, nuclear hormone receptor; ERR, estrogen-related receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; LBP, ligand binding pocket; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α; 4-OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; DES, diethylstilbestrol; LBD, ligand binding domain; SERM, selective ER modulator; ICI, ICI 164,384; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; FRET, fluorescence energy transfer; TR-FRET, time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer; TEMPO, tetramethylpyrrolidine N-oxide; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; DTT, dithiothreitol; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. superfamily consists of 48 transcription factors that control essential developmental and physiological pathways (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

Although the transcriptional activity of NRs is often regulated by specific ligands, several members of the superfamily have no known natural ligands and are therefore referred to as orphan NRs (2Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα; NR3B1) was the first orphan NR to be identified on the basis of its similarity with estrogen receptor α (ERα; NR3A1) (3Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). ERRα and its relatives ERRβ (NR3B2) and ERRγ (NR3B3) form a small family of orphan NRs that are evolutionarily related to the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. ERRs preferentially bind to DNA sites composed of a single half-site preceded by three nucleotides with the consensus sequence TNAAGGTCA, referred to as an ERR-response element. It has been shown that ERRα also efficiently binds to estrogen-response elements and that these receptors share common target genes (4Vanacker J.M. Pettersson K. Gustafsson J-A. Laudet V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4270-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This observation was further supported by studies demonstrating cross-talk between the ER and ERR pathways (reviewed in Ref. 5Giguere V. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 220-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Several studies have highlighted ERRα as a main player in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism (6Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J-A. Richard D. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 7Schreiber S.N. Emter R. Hock M.B. Knutti D. Cardenas J. Podvinec M. Oakeley E.J. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2004; 101: 6570-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), suggesting that ERRα could be used for therapeutic intervention in diabetes or metabolic diseases. In addition to this central role in metabolism, ERRα is also now accepted as an emerging target in cancer (9Ariazi E.A. Clark G.M. Mertz J.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6510-6518PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ariazi E.A. Jordan V.C. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Finally, few papers have suggested a role of ERRα in bone metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 11Bonnelye E. Aubin J.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 3115-31121Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The importance of ERRα as a drug target has been recently reviewed (12Stein R. Way J.M. McDonnell D.P. Zuercher W.J. Drugs of the Future. 2006; 31: 427-436Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), which further re-emphasizes the urge for new synthetic ligands in the ERR subfamily. Despite their overall sequence similarity with the ERs, ERRs seem to regulate transcription in the absence of known natural agonist ligands. The presence of a phenylalanine residue (Phe328 on helix H3) in the ligand binding pocket (LBP) has been found to be essential for the constitutive activity of ERRα, because its mutation to alanine abolishes constitutive activity (13Chen S. Zhou D. Yang C. Sherman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28465-28470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of apoERRα, in complex with a coactivator peptide containing the L3 site of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), had revealed that the LBP is practically filled with side chains (14Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A. Geiser M. Fournier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49330-49337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The unoccupied volume was found to be only ∼100 Å3. It was predicted that a ligand with an equivalent of more than ∼4–5 carbon atoms could only bind if Phe328 would drastically change its conformation. This would also require a displacement of Phe510 and thus of H12, making the ligand an inverse agonist. The term “inverse agonist” (instead of “antagonist”) is used because such a ligand would display an intrinsic activity, namely an inhibition of the constitutively active ERRα. In contrast a neutral antagonist does not have an intrinsic activity by itself, it just counteracts the binding of an agonist. Indeed, searches for ERRα ligands have so far mostly identified inverse agonists. Few synthetic ligands, classically linked to the ER pathway, have been shown to modulate ERRα activity, namely 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) (reviewed in Ref. 15Horard B. Vanacker J.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, a new synthetic ligand acting as an inverse agonist has been identified for ERRα. It was shown that it acts at submicromolar activities in a cell-based assay and that this compound inhibits ERRα induction of an ERRα target gene, monoamine oxidase B (16Willy P.J. Murray I.R. Qian J. Busch B.B. Stevens W.C. Martin R. Mohan R. Zhou S. Ordentlich P. Wei P. Sapp D.W. Horlick R.A. Heyman R.A. Schulman I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For ERRγ, the crystal structures for the complexes of its ligand binding domain (LBD) with the inverse agonists DES and 4-OHT (18Greschik H. Flaig R. Renaud J.P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33639-33646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a 4-OHT derivative (19Chao E.Y.H. Collins J.L. Gaillard S. Miller A.B. Wang L. Orband-Miller L.A.

The cavity volume of the LBP for unliganded ERRγ was reported as 220 Å3 (21Greschik H. Wurtz J.M. Sanglier S. Bourguet W. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), which is small but still considerably larger than the 100 Å3 described for apoERRα. This difference is mainly explained by the substitution of Phe328 (ERRα) with Ala350 (ERRγ). In all reported complexes of ERRγ with inverse agonists, the activation helix H12 was found to be completely dissociated from the LBD body (18Greschik H. Flaig R. Renaud J.P. Moras D. J. Biol.

The ERRγ structures are thus in contrast to selective ER modulator (SERM) complexes for ERα, where binding of raloxifene or 4-hydroxytamoxifen revealed H12 in the coactivator groove. In the latter ERα complexes, accompanying structural adaptations of the C-terminal end of H11 and of the H11/H12 loop (22Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstroöm O. Ohman L.

For ERβ LBD complexed with the full antagonist ICI 164,384 (ICI), H12 was not visible because of high mobility (24Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Walton J. Hubbard R.E. Thorsell A.G. Li Y.L.

For ERRα it was difficult to predict the exact details of how (and whether at all) a ligand (most likely acting as an inverse agonist) would bind in the LBP, because of the multiple conformational changes required to create the necessary space and interactions. Similarly, it was not clear what exact consequences ligand binding would have on H12, except that it would probably be displaced from the agonist position. Here we report the crystal structure of the human ERRα LBD in complex with the synthetic inverse agonist cyclohexylmethyl-(1-p-tolyl-1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-amine (Fig. 1C, compound 1a), at 2.3 Å resolution. Compound 1a is a derivative of compound 1b (Fig. 1C), which lacks the methyl group and originally was discovered by high throughput screening. We have introduced the mutation C325S in ERRα in order to reduce biochemical instability problems during purification and crystallization, associated with cysteine oxidation. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements have demonstrated that there are no significant differences in the thermodynamic binding parameters between wild type ERRα LBD and the C325S mutant for compound 1a (or 1b). Also binding studies by NMR spectroscopy of compound 1b to wild type ERRα in solution (with and without a spin label attached to Cys325) revealed no violations of the observed relaxation effects with the crystal structure of the compound 1a complex. Our results explain the novel molecular mechanism of an inverse agonist for ERRα and provide the basis for rational drug design to obtain selective inverse agonists of this potential new drug target. Protein Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The mutation C325S was introduced into the plasmid pXI392 (wild type ERRα LBD, amino acids 290–519, numbering according to Swiss-Prot P11474 (14Kallen J.

The correctness of the construction was verified by DNA sequence analysis, and the correct clone was called pXI392b. Generation of recombinant baculovirus by transfection with BacPAK8™, plaque cloning, and amplification was done as described (14Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V.

For production of ERRα(C325S) LBD-expressing cells, 1-liter shake flask cultures with Sf9 cells adapted to SF900 II (Invitrogen) at a density of 1.5 × 106 c/ml were infected with baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection = 1 and were cultured for 3 days at 28 °C and 90 rpm, as described previously (14Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A. Geiser M. Fournier B. J. Biol.

SDS-PAGE analysis (Coomassie staining and Western blotting with anti-penta-His antibody from Qiagen) revealed good and soluble expression of ERRα(C325S) LBD. The purification of the frozen Sf9 cell pellets was done by three-step chromatography as described previously (14Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A.

The purified ERRα LBD protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT was concentrated to 10.4 mg/ml prior to crystallization. The resulting protein was estimated to be >95% pure and homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The measured molecular mass of 27,025.3 Da of the protein corresponded to the acetylated des-Met form of the ERRα (290–519; C325S) LBD. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Compounds 1a and 1b were synthesized in-house. For cocrystallization, a 5:1 stoichiometric excess of compound 1a from a 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO was added to the protein solution. Crystals were obtained at 4 °C by the vapor diffusion method in 1-μl hanging drops containing equal volumes of protein (10.4 mg/ml ERRα(C325S) LBD, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and crystallization buffer (0.2 m MgCl2, 12% PEG400, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5). The initial crystallization hit was obtained with Crystal Screen I from Hampton Research. Crystals were directly mounted in cryoloops and flash-frozen in the nitrogen stream. Diffraction data at 100 K were collected at the Swiss Light Source (beamline X10SA), using a Marresearch CCD detector and an incident monochromatic x-ray beam with 0.8 Å wavelength. Raw diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL program suite version 1.96.1 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The estimated B-factor by Wilson plot analysis is 48.6 Å2. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with MOLREP (27Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

Bulk solvent correction, an initial anisotropic B-factor correction, and restrained isotropic atomic B-factor refinement were applied. The refinement target was the maximum likelihood target using amplitudes. No σ cut-off was applied on the structure factor amplitudes.

Open table in a new tab Isothermal Titration Calorimetry, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, and Fluorescence Energy Transfer Measurements—The ITC experiments were performed using a Microcal VP-ITC instrument (Microcal, Inc., Northampton, MA). The sample cell of the calorimeter was loaded with ERRα LBD (wild type and C325S mutant at 40 and 30 μm) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm TCEP. The syringe was loaded with compound 1b (400 μm) in the same buffer. All solutions were degassed for 10 min. Titrations were performed at 25 °C with injection volumes of 8 μl and a spacing of 240 s. The base line was set to zero assuming that the final injections of each titration represent only the heat of dilution. The data were fit using a one-site binding model available in the Origin ITC data analysis software (version 7.0). DSC analysis was performed on buffer solutions (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP) containing the ERRα LBD-compound 1a complex (1:10 molar ratio). The ERRα LBD concentration was 25 μm (both for wild type or the C325S mutant), and 300 μl of protein complex solution were injected. DSC scans were obtained using a MicroCal VP-capDSC system (MicroCal, LLC, Northampton, MA) at a scan rate of 200 °C/h. The fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) measurements were conducted as time-resolved measurements (TR-FRET) in a miniaturized 1536 well plate format. Typically, 100 nl of compound solution (2 mm in 90% Me2SO) were transferred to the assay plate. 3 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Pluronic F-127) containing LANCE EU-W1024-labeled anti-His6 antibody (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 1 nm final assay concentration) were added. 1 μl of His-ERRα LBD (50 nm final assay concentration) was added, and the plates were left for incubation at 20 °C for 30 min. As FRET acceptor, 1 μl of an N-terminally Cy5-labeled PGC-1α derived peptide (Cy5-RPCSELLKYLTT, 50 nm final assay concentration) was added. After 20 min of incubation the TR-FRET readout was performed on an Envision 2102 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an excitation at 350 nm, first emission (donor) at 615 nm, and second emission (acceptor) at 665 nm (30 flashes, 100-μs delay time). The readout was calculated according to X = donor/acceptor × 1000. Data were fitted with XLfit4 after plate normalization of the derived data. NMR Spectroscopy—Ligand binding studies were performed with wild type and spin-labeled ERRα LBD. The spin-labeled protein was obtained by addition of a maleimide-substituted tetramethyl pyrrolidine N-oxide (TEMPO) paramagnetic tag (Aldrich) that reacts selectively with the only cysteine residue present (Cys325). Selective reaction was completed within minutes at room temperature prior to the measurement. T1ρ relaxation and water-LOGSY experiments were performed at 600 MHz using a room temperature probe. The Overall Structure of the Complex between ERRα LBD and the Inverse Agonist Compound 1a Reveals H12 in a Position Similar to PGC-1α—We have solved the crystal structure of ERRα LBD (containing the mutation C325S) in complex with the inverse agonist cyclohexylmethyl-(1-p-tolyl-1H-indol-3-yl-methyl)-amine (compound 1a) (Fig. 1C), at 2.3 Å resolution (space group H3). Compound 1a is a derivative of compound 1b, which originally was discovered by high throughput screening. The asymmetric unit contains a homodimer of ERRα complexes, i.e. ligand binding did not interfere with dimer formation. The results of the crystallographic refinement are summarized in Table 1. In general the electron density for the ERRα LBD is well defined, except for the His tag, residues Pro309–His317 (H2/H3 loop), residues Arg462–Glu470 (H9/H10 loop), and the C-terminal residues Met518–Asp519 (all of which were not modeled). The protein part of the refined model consists of the PreScission™ site (LEVLFQGP) followed by amino acids Val290–Met308, Leu318–Gly461, and Arg471–Met517 of the ERRα LBD. The refined model also contains 236 water molecules and two compound 1a molecules. The two complexes in the asymmetric unit are very similar, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.13 Å for 210 Cα atoms of residues 291–308, 332–461, and 471–498. A comparison of apoERRα (bound to a PGC-1α peptide (14Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A. Geiser M. Fournier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49330-49337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)) with the inverse agonist complex (Fig. 1) revealed no major conformational changes for the main chain atoms from H1 to the middle of H11 (r.m.s.d. of 0.55 Å for 210 Cα atoms as above), with the exception of H3. The N-terminal part of H3 moves away from the LBP, in order to create necessary space for the ligand (Fig. 1). In particular the Cαs of Val321 and Leu324 move by 4.3 and 3.2 Å, respectively. Important structural perturbations of the main chain due to compound 1a binding also occur at the C terminus of H11 (unwinding of the last turn of H11, i.e. after Lys499), the H11/H12 loop (reorganization of its conformation, so that Pro505 is now at the beginning of H12), and H12 (new location in the coactivator binding groove) (Fig. 1). In the apoERRα complex with PGC-1α (14Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A. Geiser M. Fournier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49330-49337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), H12 is formed between His507 and Ala516 (i.e. Pro505 and Met506 are in the H11/H12 loop), whereas in the inverse agonist complex H12 already starts at Pro505 and is visible until Met517. In the apoERRα structure, the PGC-1α peptide (which adopts an α-helical conformation) utilizes two Leu side chains (Leu210 and Leu214 of its inverted LXXLL-motif) to make hydrophobic interactions in the coactivator groove. Unexpectedly, similar interactions are made by two Met side chains (Met513 and Met517) of H12 in the compound 1a complex. The hydrogen bond made between Lys340(H3) and the PGC-1α main chain (contributing to the “charge clamp” interaction) is replaced by a hydrogen bond between Lys340 and the carbonyl oxygen of Ala516(H12). H12 in the compound 1a complex is making further stabilizing interactions via a salt bridge between the side chains of Lys508(H12) and Asp329(H3) and via a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Met506(H12) and the side chain of Gln358(H4). Finally, in the inverse agonist complex Leu509(H12) is located in the same hydrophobic pocket (with Trp361 at the bottom) as Met513(H12) in the apoERRα structure. In the crystal lattice, Phe510 makes an aromatic stacking interaction with Phe510 of a neighboring molecule, but these packing interactions seem to be of less importance than the interactions in the coactivator groove itself (described above).

In this study, we report the identification and characterization of two proteins (m/z 14,900 and 15,600) that are most dramatically associated with HDL in mouse models of atherosclerosis. Mass spectral analyses of proinflammatory HDL identified the two peaks to be hemoglobin (Hb) α and β chains, respectively, with no apparent post-translational modification. Biochemical analysis confirmed the differential association of Hb with HDL from hyperlipidemic mice. We further show that HDL-associated Hb is predominantly in the oxyHb form with distinct physical and chemical properties. Furthermore oxyHb-containing proinflammatory HDL potently consumed nitric oxide and contracted arterial vessels ex vivo. Moreover Hb also was found differentially associated with HDL from coronary heart disease patients compared with healthy controls. Our data suggest that Hb contributes to the proinflammatory nature of HDL in mouse and human models of atherosclerosis and may serve as a novel biomarker for atherosclerosis."

In addition, circulating leptin levels appear to be increased more than 10-fold. However, food intake, body weight, and adipose mass are not significantly altered in LIRKO mice compared with wild-type littermates. Using a ligand immunofunctional assay, we found that the apparent increase in circulating leptin in LIRKO mice is because of an 80-fold increased serum level of soluble leptin receptor. Gene expression analysis by microarray and real time PCR reveals the liver as the source of soluble leptin receptor in LIRKO mice, with an increase in expression of the short (Ob-Ra), long (Ob-Rb), and soluble (Ob-Re) forms of the leptin receptor. Direct control of leptin receptor expression by insulin could also be demonstrated in isolated hepatocytes from normal mice. Despite the markedly increased levels of leptin receptor in their circulation, LIRKO mice exhibit normal or even enhanced leptin sensitivity, as assessed by their physiological and molecular responses to exogenous leptin administration and their lower base-line hypothalamic levels of SOCS3 mRNA. Thus, insulin signaling in the liver plays an important role in control of leptin receptor expression and shedding. In the LIRKO mouse, this is lost, leading to markedly increased leptin receptors into the circulation. These high levels of circulating leptin receptor bind leptin and likely alter its clearance, but do not inhibit leptin action and may actually potentiate leptin action.

In this manner, insulin signaling in liver plays an important role in leptin homeostasis and fine modulation of leptin action. Leptin is a major sensor of body fat stores. Normally, as fat mass increases, circulating leptin levels rise and act at the hypothalamus to decrease appetite and increase energy expenditure thus limiting further weight gain (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Although some rare forms of obesity are caused by leptin or leptin receptor mutations (2Clement K. Vaisse C. Lahlou N. Cabrol S. Pelloux V. Cassuto D. Gourmelen M. Dina C. Chambaz J. Lacorte J.M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar), in most humans and rodents with obesity there is leptin resistance, and thus leptin is unable to normally suppress overeating or enhance energy expenditure (4Frederich R.C. Hamann A. Anderson S. Lollmann B. Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1311-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). In obese states, leptin resistance is accompanied by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Cross-talk exists between leptin and insulin-regulated pathways at multiple levels. In the brain, both insulin and leptin act to inhibit appetite (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). In pancreatic islets, leptin has a direct inhibitory effect on insulin secretion (5Kulkarni R.N. Wang Z.L. Wang R.M. Hurley J.D. Smith D.M. Ghatei M.A. Withers D.J. Gardiner J.V. Bailey C.J. Bloom S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2729-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Additionally, various mechanisms of cross-talk between leptin and insulin signaling in the liver have been described recently (6Ceddia R.B. Koistinen H.A. Zierath J.R. Sweeney G. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1163-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, Cohen et al. (7Cohen B. Novick D. Rubinstein M.

On the other hand, in rodent hepatoma cells, our laboratory found that insulin-induced association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with IRS-1 was increased after leptin preincubation, whereas association of the p85α regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with IRS-2 was diminished significantly (8Szanto I. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2355-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), suggesting differential effects of leptin on individual insulin pathways. We have previously developed a mouse model of hepatic insulin resistance using the Cre-Lox system to inactivate the insulin receptor gene specifically in liver (LIRKO) (9Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). These mice develop secondary hyperinsulinemia from a combination of increased β cell mass and decreased insulin clearance by the liver. They also display focal dysplasia and hyperplastic nodules in their livers and a 50% reduction in albumin levels, as well as a similar reduction in serum triglycerides and free fatty acids (9Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N.

Ntambi J.M. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2032-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which could be explained, at least in part, by the inability of insulin to promote triglyceride synthesis in liver and by reduced lipolysis in adipose tissue. However, despite their pronounced hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, LIRKO mice are not obese, thus providing a unique model to study the effect of insulin on leptin homeostasis. Leptin production, mainly from the adipose tissue, leptin bioavailability, and leptin sensitivity of its target cells represent the main regulators of the actions of leptin under physiological conditions, the last two being mediated by leptin receptors. Leptin receptors (Ob-R) occur in several forms as a result of alternative splicing (11Ge H. Huang L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45898-45903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The long form of the receptor (Ob-Rb) serves in leptin signaling, and its functional inhibition by molecules such as SOCS3 represents a major source of leptin resistance during obesity (12Howard J.K. Flier J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 13Munzberg H. Myers Jr., M.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In addition, there are at least four forms of leptin receptor with transmembrane and short intracellular domains (Ob-Ra, Ob-Rc, Ob-Rd, and Ob-Rf). All isoforms share the ligand-binding domain, but only the long form has the full cytoplasmic domain containing all signal transduction motifs (14Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Richards G.J. Campfield L.A. Clark F.T. Deeds J. Muir C. Sanker S. Moriarty A. Moore K.J. Smutko J.S. Mays G.G. Wool E.A. Monroe C.A. Tepper R.I. Cell. 1995; 83: 1263-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3197) Google Scholar). Both the long and the short forms of receptor can also be shed into the circulation by the action of surface proteases (15Maamra M. Bidlingmaier M. Postel-Vinay M.C. Wu Z. Strasburger C.J. Ross R.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4389-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, alternative splicing creates a secretory (soluble) form of receptor (Ob-Re, also known as sOb-R), which lacks a transmembrane domain, and is directly released into the circulation, whereas by binding leptin, it controls the amount of free leptin and the rate of leptin clearance (16Zastrow O. Seidel B. Kiess W. Thiery J. Keller E. Bottner A. Kratzsch J. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 1472-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study using the LIRKO mouse, we demonstrate an important role of insulin signaling in liver in control of hepatic expression of the various isoforms of the leptin receptor gene, leading to increasing secretion and shedding of leptin receptors. This produces high apparent circulating levels of leptin, but it does not inhibit leptin action and may actually sensitize to these effects. Thus, the liver may modulate leptin homeostasis and function in insulin-resistant states. Mice—LIRKO mice were generated using the Cre/loxP system for site-specific excisional DNA recombination (17Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) by crossing mice carrying a floxed insulin receptor [IRlox/lox] and albumin-Cre transgenic mice heterozygous for the floxed allele IRlox/+ as described previously (9Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N.

Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) mice were generated in a similar fashion using tissue-specific Cre-transgenics. Other animals described in this study were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories. All protocols for animal care and use were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. The body composition of 16-week-old LIRKO and control [IRlox/lox] mice was measured by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorbiometry (DEXA) using a Lunar PIXImus densitometer (GE Healthcare). Leptin Treatment—Recombinant mouse leptin was obtained from Dr. A. F. Parlow, Scientific Director, National Hormone and Peptide Program, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. For the prolonged leptin treatment experiment, 2-month-old male LIRKO and their lox littermates mice (n = 4-6/group) were treated with leptin (4 μg/g body weight) or PBS intraperitoneally at 0700 and 1900 daily for 4 days, and sacrificed 14 h after their last leptin injection at 0900 in a randomly fed state. A similar cohort of mice (n = 4/group) was used likewise for the short term experiments, with the difference that mice were sacrificed 30 min after their first injection. Biochemical Measurements—Serum insulin was measured by ELISA (Crystal Chem Inc.). Total serum leptin was measured by ELISA (R & D Systems). sOb-R levels were determined by a ligand immunofunctional assay, as described previously (19Lammert A. Kiess W. Bottner A. Glasow A. Kratzsch J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 982-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Briefly, the wells of a microtiter plate were coated with the anti-sOb-R IgG and blocked against nonspecific binding with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Twenty microliters of murine rsOb-R (R & D Systems) standards ranging between 10 pm and 1000 nm or serum samples were added to the wells and incubated with an excess of biotinylated leptin in assay buffer (1% goat γ-globulin, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. The complex consisting of sOb-R and biotinylated leptin was detected by europium-labeled streptavidin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the Victor system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The resulting signal is based on both leptin binding and immunological recognition of the sOb-R. The assay detected sOb-R in a range between 20.7 pm and 769 nm, and spiking of 3.1 μm leptin yielded a mean recovery of 90.1%. Intra-assay as well as inter-assay coefficients of variation were below 10.7% (n = 12) and 12.4% (n = 10), respectively. Results of dilution and sOb-R spiking experiments demonstrated a recovery of 103.0 ± 10.7% (n = 4) and 94.2 ± 11.9% (n = 3), respectively, which is within the expected range for immunoassays. Free leptin index was calculated by dividing the total serum leptin (nanomolar) by the circulating sOb-R (nanomolar) concentration. Western blot analysis of sOb-R in sera of control and LIRKO mice was performed as described previously (20Lammert A. Brockmann G. Renne U. Kiess W. Bottner A. Thiery J. Kratzsch J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Five microliters of serum was fractionated under reducing conditions by 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by the polyclonal antiserum against sOb-R (R & D Systems). Gene Expression Analysis—Tissues were immediately collected from animals, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript™ Choice System (Invitrogen) or the Advantage RT for PCR kit (BD Biosciences) and (dT)18 for priming. Biotinylated cRNA was prepared using the Bioarray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Biochem). Murine 74Av2 chips (Affymetrix) were hybridized in triplicate with RNA pooled from 3 to 4 animals in the Affymetrix Core Lab at the Joslin Diabetes Center. The Affymetrix microarray analysis was facilitated by the Affymetrix 5.0 software, and the filters of significance applied have been described elsewhere (21Yechoor V.K. Patti M.E. Ueki K. Laustsen P.G. Saccone R. Rauniyar R. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16525-16530Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ob-Ra, Ob-Rb, or Ob-Re cDNA was amplified in duplicate in a 40-μl real time PCR (SYBRGreen, PE Biosystems), in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE Biosystems). The primer sets were specific for each receptor isoform, and sense and antisense primers were aligned to different exons to avoid genomic DNA amplification. Primer3 software facilitated primer design. The following primer sets were used and presented from 5′ to 3′: Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb (common) sense, aatgacgcagggctgtatgt; Ob-Ra antisense (specific), atggactgttgggaagttgg; Ob-Rb antisense (specific), tcaggctccagaagaagagg; Ob-Re sense, tgaagatgatggaatgaagtgg; Ob-Re antisense, agttggcatccttattttgaggt; leptin sense, caagcagtgcctatccaga; leptin antisense, aagcccaggaatgaagtcca; SOCS3 sense, gggagcccctttgtagactt; SOCS3 antisense, ctggtactcgcttttggagc; TATA-binding protein (TBP) sense, acccttcaccaatgactcctatg; TBP antisense, tgactgcagcaaatcgcttgg. Amplification of NPY, POMC, and AgRP has been described previously (22Bates S.H. Stearns W.H. Dundon T.A. Schubert M. Tso A.W. Wang Y. Banks A.S. Lavery H.J. Haq A.K. Maratos-Flier E. Neel B.G.

Isolation and Treatment of Primary Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes from livers of male C57BL/6 mice were prepared by collagenase perfusion as described previously for rat hepatocytes (23Mewes K. Blanz J. Ehninger G. Gebhardt R. Zeller K.P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5135-5142PubMed Google Scholar). Viability of cells, assessed by trypan blue exclusion, was >90%. Hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated 6-well Petri dishes (Costar) in 1 ml of Williams medium E supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum at a density of 125,000 cells/cm2, as described previously (24Gebhardt R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4407-4410PubMed Google Scholar). After an initial period of 4 h, medium and unattached cells were removed, and the cells transferred to serum-free Williams medium E and incubated for 20 h with or without hormones (0.1 μm insulin, 160 ng/ml leptin). Thereafter, cells were harvested, and total RNA was prepared as described above. Each experimental condition was run three times. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of the data was performed with SigmaPlot 2000 for Windows Version 6.00 (SPSS) and StatView (Abacus Concepts) using a two-tailed unpaired t test and analysis of variance factorial with Bonferroni/Dunn correction for multiple comparisons. A probability value p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. LIRKO Mice Are Characterized by Hyperleptinemia in the Absence of Obesity—As noted previously, LIRKO mice are of normal body weight (30.2 ± 0.9 versus 33.2 ± 2.3 g) and have similar levels of total body fat as assessed by DEXA (7.1 ± 0.5 versus 8.4 ± 1.9 g) and food intake (3.64 ± 0.6 versus 3.86 ± 0.6 g/day) as their 16-week-old male controls (Fig. 1). Despite this, total serum leptin levels as determined by ELISA were more than 10-fold elevated in LIRKO mice compared with controls (1.6 ± 0.2 versus 0.15 ± 0.03 nm, respectively; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2A), and this was true in both males and females and at ages 1 to 4 months (data not shown).FIGURE 2Apparent hyperleptinemia and increased circulating levels of soluble leptin receptor in LIRKO mice. LIRKO mice are represented by dark bars and their controls by open bars (n = 15-17/group). A, serum total leptin was measured using an ELISA. B, sOb-R was measured by a ligand immunofunctional assay; C, free leptin index was calculated from the above and normalized by grams of total body fat. LIRKO mice had ∼10-fold increase (***, p < 0.001) in serum total leptin and an ∼60-fold increase in circulating sOb-R (***, p < 0.001), resulting in an ∼6-fold decrease in their free serum leptin (**, p < 0.01). D-F show the same parameters as the above, in PBS (gray bars) or leptin-treated (dark bars) control or LIRKO mice. Serum was collected 30 min after the leptin injection. Leptin treatment resulted in an ∼3000-fold increase in total serum leptin levels in control mice and ∼300-fold in LIRKO mice (D) but had no effect on the sOb-R levels (E). Still, free leptin after leptin injection (F) was significantly lower in LIRKO mice compared with control mice (*, p < 0.05). G, Western blot for sOb-R in sera of control (mouse 1, 5, and 4) and LIRKO mice (mouse 18, 14, and 13). Serum proteins were fractionated in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a solid support, and incubated with an antibody against sOb-R.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The presence of high circulating leptin levels with normal weight in LIRKO mice suggested the possibility of some factor(s) that might modify the action of leptin, and one consideration in this regard would be increased levels of circulating leptin receptor. Indeed, measurement of circulating sOb-R by ligand immunofunctional assay revealed a >80-fold increase in the serum of LIRKO mice as compared with controls (8.3 ± 0.9 versus 0.1 ± 0.01 nm; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). As a result, calculated free serum leptin index, normalized by body fat, was 6-fold lower in LIRKO mice than in controls (3.0 ± 0.3 versus 18.8 ± 4.2, respectively; p < 0.01) (Fig. 2C). Indeed, even after acute IP leptin injection, although levels of total circulating leptin markedly increased in both LIRKO and control mice (187 ± 37 versus 373 ± 175 nm; respectively) (Fig. 2D) and sOb-R levels remained unaffected by leptin treatment (6.7 ± 1.0 nm versus 0.04 ± 0 nm) (Fig. 2E), the high level of circulating receptor resulted in markedly lower free leptin levels in LIRKO mice than in control mice (30.4 ± 8.5 versus 12,297 ± 6,213 respectively, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2F), confirming the vast excess of sOb-R in this mouse model of hepatic insulin resistance (Fig. 2, B and E). LIRKO Mice Have Increased Liver Production of Leptin Receptors—The source of the increased circulating sOb-R in LIRKO mice was the liver. Thus, on Affymetrix microarray analysis, Ob-Ra mRNA expression was >400-fold higher in the LIRKO liver than in controls (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). The up-regulation of leptin receptor in liver of LIRKO mice was confirmed by real time RT-PCR using isoform-specific primers for Ob-Ra, Ob-Rb, and Ob-Re. Indeed, there was a marked up-regulation of all three leptin receptor isoforms in the liver of LIRKO mice (Ob-Ra 467.6 ± 31.9-fold, p < 0.001; Ob-Rb 31.5 ± 6.3-fold, p < 0.01; Ob-Re 69.1 ± 11.9-fold, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). The increase in leptin receptor expression appeared to be a unique feature of the liver of the LIRKO mouse, because there was no alteration in leptin receptor expression in epididymal fat, skeletal muscle, and kidney of LIRKO mice (data not shown) or in epididymal fat of fat-specific insulin receptor knock-out (FIRKO) mice (18Bluher M.

Insulin Treatment Down-regulates Ob-Ra Expression in Isolated Hepatocytes—The increased Ob-Ra expression in the liver of the LIRKO mice could be due to a direct effect of tissue-specific loss of insulin signaling or secondary to other changes in the liver previously described in these mice (9Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). To gain some insight to the mechanism, we treated normal isolated mouse hepatocytes with insulin and leptin, as a positive control (26Brabant G. Nave H. Horn R. Anderwald C. Muller G. Roden M. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 34: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We found that 20 h of insulin treatment resulted in ∼75% down-regulation of Ob-Ra mRNA expression (2.1 ± 0.7 arbitrary units) compared with control (9.2 ± 2.9 arbitrary units, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). Leptin Sensitivity Is Not Compromised in LIRKO Mice—Although there is some debate, it has been suggested that high levels of circulating leptin receptor or high levels of circulating leptin might lead to leptin resistance. To determine whether the LIRKO mice were leptin-resistant, we injected 2-month old male LIRKO and control mice twice a day intraperitoneally with 4 μg/g body weight of recombinant mouse leptin for 4 days. Following leptin treatment, body weight of both LIRKO and control mice decreased significantly over the 4 days, with the fall being slightly, but not significantly, greater on day 1 in the LIRKO mice versus the controls (Fig. 5A). Assessment of food intake revealed that LIRKO mice actually had a more dramatic and rapid response to exogenous leptin than controls. Thus, in LIRKO mice there was a 50% reduction in food intake on day 1 of treatment that persisted throughout the 4 days of leptin injections, whereas leptin-treated control mice decreased food intake slowly over 4 days to eventually approach the same reduction on day 4 that the LIRKO mice achieved on day 1 (Fig. 5B). Moreover, serum insulin levels, which were initially 18-fold increased (p < 0.001) in the LIRKO mice, were decreased by 75% with leptin treatment (p < 0.01), although there was no effect in control mice (Fig. 5C). Likewise, the ∼2.5-fold elevated leptin gene expression in WAT of LIRKO mice compared with control mice (p < 0.05) was also suppressed following leptin treatment more in LIRKO mice than controls (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5D). This is consistent with a previous study from our group in which we administered continuous leptin infusion via an osmotic pump (24 μg/day) in 12-week-old male LIRKO and control mice for 4 days, which also resulted in similar weight loss, reduction in food intake, and drop in serum insulin levels in the two genotypes (10Biddinger S.B. Miyazaki M. Boucher J. Ntambi J.M. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2032-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hypothalamic Leptin Sensitivity in LIRKO Mice—SOCS3 mRNA expression in the hypothalamus has been regarded as another potential indicator and mechanism of central leptin resistance (27Bjorbaek C. Elmquist J.K. Frantz J.D. Shoelson S.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SOCS3 levels were ∼50% lower in LIRKO mice than in controls (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6). We also measured mRNA expression of several neuropeptides known to be targets of leptin in the hypothalamus both in the basal state and after 4 days of leptin (or PBS) treatment. This study revealed that both genotypes had similar neuropeptide levels at base line and both responded with appropriate down-regulation of the orexigenic peptides NPY (Fig. 7A) and AgRP (Fig. 7B) and appropriate up-regulation of the anorexigenic peptide precursor POMC (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these data indicate an increase, rather than a decrease, in leptin sensitivity in the LIRKO mice and are compatible with the suppression of food intake in response to exogenous leptin administration presented in Fig. 5B.FIGURE 7Hypothalamic appetite regulating neuropeptide responses in LIRKO mice are not compromised. After 4 days of leptin (dark bars) or PBS (gray bars) treatment, hypothalamic expression of NPY, AgRP, and POMC was evaluated in LIRKO and control mice by real time RT-PCR. Compared with PBS treatment, leptin treatment resulted in a significant down-regulation of NPY (A) and AgRP (B) and up-regulation of POMC (C) (*, p < 0.05) to a similar degree in both genotypes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Leptin resistance is a common component of obesity in humans and rodents (28Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 413-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar), but the role of circulating leptin receptor as a regulator of leptin action has just started to emerge. The current study of a mouse model with high levels of soluble leptin receptor resulting from genetic ablation of insulin signaling in the liver (9Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) has allowed us to demonstrate that even in the presence of markedly elevated levels of circulating leptin receptor both from shed and secreted isoforms, sensitivity to both endogenous and exogenous leptin appears to be completely normal. This conclusion is based on reduction of food intake and significant weight loss in LIRKO mice treated with leptin, to a degree similar to that observed in similarly treated wild-type mice (this study and see Ref. 10Biddinger S.B. Miyazaki M. Boucher J. Ntambi J.M. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2032-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, several physiological targets of leptin action (29Ahima R.S. Obesity (Silver Spring). 2006; 14: 242S-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), such as ob gene expression, insulin, and other appetite-regulating neuropeptides in the hypothalamus also respond appropriately to exogenous leptin administration in LIRKO mice. Moreover, hypothalamic SOCS3 expression, a well accepted marker of central leptin resistance (13Munzberg H. Myers Jr., M.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 27Bjorbaek C. Elmquist J.K. Frantz J.D. Shoelson S.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), is also lower in LIRKO mice. Thus, high levels of circulating leptin receptors (and the associated hyperleptinemia) do not cause leptin resistance; rather it appears that free circulating leptin may be the better determinant of leptin sensitivity. Such a statement is further corroborated by in vitro experiments showing that increased sOb-R does not directly interfere with leptin signaling at the cellular level but can regulate the availability of free leptin and its clearance (16Zastrow O. Seidel B. Kiess W. Thiery J. Keller E. Bottner A. Kratzsch J. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 1472-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Yang G. Ge H. Boucher A. Yu X. Li C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1354-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, when cells bearing Ob-Rb are incubated with leptin in the presence of high levels of sOb-R, leptin signaling can be inhibited, but this can be easily reversed by increasing the concentration of free leptin, despite the high levels of sOb-R in the media. Interestingly, and in further support of increased leptin sensitivity associated with high sOb-R levels, overexpression of sOb-R in ob/ob mice actually enhances, rather than suppresses, the effects of leptin treatment (31Huang L. Wang Z. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6343-6349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In analogy to the LIRKO mice, humans that carry a mutant allele of the leptin receptor gene, which results in enhanced shedding of the extracellular leptin binding domain of the receptor, exhibit very high levels of total leptin but normal levels of free leptin and are not obese (32Lahlou N. Clement K. Carel J.C. Vaisse C. Lotton C. Le Bihan Y. Basdevant A. Lebouc Y. Froguel P. Roger M. Guy-Grand B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1347-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Lahlou N. Issad T. Lebouc Y. Carel J.C. Camoin L. Roger M. Girard J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1980-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Typically, in lean subjects the majority of circulating leptin is in its bound form, whereas during obesity serum levels of soluble leptin receptor decrease resulting in more free leptin available to signal in its target cells; conversely, weight loss has been associated with an increase in circulating leptin receptors in both humans and rodents (34van Dielen F.M. van't Veer C.

Endocrinol. 2004; 181: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This study of the LIRKO mouse also revealed important aspects of the role of liver in leptin physiology. First, our study demonstrates that the liver may be a site of significant sOb-R production, at least in some pathological states. Indeed, serum leptin levels are higher in patients with liver cirrhosis, as are the levels of leptin receptor mRNA expression in liver, although the levels of circulating sOb-R in these studies have not been directly assessed (38Otte C. Otte J.M. Strodthoff D. Bornstein S.R. Folsch U.R. Monig H. Kloehn S. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2004; 112: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Second, in liver, leptin receptor expression is clearly under the control of insulin, as evidenced by its markedly elevated levels in the LIRKO mouse, as well as by the significant insulin-mediated down-regulation of Ob-Ra in isolated hepatocytes as presented here (Fig. 4). In fact, in states of low insulin levels, as in men subjected to a 72-h fast (39Chan J.L. Bluher S. Yiannakouris N. Suchard M.A. Kratzsch J. Mantzoros C.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), in women with anorexia nervosa (40Kratzsch J. Lammert A. Bottner A. Seidel B. Mueller G. Thiery J. Hebebrand J. Kiess W. J.

Kiess W. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2006; 155: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), serum levels of sOb-R are increased. Our finding of leptin receptor mRNA up-regulation in the liver as a result of the lack of insulin signaling in this organ has been recently recapitulated in mice lacking IRS signaling in liver (43Dong X. Park S. Lin X. Copps K. Yi X. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although the transcriptional regulators of leptin receptor expression and of specific splice products are largely unknown, a preliminary sequence analysis of the 5′-untranslated region of the leptin receptor gene using the consensus insulin-response elements (IRE) core sequence (44Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol.

Endocrinol. 2001; 172: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) T(G/A)TTT(T/G)(G/T) revealed multiple putative IREs, including one located within the first 2 kb. In addition to leptin receptor, hepatic expression of many genes that regulate metabolism or growth is under the control of insulin signaling (45O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 47Hall R.K. Yamasaki T. Kucera T. Waltner-Law M. O'Brien R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30169-30175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the LIRKO mouse in particular, the inability of insulin to signal through functional IREs in the promoter of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC)-1, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and tyrosine aminotransferase, glucose-6-phosphatase results in significant liver up-regulation of these genes, which might account, at least in part, for their hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance (9Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N.

In aggregate, the current and previous studies clearly indicate that in states of increased sOB-R levels associated with increased free leptin, there is improved, rather than decreased, leptin sensitivity. Moreover, the study of the LIRKO mouse revealed the importance of the liver in the regulation of leptin bioavailability.

The anti-secretory response described in this study provides molecular insights whereby estrogen causes fluid retention effects in the female during periods of high circulating plasma estrogen levels. Fluid and electrolyte secretion is an important function in the distal colon as it regulates whole body fluid homeostasis and also maintains mucosal hydration (1Barrett K.E. Keely S.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 535-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Chloride secretion in the distal colon occurs as a two-step transport process. Cl– is transported into the cell basolaterally with Na+ and K+ via the Na+/K+/2Cl– isoform 1 (NKCC1) co-transporter. Cl– is secreted across the apical membrane into the lumen via a chloride ion channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). 3The abbreviations used are: AbbreviationsCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorPKCprotein kinase CPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinase A 3The abbreviations used are: AbbreviationsCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorPKCprotein kinase CPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinase A Secretion of Cl– ions is driven by the activity of Na+-K+-ATPase located in the basolateral membrane. Basolateral K+ ion channels carry out the K+ recycling required to establish the favorable membrane electrical potential for Cl– secretion. The activity of ion transporters involved in Cl– secretion may be modulated by secretagogues acting through cAMP activity or intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Disorders resulting in increased Cl– secretion, for example in bacterial or viral infections, are a primary cause of secretory diarrhea (2Field M. Semrad C.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 631-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein kinase C cAMP-dependent protein kinase A cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein kinase C cAMP-dependent protein kinase A The biologically active estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2) plays an important role in the normal development and maturation of the female. In addition to this classical role, E2 has also been implicated in the regulation of whole body fluid and electrolyte balance (3Crocker A.D. J. Physiol. 1971; 214: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 4Harvey B.J. Condliffe S. Doolan C.M. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 174-177PubMed Google Scholar). The distal colon has recently been recognized as a target of E2. The colonic crypts express both isoforms of the nuclear estrogen receptor, ERα and ERβ, similar to classical E2-responsive tissues such as uterus and breast tissue (5Thomas M.L. Xu X. Norfleet A.M. Watson C.S. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that E2 inhibits secretagogue stimulated Cl– secretion in the rat distal colonic crypt (6Condliffe S.B. Doolan C.M. Harvey B.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The anti-secretory response to E2 was rapid, occurring within 10 min and was dependent on protein kinase C (PKC). In human distal colonic tissue, blocking basolateral K+ channel activity decreases forskolin-stimulated Cl– secretion (7McNamara B. Winter D.C. Cuffe J.E. O'Sullivan G.C. Harvey B.J. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In rat distal colon the basolateral K+ conductance is formed by at least two different types of K+ channels, activated by Ca2+ or cAMP-dependent agonists (8Liao T. Wang L. Halm S.T. Lu L. Fyffe R.E. Halm D.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 289: C564-C575Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies in these cells have revealed the candidate K+ channel involved in Cl– secretion to be KCNQ1, a low conductance (1–3 pS) K+ channel, which is activated during cAMP-stimulated Cl– secretion (9Kunzelmann K. Hubner M. Schreiber R. Levy-Holzman R. Garty H. Bleich M. Warth R. Slavik M. von Hahn T. Greger R. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 179: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Other types of K+ channels have also been implicated in chloride secretion, including the Ca2+-dependent KCNN4 channel (10Halm S.T. Liao T. Halm D.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C636-C648Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The rat KCNQ1 channel was cloned from colonic tissue and expression was demonstrated in both the crypt and surface cells (9Kunzelmann K. Hubner M. Schreiber R. Levy-Holzman R. Garty H. Bleich M. Warth R. Slavik M. von Hahn T. Greger R. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 179: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). KCNQ1 is a voltage-gated channel, which plays a crucial role in controlling salt and water homeostasis in a number of epithelia (11Jespersen T. Grunnet M. Olesen S.P. Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). KCNQ1 is located in the basolateral membrane of the rat distal colonic crypt (8Liao T. Wang L. Halm S.T. Lu L. Fyffe R.E. Halm D.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 289: C564-C575Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and is regulated by forming a complex with the β-subunit KCNE3 (MiRP2) to form the basolateral K+ conductance that is required for transepithelial cAMP-stimulated chloride secretion (12Warth R. Bleich M. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 140: 1-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose KCNQ1 as a candidate membrane target for E2 in the inhibition of Cl– secretion in the rat distal colonic crypt. A previous study in cardiac tissue demonstrated a concentration-dependent inhibition of the KCNQ1/KCNE1-mediated K+ current by E2 (13Moller C. Netzer R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 532: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PKCδ is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the novel PKC subgroup and plays a key role in cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation and tissue remodeling (14Steinberg S.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the gastrointestinal tract PKCδ has been implicated in the maintenance of the epithelial barrier integrity (15Di Mari J.F. Mifflin R.C. Powell D.W. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128: 2131-2146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and is an important regulator of Cl– secretion (16Song J.C.

We have previously demonstrated that physiological concentrations of E2 (0.01–100 nm) produced a rapid (15 min) stimulation of PKC and PKA activities in female rat distal colonic crypts (17Doolan C.M. Harvey B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8763-8767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of ion channels is a major mechanism for their regulation. Indeed it has been demonstrated recently that KCNQ1 can be phosphorylated at Ser27 in the N terminus of the channel by PKA (18Kurokawa J. Motoike H.K. Rao J. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16374-16378Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the female gender-specific regulation of the KCNQ1 channel by E2 and the role of PKA and PKCδ as mediators of the rapid anti-secretory response to estrogen in rat distal colonic crypts.

Total KCNQ1 antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein-G Sepharose beads and the ECL plus detection system were from Amersham Biosciences and Bradford reagent from Bio-Rad. Chromanol 293B was obtained from Tocris and rottlerin from Calbiochem. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Animals—Male (∼350 g) and female (∼300 g) Sprague-Dawley rats at three-months-old were used for all experiments. Animals were kept on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle, and were given ad libitum access to food and water. Following anesthesia rats were killed by cervical dislocation. Cervical smears were obtained from female rats, and the stage of the estrous cycle was determined histologically as previously described (19Hubscher C.H. Brooks D.L. Johnson J.R. Biotech. Histochem. 2005; 80: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). All female rats were used at the estrus stage of the cycle where estradiol is present at a circulating level of ∼75 pg/ml and progesterone at ∼32.5 pg/ml (20Nequin L.G. Alvarez J. Schwartz N.B. Biol. Reprod. 1979; 20: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The distal colon was removed to below the pelvic rim. The faecal contents were rinsed and distal colonic crypts were isolated as previously described (17Doolan C.M. Harvey B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8763-8767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Isolations and treatments were carried out at room temperature to avoid colonic crypt disintegration (17Doolan C.M. Harvey B.J. J. Biol.

All procedures were approved by the RCSI Ethics Committee. Transepithelial Transport Studies—Colonic epithelia were mounted in Ussing chambers (Physiologic Instruments) on inserts exposing an area of 0.5 cm2. Transepithelial potential difference was clamped to 0 mV using an EVC-4000 voltage-clamp apparatus (World Precision Instruments). The transepithelial short circuit current (ISC) was recorded using Ag-AgCl electrodes in 3 m KCl agar bridges. Apical and basolateral baths were filled with Krebs bicarbonate buffer (in mm: 120 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 3.3 KH2PO4, 0.8 K2HPO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 10 glucose), pH 7.4 maintained at 37 °C by heated water jackets and oxygenated with a 95% O2/5% CO2 mixture. All preparations were allowed to equilibrate for 30–45 min before the experiments were performed. The Isc was defined as positive for anion flow from the basolateral to apical chamber and for cation flow in the opposite direction. To investigate the activity of basolateral K+ channels in Ussing chamber experiments, the apical membrane was permeabilized by addition of 10 μm of the K+ ionophore amphotericin B in the presence of a mucosal to serosal K+ gradient established by the following bath solutions: apical (in mm), 145 K-gluconate, 3 KH2PO4, 0.8 K2HPO4, 1.2 Mg(gluconate)2, 4 Ca(gluconate)2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES; basolateral, 145 Nagluconate, 3.3 NaH2PO4, 0.8 Na2HPO4, 1.2 Mg(gluconate)2, 4 Ca(gluconate)2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES. Ouabain (1 mm) was added to the serosal bath to inhibit Na+-K+-ATPase. The resulting Isc was generated by the movement of K+ through channels in the basolateral membrane (IK) as the current collapses to zero in equimolar K+ solutions bathing both sides of the epithelium. For measurement of IK current-voltage relationships, currents were elicited in asymmetrical K+ gluconate solutions by imposition of 1-s test potentials between −100 and +100 mV in 20-mV increments. Patch-clamp—A small aliquot (100 μl) of freshly isolated colonic crypts was transferred into 1 ml of superfusion chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (TE 2000-S, Nikon Ltd). Pipettes were prepared from capillary glass (GC150F-10, Harvard Apparatus Ltd, Edenbridge, UK). Patch pipettes were pulled and fire-polished using a programmable horizontal puller (DMZ-Universal, Zeitz-Instruments GmbH) and had an electrical resistance of 2–5 mΩ when filled with K+ solutions. The patch-clamp apparatus consisted of a CV-203BU head stage (Axon Instruments Incorporated) connected to an Axopatch 200B series amplifier (Axon Instruments). Patch-clamp experiments were performed at 37 °C in the standard whole cell recording configuration (22Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15118) Google Scholar) and recorded membrane currents were filtered at 1 kHz through an 8 pole, low-pass Bessel filter, and digitized at 5 kHz. The voltage clamp protocol consisted of a series of voltage steps from −100 mV to +100 mV in 20-mV increments from an initial holding potential of −50 mV. Colonic crypts were superfused at a rate of 1 ml/min in a standard bath solution containing (in mm): NaCl 140, KCl 5.4, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1.25, HEPES 10, glucose 12.2, buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH. The patch pipette solution contained (mm): K-gluconate 95, KCl 30, Na2ATP 4.8, KH2 PO4 1.2, EGTA 1, Ca-gluconate 0.73, MgCl2 1, ATP 3, d-glucose 5 (pH 7.2). Once whole cell access to the inside of the cell was obtained, cells were allowed to stabilize for up to 10 min before the experiment began. The protocols for patch-clamp and data analysis were established with routines using pClamp 9.2 software (Axon Instruments), and data were stored for subsequent analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Isolated distal colonic crypts resuspended in Krebs solution were treated with drugs for the indicated time points. The samples were then immediately centrifuged for 30 s at 4 °C at 4,000 rpm, and the supernatant removed. Cells were lysed by hypotonic shock on ice for 45 min (lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonident P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, leupeptin 1 μg/μl, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (1 tablet/7 ml of lysis buffer; Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors). Following incubation the samples were clarified at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The cleared supernatant was collected and the protein content was quantified by the Bradford method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). For activation assays 50 μg of sample were combined with 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and spun at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. All KCNQ1 immunoprecipitations were carried out using lysis buffers as described previously (24Kurokawa J. Chen L. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 500 μg of sample was removed for co-immunoprecipitation of KCNQ1 and associated kinases. KCNQ1 was immunoprecipitated as follows: 1 μg of total KCNQ1 antibody was added to 500 μg of sample and incubated on a rotor for one hour at 4 °C. 40 μl of washed protein G-Sepharose beads were combined with the immunocomplex. The samples were then incubated overnight on a rotor at 4 °C. Complexes were spun at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and washed three times with ice-cold sterile 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The supernatant was removed, and 35 μl of Laemmli buffer were added and samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min and spun at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Western blot analysis was carried out as standard. Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked in 1× TBS with Tween (0.3%) (1× TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody. Membranes were washed in 1× TBST 0.3% three times for 15 min. Bands were detected using autoradiographic film and chemiluminescence. PKA Activation Assay—PKA activation was detected using PepTag Assay (Promega) for non-radioactive detection of cAMP-dependent protein kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. 2.5 μl of the F-Kemptide PepTag and 2.5 μl of the cAMP activator solution were added instead of 5 μl. RNA Preparation and Reverse Transcriptase (RT) PCR—Total RNA was extracted from male and female rat distal colonic crypt preparations using Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Single-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Improm II reverse transcriptase kit (Promega). cDNA was quantified and corrected for loading into RT-PCR reaction mixes. PKCδ was amplified using the following primers: forward; 5-caccatcttccagaaagaacg-3′ and reverse; 5′-cttgccataggtcccgttgttg-3′. β-Actin was amplified using the following primers: forward; 5′-cagtaatctccttctgcatcc-3′ and reverse; 5′-actacctcatgaagatcctga-3′. GoTaq® polymerase mix from Promega was used in the amplification. Touch-down PCR was used to amplify PKCδ cDNA for 25 cycles over an annealing temperature range of 65–55 °C. β-Actin was amplified for 25 cycles at an annealing temperature of 52 °C. The RT-PCR product was analyzed on a 1.5% 1× Tris acetate-EDTA (TAE) agarose gel and imaged using a UV light source. Statistical and Densitometric Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. for a series of the indicated number of experiments. Statistical analysis of the data was obtained by analysis using paired Student's t test for analysis between two groups. One-way analysis of variance and Tukeys post-hoc test was used for multiple analysis of more than two groups. Patch-clamp data analysis was performed using Clampfit software of the p-clamp suite version 9.2 and Origin 7.5 (OriginLab Corp.). Densitometric analysis of Western blots, PKA and RT-PCR images were performed using GeneTools software (SYNGENE). 17β-Estradiol Inhibits Cl– Secretion Evoked by Forskolin in Rat Colonic Epithelia—We first set out to examine the effect of 17β-estradiol (E2) on intestinal secretion elicited by the cAMP agonist forskolin. Basolateral addition of 20 μm forskolin induced an almost instantaneous and sustained increase in ISC (Fig. 1A). E2 (10 nm) reduced the forskolin-effect on ISC by 60 ± 6% (n = 5, p < 0.01). The estrogen inhibition of forskolin-induced secretion was observed to be gender dependent. E2 inhibition of forskolin-induced chloride secretion was only observed in tissues from female rats with no significant response to E2 in male tissues (female 60 ± 6% ISC decrease versus male 6 ± 3%, p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig. 1A). All Ussing chamber values are maximal inhibition achieved at E2 treatment between 15 and 20 min. Previous data from our group have demonstrated direct and rapid activation of PKCδ in response to E2 (25Doolan C.M. Condliffe S.B. Harvey B.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated a potential role for this kinase in mediating the anti-secretory effects of E2. We used rottlerin as an inhibitor of PKCδ as it has been reported to inhibit this kinase more potently than other kinases. A previous publication on the inhibitor reported that it inhibits the PKC isoforms at different IC50 concentrations; PKCδ:3–6 μm, PKCα, PKCβ and PKCγ: 30–42 μm, PKCϵ, PKCζ and PKCθ: 80–100 μm (26Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of colonic mucosa with rottlerin (10 μm) completely abolished the anti-secretory action of E2 (E2: 59 ± 6%, E2 + rottlerin, 5 ± 3%, n = 5, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that PKCδ activity is required for the E2-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced Cl– secretion. The Effect of 17β-Estradiol on Basolateral Membrane K+ Currents in Rat Colonic Epithelia—Basolaterally directed K+ currents were generated in female rat colonic epithelia permeabilized apically by pretreatment with amphotericin B. Fig. 2A shows the current/voltage (IK/V) relationship for apically permeabilized epithelia before and after the addition of the cAMP-dependent agonist forskolin (10 μm). Treatment with forskolin-activated outward currents (apical to basolateral) that displayed slight outward rectification at positive transepithelial voltages and shifted apparent reversal potentials to more negative values consistent with activation of basolateral membrane K+ current IK. Treatment with chromanol 293B (10 μm), a specific KCNQ1 channel blocker, inhibited both the basal and forskolin-activated basolateral membrane K+ current suggesting the main component of this current is due to KCNQ1 channel activity (Fig. 2A). Treatment with E2 (10 nm) produced a marked inhibition of forskolin-stimulated IK (at Vp +100, forskolin 185 ± 19 μA/cm2; forskolin + E2 44 ± 6 μA/cm2, n = 3, p < 0.01) and subsequent addition of chromanol 293B had little effect on the remaining K+ current (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment of colonic epithelia with rottlerin (10 μm) for 15 min before addition of forskolin did not modify the increase in IK induced by forskolin but prevented the inhibition by E2 (at Vp +100, forskolin + rottlerin 182 ± 17 μA/cm2; forskolin + rottlerin + E2 158 ± 21 μA/cm2, n = 3, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the anti-secretory effect of 17β-estradiol is mediated by the inhibition of basolateral KCNQ1 channels via PKCδ. The Effect of Chromanol 293B on Whole Cell KCNQ1 Channel Current in Female Rat Colonic Crypts—Membrane currents were recorded in the whole cell mode of the patch-clamp technique from colonic crypt cells at 37 °C. The mean maximal whole cell current under control conditions was 817 ± 84 pA (at Vp = 100 mV, n = 4, p < 0.01) and subsequent addition of chromanol 293B (100 μm) produced a reduction of currents by 91% (corresponding to a reduction to 69 ± 50 pA, at Vp =+100 mV, n = 4, p < 0.01). Consistent with the decrease in whole cell current, chromanol 293B also reduced the whole cell conductance (Gc) at +100 mV (γ+100) from 397 ± 33 pS to 25 ± 4 pS (n = 4, p < 0.01 n = 4) (figure shown as supplemental data). The KCNQ1 channel activity is temperature-sensitive and increasing the temperature to 37 °C is known to activate the channel (27Unsold B. Kerst G. Brousos H. Hubner M. Schreiber R. Nitschke R. Greger R. Bleich M. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 441: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Supplementary data show the mean maximal whole cell KCNQ1 currents recorded at room temperature (22 °C), Vp +100 mV and at 37 °C prior to the addition of chromanol 293B (100 μm). Chromanol 293B inhibited the mean maximal whole cell KCNQ1 currents and reduced the K+ current toward the level measured at room temperature (22 °C). The mean maximal temperature-stimulated increase in current was 822 ± 52 pA (n = 4, p < 0.02) and chromanol 293B addition produced a reduction of current by 69% (corresponding to 252 ± 45 pA), (n = 4, p < 0.05). Taken together, these results demonstrate the functional activity of KCNQ1 channels in female rat distal colonic crypts. E2 Effect on KCNQ1 Whole Cell Currents in Female Rat Colonic Crypts—Following membrane breakthrough to the whole cell patch-clamp configuration, the patched cells were allowed to stabilize and dialyze for 5 min. Currents were recorded over this time period before the addition of E2 to ensure stability of the current recording and to check for channel rundown. The experiments involved exposing the isolated colonic crypts to E2 (100 nm) and measuring the whole cell currents at 30-s intervals. Fig. 3A shows the effects of E2 (100 nm) treatment over time on the whole cell current-voltage relationships. E2 application caused a decrease in whole cell current and its outward rectification over 9 min with a concomitant fall in whole cell membrane conductance at +100 mV from control 278 ± 22 pS to: 160 ± 13 pS at 1 min; 158 ± 11 pS at 3 min; 107 ± 9 pS at 5 min; 82 ± 16 pS at 7 min and 81 ± 25 pS at 9 min (n = 4, p < 0.01). The effect of E2 treatment on whole cell current over time is shown in Fig. 3B. The mean maximal whole cell currents recorded over 5 min prior to E2 addition was 526 ± 50 pA (at Vp =+100 mV). Addition of E2 (100 nm) inhibited the mean maximal current after 5 min to 248 ± 38 pA and to 73 ± 10 pA after 15 min (n = 4, p < 0.05). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that KCNQ1 channel activity generates the main basolateral membrane K+ current, in female colonic crypts, consistent with the Ussing chamber results, and the channel is a target for E2 causing an anti-secretory response. Gender Comparisons of PKA, PKCδ, and KCNQ1 Basal Expression Levels in Rat Distal Colonic Crypts—Total untreated cellular lysates of isolated rat distal colonic crypts were prepared, subjected to Western blot analysis, and probed using specific antibodies to endogenous levels of PKARI, PKACI, PKCδ, and KCNQ1. In all cases expression differences were normalized for loading by probing for total β-actin levels. Differences are expressed as fold values of female expression levels compared with male. PKA isoform I is a cytoplasmic PKA, unlike isoform II which is membrane bound (28Tasken K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Previous studies in rat colonic crypts demonstrated no significant activation of PKA in the membrane fractions of crypts and a significant activation of PKA in cytosolic fractions (25Doolan C.M. Condliffe S.B. Harvey B.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Isoform I, the soluble cytosolic isoform, was therefore investigated in this study. Basal expression amounts of PKARI and PKACI were similar between male and female rat distal colonic crypts (PKACI: 1.1 ± 0.2, p > 0.05, n = 3; PKARI: 1 ± 0.2, n = 3, p > 0.05) (Fig. 4, A and B). A comparison of KCNQ1 basal expression levels between male and female distal colonic crypts was also investigated. No significant difference was found between male and female crypts for total basal expression levels of KCNQ1 (1.1 ± 0.03, n = 3, p > 0.05) (Fig. 4E). We have found gender differences to exist in the basal expression for novel PKCδ. In comparison to male, distal colonic crypts from female rats displayed a 3.2 ± 0.42-fold higher expression of the PKCδ protein (n = 6, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4C). To further verify the gender difference in expression of PKCδ we also amplified the messenger transcript levels of the kinase by RT-PCR. Female distal colonic crypts had a significantly higher level of the PKCδ transcript present compared with male distal colonic crypts (2.1 ± 0.1-fold higher, n = 3, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4D). We conclude from these expression studies that a significant gender difference exists for PKCδ, with a higher expression level in female rat distal colonic crypts. No gender differences were detected for PKACI, PKARI, or"

https://openalex.org/W1990978338,"The human gene MUC4 encodes a large transmembrane mucin that is developmentally regulated and expressed along the undifferentiated pseudostratified epithelium, as early as 6.5 weeks during fetal development. Immunohistochemical analysis of Muc4 expression in developing mouse lung and gastrointestinal tract showed a different spatio-temporal pattern of expression before and after cytodifferentiation. The molecular mechanisms governing MUC4 expression during development are, however, unknown. Hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF), forkhead box A (FOXA), GATA, and caudal-related homeobox transcription factors (TFs) are known to control cell differentiation of gut endoderm derived-tissues during embryonic development. They also control the expression of cell- and tissue-specific genes and may thus control MUC4 expression. To test this hypothesis, we studied and deciphered the molecular mechanisms responsible for MUC4 transcriptional regulation by these TFs. Experiments using small interfering RNA, cell co-transfection, and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that MUC4 is regulated at the transcriptional level by CDX-1 and -2, HNF-1α and -1β, FOXA1/A2, HNF-4α and -4γ, and GATA-4, -5, and -6 factors in a cell-specific manner. Binding of TFs was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gel-shift assays. Altogether, these results demonstrate that MUC4 is a target gene of endodermal TFs and thus point out an important role for these TFs in regulating MUC4 expression during epithelial differentiation during development, cancer, and repair.

MUC4 is a large transmembrane mucin with a very long glycosylated extracellular domain, which is expressed by epithelial cells in normal respiratory, gastrointestinal and genital tracts (1Audié J.P.

However, the molecular mechanisms governing MUC4 expression during embryonic and fetal development are unknown. Recently, we characterized the promoter region of MUC4, which is composed of a proximal and a distal promoter (13Perrais M. Pigny P. Ducourouble M.P. Petitprez D. Porchet N. Aubert J.P.

We also recently showed that MUC4 endogenous expression is regulated by HNF-1α and HNF-4α TFs in esophageal cancer cells (15Piessen G. Jonckheere N. Vincent A. Hemon B. Ducourouble M.P. Copin M.C.

Altogether, these findings suggest that MUC4 expression may be regulated by TFs responsible for cell differentiation programs leading to the formation of organs derived from the primitive gut.

Among these genes, we recently identified the secretory mucin MUC2 as a target of CDX-1/CDX-2 (26Mesquita P. Jonckheere N. Almeida R. Ducourouble M.P. Serpa J. Silva E. Pigny P. Silva F.S. Reis C.

The GATA family consists of six members, GATA-1 to -6, that bind to the 5′-(A/T)GATA(A/G)-3′ nucleotide motif via their zinc finger domains. They are grouped into two subfamilies based on structural features and expression patterns. GATA-1, -2, and -3 are involved in hematopoiesis and neurogenesis. GATA-4, -5, and -6 are found mainly in heart and endoderm-derived tissues, including liver, lung, pancreas, stomach, and intestine, and are involved in regulation of cardiogenesis and gut development (28Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte nuclear factors belong to a heterogeneous family of TFs involved in a wide variety of biological pathways. Although important in liver development and function, they are also involved in visceral endoderm differentiation and found in kidney, pancreas, stomach, small intestine, and colon (29Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). HNF-1α and -1β are homeodomain proteins that form homo- or heterodimers and bind the consensus sequence 5′-GTTAATGATTAAC-3′. HNF-3α and -3β belong to the forkhead/winged helix DNA binding domain family. They bind the consensus sequence 5′-GATTATTGACTT-3′ as monomers (30Hromas R. Costa R. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 20: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and are expressed in embryonic endoderm and in the adult intestine (31Kaestner K.H. Hiemisch H. Luckow B. Schutz G. Genomics. 1994; 20: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this paper we will use the new nomenclature FOXA1 (HNF-3α) and FOXA2 (HNF-3β). HNF-4α and -4γ are members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. They are zinc finger TFs and bind the consensus sequence 5′-TGGACTTAG-3′. HNF-4 has been implicated in early endodermal development and differentiation of the liver, kidney, pancreas, stomach, and intestine (32Duncan S.A. Manova K. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Weinstein D.C.

Homeobox CDX-1 and -2 are intestine-specific genes that bind the AT-rich consensus sequence (T/C)ATAAA(T/G) either as homo- or heterodimers (33Freund J.N. Domon-Dell C. Kedinger M. Duluc I. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).

In this paper we report that Muc4 mucin is expressed before and after cytodifferentiation in the lung and gastrointestinal tract of the developing mouse and that the apical surface expression observed prior to cytodifferentiation in the gastrointestinal tract is also observed in mucus-secreting goblet cells after differentiation. Furthermore, we report, by deciphering the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, that MUC4 is a target gene of CDX-1/-2, HNF-1/-4, FOXA1/A2, and GATA-4, -5, and -6 TFs. Animals—Pregnant female Balb/c mice (Charles River, Maastricht, the Netherlands) were housed at constant temperature and humidity on a 12-h light-dark cycle. The mice had free access to a standard pelleted diet (Special Diets Services, Witham, Essex, England) and tap water. Pregnant females were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, embryos were isolated and the lungs and intestine were excised at embryonic days (E) 15.5, E17.5, E18.5, postnatal days (P) 1.5 and P14.5, and adults. Lungs and intestine were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and prepared for light microscopy.

Relative luciferase activity was expressed as -fold activation in samples transfected with vector expressing the TF of interest compared with empty vector. Each construct or combination was assayed in triplicate in three separate experiments. To study the effects of the TFs on endogenous expression of MUC4 mRNA, cells were transfected with 4 μg of the expression vector of interest or empty control as previously described (27van der Sluis M.

Oligonucleotides used for EMSA (supplemental Table S3) were synthesized by MWG-Biotech. Annealed oligonucleotides were radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]dATP (GE Healthcare) and purified by chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-6 column (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described before (47Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X.R. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Cells (3 × 106) were treated with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and cross-links were quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 0.125 m for 5 min. ChIP experiments were then carried out as previously described (15Piessen G. Jonckheere N. Vincent A. Hemon B. Ducourouble M.P. Copin M.C. Mariette C. Van Seuningen I. Biochem.

Primer information is given in supplemental Table S4. Statistics—All values in this article are mean ± S.D. When indicated, Student’s t test was used for statistical evaluations; a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Expression of Mouse Muc4 during Gastrointestinal and Lung Development—Expression and localization of Muc4 protein was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in stomach, small intestine, colon, and lung (Fig. 1). In the hindstomach, a weak expression was seen at the apical surface of the undifferentiated epithelium at E15.5, in the differentiated monolayer of the glandular stomach at E17.5 and in P1.5 neonates. Expression was stronger at the adult stage. In the small intestine, Muc4 was also present at the apical surface of the pseudostratified epithelium at E15.5. On days E17.5 (not shown) and E18.5 when the pseudostratified epithelium has undergone transition to a differentiated monolayer, Muc4 was confined to goblet cells of the villi and intervillus regions. This pattern was maintained in neonate (P1.5) and adult mice. In the colon, Muc4 was first seen at the apical surface at day E17.5, when goblet cells were not yet present. At E18.5 Muc4 was detected both in brush borders of crypt and surface epithelial cells and in goblet cells. Remarkably, in P1.5 neonates and adults, Muc4 was confined to goblet cells and absent from brush borders. In adults, it was restricted to goblet cells of the upper half of the crypts. In lung, Muc4 was seen at the apical surface of the pseudostratified epithelium at E15.5, of the columnar epithelial cells at days E17.5 and E18.5 (not shown), and the bronchiolar epithelium in neonates (P1.5) and adults. MUC4 Expression in Epithelial Cancer Cell Lines—Because MUC4 has a cell-specific pattern of expression in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, we studied its mRNA expression and promoter regulation in a panel of epithelial cell lines of different origins (respiratory, gastric, colonic, and pancreatic) and phenotypes (enterocyte, mucus-secreting, and undifferentiated colonic cancer cells). MUC4 mRNA was strongly expressed in respiratory NCI-H292, pancreatic CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2, and to a lower extent in gastric KATO-III and intestinal HT-29 5F12 cell lines (Fig. 2A). The basal level of the TFs in the different cell lines is shown in Fig. 2B. Regulation of MUC4 mRNA Expression by Endodermal Transcription Factors—To investigate whether endodermal CDX-1 and -2, HNF-1 and -4, FOXA1/A2, and GATA-4, -5, and -6 TFs regulate MUC4 endogenous expression, knockdown assays were carried out with specific siRNA in CAPAN-1, HT-29 5F12, and KATO-III cell lines that expressed the TFs of interest (supplemental data Fig. S2). The strongest inhibitions of MUC4 mRNA expression were observed with FOXA2, GATA-6, CDX-2, and HNF-1α siRNAs (75–80% inhibition, Fig. 2C). siRNA for HNF-1β and FOXA1 led to a 60% decrease of MUC4 expression, whereas CDX-1, HNF-4α, and GATA-4 siRNA effects were milder (20–30% inhibition). Regulation of endogenous MUC4 expression by HNF-4γ and GATA-5 could not be studied by the siRNA approach because none of the cell lines studied expressed these TFs or expression was extremely low (HNF-4γ in KATO-III). Forced expression of HNF-4γ and GATA-5 in NCI-H292 and CAPAN-2 MUC4-expressing cells led to a 5.5–7.5- and 1.5–2.0-fold increase of MUC4 mRNA, respectively (Fig. 2D). Together, these results demonstrate that CDX, HNF, FOXA, and GATA TFs regulate MUC4 mRNA expression in cancer cell lines of endodermal origin. MUC4 gene expression is under the control of a proximal and a distal promoter (13Perrais M. Pigny P. Ducourouble M.P. Petitprez D. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Van Seuningen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30923-30933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequence showed a high density of putative binding sites for CDX, HNF, FOXA, and GATA TFs in the distal promoter (supplemental data Fig. S3). Three CDX binding sites (T90 and T60) contain the consensus sequence -ATAAAT- for CDX binding. The fourth site T164 is more degenerate. Among the HNF putative binding sites, T144 contains a consensus sequence for TF of the HNF-1 family, whereas T106 resembles a HNF-1 and FOXA binding site. T91 is more degenerate and resembles a FOXA binding site. The two GATA binding sites (T59 and T60) contain the consensus -GATA- binding sequence. To analyze the regulation of MUC4 by these TFs at the promoter level, we studied their transactivating effects on four deletion constructs previously used in the laboratory (13Perrais M. Pigny P.

Two of them (-2781/-2572 and -3135/-2572) contain the TATA box and the transcription initiation site and are transcriptionally active (13Perrais M. Pigny P. Ducourouble M.P. Petitprez D. Porchet N.

Although the molecular basis of this event and the intracellular compartment where it occurs are not yet understood, the association of PrP with cellular membranes and in particular its presence in detergent-resistant microdomains appears to be of critical importance. In addition it appears that scrapie conversion requires membrane-bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked PrP. The GPI anchor may affect either the conformation, the intracellular localization, or the association of the prion protein with specific membrane domains. However, how this occurs is not known. To understand the relevance of the GPI anchor for the cellular behavior of PrP, we have studied the biosynthesis and localization of a PrP version which lacks the GPI anchor attachment signal (PrPΔGPI). We found that PrPΔGPI is tethered to cell membranes and associates to membrane detergent-resistant microdomains but does not assume a transmembrane topology. Differently to PrPC, this protein does not localize at the cell surface but is mainly released in the culture media in a fully glycosylated soluble form. The cellular behavior of anchorless PrP explains why PrPΔGPI Tg mice can be infected but do not show the classical signs of the disorder, thus indicating that the plasma membrane localization of PrPC and/or of the converted scrapie form might be necessary for the development of a symptomatic disease.

PrPSc is able to replicate and propagate itself by transferring its altered conformation to the endogenous PrPC, a cell surface-enriched protein that becomes partially resistant to proteases and accumulates in plaques in the brain (2Horwich A.L. Weissman J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 499-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of PrPC-PrPSc conversion, the intracellular compartment where the conversion occurs, and how the process leads to neurological dysfunction are still very open and debated questions (3Campana V. Sarnataro D. Zurzolo C. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 102-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Several studies indicate that PrPC-PrPSc conversion is a post-translational event that occurs after the protein reaches the cell surface (4Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol.

Indeed, it is possible to impair PrPSc formation in infected cells either by preventing PrPC transport to the plasma membrane (7Lee K.S. Magalhaes A.C. Zanata S.M. Brentani R.R. Martins V.R.

However, these data do not distinguish whether scrapie conversion occurs on the plasma membrane or later during its internalization. In infected cells PrPSc accumulates in late endosomes, and inhibition of endocytosis reduces scrapie production (5Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol.

Although the exact nature of the compartment of prion conversion is still debated, the membrane domains (also called rafts) with which PrP associates seems to be important in the conversion process (3Campana V.

Rafts are membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids that have been proposed to have a central role in many cellular processes (12Zurzolo C. van Meer G. Mayor S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), including membrane sorting and trafficking, cell polarization, and signal transduction (13Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Like other GPI-anchored proteins, PrPC and PrPSc associate with rafts because of the affinity of their GPI anchor for saturated lipid species (16Sarnataro D. Paladino S. Campana V. Grassi J.

In prion-infected N2a cells, perturbation of PrP raft association by modifying the cellular levels of cholesterol affects PrPSc formation (9Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Moreover, removal of PrPC from rafts by the substitution of its GPI anchor with a transmembrane domain prevents the formation of PrPSc (11Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 20Kaneko K. Vey M. Scott M. Pilkuhn S. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

From these observations it also seems evident that scrapie conversion requires membrane-bound GPI-linked PrP. However, the role of the GPI-anchor in prion conversion is still debated. In cell-free experiments, PrP lacking the GPI moiety can be converted to the PrPSc form (21Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35265-35271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas in scrapie-infected cells the absence of the GPI moiety reduces conversion (4Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rogers M. Yehiely F. Scott M. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been recently shown that a PrP mutant lacking the GPI anchor (anchorless PrP or PrPΔGPI) supports scrapie replication in transgenic mice, although the infected mice do not show any of the clinical signs of the disease until death (24Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for these differences between PrPC and PrPΔGPI could be that PrPΔGPI is per se able to sustain conversion into PrPSc but that other factors present in specific compartments of the cell are also required for conversion and for the pathogenesis of the disease. These findings have prompted us to analyze the biosynthesis, intracellular trafficking, and biological properties of an anchorless version of PrP (PrPΔGPI) in transfected cells to better understand the role of the GPI anchor in the behavior of the prion protein. Differently to what was published before, we found that PrPΔGPI is fully glycosylated, but in contrast to the GPI-anchored version, it does not localize on the plasma membrane and is mainly secreted. Interestingly, despite the lack of the GPI anchor, PrPΔGPI associates to intracellular membranes but does not acquire a transmembrane topology. Furthermore, we found that a significant amount of the protein associates to detergent-resistant domains (DRMs), supporting previous evidence that PrPC could associate to lipid rafts in a GPI anchor-independent manner (25Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37241-37248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We propose that the differences in metabolism and intracellular trafficking compared with PrPC are relevant for the development of prion diseases and might lead to a better understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms.

Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and single stable clones were selected by G418 resistance and used for the following experiments. Cell Culture and Drug Treatments—FRT cells stably expressing PrPΔGPI were grown in F-12 Coon’s modified medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Tunicamycin (10 μg/ml) was added to the cell culture medium for 16 h. Mevinolin/βCD and fumonisin B1 treatments were carried out as described elsewhere (16Sarnataro D. Paladino S. Campana V.

Cellular cholesterol levels before and after depletion were determined by a colorimetric assay (Infinity Cholesterol reagent; Sigma) according to the suggested Sigma protocol number 401, as previously described (17Sarnataro D. Campana V. Paladino S. Stornaiuolo M. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4031-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The samples were then read in a spectrophotometer at 550 nm. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 μm), GM6001 (25 μm), and βCD (5 mm) were added to the culture medium for 7 h before collecting cell-free media. Immunoprecipitation—Cells grown in 60- or 100-mm dishes were washed 3 times with and lysed in Triton/DOC buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% DOC, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with protease inhibitor mixture (leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min. Lysates were then precleared with protein-A-Sepharose beads (5 mg/sample) for 30 min and incubated overnight at 4 °C with α-PrP antibody coupled with protein-A-Sepharose beads (10 mg/sample). For media analysis cell media were collected at 7 h or after overnight incubation and immunoprecipitated. The pellets were washed twice with cold lysis buffer and three times with PBS. The samples were then boiled with SDS sample buffer, loaded on polyacrylamide gels, and revealed by Western blotting against PrP and ECL. For direct coupling of antibody to protein A-Sepharose beads, 10 mg/sample of protein A-Sepharose beads was incubated with the antibody for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The beads were then washed and incubated in 20 mm methyl pimelimidate in 0.2 m sodium borate, pH 9.0, for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 0.2 m ethanolamine. Peptide N-glycosidase F, Endoglycosidase H, and Neuraminidase Treatment—PGNaseF, EndoH, and neuraminidase digestions were performed on immunoprecipitated samples. For PGNaseF treatment the immunoprecipitated samples were resuspended and boiled for 5 min in 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol and incubated with PGNaseF (5 units/sample) for 16 h at 37 °C. For EndoH and neuraminidase (5 milliunits/sample) digestion, the immunoprecipitated samples were first boiled for 3 min in 50 μl of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, containing 0.1% SDS and then treated with the specific enzyme for 16 h at 37 °C. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Pulse-Chase Analysis—FRT cells expressing PrPΔGPI and grown on 100-mm dishes were pulsed for 20 min with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and chased for various times at 37 °C, as indicated in Fig. 1C. At the end of the chase times cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed for 20 min on ice in Triton/DOC buffer. PrPΔGPI immunoprecipitation was performed overnight using the α-PrP SAF32 antibody coupled to protein-A-Sepharose beads. The pellets were washed twice with cold lysis buffer and three times with PBS. The samples were then boiled with SDS sample buffer, loaded on 12% polyacrylamide gels, and revealed by phosphorimaging scanning. Assays for Scrapie-like Properties—Proteinase K (PK) digestion and Triton/DOC insolubility assays were performed as previously described (16Sarnataro D. Paladino S. Campana V. Grassi J. Nitsch L.

Fluorescence Microscopy—FRT cells stably expressing PrPΔGPI were grown for 4-5 days both on coverslips and on Transwell filters (not shown), washed with PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.075% saponin, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using specific antibodies. PrPΔGPI was visualized with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, whereas CNX, giantin, and early endosomal antigen 1 were revealed by TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM 510). For lysosome staining, cells were incubated for 1 h with Lysotracker (1:10,000) in complete medium before fixing. Biotinylation Assays—Confluent monolayers on Transwells were biotinylated and processed for immunoprecipitation as previously described (26Zurzolo C. Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To recover the immunoprecipitated PrP, the samples were boiled for 10 min and then loaded on 12% gels and revealed by Western blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Triton X-114 Phase Separation—Cells were lysed in Tris-buffered saline 1% Triton X-114 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. and 1 mm EDTA) for 1 h at 4°C. Post-nuclear supernatants were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C and centrifuged for 1 min at room temperature for phase separation. An aqueous and a detergent phase were collected and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. PrPs were revealed by Western blotting. Topology Assays; Digitonin Permeabilization—FRT cells grown for 4-5 days on coverslips were washed twice with Buffer 1 (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate) and then incubated on ice for 5 min with digitonin (20 μg/ml) in Buffer 1. After washing, coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and, where indicated, permeabilized with 0.075% saponin, processed for indirect immunofluorescence, and analyzed by a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM 510) as described above. PK Protection Assay—Membrane topology of PrPΔGPI was determined as previously described (28Campana V. Sarnataro D. Fasano C. Casanova P. Paladino S. Zurzolo C. J.

The post-nuclear supernatant was divided into three samples; one untreated, the second digested with 250 μg/ml PK for 30 min at 22 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the third digested with PK at the same concentration in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100 (TX-100). Samples were immunoprecipitated both with SAF32 or SAF61 antibodies, divided in two aliquots digested (+) or not (-) with PGNaseF, and analyzed by Western blotting. Sodium Carbonate Extraction—Cells were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose with either 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 11, for 30 min on ice by 10 passages through 26-gauge needles and centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C at 61,000 rpm (in a MLA 130 rotor from TLA 100, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Soluble and insoluble phases were collected and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and PrPs were revealed by Western blotting. DRM Analysis by Sucrose Density Gradients—Control and mevinolin/βCD- and fumonisin B1-treated cells grown to confluence in 150-mm dishes were harvested in cold PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% TX-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), left in ice for 20 min, and passaged 10 times through 22-gauge needles. Lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose (w/v) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, placed at the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (30-5%) in the same buffer, and ultracentrifuged at 200,000 × g for 17 h at 4 °C in an ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor from Beckman Instruments). Twelve fractions were harvested from the top of the gradient. A white light-scattering band, identified in fraction 5 at the interface between 5 and 30% sucrose, contained DRM domains. Samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Lipid Analysis—Aliquots of fraction 5 (800 μl) of sucrose density gradients diluted with 200 μl of lysis buffer were precleared twice with Dynabeads for 2 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with an α-PrP antibody. Immunoprecipitates were recovered using protein A-coupled magnetic beads (30Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11658-11665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). ⅕ of the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Lipids were extracted from the immunoprecipitates and analyzed as described below. Cholesterol was quantified after separation on high performance TLC by visualization with 15% concentrated sulfuric acid in 1-butanol (30Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11658-11665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phospholipids and sphingomyelin were separated by a two-run mono-dimensional high performance TLC using the solvent system chloroform/methanol 9:1 (v/v) followed by the solvent system chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water 30:20:2:1 (v/v/v/v) and quantified after separation on a high performance TLC followed by specific detection with a molybdate reagent. Lipids were quantified by densitometry and compared with known amounts of standard lipids (Molecular Analyst program, Bio-Rad). Preparation of Detergent-free Lipid Rafts—Detergent-free extraction and gradients were performed as previously published (31Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Four 150-mm plates of cells were washed and scraped into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose to which had been added 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min at 250 × g and resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors at final concentrations of 0.2 mm aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm bestatin, 3 μm E-64, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I. The cells were then lysed by passage through a 22-gauge needle 20 times. Lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The resulting post-nuclear supernatant was collected and transferred to a separate tube. The pellet was again lysed by the addition of 1 ml of base buffer plus divalent cations and protease inhibitors followed by sheering 20 times through a needle and syringe. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, the second post-nuclear supernatant was combined with the first. An equal volume (2 ml) of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose containing 50% OptiPrep was added to the combined post-nuclear supernatants and placed in the bottom of a 12-ml centrifuge tube. An 8-ml gradient of 0-20% OptiPrep in base buffer was poured on top of the lysate, which was now 25% in OptiPrep. Gradients were centrifuged for 90 min at 52,000 × g using an SW-41 rotor in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. Gradients were fractionated into 0.67-ml fractions, and the distribution of various proteins was assessed by Western blotting. Differential Centrifugation and Secreted Vesicle Isolation—Cell culture media from 20 × 106 FRT cells was submitted to differential centrifugation in the absence or in the presence of 1% TX-100. Media were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min and at 10,000 × g for 30 min and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pellet and soluble fractions were recovered at each ultracentrifugation step and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. PrPs were analyzed by Western blotting. Expression and Characterization of PrPΔGPI in Transfected FRT Cells—Polarized epithelial FRT (Fischer rat thyroid) cells, previously used to characterize the exocytic pathway of PrPC (16Sarnataro D. Paladino S. Campana V. Grassi J. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Sarnataro D. Campana V. Paladino S. Stornaiuolo M. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4031-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and of an inherited pathological PrP mutant (28Campana V. Sarnataro D. Fasano C. Casanova P. Paladino S. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), were stably transfected with a PrP version lacking the GPI anchor attachment signal (PrPΔGPI) (23Rogers M. Yehiely F. Scott M. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although PrPΔGPI was previously shown to be predominantly unglycosylated in both cells and animals (23Rogers M. Yehiely F. Scott M. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E.

Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), in our hands it migrated as three major bands corresponding to unglycosylated (U), monoglycosylated (M), and highly diglycosylated isoforms (H), similarly to PrPC (Fig. 1A). This discrepancy could be explained by different conformations of the different isoforms of PrPΔGPI or by particular sugar modifications that could mask the epitopes recognized by some antibodies. Indeed, although all isoforms of PrPC were equally well immunoprecipitated by the three different antibodies used (α-N-terminal (SAF32, Fig. 1, lane 1), α-C-terminal (SAF61, lane 3), and α-3F4 tag (PRI308, lane 2)), in the case of PrPΔGPI only SAF32 and SAF61 antibodies recognized all glycoforms, whereas PRI308 specifically recognized only the unglycosylated form (Fig. 1A). Because the α-3F4 antibody recognizing the same epitope of PRI308 was previously used to characterize PrPΔGPI (23Rogers M. Yehiely F. Scott M. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), this could explain why it was previously thought to be unglycosylated (23Rogers M. Yehiely F. Scott M. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In support of our findings, inhibition of N-glycosylation either with PGNaseF digestion or tunicamycin treatment reduced PrPΔGPI to a single band corresponding to the unglycosylated PrP isoform (Fig. 1B) similar to the wild-type protein as previously shown (28Campana V. Sarnataro D. Fasano C. Casanova P. Paladino S. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To characterize the oligosaccharide chains of PrPΔGPI, we performed a deglycosylation assay using either EndoH or neuraminidase (27Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21479-21487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B).

https://openalex.org/W2091338237,"Regulation of proteolysis is a critical element of the host immune system and plays an important role in the induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory reactions in response to infection. Some bacterial species take advantage of these processes and recruit host proteinases to their surface in order to counteract the host attack. Here we show that Thrombin-activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI), a zinc-dependent procarboxypeptidase, binds to the surface of group A streptococci of an M41 serotype. The interaction is mediated by the streptococcal collagen-like surface proteins A and B (SclA and SclB), and the streptococcal-associated TAFI is then processed at the bacterial surface via plasmin and thrombin-thrombomodulin. These findings suggest an important role for TAFI in the modulation of host responses by streptococci. Regulation of proteolysis is a critical element of the host immune system and plays an important role in the induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory reactions in response to infection. Some bacterial species take advantage of these processes and recruit host proteinases to their surface in order to counteract the host attack. Here we show that Thrombin-activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI), a zinc-dependent procarboxypeptidase, binds to the surface of group A streptococci of an M41 serotype. The interaction is mediated by the streptococcal collagen-like surface proteins A and B (SclA and SclB), and the streptococcal-associated TAFI is then processed at the bacterial surface via plasmin and thrombin-thrombomodulin. These findings suggest an important role for TAFI in the modulation of host responses by streptococci. Streptococcus pyogenes is an important human Gram-positive pathogen that mainly causes throat and skin infections. Although these conditions are normally superficial and self-limiting, they can occasionally turn into invasive and life-threatening diseases such as sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis (1Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). In order to colonize the human host, S. pyogenes expresses so-called adhesins, which allow the bacterium to attach to the extracellular matrix or to cell surface structures. So far, at least 20 adhesins have been described in S. pyogenes, including for instance M proteins and protein F1 (for a review see Ref. 2Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The two related streptococcal collagen-like surface proteins SclA and SclB, which were first described in 2000 and 2001, also belong to this family (3Rasmussen M. Eden A. Björck L. Infect.

Although their extracellular parts differ in size and primary sequence, SclA and SclB are organized into a similar “lollipop”-like structure. The stalk is made up of a collagen-like region with varying numbers of GXY repeats, whereas the globular head consists of a non-collagenous amino-terminal variable region. Both proteins have a conserved signal peptide and a carboxyl-terminal region that is attached to the cell wall via an LPATG anchor. The collagen-like regions of Scls have been shown to mediate adhesion to human lung epithelial cells (5Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Ireland R.M. Reid S.D. Adams G.G. Musser J.M.

Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that SclA from M type 41 activates the collagen receptor α2β1 integrin on fibroblasts (8Humtsoe J.O. Kim J.K. Xu Y. Keene D.R. Hook M. Lukomski S. Wary K.K. J. Biol.

Proteolysis plays an important role in host parasite interactions. Although some immune defense mechanisms such as complement, coagulation, and fibrinolysis are dependent on their activation by limited proteolysis, bacteria have evolved strategies to benefit from these host systems by assembling host proteinases at their surface. Probably the best studied interaction in this respect is the binding of plasmin(ogen) to the bacterial surface, which is thought to be a mechanism for the bacteria to trigger their dissemination in the human host (10Sun H. Ringdahl U. Homeister J.W. Fay W.P. Engleberg N.C. Yang A.Y. Rozek L.S. Wang X. Sjöbring U. Ginsburg D. Science. 2004; 305: 1283-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar).

The protein is synthesized in the liver and secreted into plasma, where it circulates as a zymogen at concentrations between 60 and 275 nm (11Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1566-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The most potent activator of TAFI is the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex (12Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), but plasmin, trypsin, and neutrophil elastase have also been reported to function as activators (13Marx P.F.

Active TAFI (TAFIa) has anti-fibrinolytic properties as the enzyme removes carboxyl-terminal lysine residues from fibrin, thereby attenuating accelerated plasmin formation. Apart from its role in regulating fibrinolysis, TAFI can also modulate inflammatory responses. For instance, TAFIa has been shown to inactivate the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a by removing their carboxyl-terminal arginine residues (16Campbell W.D. Lazoura E. Okada N. Okada H. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 46: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that TAFI is involved in the conversion of the fibrinopeptide B (FPB), a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, to its inactive metabolite des-Arg FPB (17Brummel K.E. Butenas S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22862-22870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In another study, it was found that the removal of the carboxylterminal arginine from thrombin-cleaved osteopontin by TAFI impairs the adhesive function of the protein (18Myles T. Nishimura T. Yun T.H. Nagashima M. Morser J. Patterson A.J. Pearl R.G. Leung L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51059-51067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, TAFI also has pro-inflammatory properties, because it can convert bradykinin into desArg9bradykinin, a selective agonist of the kinin B1 receptor, which has an important role in chronic inflammatory processes (16Campbell W.D. Lazoura E. Okada N. Okada H. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 46: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Shinohara T. Sakurada C. Suzuki T. Takeuchi O. Campbell W. Ikeda S. Okada N. Okada H.

However, the pathophysiological effects of these modifications are not completely understood. thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor colony-forming unit peptostreptococcal albumin binding phosphate-buffered saline streptococcal collagen-like surface protein The present study was undertaken to investigate the interaction between TAFI and S. pyogenes. Here we find that streptococci of serotype 41 are able to bind TAFI and that activation of TAFI can occur on the bacterial surface, which might be an important mechanism for bacteria to modulate inflammatory reactions of the host. Reagents—TAFI and PAB were produced and purified as described elsewhere (20Marx P.F. Hackeng T.M. Dawson P.E. Griffin J.H. Meijers J.C. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12410-12415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21de Chateau M. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12147-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasminogen and plasmin were purchased from Sigma, and thrombin was from Chemicon, Malmö, Sweden. Oligonucleotides were obtained from DNA Technology A/S, Aarhus, Denmark. Rabbit lung thrombomodulin was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), hippuryl-arginine and H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). For the TAFI activity assays, thrombin was used that was a generous gift from Dr. W. Kisiel (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM), while plasmin and t-PA (actilyse) were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Bacteria and Culturing Conditions—S. pyogenes AP strains, obtained from the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (Prague, Czech Republic), were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (BD Biosciences) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To express SclA and SclB recombinantly, the Escherichia coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) was used. Bacteria were grown in Luria Bertani broth (1% (w/v) tryptone (BD Biosciences), 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK), and 1% (w/v) NaCl (Merck), supplemented with 1% (w/v) glucose (Prolabo, Fontenay sous bois Cedex, France) and kanamycin 50 μg/ml (Sigma). Radiolabeling—Proteins were labeled with 125I with Iodo-Beads (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding Assays—Overnight cultures of bacteria were washed three times in PBS with 0.02% sodium-azide and 0.05% Tween, adjusted to 0.02–2 × 109 CFU/ml, and incubated with 40,000 cpm of 125I-labeled TAFI, plasmin, or thrombin for 1 h at room temperature. Bacteria were washed once in PBS, 0.02% sodiumazide and 0.05% Tween, and the radioactivity of the cell pellets was detected with a γ counter (PerkinElmer). For competition experiments, AP41 bacteria (1 × 107 CFU/ml) were incubated with 50,000 cpm of 125I-TAFI in the presence or absence of 40 μg/ml rSclA/AP/M41, rSclB/AP/M41, or protein PAB. Alternatively, bacteria were incubated with 50,000 cpm of 125I-plasmin or 125I-thrombin in the absence or presence of 12.5–100 μg/ml of unlabeled plasmin or 100–800 μg/ml of unlabeled thrombin, respectively. Bacteria were washed, and bound 125I-labeled ligand was determined as above. Protein Sequence Analysis—TAFI was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech, Sollentuna, Sweden) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Surface proteins of S. pyogenes AP41 were removed by cleavage with CNBr as described (22Faulmann E.L. Boyle M.D. Prep. Biochem. 1991; 21: 75-86PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were washed and resuspended in PBS (2 ml of PBS/g bacteria, wet weight) and mixed with an equal volume of CNBr 30 mg/ml in 0.2 m HCl. After incubation for 15 h on rotation at room temperature, cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtersterilized, dialyzed against 0.1 m HCl, neutralized with 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and finally incubated with TAFI-coupled Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.0. Eluted fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were excised and sent to Eurosequence (Groningen, The Netherlands) for identification by internal sequencing. The peptide sequences generated by internal sequencing were matched against streptococcal proteins in a BLAST search. PCR and Sequencing—Genomic DNA was obtained by boiling bacteria in H2O for 5 min. PCR was performed in a Mastercycler (Eppendorf) using Taq polymerase and buffers from Saveen & Werner AB (Malmö, Sweden). dNTPs were from Fermentas (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator v3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers with the following sequences were used: SclA forward, CAA CAT ATG TTG ACA TCA AAG CAC, SclA reverse, GGG TTG GAT CCC TAA CCA GTT GCT G; SclB forward 1, ATA CAA AAA GAA CTT TAC AAT CAT TC, SclB forward 2, CTT AAA GAG TTA AAT ATG TTT G, and SclB reverse, GAT TGG ATC CTT AGC CTG TTG CTG GC. Recombinant Protein Expression—SclA and SclB from the AP41 strain were PCR-amplified with the following primer pairs: SclA forward, CAC CGA TAT CTG GGA CCA GGA GC, SclA reverse, GCT CTC AAG TTG CTG GTA GAC GTC; SclB forward, CAC CGA TGG CGA AGG TAT CAG AAA G, and SclB reverse, GTT TCT CAT GTT GCT GGC AAT TG. The PCR products were cloned into the pET200 TOPO vector (Invitrogen), resulting in His-tagged fusion proteins. The vector was amplified in E. coli TOP 10 cells and then transformed into E. coli of the BL21 Star (DE3) strain for protein expression. Recombinant proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind-Sepharose (Novagen, Madison, WI). Recombinant SclA from the M41 strain MGAS6183 and rScls from the M28 strain MGAS6274 were produced and purified as described previously (23Han R. Zwiefka A. Caswell C.C. Xu Y. Keene D.R. Lukomska E. Zhao Z. Hook M. Lukomski S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 72: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Slot Blot Analysis—Different amounts of recombinant SclA and B from different strains were applied to the wells of a MilliBlot (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and transferred to a methanol-activated Immobulone Transfer Membrane (Millipore) by gentle suction. After blocking in VBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium-5.5-diethylbarbiturate, pH 7.35) supplemented with 0.25% (w/v) gelatin and 0.25% (v/v) Tween 20 for 4 × 10 min, the membrane was incubated with 125I-labeled TAFI (2 × 105 cpm/ml) in VBS with 0.1% (w/v) gelatin overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then washed in PBS 0.25% (w/v) gelatin and 0.25% (v/v) Tween 20 and exposed to an x-ray film (AGFA, Mortsel, Belgium) for 10 days. Binding Studies Using a BIAcore 2000 Biosensor System—Recombinant AP41 SclA and SclB were immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip using the amine coupling kit according to the supplier's recommendation (Biacore AB). SclA and SclB were applied in 10 mm NaAc, pH 3.1. Immobilization of SclA on the chip resulted in an increase of the resonance signal by ∼400 resonance units and with SclB of ∼440 resonance units. Binding studies were done using 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% P20, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 25 °C. Different concentrations of TAFI (0–2 μm) were injected for 3 min. The KD values were calculated using the steady-state model in the BiaEvaluation software. TAFI Cleavage—125I-labeled TAFI (2 × 106 cpm/ml) was incubated in the absence or presence of S. pyogenes AP41 bacteria (1 × 108 CFU/ml in PBS containing 0.25% (v/v) Tween 20, final concentration) together with different concentrations of thrombin and thrombomodulin (5–100 nm of each protein) at 37 °C for 10 min or with plasmin (0.5–10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. Bacteria were then washed once in PBS with 0.25% (v/v) Tween 20, resuspended in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris, 4% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 2‰ (w/v) Bromophenol blue), and boiled for 5 min. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel along with the samples incubated without bacteria. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Alternatively, AP41 bacteria (1 × 108 CFU/ml in PBS containing 0.25% (v/v) Tween 20, final concentration) were preincubated with thrombin-thrombomodulin (100 nm of each protein) or plasmin 10 μg/ml for 1 h on ice. Unbound proteins were removed by a washing step. Bacteria were then incubated with 125I-TAFI (200,000 cpm) at 37 °C for 15 min (thrombin-thrombomodulin) or 30 min (plasmin) followed by a centrifugation step. Supernatants were collected, and cell pellets were subsequently washed and resuspended in SDS sample buffer as described above. Supernatants and proteins recovered from the bacterial pellets were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed as described above. Negative Staining Transmission Electron Microscopy—SclA, SclB, and TAFI, as well as TAFI in complex with SclA or SclB, were analyzed by negative staining and electron microscopy as described previously (24Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). TAFI and rScls were mixed in Tris-buffered saline and allowed to react for 30 min at 4 °C. Final sample concentrations were 20 nm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (Tris-buffered saline). Subsequently, 5-μl aliquots were adsorbed onto carbon-coated grids for 1 min, washed with two drops of water, and stained on two drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. Specimens were observed in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. Determination of the Stability of TAFIa in the Presence of rScls—The assay was basically done as described (25Schatteman K.A. Goossens F.J. Scharpé S.S. Neels H.M. Hendriks D.F. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the presence of rSclA/AP/M41 and rSclB/AP/M41 on the rate of TAFIa inactivation, TAFI (12.5 nm) (all concentrations are final concentrations) and rScls (0–0.18 μm) were added to a premix of thrombin (16 nm) and thrombomodulin (32 nm) in the presence of CaCl2 (5 mm), in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0/0.1%, bovine serum albumin. This mixture was incubated for 1 min at 37 °C before the thrombin activity was stopped by adding H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone, while the mixture remained at 37 °C to allow spontaneous TAFIa inactivation. At several time points, 20-μl samples were withdrawn and added to 50 μl of the substrate hippuryl-arginine (21.4 mm). After 30 min of incubation with the substrate at 37 °C, substrate conversion was stopped by adding 50 μlof1 m HCl. Then, o-methyl hippuric acid (1.7 μm) was added as an internal standard, both o-methyl hippuric acid and hippuric acid were extracted using a Solid Phase Extraction unit according to the supplier's recommendation (Waters Oasis, Wexford, Ireland), and samples were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described (25Schatteman K.A. Goossens F.J. Scharpé S.S. Neels H.M. Hendriks D.F. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The TAFIa activity is expressed in units/liter. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 μmol of substrate/min at 37 °C under the conditions described (25Schatteman K.A. Goossens F.J. Scharpé S.S. Neels H.M. Hendriks D.F. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Influence of Scls on TAFI Activation—The assay was done as described (26Willemse J. Leurs J. Verkerk R. Hendriks D. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 340: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In a microtiterplate, 40 μl of reaction mixture, 20 μl of TAFI (100 nm), and 20 μlof rSclA/AP/M41 or rSclB/AP/M41 (0–0.45 μm) were mixed and prewarmed to 37 °C. The reaction mixture was composed of P-enolpyruvate (2 mm) (all concentrations are final concentrations in the assay), ATP (2.7 mm), NADH (0.5 mm), arginine kinase (21 units/liter), pyruvate kinase/dehydrogenase, and hippuryl-arginine (5 mm). The activation mixture contained thrombin (8 nm), thrombomodulin (16 nm), and CaCl2 (5 mm) or plasmin (0.36 units/ml). Volumes were adjusted with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.01% Tween 20. The reactions were started by adding 20 μl of TAFI (100 nm). TAFI activation was followed over time as a loss of NADH absorbance at 340 nm in a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA). Clot-Lysis Assay—The clot-lysis assay was performed essentially as described previously (27Mosnier L.O. von dem Borne P.A. Meijers J.C. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, 47 μl of citrated, pooled, human plasma (pooled normal plasma) was mixed with various concentrations of TAFI and rSclA/AP/M41 or rSclB/AP/M41 (0–0.45 μm) (all concentrations are final concentrations in the assay) in a 96-well microtiter plate. The experiments were done in the presence or absence of carboxypeptidase inhibitor (12 μm). The volumes were adjusted to 65 μl with HBS (25 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. A mixture (35 μl) of a thousand-fold dilution of Innovin, CaCl2 (17 mm), and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (actilyse, 0.3 ng/ml) in HBS/0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, was added to the plasma and turbidity was measured in time at 37 °C at 405 nm in a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The clot-lysis time was defined as the time difference between half-maximal lysis and half-maximal clotting. TAFI Binds to Collagen-like Surface Proteins from S. pyogenes—To investigate the interaction between TAFI and streptococci, the binding of 125I-TAFI to twelve different streptococcal serotypes was tested. Fig. 1 shows that the strains displayed varying degrees of TAFI binding, with the AP41 strain being the most efficient. Based on these results, the AP41 strain was chosen for further characterization. To identify the streptococcal receptor(s) involved in TAFI binding, surface proteins of the AP41 strain were solubilized with CNBr and incubated with TAFI immobilized to Sepharose. Following a washing step, bound proteins were eluted from the column, separated on SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie staining. Fig. 2A shows that a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼35 kDa was recovered. The band was excised from the gel and further processed by internal sequencing. Two peptides were generated, both of which shared 90% homology with streptococcal collagen-like surface protein A (SclA) from an M41 strain (Table 1). All group A streptococcal serotypes tested so far carry the genes coding for SclA and SclB. As previous studies have shown that the extracellular domains of the two proteins differ significantly from each other and also vary within serotypes, we decided to sequence both genes from the AP41 strain. As expected, the results show that the deduced nucleotide sequences of the two peptides (Table 1) were found in SclA, but not in SclB.FIGURE 2Isolation of a TAFI-binding protein from S. pyogenes. A, surface proteins from the AP41 strain of S. pyogenes were solubilized with CNBr as described under “Experimental Procedures” and incubated with TAFI-coupled Sepharose. After washing the Sepharose with PBS, bound proteins were eluted and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The figure shows a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel with solubilized surface proteins from AP41 (lane 1) and eluted proteins from the TAFI-coupled Sepharose (lane 2). The arrow indicates the protein band that was subjected to internal sequencing.

Open table in a new tab To study the interaction between Scls and TAFI at the protein level, the extracellular part of SclA (rSclA/AP/M41) and SclB (rSclB/AP/M41) from the AP41 strain were recombinantly expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2B shows that the apparent molecular masses of the two proteins were slightly higher than expected, which was also reported when recombinantly expressed Scls from other serotypes were examined by SDS electrophoresis (3Rasmussen M. Eden A. Björck L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6370-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Binding of TAFI to purified Scls was studied using the BIA-core biosensor system. Analysis of the binding curves (Fig. 3, A and B) showed that the interactions did not follow a one-to-one stoichiometry model. The KD for steady state binding of TAFI to SclA was 215 ± 31 nm and to SclB 253 ± 37 nm. For further binding studies, rSclA/AP/M41 and rSclB/AP/M41 were immobilized on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with 125I-TAFI. Moreover, SclA from the M41 strain 6183 (rSclA/176/M41) and the M28 strain 6274 (rSclA/161/M28) as well as SclB from that M28 strain (rSclB/163/M28) were also applied to the membrane. After a washing step, bound 125I-TAFI was detected by exposing the membrane to an x-ray film. Fig. 3C shows that rSclA/AP/M41 binds more efficiently to TAFI than rSclB/AP/M41. Interestingly, rSclA/176/M41 derived from another M41 strain bound TAFI to a similar degree as rSclA/AP/M41, whereas rSclA/161/M28 and rSclB/163/M28 showed no interaction. The latter observation is in accordance with the finding that streptococci of the AP28 strain displayed only poor TAFI binding properties (Fig. 1). To further establish the role of Scls in the binding of TAFI to S. pyogenes, AP41 bacteria were incubated with 125I-TAFI in the absence or presence of recombinant Scls. As a control, the surface protein PAB from Finegoldia magna was used. PAB had no influence on TAFI binding, whereas rSclA/AP/M41 and rSclB/AP/M41 reduced TAFI binding 84 and 42%, respectively (Fig. 3D). No additional effect was seen with both proteins in combination (data not shown). To visualize the interaction of rSclA/AP/M41 and rSclB/AP/M41 with TAFI, negative staining and transmission electron microscopy were employed. Fig. 4, A and C, shows that rSclA/AP/M41 displayed a characteristic lollipop-like structure with a globular head and a tail as has also been described for other Scls (9Han R. Caswell C.C. Lukomska E.

When incubating TAFI with rSclA/AP/M41, the carboxypeptidase was frequently (>95%) localized close to the heads of SclA (Fig. 4, D and F), and this was also found when the interaction between rSclB/AP/M41 and TAFI was investigated (data not shown). Interestingly, similar findings were recently reported when the binding of ApoB100 to SclA was analyzed (9Han R. Caswell C.C. Lukomska E. Keene D.R. Pawlowski M. Bujnicki J.M. Kim J.K. Lukomski S.

Classically, RB functions to repress E2F-mediated transcription and inhibit cell cycle progression. Consequently, RB ablation leads to loss of cell cycle control and aberrant expression of E2F target genes. Emerging evidence indicates a role for RB in maintenance of genomic stability. Here, mouse adult fibroblasts were utilized to demonstrate that aberrant DNA content in RB-deficient cells occurs concomitantly with an increase in levels and chromatin association of DNA replication factors. Furthermore, following exposure to nocodazole, RB-proficient cells arrest with 4 n DNA content, whereas RB-deficient cells bypass the mitotic block, continue DNA synthesis, and accumulate cells with higher ploidy and micronuclei. Under this condition, RB-deficient cells also retain high levels of tethered replication factors, MCM7 and PCNA, indicating that DNA replication occurs in these cells under nonpermissive conditions. Exogenous expression of replication factors Cdc6 or Cdt1 in RB-proficient cells does not recapitulate the RB-deficient cell phenotype. However, ectopic E2F expression in RB-proficient cells elevated ploidy and bypassed the response to nocodazole-induced cessation of DNA replication in a manner analogous to RB loss. Collectively, these results demonstrate that deregulated S phase control is a key mechanism by which RB-deficient cells acquire elevated ploidy.

Cell Res. 1997; 237: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In quiescent, senescent, or differentiated cells, RB is hypophosphorylated, wherein it interacts with a host of cellular proteins to repress transcription of genes required for cell cycle progression (4Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Specifically, RB can interact with the E2F family of transcription factors and either directly inhibit transcription of cell cycle genes or mediate transcriptional repression through the recruitment of co-repressors (e.g. HDAC1 or SWI/SNF) (5Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 6Giacinti C. Giordano A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5220-5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). During progression into the cell cycle, RB is inactivated by phosphorylation, thereby disrupting the RB-mediated transcriptional repressor complexes (7Ma D. Zhou P. Harbour J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, it is widely accepted that RB functions to regulate cell cycle transitions, particularly relating to entry into S phase. Recent studies have identified roles for RB in modulating DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle (8Wikman H. Kettunen E. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2006; 6: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2002; 14: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 10Angus S.P.

Wilkie S. Mittnacht S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DNA replication requires the sequential assembly of a prereplication complex (pre-RC) that comprises multiple proteins, including the origin recognition complex, Cdc6 (cell division cycle 6) protein, Cdt1 (cell division transition 1 protein), and the minichromosome maintenance family of proteins (MCM2 to -7) (12Bell S.P.

Together, assembly of the prereplication complex on chromatin specifies origins that are competent for the initiation of DNA replication (15Stillman B. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The regulation of pre-RC assembly is tightly controlled and is a critical means through which DNA replication is restricted to a single round per cell cycle (17Blow J.J. Dutta A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 18Machida Y.J. Hamlin J.L. Dutta A.

Subsequent to origin activation, additional factors are recruited to initiate DNA replication (e.g. Replication Protein A and primase) (20Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). As replication forks mature, DNA polymerases (e.g. DNA polymerase delta) and associated processivity factors (e.g. proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)) are recruited to facilitate replication of the genome (21Diffley J.F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R778-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 22Diffley J.F. Labib K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 869-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The influence of RB on the functional activity of the pre-RC remains unclear. Studies utilizing overexpression of active alleles of RB demonstrate that RB does not a priori inhibit pre-RC assembly. Rather, it functions downstream to actively inhibit the retention of PCNA within the replication machinery (23Sever-Chroneos Z. Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Wan H. Todorov I. Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4032-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additionally, other studies have identified a role for RB in the maintenance of genome integrity. The impact of RB loss on genomic instability was initially observed in HPV-infected fibroblasts, where E7-medated inactivation of RB led to impaired chromosomal integrity (24White A.E. Livanos E.M. Tlsty T.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies show that cellular stresses, such as DNA damage or exposure to cytotoxic compounds, coupled with RB loss also elevate cell ploidy (25Avni D. Yang H. Martelli F. Hofmann F.

Polyploidy is a likely precursor of aneuploidy, which in turn is a hallmark of most tumors (30Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 31Sen S.

Although several studies report the effect of RB loss on cell proliferation and its impact on cancer, few studies document the consequence of RB deficiency on DNA replication control and its subsequent effect on cancer. It is known that loss of RB enables aberrant DNA replication in the presence of DNA damage or under conditions of mitotic blockade (36Eguchi T. Takaki T. Itadani H. Kotani H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37Bosco E.E. Knudsen E.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1581-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Such aberrant replication is linked with secondary forms of DNA damage and has been hypothesized to compromise genome integrity (27Khan S.H. Wahl G.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 396-401PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mayhew C.N. Perkin L.M. Zhang X. Sage J. Jacks T. Knudsen E.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4107-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Mayhew C.N. Bosco E.E. Solomon D.A. Knudsen E.S. Angus S.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 281: 3-16PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these effects involve a direct action of RB on chromatin or indirect effects in transcriptional control have yet to be conclusively determined. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which RB loss bypasses normal controls over replication, the critical effectors in this process, and how they contribute to tumorigenesis are unknown. Given that RB controls replication, which in turn determines cell ploidy, it is critical to determine the consequences of RB loss on these phenomena. In the present study, we investigated the impact of RB loss on the DNA replication machinery and show that RB deficiency has profound effects on the establishment of the prereplication complex and enables inappropriate rounds of DNA replication. Furthermore, the consequences of RB loss on cell ploidy can be phenocopied by exogenous E2F expression in RB-proficient cells. The current findings indicate that transcriptional control is important in the deregulation of DNA replication that is observed upon RB loss and that deregulation of DNA synthesis resulting from loss of RB contributes to genomic imbalance. Isolation of Primary RbloxP/loxP Mouse Adult Fibroblasts (MAFs), Cell Culture, and Adenoviral Infections—Primary fibroblasts were isolated from the peritoneal fascia of Rb floxed mice and cultured as previously described (29Mayhew C.N. Perkin L.M. Zhang X. Sage J. Jacks T. Knudsen E.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4107-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All cells used in this study were between passages 2 and 4 unless indicated otherwise. Primary RbloxP/loxP MAFs were infected with adenoviruses expressing the control GFP vector alone (Ad-GFP) or GFP and Cre recombinase (Ad-GFP-CRE). The Ad-GFP-CRE infection rendered conditional RB knock-out cells due to the activity of the Cre recombinase. After infection, cells were cultured at least 3 days before experimentation. Detection of Recombination and RB Knockdown in MAFs—Genomic DNA was isolated from either GFP (RB-proficient) or GFP-CRE (RB-deficient) MAFs using the Dneasy kit (Qiagen). To detect Cre-mediated recombination, PCR analysis of Rb exon 19 was done as described previously (39Mayhew C.N. Bosco E.E. Fox S.R. Okaya T. Tarapore P. Schwemberger S.J. Babcock G.F. Lentsch A.B. Fukasawa K. Knudsen E.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4568-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the Rb deletion was also confirmed by Western blot analysis of target protein deregulation. BrdUrd/Propidium Iodide Flow Cytometry Analysis Staining—RB-proficient and RB-deficient MAFs were plated (2 × 106 cells/10-cm2 dish) in 10-cm2 dishes. Eighty percent confluent cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole or Me2SO control. After 24 h, the cells were washed and labeled with BrdUrd (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h, trypsinized, and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. Fixed cells were resuspended in 2 n HCl for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.5% FBS plus 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS. Anti-BrdUrd-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Pharmingen) was added to the cell suspension and incubated for 30 min. Propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and RNase A (80 μg/ml) were added to the cell suspension and allowed to stain overnight at 4 °C. Samples were analyzed for BrdUrd/propidium iodide (PI) by bivariate flow cytometry analysis. Flow Cytometry—RB-proficient and RB-deficient MAFs were plated as described above. Two days post-plating, cells were treated with either Me2SO or 100 ng/ml nocodazole (Calbiochem) for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized (both the floating and the adherent cells were collected) and fixed with 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were treated with RNase (80 μg/ml) and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). Cells were processed for flow cytometric analysis as previously described (39Mayhew C.N. Bosco E.E. Fox S.R. Okaya T. Tarapore P. Schwemberger S.J. Babcock G.F. Lentsch A.B. Fukasawa K. Knudsen E.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4568-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Modfit software was used to determine the percent of cells with >4 n DNA content. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—RB-proficient (GFP) and RB-deficient (GFP-CRE or CRE) MAFs were plated (2 × 106/ 10-cm2 dish). Cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (supplemented with protease inhibitors), sonicated, and quantified (Pierce). Lysates were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Specific proteins MCM7, PCNA, Cdc6, lamin B, Cdk4, cyclin A, cyclin E, Replication Protein A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Cdt1 (a gift from Dr. Jeanne Cook) were detected by Western blotting. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—Cells were plated on coverslips and treated with Me2SO or nocodazole (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cells were washed and labeled with BrdUrd (Amersham Biosciences) for 6 h to detect DNA synthesis. Labeled cells were probed with anti-BrdUrd antibody as described previously (40Bosco E.E. Mayhew C.N. Hennigan R.F. Sage J. Jacks T. Knudsen E.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Biochemical Fractionation to Isolate Chromatin-bound Proteins—The isolation of chromatin-associated proteins was performed as described previously (41Braden W.A. Lenihan J.M. Lan Z. Luce K.S. Zagorski W. Bosco E. Reed M.F. Cook J.G. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7667-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with Me2SO or nocodazole (100 ng/ml), washed with PBS, and trypsinized. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold cytoskeletal (CSK) buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% Triton X-100). Total cell lysates were generated by lysing one-third of the cells in CSK buffer. The remaining cells were extracted twice with cold CSK buffer on ice. The suspension was then centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in CSK buffer. All samples were quantified and processed for blotting of the indicated proteins. Immunofluorescence Assay to Visualize Chromatin-bound Replication Factors—Cells were plated on coverslips, and one set was utilized to detect total proteins. The second set was subjected to CSK extraction to retain only the chromatin-bound proteins, as previously described (41Braden W.A. Lenihan J.M. Lan Z. Luce K.S. Zagorski W. Bosco E. Reed M.F. Cook J.G. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7667-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All cells were methanol-fixed and probed with the indicated antibodies. Cells were visualized using a fluorescent microscope. Ectopic Expression of Ad-Cdc6, Ad-Cdt1, Ad-E2F1, and Ad-E2F2 in RB-proficient Cells and Dominant Negative E2F-A/B in RB-deficient Cells—GFP cells (RB-proficient) were plated and infected with virus, at least 1 × 1011 plaque-forming units/10-cm2 dish for 24–30 h, as previously described (41Braden W.A. Lenihan J.M. Lan Z. Luce K.S. Zagorski W. Bosco E. Reed M.F. Cook J.G. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7667-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with Me2SO control or nocodazole and processed for flow cytometry, CSK extraction, and Western blotting as described above. RB-deficient cells were plated (2 × 106/10-cm2 dish) and transfected with either H2B-GFP plasmid or H2B-GFP and E2F-A/B using Fugene transfection agent. Forty-eight hours later, cells were treated with Me2SO control or nocodazole (100 ng/ml). Twenty-four hours after treatment, cells were labeled with BrdUrd for 6 h and processed for BrdUrd incorporation as described above. Microscopy and Digital Image Acquisition—A DIX digital camera (Nikon) attached to a Microphot FXA upright microscope (Nikon) with a ×63 or ×100 dippable Zeiss objective was used to visualize and photograph cells. NikonView5 software was used to transfer images. For the immunofluorescence images, an ORCA-ER Hamamatsu Avioplan 2 imaging microscope was used with a ×100 dippable Zeiss objective and Hoechst and Rhodamine Zeiss filters. Metamorph software was used to acquire images. RB Loss Deregulates Expression of Replication Factors and Results in Aberrant Ploidy—To investigate the acute loss of RB on replication control, MAFs were cultured from the peritoneal fascia of RbloxP/loxP mice. The cells were then infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing either GFP vector alone (Ad-GFP) or GFP and Cre-recombinase (Ad-GFP-CRE). The infection of these cells with Ad-GFP-CRE resulted in the efficient deletion exon 19 of Rb, as detected by genomic PCR (Fig. 1A). This deletion event is well characterized to produce an unstable, nonfunctional protein, resulting in efficient ablation of the RB protein (39Mayhew C.N. Bosco E.E. Fox S.R. Okaya T. Tarapore P. Schwemberger S.J. Babcock G.F. Lentsch A.B. Fukasawa K. Knudsen E.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4568-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this manner, MAFs that are RB-proficient (GFP) and RB-deficient (CRE) were obtained. Consistent with previous observations (29Mayhew C.N. Perkin L.M. Zhang X. Sage J. Jacks T. Knudsen E.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4107-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the acute loss of RB results in a 7-fold increase in the percentage of cells that exhibit >4 n DNA content (Fig. 1, B (flow cytometry trace) and C (combined average from three experiments)). Coordinate analyses of DNA replication (via BrdUrd incorporation) and DNA content reveal that the 2 n population exhibits pronounced BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 1D). Since the majority of these cells are cycling, diploid cells, there is a high degree of BrdUrd incorporation in the 2 n fraction. However, a small fraction of these cells have begun to acquire >4 n DNA content (Fig. 1D, boxed region); among these cells, a greater proportion of RB-deficient cells are BrdUrd-positive when compared with RB-proficient cells (Fig. 1D, boxed regions, compare BrdUrd-positive cells with >4 n DNA in GFP and CRE populations). This result, coupled with the discrete peaks at 4 and 8 n (Fig. 1B), suggests that the increased ploidy is the result of a complete round of DNA replication. To determine if aberrant DNA replication in RB-deficient cells was associated with changes in DNA replication factors, the levels of these factors were determined by immunoblotting. In RB-deficient cells, components of the prereplicative complex, such as Cdc6, Cdt1, and MCM7 were greatly increased as compared with RB-proficient cells (Fig. 1E, compare lanes 1 and 2). In addition, levels of other S phase-associated factors, such as PCNA, cyclin A, cyclin E, and Replication Protein A were also elevated (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that the elevated levels of replication factors may functionally contribute to the aberrant ploidy observed with the loss of RB. RB Loss Is Associated with Increased Chromatin Association of DNA Replication Factors—The preceding results indicate that the total protein levels of several DNA replication factors are enhanced with RB loss. Therefore, we next investigated the extent to which these proteins engage in DNA replication. Most DNA replication proteins are considered active when they are associated with chromatin. For instance, it has been determined that the chromatin-bound fraction of MCM2 to -7 denotes the presence of a functional prereplication complex (42Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S. Masuda T. Nojima H. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3320-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 43Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar, 44Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the relative levels of chromatin-bound replication factors in RB-proficient versus RB-deficient cells, since they represent the functional components of the replication machinery. Western blot analysis of replication factors, such as MCM7, PCNA, and Cdc6, demonstrated increased total protein levels (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2), consistent with the preceding results. Interestingly, their chromatin-tethered levels were also significantly elevated in RB-deficient cells (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Thus, components of DNA replication are differentially engaged in RB-proficient versus RB-deficient cells. In contrast, other chromatin/insoluble proteins, such as lamin B (loading control), were unaffected by RB loss. Additionally, we observed that Cdk1 was not associated with chromatin (Fig. 2A), indicating that the increased tethering of the replication factors is specific to RB loss. Since the accumulation of pre-RC proteins in the chromatin fraction was pronounced in RB-deficient cells, this suggests that assembly of the prereplication complex is deregulated with the loss of RB. These results were further validated by immunofluorescence, wherein cells were subjected to in situ extraction to remove soluble cytosolic/nucleoplasmic proteins and retain only chromatin-tethered proteins. They were probed with antibodies to MCM7, PCNA, cyclin A, Cdk1 (negative control for tethering), and lamin B (additional control) and evaluated by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2, B–F). RB-deficient cells exhibited higher levels of total and tethered replication proteins. Data from fractionation and immunofluorescence experiments thus demonstrate enhanced chromatin retention of replication proteins, suggesting that RB loss influences DNA replication control by altering the level and activity of components of the DNA replication machinery. RB Loss Facilitates DNA Rereplication in the Presence of a Mitotic Block—Although deregulation of DNA replication processes could contribute to alterations in genome copy, similar effects can occur as a result of high frequency mitotic failures (45Kops G.J. Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to distinguish between the contribution of DNA replication and mitotic progression to the increased ploidy of RB-deficient cells. To this end, we used the microtubule-destabilizing agent nocodazole to block mitotic progression in RB-proficient and RB-deficient cells. In this manner, any changes in ploidy by definition would be the specific consequence of reinitiation of DNA replication. Under this condition, nocadazole significantly inhibits DNA replication in RB-proficient cells as detected by flow cytometry, and cells accumulate with 4 n DNA as expected, with minimal cells harboring >4 n DNA content (Fig. 3A). In contrast, RB-deficient cells failed to arrest following exposure to nocodazole. Furthermore, in the RB-deficient condition, ∼20% of cells harbored >4 n DNA content (Fig. 3A), indicating that DNA rereplication does occur in these cells and enhances cell ploidy. Additionally, nocodazole-treated RB-proficient cells showed a decrease in BrdUrd incorporation, indicating cessation of DNA synthesis, whereas the RB-deficient cells bypassed the mitotic block and exhibited continued BrdUrd incorporation, indicating active, ongoing DNA synthesis (Fig. 3B, top). Determination of the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells demonstrated that treatment with nocodazole resulted in a 3-fold decrease in the BrdUrd incorporation in RB-proficient cells, whereas the RB-deficient cells retained comparable levels of BrdUrd-positive cells either in the absence or presence of nocodazole (Fig. 3B, bottom). The aberrant ploidy occurring in RB-deficient cells was accompanied by a significant increase in micronuclei that were largely positive for BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 3B, compare nuclei in nocodazole-treated GFP and CRE images). The numerical increase in micronuclei seen upon RB loss was further exacerbated by nocodazole treatment (Fig. 3C). Thus, RB deficiency enables DNA replication to proceed under inappropriate conditions and contributes to increased ploidy. To determine the mechanistic basis for the observed DNA rereplication, we evaluated the influence of nocodazole on the levels of DNA replication factors in RB-proficient and RB-deficient cells. In cells containing functional RB, treatment with nocodazole resulted in diminished levels of MCM7 and PCNA in both total and chromatin-associated fractions (Fig. 4A, compare lane 1 with lane 2 and lane 5 with lane 6). In contrast, the chromatin-tethered levels of MCM7 and PCNA in RB-deficient cells were retained at high levels relative to RB-proficient cells (Fig. 4A, compare lane 2 with lane 4 and lane 6 with lane 8). Additionally, nocodazole treatment did not diminish levels of these proteins in RB-deficient cells (compare lane 3 with lane 4 and lane 7 with lane 8). Evaluation of MCM7 and PCNA levels and their association with chromatin by fluorescence microscopy revealed that nocodazole-treated RB-proficient cells show decreased levels of total and tethered replication proteins (GFP in Fig. 4, B and C). However, RB loss resulted in the retention of chromatin association of these proteins even in the presence of nocodazole (CRE in Fig. 4, B and C). These results concur well with the biochemical fractionation experiments shown in Fig. 4A. Another feature of nocodazole-treated RB-deficient cells was the increased presence of micronuclei. Analysis of such cells by immunofluorescence demonstrated that they also show significant levels of MCM7 (Fig. 4D). This finding illustrates the functional consequence of RB loss on genomic integrity. Collectively, these data indicate that RB deficiency results in the abrogation of nocodazole-induced cell cycle arrest and inappropriate retention of DNA replication factors onto chromatin. Consequently, RB-deficient cells undergo DNA synthesis under nonpermissive conditions, thus leading to aberrant increases in cell ploidy and genome instability. Ectopic Cdc6 or Cdt1 Expression Does Not Recapitulate the Effects of RB Loss—The loading of MCMs onto chromatin to assemble a functional prereplication complex is dependent on the activity of Cdc6 and Cdt1, since these two proteins recruit the MCMs to sites of DNA replication (46Eward K.L.

As shown in Fig. 1E, the levels of these proteins are significantly elevated in RB-deficient cells. These"
https://openalex.org/W1999587639,"Prothrombin is proteolytically activated by the prothrombinase complex comprising the serine protease Factor (F) Xa complexed with its cofactor, FVa. Based on inhibition of the prothrombinase complex by synthetic peptides, FVa residues 493–506 were proposed as a FXa binding site. FVa is homologous to FVIIIa, the cofactor for the FIXa protease, in the FX-activating complex, and FVIIIa residues 555–561 (homologous to FVa residues 499–506) are recognized as a FIXa binding sequence. To test the hypothesis that FVa residues 499–505 contribute to FXa binding, we created the FVa loop swap mutant (designated 499–505VIII FV) with residues 499–505 replaced by residues 555–561 of FVIIIa, which differ at five of seven positions. Based on kinetic measurements and spectroscopic titrations, this FVa loop swap mutant had significantly reduced affinity for FXa. The fully formed prothrombinase complex containing this FVa mutant had fairly normal kinetic parameters (kcat and Km) for cleavage of prothrombin at Arg-320. However, small changes in both Arg-320 and Arg-271 cleavage rates result together in a moderate change in the pathway of prothrombin activation. Although residues 499–505 directly precede the Arg-506 cleavage site for activated protein C (APC), the 499–505VIII FVa mutant was inactivated entirely normally by APC. These results suggest that this A2 domain sequence of the FVa and FVIIIa cofactors evolved to have different specificity for binding FXa and FIXa while retaining compatibility as substrate for APC. In an updated three-dimensional model for the FVa structure, residues 499–505, along with Arg-506, Arg-306, and other previously suggested FXa binding sequences, delineate a continuous surface on the A2 domain that is strongly implicated as an extended FXa binding surface in the prothrombinase complex."

However, roles of transcription factors involved in these processes remain incompletely defined. The early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1) is a member of the zinc finger transcription factor family. A role for Egr-1 in SCF-induced mast cell activation and growth was investigated in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC). The stimulation of BMMC with SCF induced a strong expression of Egr-1 mRNA. SCF-induced Egr-1 nuclear translocation and DNA binding were demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and immunofluorescence assay. SCF-induced IL-13 expression was significantly reduced at both mRNA and protein levels in Egr-1-deficient BMMC. In addition, the synergy between IgE and SCF on IL-13 and IL-4 production was reduced in Egr-1-deficient mast cells. Interestingly, Egr-1 deficiency had little effect on SCF-induced mast cell growth. SCF-induced Egr activation likely requires tyrosine phosphorylation because a tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 blocked SCF-induced nuclear protein binding to Egr probe as determined by EMSA.

Mast cells play a central role in allergic reactions. They originate from pluripotential progenitor cells in bone marrow and acquire mature phenotype in tissues through migration and differentiation (1Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar).

The c-Kit ligand, SCF, is critical for the development, survival, and proliferation of mast cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Galli S.J. Zsebo K.M. Geissler E.N. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 1-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). SCF initiates its effects by binding to c-Kit, which possesses intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (2Galli S.J. Zsebo K.M. Geissler E.N. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 1-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Binding of SCF to c-Kit results in receptor dimerization and activation of protein kinase activity. Activation of c-Kit initiates multiple signaling pathways as a result of interaction with several enzymes and adaptor proteins (3Ronnstrand L. Cell. Mol.

These include Src kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI 3)-kinase, phospholipase C (PLC)-γ, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways, and others (3Ronnstrand L. Cell. Mol.

Thus, each SCF-induced signaling pathway is associated with specific biological functions. Upon activation, mast cells secrete three major categories of mediators including preformed mediators such as histamine, lipid mediators such as leukotrienes and various cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-13 (1Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar, 9Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 931-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Although mast cells are able to produce all three categories of mediators, the kinetic, amount, and type of particular mediators secreted are dependent upon the nature of individual stimuli (10Galli S.J. Kalesnikoff J. Grimbaldeston M.A. Piliponsky A.M. Williams C.M. Tsai M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 749-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Studies of the regulation of release of these mediators from mast cells have largely focused on FcɛRI-mediated signaling pathways. However, FcɛRI functions physiologically in the context of c-Kit. FcɛRI and c-Kit serve distinct as well as overlapping functions in mast cells (11Hundley T.R. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Andrade M.V. Metcalfe D.D. Beaven M.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This is because FcɛRI and c-Kit mediate unique and convergent signals for release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells (11Hundley T.R. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Andrade M.V. Metcalfe D.D. Beaven M.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently we demonstrated that a transcription factor, early growth response-1 (Egr-1) is required for the FcɛRI-induced cytokine TNF and IL-13 production by mast cells (12Li B. Power M.R. Lin T.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether Egr-1 regulates SCF-induced mast cell cytokine production or SCF-dependent mast cell growth. Egr-1 is an 80–82-kDa zinc finger transcription factor. It is the prototype of the Egr family that includes Egr-1, Egr-2, Egr-3, Egr-4, and the Wilm’s tumor product (13Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog.

Neurochem Int. 1997; 31 (; discussion 517-476): 477-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Members of the Egr family have been associated in a large number of biological effects including cell growth and gene expression (13Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

SCF stimulated a rapid expression of Egr-1 mRNA and protein. By using Egr-1-deficient mast cells, we showed that SCF-induced IL-13 production requires Egr-1. Inhibition of Src family kinases, but not PI 3-kinase, PKC, or MAP kinase blocked SCF-induced Egr-1 activation, suggesting a role for Src kinases in SCF-induced Egr-1 activation. Surprisingly, SCF induced mast cell growth was not affected in the absence of Egr-1. Taken together, Egr-1 represents a novel mechanism in SCF-induced cytokine IL-13 production by mast cells. Animals—Egr-1-deficient mice and control C57BL/6NTac mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). The protocols were approved by the University Committee on Laboratory Animals, Dalhousie University, in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies to Egr-1 (sc-189 for immunofluorescence study and sc-189X for the blockade of DNA-protein complex formation), Egr-2 (sc-20690), Egr-3 (sc-22801X), and Egr-4 (sc-19868X) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Recombinant murine stem cell factor (SCF, catalog no. 250-03) was purchased from PeproTech Incorporation (Rocky Hill, NJ). Mast Cell Culture and Stimulation—Murine primary cultured bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) were cultured as previously described (12Li B. Power M.R. Lin T.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Following 4–5 weeks of culture, mast cell purity of greater than 98% was achieved as assessed by toluidine blue staining (pH 1.0) of fixed cytocentrifuged preparations. BMMC (1 × 106 cells/ml) were activated by addition of various concentrations of SCF (0.5–100 ng/ml) for various times (5 min to 24 h). In the case of IgE+antigen stimulation, BMMC were sensitized with IgE directed against trinitrophenyl (TNP) as previously described (12Li B. Power M.R. Lin T.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). TNP-bovine serum albumin (BSA; Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Novato, CA) was used as an antigen. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear protein extracts were obtained using a nuclear extract kit (catalog no. 40010; Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All preparation procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Total protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (catalog no. 500-0006; Bio-Rad Laboratories). EMSA was carried out as previously described (12Li B. Power M.R. Lin T.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used: wild-type Egr-1 probe, 5′-GGA TCC AGC GGG GGC GAG CGG GGG CGA ACG-3′ (catalog no. 1200011; Geneka Biotechnology, Montreal, QC, Canada. Note, this probe recognizes all 4 Egr family members, although it is indicated as an Egr-1 probe by the manufacturer); mutant Egr-1 probe, 5′-GGA TCC AGC GGG GTA GAG CGG GTA CGA ACG-3′ (catalog no. 1400011; Geneka Biotechnology); Sp-1 probe, 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′ (catalog no. E323B; Promega, Madison, WI), and Ap-1 probe, 5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′ (catalog no. E320B; Promega, Madison, WI). Probe-labeling was accomplished by treatment with T4 poly kinase (catalog no. M410A; Promega) in the presence of adenosine 5′-[32P]triphosphate (catalog no. PB10218; Amersham Biosciences). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified using a MicroSpin G-25 column (catalog no. 275325; Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear protein (8 μg) was added to a total volume of 10 μl of the binding reaction with 1 μl of (0.75 μg/μl) poly(dI-dC) (catalog no. 27-7880-02; Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Labeled oligonucleotides were added to each reaction mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were then separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris boric acid-EDTA buffer at room temperature for 1 h at 300 V. Gels were pre-run for 30 min at 100 V before samples were loaded. Gels were vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography overnight at -80 °C. For competition assays, 1 μl of nonradiolabeled wild-type Egr-1, mutant Egr-1, Sp1, or Ap-1 oligonucleotides (50-fold excess of radiolabeled probe) were added and incubated for 15 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. For assays using antibodies to block the DNA-protein complex formation, nuclear extracts were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl with 6 μl of appropriate polyclonal antibodies to Egr-1 (sc-189X), Egr-2 (sc-190X), Egr-3 (sc-22 801X), or Egr-4 (sc-19868X), respectively, for 2 h on ice before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from BMMCs using TRIzol Reagent (catalog no. 15596-026; Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (catalog no. 18064-014; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using a 7000 Sequence detector (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Specific quantitative assays for Egr-1, 2, and IL-13 were performed using Assays-on-Demand reagents containing 6-FAM dye-labeled TaqMan MGB probes (Applied Biosystems). GAPDH was used as an endogenous reference. Data were analyzed using relative standard curve method according to the manufacturer’s protocol. An average value of each gene after GAPDH normalization at the time point showing highest expression was used as a calibrator to determine the relative levels of Egr-1, 2, or IL-13 at different conditions as previously described (12Li B. Power M.R. Lin T.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, PCR products of Egr-1, 2, IL-13, and GAPDH were separated on 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Immunofluorescence Study—BMMCs (3 × 106 cells/sample) were stimulated with SCF (100 ng/ml) for 2 h, or pretreated with SCF (100 ng/ml) for 1 h, then stimulated with various concentrations of TNP-BSA for an additional 1 h. After stimulation, BMMCs were fixed and permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (catalog no. 554714; BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum (catalog no. CL1200, Cedarlane Laboratories) for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, cells were incubated with 4 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-Egr-1 antibody (catalog no. sc-189; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4 °C. Cells were then stained for 2 h with Alexa Fluor-594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (F(ab)2) (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence-labeled mast cells were cytocentrifuged (Cytospin 3, Shandon, United Kingdom) onto slides at 4.5 × g (200 rpm) for 5 min. To visualize cell nuclei, slides were mounted with DAPI, a fluorescent groove-binding probe for DNA, before coverslip attachment. Cells were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—For analysis of c-Kit expression, BMMCs were stained with a FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD117 (c-kit) monoclonal Ab (mAb) (IgG2a) for 30 min at 4 °C. FITC-rat IgG2a was used as an isotypic control. Cells were analyzed by a FACScaliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence-labeled mast cells also were cytocentrifuged (Cytospin 3, Shandon, UK) onto slides at 4.5g (200 rpm) for 5 min. To visualize cell nuclei, slides were mounted with DAPI, a fluorescent groove-binding probe for DNA, before coverslip attachment. Cells were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). For analysis of FcɛRI expression, BMMC were sensitized with IgE and then stained with FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgE mAb (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. FITC-rat IgG1 was used as a control. For cell proliferation assay, BMMCs (1 × 106) were incubated with 1 μm 5 (6Bondzi C. Litz J. Dent P. Krystal G.W. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 305-314PubMed Google Scholar)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE, catalog no. 21888, Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate buffer for 8 min, and were then washed with 2% FBS RPMI 1640 medium for three times. CFSE-labeled BMMCs were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 5 days with 0, 0.5, 5, 25, 50, or 100 ng/ml of SCF. Cells were counted using hemocytometer and also analyzed by flow cytometer. Cytokine Assays—The levels of IL-13, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, MCP-1 (CCL-2), and RANTES (CCL-5) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using Quantikine Mouse IL-13 Immunoassay (for IL-13) and Duoset antibody pairs (for all other cytokines and chemokines) from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. SCF-induced Expression of Egr Products in Mouse BMMC—To determine if SCF stimulation induces expression of Egr family members in mast cells, mouse BMMC were treated with SCF at the concentration of 50 ng/ml for 15, 30, 60, or 180 min. Expression of Egr products were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Egr levels were normalized to GAPDH in each sample. An average value of Egr products after GAPDH normalization at the time point of 15 min (the highest Egr expression level) was used as a calibrator to determine the relative levels of Egr expression at various conditions (Fig. 1A). SCF treatment induced a rapid and transient expression of Egr-1 (Fig. 1, A and B) and Egr-2 (supplemental Fig. S1). We also examined expression of Egr-3, Egr-4, and the Wilm’s tumor product. Little or no Egr-3, Egr-4, or the Wilm’s tumor product can be detected in these samples (data not shown). PCR products were also separated in agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Representative gels were presented in Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1. A rapid and strong Egr-1 and Egr-2 expression can be seen at 15 and 30 min after SCF treatment. Egr-1 and Egr-2 levels in the unstimulated mast cells were undetectable. SCF-induced expression of Egr-1 protein was determined by immunofluorescence assay. BMMC after treatment with SCF (100 ng/ml) for 2 h were fixed, permeabilized and stained with anti-Egr-1 Ab. Alexa-594-conjugated secondary Ab was used to visualize Egr-1 expression. Nuclei were stained by DAPI. SCF-induced Egr-1 protein localized in the nucleus of the BMMC (Fig. 2). SCF-induced Egr Activation in Mouse BMMC—To determine if SCF stimulation induces Egr activation, nucleus proteins from SCF-treated BMMC were examined by EMSA. An Egr DNA probe, which can bind Egr products (Egr-1, -2, -3, and -4) was used. Significant Egr DNA binding can be seen after treatment with SCF (50 ng/ml) for 40, 60, and 120 min. Egr DNA binding activity declined after 3–6 h (Fig. 3A). Dose-dependent experiment showed that mast cells responded to SCF even at the very low concentration (0.5 ng/ml). A strong Egr binding was observed when BMMC were stimulated with 5 ng/ml of SCF (Fig. 3B), a concentration close to the physiological SCF level of 3.3 ng/ml in human serum (17Langley K.E. Bennett L.G. Wypych J. Yancik S.A. Liu X.D. Westcott K.R. Chang D.G. Smith K.A. Zsebo K.M. Blood. 1993; 81: 656-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significant Egr binding was found when BMMC were stimulated with SCF at the concentrations of 25–100 ng/ml (Fig. 3B). Egr DNA binding specificity was confirmed by competitive binding with unlabeled Egr probe, but not mutant Egr probe or Sp-1 probe (Fig. 3C). Because Sp-1 has been shown to be closely associated with Egr-1 function because of the similarity in their DNA binding sequences, we examined whether SCF induced Sp-1 DNA binding. No Sp-1 activation can be observed in SCF-stimulated mast cells (Fig. 3C). As a control, the specific binding of Sp-1 was shown using nuclear extracts from Hela cells (Fig. 3D). To further confirm Egr binding specificity, antibodies to Egr-1, -2, -3, and -4 were used in an EMSA supershift assay. Anti-Egr-1 or anti-Egr-2 antibodies diminished Egr DNA binding activity, whereas anti-Egr-3 or anti-Egr-4 antibodies had little effect. These results were consistent with that shown in Fig. 1 that Egr-1 and -2 but not Egr-3 or -4 were induced by SCF stimulation. SCF-induced Mast Cell Growth in the Absence of Egr-1—Because SCF is a major mast cell growth factor, we determined if SCF-induced Egr-1 expression is required for mast cell growth. Bone marrow cells from Egr-1-deficient mice and wild-type control mice were used to culture for BMMC. We used conventional method to culture BMMC by using WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source for IL-3. Egr-1-deficient BMMC showed similar level of c-kit and IgE receptor expression when compared with wild-type BMMC (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S2) (12Li B. Power M.R. Lin T.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Egr-1-deficient BMMC and wild-type BMMC were labeled with CFSE and treated with various concentrations of SCF (0.5, 5, 25, 50, or 100 ng/ml) for 5 days. Cells were then examined by flow cytometry. Treatment with SCF induced a concentration dependent reduction of CFSE fluorescence intensity, suggesting cell proliferation. Egr-1 deficiency did not affect SCF-induced decrease of CFSE fluorescence intensity (mast cell proliferation) (Fig. 4B). Moreover, a similar trend of SCF-induced increase of mast cell numbers was observed in both Egr-1-deficient BMMC and wild-type BMMC (Fig. 4C). In addition, no morphological difference was observed between Egr-1-deficient and wild-type BMMC by toluidine blue staining or electron microscopic analysis (data not shown). These results suggest that Egr-1 is not required for SCF-induced mast cell growth in vitro. To examine if Egr-1 is needed for mast cell development in vivo, tissues from the ear and back skin of Egr-1-deficient and wild-type mice were used for alcian blue staining for mast cells. Consistent with the in vitro results, no difference of mast cell number in these tissues was observed (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). To determine if Egr-1 has a role in maintaining mast cell viability, WEHI-3B supernatant (a source for IL-3) was removed from the culture media to induce cell death. Mast cell viability was examined by trypan blue exclusion. The withdrawal of WEHI-3B component from the culture media induced similar levels of cell death in Egr-1-deficient and wild-type mast cells (supplemental Fig. S4A). To further examine if Egr-1 affects mast cell apoptosis, BMMC were treated with camptothecin (5 μm, 24 h). Cell lysates were used to examine the cleavage of D4-GDI, an endogenous caspase 3 substrate. Similar level of D4-GDI cleavage in Egr-1-deficient and wild-type BMMC was observed (supplemental Fig. S4B). Decreased IL-13 Production in Egr-1-deficient Mast Cells Following SCF Stimulation—In addition to promotion of mast cell growth, SCF modulates mast cell function by regulating expression of various inflammatory mediators. SCF has been shown to directly induce IL-13 expression by human mast cells (11Hundley T.R. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Andrade M.V. Metcalfe D.D. Beaven M.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine if Egr-1 is required for SCF-dependent IL-13 production, Egr-1-deficient mast cells were treated with SCF (50 ng/ml) for various times. Expression of IL-13 mRNA and protein was determined. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that SCF-induced IL-13 mRNA expression was reduced in Egr-1-deficient BMMC when compared with wild-type BMMC (Fig. 5A). Reduced IL-13 expression by Egr-1-deficient BMMC was also confirmed by analysis of IL-13 PCR product using agarose gel (Fig. 5B). Similarly, SCF-induced production of IL-13 at the protein level by Egr-1-deficient BMMC was significantly reduced comparing to that by wild-type BMMC (Fig. 5C). SCF not only directly stimulates mast cell mediator secretion, it also modulates IgE-dependent cytokine production. SCF synergistically potentiated antigen (TNP)/IgE-induced IL-13 (Fig. 6A) and IL-4 (Fig. 6B) production. Comparing to wild-type BMMC, Egr-1-deficient BMMC showed 69% reduction for IL-13 (Fig. 6A) and 53% reduction for IL-4 (Fig. 6B) in response to SCF + TNP/IgE stimulation. This result suggests that Egr-1 is required for the full scale production of IL-13 and IL-4 during SCF and TNP/IgE co-stimulation. Interestingly, Egr-1 deficiency had little or no effects on SCF + IgE-induced MCP-1 production (supplemental Fig. S5). In addition, RAN-TES, IL-10, and IL-5 were undetectable in any BMMC samples (data not shown). To examine if SCF and TNP/IgE co-stimulation has synergistic effects on Egr-1 expression and activation, BMMC were treated with various concentrations of TNP-BSA (0.5, 2, 10 ng/ml) alone or in the presence of SCF (50 ng/ml). Egr-1 expression at mRNA and protein levels was examined by real-time PCR and immunofluorescence, respectively. DNA binding activity was examined by EMSA. No synergistic or limited additive effect between SCF and TNP/IgE on Egr DNA binding activity was observed when analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 6, C and D). Similarly, little additive effects between SCF and TNP/IgE on Egr-1 mRNA and protein expression were observed (supplemental Fig. S6, A and B). It is likely that the synergistic effect between SCF and IgE on IL-13 and IL-4 production involves additional mechanisms. Tyrosine Kinase Activity in SCF-induced Egr Activation—To examine possible mechanisms involved in SCF-induced Egr activation, BMMC were pretreated for 1 h with various inhibitors for different protein kinases and phosphatases. These inhibitors include PP2 (tyrosine kinases), SB 203580 (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, p38 MAPK), PD 98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, ERK), wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PI 3-kinase), Ro 31-8220 (protein kinase C), rapamycin (mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR), and okadaic acid (protein phosphatase 2A, PP2A). BMMC were then stimulated with SCF (50 ng/ml) for an additional 2 h. Nuclear proteins were then extracted and subjected to EMSA. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor okadaic acid blocked SCF-induced Egr activation (Fig. 7A). However, other kinase inhibitors including SB 203580, PD 98059, wortmannin, Ro 31-8220, or rapamycin had no effect (Fig. 7A). A concentration-dependent inhibition of PP2 on SCF-induced Egr activation was demonstrated in Fig. 7B. Increased mast cell numbers and increased mast cell functional activities are major features of allergic disorders. SCF is a critical factor for both mast cell growth and functional activation (2Galli S.J. Zsebo K.M. Geissler E.N. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 1-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Mast cell precursors as well as mature mast cells express the SCF receptor, c-Kit, on their surface (2Galli S.J. Zsebo K.M. Geissler E.N. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 1-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In mice, mutations on the c-Kit or the SCF (steel) loci lead to mast cell deficiency (18Geissler E.N. Ryan M.A. Housman D.E.

https://openalex.org/W2060638621,"The regulated oligomerization of proteins is increasingly understood to be an important step in many cellular processes, including signaling, transcription, and protein degradation. The activity of Bax, which is essential for the completion of apoptosis, has been shown to be associated with its oligomerization: homodimerization that appears to facilitate mitochondrial permeabilization during apoptosis and heterodimerization with multidomain anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family inhibiting this process. Several domains have been identified to be crucial in the homo-/heterodimerization or oligomerization of Bax, especially the so-called Bax homology 3 domain. In this study we show that although the carboxyl terminus of Bax is not implicated in its mitochondrial localization, it has a role in the dimerization process and thus in its activity.

Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). This family is defined by structural and sequence homology of at least one domain. Typically, anti-apoptotic members of this family (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-W) comprise four domains of homology termed BH1–4, whereas pro-apoptotic members are limited to three domains BH1–3 (multidomain proteins such as Bax and Bak) or only a BH3 (e.g. Bad or Bid) (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). The latter class is divided into two subgroups, Bad-like proteins that act as inhibitors of anti-apoptotic members or Bid-like proteins that act as activators of Bax (2Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain is implicated in the homo- and heterodimerization of pBcl-2s, a process that is central to the control of mitochondrial permeability, which is essential for the completion of the apoptotic program (3Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The apoptotic mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (AMOMP), which leads to the release of intermembrane mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and AIF, is under the control of Bax and Bak (3Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In healthy cells, Bax is a monomeric protein soluble in the cytosol or loosely attached to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Upon the induction of apoptosis, Bax undergoes a change in the conformation resulting in the translocation to the mitochondria and the subsequent formation of oligomers, which are supposed to be involved in the formation of AMOMP via the formation of channels or pores (4Er E. Oliver L. Cartron P.-F. Juin P. Manon S. Vallette F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, oligomerization appears to be essential to AMOMP, but the precise molecular mechanism is not completely understood. Recent data from Annis et al. (5Annis M. Soucie E. Dlugosz P. Cruz-Aguado J. Penn L. Leber B. Andrews D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) suggest that membrane permeabilization occurs through the recruitment of monomers embedded in the membrane, and thus the assemblage of oligomers occurs within the mitochondrial member (or in close proximity) and not in the cytosolic compartment. It has been suggested that the lastα-helix of Bax (i.e. Hα-9) was the addressing/membrane anchor domain of the protein based on its homology with equivalent domains in anti-apoptotic pBcl-2s (6Schinzel A. Kaufmann T. Borner C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, we and others have shown that this domain was not essential for either its mitochondrial addressing or for its pro-apoptotic activity in yeast and mammals (reviewed in Ref. 4Er E. Oliver L. Cartron P.-F. Juin P. Manon S. Vallette F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition, Bax lacking its Hα-9 (BaxΔC) appears to be more effective than full-length Bax α (FLBax) to form channels in the mitochondrial membrane (7Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Structural analyses suggest that although the Hα-9 of Bax is anchored in the membrane, its actual role is more complex than primarily assumed (4Er E. Oliver L. Cartron P.-F. Juin P. Manon S. Vallette F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). proteins of the Bcl-2 family Bax homology blue native PAGE apoptotic mitochondrial outer membrane permeability α-helix carboxyl terminus of Bax (amino acids 170–191) full-length Bax α green fluorescent protein in vitro translated amino terminus of Bax red fluorescent protein recombinant truncated (p13)-Bid phosphate-buffered saline ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) small interfering RNA disuccinimidyl suberate proteins of the Bcl-2 family Bax homology blue native PAGE apoptotic mitochondrial outer membrane permeability α-helix carboxyl terminus of Bax (amino acids 170–191) full-length Bax α green fluorescent protein in vitro translated amino terminus of Bax red fluorescent protein recombinant truncated (p13)-Bid phosphate-buffered saline ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) small interfering RNA disuccinimidyl suberate In this work, we have analyzed apoptosis induced by a Bax construct lacking the Hα-9 (BaxΔC). We show that BaxΔC induced apoptosis in a cell line deficient in endogenous Bax as well as in a cell line expressing Bax. Interestingly, the BaxΔC activity seems to depend on the presence of endogenous Bak. However, BaxΔC appears to be a monomer both in the cytosol and in the mitochondria under healthy or apoptotic conditions suggesting that BaxΔC cannot form oligomers with itself or with FLBax. We also show that substitution of Hα-9 by the equivalent segment of Bcl-xL (BaxTMxL) restores this capacity to form oligomers in a cell-free assay, thus confirming that the Bax-CT is not involved in Bax oligomerization. Materials—Unless otherwise stated, all reagents used in this study were from Sigma. All cell culture material was obtained from Invitrogen. Etoposide was from Teva® Classics (Paris, France) and was used from a stock solution at 20 mg/ml. Commercial antibodies used were monoclonal anti-Bax (clone 2D2, R & D Systems, Lille, France), polyclonal anti-Bax (clone A3533, DakoCytomation, Trappes, France), monoclonal anti-FLAG (F1804, Sigma), monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (MAB-897, R & D Systems), horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies from Bio-Rad, and Alexa 568- and 488-conjugated secondary antibodies from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). The cross-linkers ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) (EGS) and disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) were from Pierce. Cell Culture—The human breast carcinoma cell line HeLa was grown in complete RPMI (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamate). The human prostate carcinoma cell line Du145 (gift from Dr. P.T. Daniel, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin-Buch, Germany) was grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4500 mg/liter glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamate). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in an environment of 5% CO2, 95% air in a humidified atmosphere. Apoptosis was induced in semi-confluent (50–70%) cultures, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Plasmid Constructions—pRcCMV/FLBax, pRcCMV/BaxΔC, and pRcCMV/BaxTMxL were as described previously (8Tremblais K. Oliver L. Juin P. Le Cabellec T.M. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GFP-FLBax and GFP-BaxΔC were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the PCR-based Gateway method and then subcloned into a pcDNA-DEST53 plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Primers used were Bax sense (5′-GGG GAC AAG TTT GTA CAA AAA AGC AGG CTT AAT GGA CGG GTC CGG GGA GCA GCC C-3′) and Bax antisense (5′-GGG GAC CAC TTT GTA CAA GAA AGC TGG GTC GCC CAT CTT CTT CCA GAT GGT G-3′) (for Bax) or BaxΔC antisense (5′-GGG GAC CAC TTT GTA CAA GAA AGC TGG GTC CTG CCA CGT GGG CGT CCC AAA GTA G-3′) (for BaxΔC). FLAG-FLBax and FLAG-BaxΔC were obtained using the Gateway method and were subcloned into a pDEST12.2 plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used were FLAG sense (5′-GGG GAC AAG TTT GTA CAA AAA AGC AGG CTT AGA AGG AGA TAG AAC CAT GGA CTA CAA AGA CGA TGA CGA C-3′), Bax antisense (5′-GGG GAC CAC TTT GTA CAA GAA AGC TGG GTC gcc cat ctt ctt cca gat ggt gag t-3′), and BaxΔC antisense (5′-GGG GAC CAC TTT GTA CAA GAA AGC TGG GTC ctg cca cgt ggg cgt ccc aaa gta g-3′). FLAG-FLBax, cloned into pDEST12.2, was subjected to mutagenesis to obtain the L63E mutant using the site-directed mutagenesis system from Invitrogen with the oligonucleotide 5′-ACC AAG AAG CTG AGC GAG TGT GAG AAG CGC ATC GGG GAC-3′ (the mutated sequence is underlined). The construction of the Hα1-RFP and RFP-Hα9 plasmids was as described previously (9Cartron P.-F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cell Transfections—The different cell lines were transfected with pRcCMV-FLBax, pRcCMV-BaxΔC, or pDEST12.2-FLAG-BaxΔC using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, 10 μg of plasmid DNA diluted in 100 μl of Opti-MEM® medium was added to 25 μl of Lipofectamine, gently mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then added directly to the cells at 50–70% confluency. Stable transfectants were selected with 250 μg/ml G418. For HeLa cells transfected with GFP-Bax (pcDNA-DEST53) or GFP-BaxΔC (pcDNA-DEST53), 10 μg of plasmid DNA was introduced by electroporation (GenePulser, Bio-Rad) using 200 V/cm and 250 microfarads, and transfected cells were selected as above. All cells were used as stable transfectants. Cell Fractionation—After the induction of apoptosis by UV irradiation (1 min) or etoposide treatment, the cells were collected (16, 24, or 36 h after treatment) and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in CEB, v/v (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm cytochalasin B, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 tablet protease inhibitor), as described previously (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to swell for 30 min on ice and then homogenized with 30 strokes in a 2-ml glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged a further 15 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. These mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in CEB. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min in an Airfuge (Beckman Instruments), and the resulting supernatants (S100) were further referred to as the cytosolic fraction. Microinjection—Microinjections were performed as described previously (11Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded on glass coverslips the day prior to microinjection, which was performed using sterile microcapillaries (femtotips II, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) mounted on an automated microinjection system. The plasmids (100 ng/μl) were co-injected with 100 ng/μl pDSRed2-C1 plasmid marker (Clontech). Typically, 100–200 cells were injected using an identical pressure (100 hPa) and time (0.1 s). The percentage of positive cells (with red fluorescence) with apoptotic characteristics was evaluated every 2 h. For cytoplasmic microinjections, peptides and/or recombinant proteins were dissolved in PBS together with dextran (10 kDa)-conjugated lysine-fixable Oregon Green (final concentration of 0.5%; Molecular Probes) as a co-injection marker. Typically, 200 cells were microinjected for each condition in each experiment. Calibration assays indicated that a 2- to 5-pl volume was delivered to each cell (data not shown). The percentage of positive (i.e. fluorescent) cells exhibiting morphological features of apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. For nuclear microinjection studies, plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen midipreps according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng/μl empty expression vector pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N1 (FLBax), or pEGFP-N1 (BaxΔC) was microinjected. The cells were microinjected with the same concentration of plasmid, and confocal analysis using the same photomultiplier transmission confirmed that the relative fluorescence in the cells microinjected with FLBax and BaxΔC was similar (data not shown). Cross-linking Experiments—For cross-linking experiments with EGS or DSS, 50 μg of mitochondrial or cytosolic fractions (S100) were incubated in the absence or in the presence of 2 mm EGS or DSS for 45 min at room temperature. Alternatively, the cross-linker DSS was added to IVT-FLBax, BaxΔC, Hα1-RFP, and RFP-Hα-9 at a final concentration of 5 mm at pH 7.8 after triggering dimerization (10Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the cross-linker was quenched with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Bax oligomerization was analyzed in 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by PhosphorImager analysis. Western Blots—The protein concentration was determined in the different fractions using the Bio-Rad protein assay prior to analysis under reducing conditions in 12% SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed using standard protocol. BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) was used to detected proteins bound to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Laser Confocal Microscopy—Confocal analyses were performed as described previously (11Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.9% picric acid in PBS for 30 min. After a 10-min permeabilization with 0.1% SDS/PBS and a saturation with 5% gelatin/PBS for 1 h, the cells were incubated with polyclonal anti-F1-ATPase (1/1000; a gift from Prof. J. Lunardi) for 1 h and then washed and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Bax antibodies (2 μg). After extensive washing, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. All incubations were done at room temperature unless stated otherwise. Images were visualized using a Leica TCS NT microscope with a ×63 1.3 NA Fluotar objective (Leica, France). Quantification of the overlay of labeling was done using the Metamorph program. Briefly, the correlation coefficient (r) is a measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables x (labeling specific for mitochondria) and y (labeling of Bax). Blue Native-PAGE—Blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE) was performed essentially as described on line. Briefly, mitochondria were suspended at 0.8 mg/ml in imidazole/HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 mm NaCl and 5 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid. Digitonin solubilization was done for 20 min on ice at a detergent/protein ratio of 3 (w/w). Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was supplemented with Coomassie dye solution (5% Serva Blue G in 750 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid) at a dye/protein ratio of 0.2 (w/w) and separated on a linear gradient (5–14%) polyacrylamide slab gel. Molecular weight markers were treated in a similar manner before loading on the gel. Second dimension electrophoresis was done on each individual lane excised from the BN-PAGE. The excised lanes were incubated in dissociating solution (1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 3 h at room temperature. The lane was layered on the top of a 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were analyzed as described above. Quantification of Immunoblots—Bands were quantified using the Image J program available on line. Induction of Oligomerization—[35S]Met proteins were synthesized from cDNAs using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation system from Promega (Lyon, France). The oligomerization of IVT-Bax, FLAG-Bax, BaxΔC, FLAG-BaxΔC, Bax-L63E, or BaxTMxL was induced by either recombinant truncated (rt)-Bid (11Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), increasing the temperature from 30 to 43 °C for 1 h (12Pagliari L.J. Kuwana T. Bonzon C. Newmeyer D.D.

Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). rt-Bid was eliminated by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) as described previously (11Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Low binding Ultracel-YM membrane from Millipore (France) with a cut off of 50 kDa (MicroCon YM 50) was used to isolate IVT-Bax monomers (21 kDa) or dimers (42 kDa), as recommended by the manufacturer. IVT proteins incubated at various conditions (temperature, pH, or tBid) were added to microCon YM 50 and were then eluted from the column and verified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (10Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using Catch and Release version 2.0 (Chemicon, Millipore, France) under native condition with IVT-Bax or its mutants activated by 8 fmol of rt-Bid or by raising the temperature from 30 to 43 °C for 1 h and with 4 μg of anti-FLAG antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody-protein complexes were then incubated with gentle rocking for 30 min. The resin was collected by centrifugation for 30 s at 2,000 × g. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were washed, and then the proteins were eluted with 1× nondenaturing elution buffer by centrifugation for 30 s at 2,000 × g. Control immunoprecipitations were carried out in parallel with unrelated poly- or monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and scanned with a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Knockdown of the Expression of Bak in Du145 Cell Line—The expression of Bak was knocked down in Du145 cell lines by the Silencer® siRNA construction kit (Ambion) as described on line. Three different siRNA sequences were used: siRNA Bak137 sense, 5′-GAT CCG CAG GAG GCT GAA GGG GTG GTT CAA GAG A CCA CCC CTT CAG CCT CCT GT TTT TTG GAA A-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA CAG GAG GCT GAA GGG GTG GTC TCT TGA ACC ACC CCT TCA GCC TCC TGCG-3′; siRNA Bak316 sense, 5′-GAT CCG TGC CTA TGA GTA CTT CAC CTT CAA GAG A GGT GAA GTA CTC ATA GGC A TTT TTT GGA AA-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA TGC CTA TGA GTA CTT CAC CTC TCT TGA AGG TGA AGT ACT CAT AGG CAC G-3′; siRNA Bak553 sense, 5′-GAT CCG TGG TCC CAT CCT GAA CGT GTT CAA GAG A CAC GTT CAG GAT GGG ACC A TTT TTT GGA AA-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA TGG TCC CAT CCT GAA CGT GTC TCT TGA ACA CGT TCA GGA TGG GAC CAC G-3′. A Deletion of the Bax-CT Does Not Interfere with Its Intracellular Localization and Its Apoptotic Function but with Its Oligomerization in a Bax-deficient Cell Line—We and others have shown that the Bax-CT was not essential for its subcellular localization or its apoptotic function in several cell lines (8Tremblais K.

Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The prostate carcinoma cell line Du145, which does not express Bax, was transfected with a human Bax construct in which the last 21 amino acids (i.e. amino acids 170–191) were deleted, and a FLAG tag was added to the amino terminus (FLAG-BaxΔC). The subcellular localization and apoptotic activity of this construct was compared with that of full-length Bax α (FLBax). It should be noted that we were not able to obtain a stable transfected cell line exhibiting a high expression of BaxΔC as the overexpression of this construct appeared highly toxic for these cells (data not shown). As established in Fig. 1A, the cell lines used exhibited a 2-fold difference between FLBax and FLAG-BaxΔC variants. Interestingly, despite this difference in expression, the viability of cells was more affected in the BaxΔC-expressing cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting again that the construct was highly toxic. Of note, under our conditions, time-lapse experiments showed that the kinetics of cell death of the FLBax- and BaxΔC-Du145 cells were similar (supplemental Fig. 1). One of the hallmarks of apoptosis is the relocalization of Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria (17Adams J.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2481-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). To determine whether the release of cytochrome c was associated with a Bax translocation to mitochondria, the subcellular localization of Bax and BaxΔC in untreated and etoposide-treated cells was analyzed by laser confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2A, a proportion of Bax and BaxΔC was mitochondrial (i.e. co-localized with F1-ATPase) in untreated cells, and this proportion was significantly increased in both cases after the induction of apoptosis by the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. Similar results were obtained using another apoptosis inducer (i.e. UV-B treatment) (data not shown). To verify that the cytochrome c release was associated with Bax (and in particular that of FLAG-BaxΔC) translocation to mitochondria, its presence in the cytosol was assessed after cell fractionation as described earlier (9Cartron P.-F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in both FLBax and FLAG-BaxΔC-expressing Du145 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, induction of apoptosis by etoposide stimulated the liberation of cytochrome c in both FLBax- and BaxΔC-transfected Du145 cells, although in the latter case this release was not complete. The extent of the release of cytochrome c has been correlated with the degree of oligomerization of Bax (18Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 19Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 20Roucou X. Montessuit S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the molecular organization of Bax and BaxΔC after the induction of apoptosis by UV-B or etoposide. Fig. 2C shows the results obtained in UV-B-treated cells (note that similar results were obtained with etoposide). Quite surprisingly, we observed that the oligomerization of Bax was incomplete in mitochondria from FLBax-transfected Du145 cells in which only dimers were found and completely absent in BaxΔC transfected Du145 cells in which only monomers were observed. These results suggest that the oligomerization of Bax is affected in Du145 cell lines, and this is particularly significant in the case of BaxΔC as this variant is present only as monomers. It has been suggested that c-Myc was involved in Bax activation at the mitochondrial level and, in particular, in promoting the oligomerization (5Annis M. Soucie E. Dlugosz P. Cruz-Aguado J. Penn L. Leber B. Andrews D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 21Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that Du145 cells express a functional c-myc (22Cassinelli G. Supino R. Zuco V. Lanzi C. Scovassi A.I. Semple S.C. Zunino F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), ruling out the involvement of this oncogene as a putative factor involved in the deficient oligomerization. The putative role of Bak in Bax activity has been raised by several reports (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar, 2Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 3Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and one possibility was that BaxΔC activated the apoptotic program through heterodimerization with Bak. Because we observed only the monomeric form of BaxΔC, we investigated a possible physical association with Bak using co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Fig. 3A shows that Bax did not co-immunoprecipitate with Bak under any of our conditions. We expressed the BaxΔC construct into Du145 cell lines treated with several siRNAs designed to knock down the expression of Bak (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 3B) to study the influence of endogenous Bak on BaxΔC activity. Apoptosis was induced either by UV irradiation or by staurosporine treatment in co-transfected cells, which expressed similar amounts of BaxΔC (data not shown) and different amounts of Bak (Fig. 3B). Cell death was monitored by trypan blue exclusion as described earlier (11Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the Du145 cell line, which expressed Bak but not Bax, cell death was accompanied by oligomerization of Bak (supplemental Fig. 2). This result suggests that the absence of Bax did not interfere with Bak activity. In contrast, little or no cell death was observed in cell lines devoid of Bak indicating that the presence of Bak affects the activity of BaxΔC (Fig. 3C). Of note, similar results were obtained with full-length Bax (data not shown), indicating that the role of Bak in Bax activity is not dependent on the presence of Bax-CT. The Oligomerization of BaxΔC Is Also Absent in Bax-expressing HeLa Cells—It could be possible that the lack of endogenous FLBax was responsible for the absence of oligomerization observed above. To address this question, we used HeLa cells, which express FLBax. To discriminate the exogenous from endogenous Bax, a GFP or a FLAG tag was fused to the ami"
