https://openalex.org/W2028151674,"Insulin resistance progressing to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is marked by a broad perturbation of macronutrient intermediary metabolism. Understanding the biochemical networks that underlie metabolic homeostasis and how they associate with insulin action will help unravel diabetes etiology and should foster discovery of new biomarkers of disease risk and severity. We examined differences in plasma concentrations of >350 metabolites in fasted obese T2DM vs. obese non-diabetic African-American women, and utilized principal components analysis to identify 158 metabolite components that strongly correlated with fasting HbA1c over a broad range of the latter (r = −0.631; p<0.0001). In addition to many unidentified small molecules, specific metabolites that were increased significantly in T2DM subjects included certain amino acids and their derivatives (i.e., leucine, 2-ketoisocaproate, valine, cystine, histidine), 2-hydroxybutanoate, long-chain fatty acids, and carbohydrate derivatives. Leucine and valine concentrations rose with increasing HbA1c, and significantly correlated with plasma acetylcarnitine concentrations. It is hypothesized that this reflects a close link between abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, amino acid catabolism, and efficiency of fuel combustion in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It is speculated that a mechanism for potential TCA cycle inefficiency concurrent with insulin resistance is “anaplerotic stress” emanating from reduced amino acid-derived carbon flux to TCA cycle intermediates, which if coupled to perturbation in cataplerosis would lead to net reduction in TCA cycle capacity relative to fuel delivery."

This paper proposes a novel, fine-grained approach to regional delineation, based on analyzing networks of billions of individual human transactions. Given a geographical area and some measure of the strength of links between its inhabitants, we show how to partition the area into smaller, non-overlapping regions while minimizing the disruption to each person's links. We tested our method on the largest non-Internet human network, inferred from a large telecommunications database in Great Britain. Our partitioning algorithm yields geographically cohesive regions that correspond remarkably well with administrative regions, while unveiling unexpected spatial structures that had previously only been hypothesized in the literature. We also quantify the effects of partitioning, showing for instance that the effects of a possible secession of Wales from Great Britain would be twice as disruptive for the human network than that of Scotland."
https://openalex.org/W2083153667,"Only a small percentage of human transcription factors (e.g. those associated with a specific differentiation program) are expressed in a given cell type. Thus, cell fate is mainly determined by cell type-specific silencing of transcription factors that drive different cellular lineages. Several histone modifications have been associated with gene silencing, including H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. We have previously shown that genes for the two largest classes of mammalian transcription factors are marked by distinct histone modifications; homeobox genes are marked by H3K27me3 and zinc finger genes are marked by H3K9me3. Several histone methyltransferases (e.g. G9a and SETDB1) may be involved in mediating the H3K9me3 silencing mark. We have used ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq to demonstrate that SETDB1, but not G9a, is associated with regions of the genome enriched for H3K9me3. One current model is that SETDB1 is recruited to specific genomic locations via interaction with the corepressor TRIM28 (KAP1), which is in turn recruited to the genome via interaction with zinc finger transcription factors that contain a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain. However, specific KRAB-ZNFs that recruit TRIM28 (KAP1) and SETDB1 to the genome have not been identified. We now show that ZNF274 (a KRAB-ZNF that contains 5 C2H2 zinc finger domains), can interact with KAP1 both in vivo and in vitro and, using ChIP-seq, we show that ZNF274 binding sites co-localize with SETDB1, KAP1, and H3K9me3 at the 3' ends of zinc finger genes. Knockdown of ZNF274 with siRNAs reduced the levels of KAP1 and SETDB1 recruitment to the binding sites. These studies provide the first identification of a KRAB domain-containing ZNF that is involved in recruitment of the KAP1 and SETDB1 to specific regions of the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2086487946,"Wnt signaling plays an important role in developmental and stem cell biology. To test the hypothesis that temporary inhibition of Wnt signaling will enhance granulation tissue and promote angiogenesis in tissue repair, we employed a recently characterized small molecule Wnt inhibitor. Pyrvinium is an FDA-approved drug that we identified as a Wnt inhibitor in a chemical screen for small molecules that stabilize β-catenin and inhibit Axin degradation. Our subsequent characterization of pyrvinium has revealed that its critical cellular target in the Wnt pathway is Casein Kinase 1α. Daily administration of pyrvinium directly into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sponges implanted subcutaneously in mice generated better organized and vascularized granulation tissue; this compound also increased the proliferative index of the tissue within the sponges. To evaluate its effect in myocardial repair, we induced a myocardial infarction (MI) by coronary artery ligation and administered a single intramyocardial dose of pyrvinium. Mice were evaluated by echocardiography at 7 and 30 days post-MI and treatment; post mortem hearts were evaluated by histology at 30 days. Pyrvinium reduced adverse cardiac remodeling demonstrated by decreased left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (LVIDD) as compared to a control compound. Increased Ki-67+ cells were observed in peri-infarct and distal myocardium of pyrvinium-treated animals. These results need to be further followed-up to determine if therapeutic inhibition of canonical Wnt may avert adverse remodeling after ischemic injury and its impact on myocardial repair and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2038082544,"Background Melanoma is the most aggressive and lethal form of skin cancer. Because of the increasing incidence and high lethality of melanoma, animal models for continuously observing melanoma formation and progression as well as for testing pharmacological agents are needed. Methodology and Principal Findings Using the combinatorial Gal4 –UAS system, we have developed a zebrafish transgenic line that expresses oncogenic HRAS under the kita promoter. Already at 3 days transgenic kita-GFP-RAS larvae show a hyper-pigmentation phenotype as earliest evidence of abnormal melanocyte growth. By 2–4 weeks, masses of transformed melanocytes form in the tail stalk of the majority of kita-GFP-RAS transgenic fish. The adult tumors evident between 1–3 months of age faithfully reproduce the immunological, histological and molecular phenotypes of human melanoma, but on a condensed time-line. Furthermore, they show transplantability, dependence on mitfa expression and do not require additional mutations in tumor suppressors. In contrast to kita expressing melanocyte progenitors that efficiently develop melanoma, mitfa expressing progenitors in a second Gal4-driver line were 4 times less efficient in developing melanoma during the three months observation period. Conclusions and Significance This indicates that zebrafish kita promoter is a powerful tool for driving oncogene expression in the right cells and at the right level to induce early onset melanoma in the presence of tumor suppressors. Thus our zebrafish model provides a link between kita expressing melanocyte progenitors and melanoma and offers the advantage of a larval phenotype suitable for large scale drug and genetic modifier screens."
https://openalex.org/W1981298128,"Previously, using artificial cell systems, we identified receptor heteromers between the dopamine D1 or D2 receptors and the histamine H3 receptor. In addition, we demonstrated two biochemical characteristics of the dopamine D1 receptor-histamine H3 receptor heteromer. We have now extended this work to show the dopamine D1 receptor-histamine H3 receptor heteromer exists in the brain and serves to provide a novel link between the MAPK pathway and the GABAergic neurons in the direct striatal efferent pathway. Using the biochemical characteristics identified previously, we found that the ability of H3 receptor activation to stimulate p44 and p42 extracellular signal-regulated MAPK (ERK 1/2) phosphorylation was only observed in striatal slices of mice expressing D1 receptors but not in D1 receptor-deficient mice. On the other hand, the ability of both D1 and H3 receptor antagonists to block MAPK activation induced by either D1 or H3 receptor agonists was also found in striatal slices. Taken together, these data indicate the occurrence of D1-H3 receptor complexes in the striatum and, more importantly, that H3 receptor agonist-induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in striatal slices is mediated by D1-H3 receptor heteromers. Moreover, H3 receptor-mediated phospho-ERK 1/2 labeling co-distributed with D1 receptor-containing but not with D2 receptor-containing striatal neurons. These results indicate that D1-H3 receptor heteromers work as processors integrating dopamine- and histamine-related signals involved in controlling the function of striatal neurons of the direct striatal pathway.

The striatum is the main input structure of the basal ganglia, which are subcortical structures involved in the processing of information related to the performance and learning of complex motor acts. It is widely accepted that dopamine receptor subtypes, which are fundamental for motor control and are implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, are largely segregated in the two subtypes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), 4The abbreviations used are: MSNmedium spiny neuronsD2Rdopamine D2 receptorH1Rhistamine H1 receptorD1Rdopamine D1 receptorRAMHR(−)-α-methylhistamine dihydrochloride. the most populated neuronal type in the striatum. Dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) are mostly localized in the striatopallidal MSNs, which express the peptide enkephalin and which gives rise to the indirect striatal efferent pathway, whereas dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) are mostly expressed by the striatonigral MSNs, which express substance P and dynorphin and constitute the direct striatal efferent pathway (1Albin R.L.

Elsevier Academic Press, Amsterdam2004: 445-508Google Scholar). Dopaminergic drugs activate the ERK transduction pathway, which is involved in basic physiological processes and in synaptic plasticity (3Thomas G.M. Huganir R.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). In the dopamine-depleted striatum, ERK signaling is implicated in the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Thus, in dopamine-denervated mice, L-DOPA activates ERK signaling specifically in D1Rs containing striatonigral MSNs but not in D2Rs containing striatopallidal MSNs (4Santini E. Alcacer C.

Histamine is an important regulatory transmitter in the nervous system involved in the sleep/wake cycle, attention, memory, and other functions. Four histamine receptor types (H1R–H4R) have been cloned. H3Rs are expressed in abundance in the brain and high densities are particularly found in the striatum (5Ryu J.H. Yanai K. Iwata R. Ido T.

Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1983; 302: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar), but they were later found to act as heteroreceptors (9Leurs R. Bakker R.A. Timmerman H. de Esch I.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The major localization of striatal H3Rs is postsynaptic (5Ryu J.H. Yanai K. Iwata R. Ido T. Watanabe T.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7272-7280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Histamine, by means of interactions with striatal H3Rs, plays an important role in the modulation of dopamine neurotransmission (11García-Ramírez M. Aceves J. Arias-Montaño J.A. Behav. Brain Res. 2004; 154: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Arias-Montaño J.A. Floran B. Garcia M. Aceves J. Young J.M. Br. J.

Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). At the behavioral level, it was shown that stimulation of postsynaptic H3R counteracts the motor activation induced by D1R and D2R agonists in reserpinized mice (14Ferrada C. Ferré S. Casadó V. Cortés A. Justinova Z. Barnes C. Canela E.I. Goldberg S.R. Leurs R. Lluis C. Franco R. Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These interactions may be related to the ability of H3Rs to form heteromers with dopamine receptors. In fact, D1R-H3R and D2R-H3R heteromerization was demonstrated by biophysical techniques in mammalian cells (14Ferrada C. Ferré S. Casadó V. Cortés A. Justinova Z. Barnes C. Canela E.I. Goldberg S.R. Leurs R. Lluis C. Franco R. Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Ferrada C. Moreno E. Casadó V. Bongers G. Cortés A. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Leurs R. Ferré S. Lluís C. Franco R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 157: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, their presence in the brain remained to be demonstrated. In addition, if H3Rs form heteromers with both D1R and D2R, is there a functional difference between these two receptor heteromer pairs? One might expect that because the D1R and D2R receptors are found in two different neuronal pathways that the different heteromers might confer different properties. Here, we have explored this idea by taking advantage of unique properties of the D1R-H3R heteromers to provide evidence for their presence in rodent brain. Previously, using an in vitro cell system, we found an important feature of the D1R-H3R heteromer is that H3R agonists only activate ERK 1/2 in a receptor heteromer context, but not in cells expressing H3Rs without D1R (15Ferrada C. Moreno E. Casadó V. Bongers G. Cortés A. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Leurs R. Ferré S. Lluís C. Franco R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 157: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Here, by taking advantage of this distinct ERK 1/2 signaling characteristic, we demonstrate the occurrence of D1R-H3R heteromers in rodent striatum. Despite H3Rs being expressed in both D1R and D2R containing neurons, histamine-receptor-mediated phosphorylation of the ERK 1/2 kinase occurred only in neurons expressing D1R and not in those with D2R. Thus, D1-H3 receptor heteromers confer a direct link to MAPK activation within the GABAergic neurons of the direct striatal efferent pathway. Sprague-Dawley male rats, 7–9 weeks old and weighing 200–250 g, were provided by the Animal Service of the Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain). Six-to-eight-month-old wild-type littermates and dopamine D1 receptor knock-out C57BL6 male mice, weighing 25–30 g, were provided by Instituto Cajal (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas; Madrid, Spain) and generated by homologous recombination as described previously (16Xu M. Moratalla R. Gold L.H. Hiroi N. Koob G.F. Graybiel A.M. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 79: 729-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Rats (2 per cage) or mice (five per cage) were housed in a temperature (21 ± 1 °C) and humidity-controlled (55 ± 10%) room with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (light between 08:00 and 20:00 h) with food and water ad libitum. Animal procedures were conducted according to standard ethical guidelines (European Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC) and approved by the local (Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona or Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas) ethical committee. SK-N-MC/H3 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, nonessential amino acids, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml sodium pyruvate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 to 80% confluence. The SK-N-MC cells stably expressing the human H3R (SK-N-MC/H3) were provided by Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C. Cells were disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer (PTA 20 TS rotor, setting 3; Kinematica, Basel, Switzerland) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1/1000; Sigma). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 45 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μm phenylarsine oxide, 0.4 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitor mixture to be processed by Western blot. Rats and mice were decapitated with a guillotine, and the brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold oxygenated (O2/CO2: 95/5%) Krebs-HCO3− buffer (124 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 26 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4). The brains were sliced at 4 °C in a brain matrix (Zivic Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA) into 0.5-mm coronal slices. Slices were kept at 4 °C in Krebs-HCO3− buffer during the dissection of the striatum. Each slice was transferred into an incubation tube containing 1 ml of ice-cold Krebs-HCO3− buffer. The temperature was raised to 23 °C and after 30 min, the medium was replaced by 2 ml Krebs-HCO3− buffer (23 °C). The slices were incubated under constant oxygenation (O2/CO2: 95/5%) at 30 °C for 4–5 h in an Eppendorf Thermomixer (5 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). The media was replaced by 200 μl of fresh Krebs-HCO3− buffer and incubated for 30 min before the addition of ligands. Striatal slices were incubated in the presence of the indicated concentrations of histamine H3 or dopamine D1 receptor ligands, prepared in Krebs-HCO3− buffer. After the indicated incubation period, the solution was discarded, and slices were frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Slices were lysed by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 45 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μm phenylarsine oxide, 0.4 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and protein was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin dilutions as standard. To determine the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, equivalent amounts of protein (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto PVDF-FL membranes. Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska) was then added, and membranes were rocked for 90 min. Membranes were then probed with a mixture of a mouse antiphospho-ERK 1/2 antibody (1:2500, Sigma) and rabbit anti-ERK 1/2 antibody (1:40,000, Sigma) for 2–3 h. The 42 and 44 kDa bands corresponding to ERK 1 and ERK 2 were visualized by the addition of a mixture of IRDye 800 (anti-mouse) antibody (1:10,000, Sigma) and IRDye 680 (anti-rabbit) antibody (1:10,000, Sigma) for 1 h and scanned by the Odyssey infrared scanner (LI-COR Biosciences). Bands densities were quantified using the scanner software and exported to Microsoft Excel. The level of phosphorylated ERK 1 and phosphorylated ERK 2 was normalized for differences in loading using the total ERK 1/2 protein band intensities. Striatal slices were incubated with the indicated H3R ligands in Krebs-HCO3− buffer for 10 min and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Antigenfix, DiaPath) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. The slices were then washed in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.8), treated 5 min with 1% Na2BH4 dissolved in TBS, followed by successive TBS washes until all Na2BH4 was eliminated. Finally, the slices were cryopreserved in a 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4 °C and stored at −20 °C until sectioning. 15-μm-thick coronal sections were cut on a freezing cryostat (Leica Jung CM-3000) and mounted on slide glass (three control and three treated coronal sections in each slide; STAR FROST PLUS, DELTALAB). Coronal sections were thawed at 4 °C, washed in TBS, and rocked in 7% normal donkey serum (SND, Sigma) in TBS for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. Coronal sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified atmosphere with the primary antibodies: rabbit antiphospho-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK 1/2 antibody (1:300, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), guinea pig anti-D1 antibody (1:100, Frontier Institute, Ishikari, Hokkaido, Japan) or guinea pig anti-D2 antibody (1:100, Frontier Institute, Ishikari, Hokkaido, Japan) alone or in combination in a solution with 0.1% TBS-Tween, 0.1% BSA-acetylated (Aurion), 7% SND (250 μl per slide). The specificity of these dopamine receptor antibodies has been previously shown by preabsorption tests with the antigen peptides and by mutually exclusive pattern and triple labeling in immunohistochemistry (17Narushima M. Uchigashima M. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Kano M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 2246-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and by Western blot (see “Results”). Coronal sections were washed in 0.05% TBS-T and left for 2 h at room temperature in a humidified atmosphere with the corresponding secondary antibodies: chicken anti-rabbit (1:200, Alexa Fluor 594, Invitrogen) and goat anti-guinea pig (1:200, Alexa Fluor 488, Invitrogen) in a solution with TBS-Tween 0.1%, BSA acetylated 0.1%, SND 7%, and then washed in TBS-T 0.05%, followed by a single wash in TBS before mounting in Mowiol medium (Calbiochem), covered with a glass, and left to dry at 4 °C for 24 h. Single and double immunostained slices were observed and imaged in a Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Images were opened and processed with ImageJ confocal microscopy program and a Adobe Photoshop program (version 5.5; Seattle, WA). Double-labeled cells (cells stained for phospho-ERK 1/2 and D1 or D2 receptors) were counted in a total of two to three nonoverlapping fields of 45 coronal sections from 4 to 5 slices treated with medium (control), 1 μm RAMH, or 1 μm imetit. Coronal sections from nontreated slices (six control coronal sections in each slide) were used for double-immunohistochemistry using rabbit anti-H3R antibody (1:200, Chemicon, Billerica, MA) and guinea pig anti-D1R antibody or guinea pig anti-D2R antibody as primary antibodies and goat anti-rabbit-peroxidase (1:200, Thermo Scientific, Fremont, CA) and goat anti-guinea pig (1:200, Alexa Fluor 488, Invitrogen) as secondary antibodies by the same procedure as described above. In this case, the amplification system for the red fluorophore, TSA-cyanine 3 (1:100, Tyramide Signal Amplification, PerkinElmer Life Science) was used as described in the TSA Plus fluorescence amplification kit, before mounting in Mowiol medium. Double-labeled cells (cells stained for H3 and D1 or D2 receptors) were counted in a total of two to three nonoverlapping fields of 15 coronal sections from four to five slices. In all cases, we did not observe staining in the absence of the primary antibodies. The rat striatal tissue was disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1/1000, Sigma). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed two more times at the same conditions and were solubilized by homogenization in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 30 min on ice before centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant (1 mg/ml of protein) was processed for immunoprecipitation as described in immunoprecipitation protocol using a Dynabeads® Protein G kit (Invitrogen). Protein was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin dilutions as standard. Immunoprecipitates were carried out with rat anti-D1 receptor antibody (1:1000, Sigma) or rabbit anti-D2 receptor antibody (1:1000, Millipore, Billerica, MA) As negative control anti-calnexin antibody was used (1:1000, BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Immunoprecipitates were separated on a denaturing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were proved with the primary antibodies guinea pig anti-D1 antibody (1:1000, Frontier Institute, Ishikari, Hokkaido, Japan), guinea pig anti-D2 antibody (1:1000, Frontier Institute) or goat anti-H3R antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and the secondary antibodies goat anti-guinea pig-peroxidase (1:20,000, Sigma) and donkey anti-goat-peroxidase (1:20,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Bands were visualized with a LAS-3000 (Fujifilm). Analysis of detected bands was performed by Image Gauge software (version 4.0) and Multi Gauge software (version 3.0). To establish whether D1R and H3R are functionally coupled to the MAPK pathway in rat striatum, slices were treated with a D1R or an H3R agonist, and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The time response curve obtained after treatment with 10 μm SKF 38393 (D1R agonist) or 0.1 μm imetit (H3R agonist) showed that phosphorylation peaked at 10 min (Fig. 1a). Therefore, all subsequent assays were analyzed at 10 min of drug treatment. Dose-response curves for different D1R or H3R agonists are displayed in Fig. 1b. Both SKF 81297 and SKF 38393 (full and partial D1R agonists, respectively) were able to increase ERK 1/2 phosphorylation; SKF 81297 was more potent than SKF 39393. RAMH and imetit (H3R agonists) also increased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, with imetit being more potent than RAMH. The results show that striatal slices contain D1R and H3R functionally coupled to MAPK signaling. A cross-antagonism between D1Rs and H3Rs has been demonstrated previously in heterologous cell systems. This cross-antagonism only occurs in D1R-H3R-heteromer-containing cells and consists of both the ability of D1R antagonists to block the effect of H3R agonists and, conversely, the ability of H3R antagonists to block the effect of D1R agonists (15Ferrada C. Moreno E. Casadó V. Bongers G. Cortés A. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Leurs R. Ferré S. Lluís C. Franco R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 157: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To test whether this phenomenon also occurs in vivo, rat striatal slices were incubated with D1R or H3R agonists (SKF 81297 or RAMH, respectively) in the presence of either D1R or H3R antagonists (SCH 23390 or thioperamide, respectively). The results reproduced the cross-antagonism found in the heterologous cell system (Fig. 2). ERK 1/2 phosphorylation induced by RAMH (0.1 μm) was not only blocked by thioperamide (10 μm) but also by SCH 23390 (10 μm) (Fig. 2a). Similarly, ERK 1/2 phosphorylation induced by SKF 81297 (0.1 μm) was blocked by both SCH23390 and thioperamide (10 μm in both cases) (Fig. 2b). As a control, activation of striatal serotonin receptors (with 0.2 μm of serotonin) significantly induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, but the effect was not modified by either SCH23390 or thioperamide (10 μm in both cases) (Fig. 2, c and d). These results provide evidence for the expression D1R-H3R heteromers in the striatum. Another characteristic of the D1R-H3R heteromer is that it allows H3R agonists to activate MAPK signaling (15Ferrada C. Moreno E. Casadó V. Bongers G. Cortés A. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Leurs R. Ferré S. Lluís C. Franco R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 157: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We decided to investigate whether this heteromer characteristic persisted in vivo using transgenic mice lacking D1Rs. When H3R-mediated MAPK signaling was investigated in striatal slices from transgenic mice lacking the D1Rs and in wild-type littermate controls displaying the same genetic background, RAMH (0.1 μm) was unable to induce ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, whereas a strong signal was obtained in slices from wild-type littermate controls displaying the same genetic background (Fig. 3). In addition in wild-type animals, RAMH-induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was blocked by both thioperamide (10 μm) and SCH 23390 (10 μm) (Fig. 3). These results indicate that H3R agonist-induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in striatal slices is mediated by D1R-H3R heteromers.FIGURE 3H3R agonist-induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in striatal slices from wild-type and dopamine D1R knock-out mice. Wild-type (white) or D1R knock-out mice (black) slices were treated for 10 min with 0.1 μm RAMH or for 10 min with 10 μm thioperamide and/or 10 μm SCH 23390 prior to the addition of 0.1 μm RAMH and incubation for further 10 min. ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For each treatment, the immunoreactive bands from four to six slices from a total six wild-type and nine knock-out animals were quantified, and values represent the mean ± S.E. of the percentage of phosphorylation relative to basal levels found in untreated slices (100%). No significant differences were obtained between the basal levels of the wild-type and the D1R knock-out mice, and no significant differences were observed between basal and slices treated (20 min) with 10 μm thioperamide or 10 μm SCH 23390. Significant treatment and genotype effects were analyzed by a bifactorial analysis of variance followed by post hoc Bonferroni's tests. There were significant genotype, treatment, and interaction effects, explained by the ability of RAMH to strongly and selectively induce ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in wild-type mice (***, p < 0.001, as compared with knock-out mice). A representative Western blot is also displayed (top).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To provide further insight on the function of striatal D1R and H3R receptors coexpressed in striatal neurons, ERK 1/2 activation was studied in rat striatal slices in the presence of agonists for the two receptors. This would mimic the situation when the two neurotransmitters histamine and dopamine are simultaneously impacting a given GABAergic neuron. Interestingly, the effect of the D1R agonist SKF 81297 (10 μm) was significantly counteracted by the H3R agonist, RAMH (1 μm). Furthermore, the combination of RAMH (10 μm) and SKF 81297 (1 μm) produced a significantly weaker effect than that of either drug alone (Fig. 4), indicating the existence in striatal neural circuits of an agonist-induced D1R-H3R reciprocal negative cross-talk. Dopamine receptors are segregated in the two main types of GABAergic striatal efferent neurons: dynorphinergic neurons of the direct pathway expressing D1Rs and enkephalinergic neurons of the indirect pathway expressing dopamine D2Rs. Evidence supporting the presence of H3R in both types of neurons had been obtained previously by autoradiography and lesion studies (5Ryu J.H. Yanai K. Iwata R. Ido T. Watanabe T. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and by in situ hybridization (10Pillot C. Ortiz J. Héron A. Ridray S. Schwartz J.C. Arrang J.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7272-7280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, by double immunohistochemistry using H3R and either D1R or D2R antibodies, we found H3R immunostaining in cells labeled with either D1R or D2R antibodies (Fig. 5). In fact, 95 ± 12% of D1R stained neurons or 89 ± 15% of D2R stained neurons showed H3R staining (Fig. 6a). Thus, co-expression of D1R and H3R in GABAergic neurons of the direct pathway and co-expression of D2R and H3R in GABAergic neurons of the indirect pathway was found. We have described previously that both D1R and D2R may form heteromers with H3R in living cells (14Ferrada C. Ferré S. Casadó V. Cortés A. Justinova Z. Barnes C. Canela E.I. Goldberg S.R. Leurs R.

To test D1R-H3R and D2R-H3R heteromer expression in the rat striatum, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. The immunoprecipitates with the anti-D1R antibody (Fig. 7a) or with the anti-D2R antibody (Fig. 7b) were not stained in a Western blot using anti-D2R or anti-D1R antibodies respectively, showing the specificity of the antibodies. Interestingly, specific H3R staining was detected by Western blot in both immunoprecipitates using anti-D1R or anti-D2R antibodies but not with an irrelevant antibody (Fig. 7c). These results corroborate the expression of D1R-H3R heteromers in the neurons of the direct pathway and suggest the expression of D2R-H3R heteromers in the neurons of the indirect pathway.FIGURE 6Quantification of colocalization in confocal microscope images.

https://openalex.org/W2165816614,"Background DNA barcoding is expected to be an effective identification tool for organisms with heteromorphic generations such as pteridophytes, which possess a morphologically simple gametophyte generation. Although a reference data set including complete coverage of the target local flora/fauna is necessary for accurate identification, DNA barcode studies including such rich taxonomic sampling on a countrywide scale are lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings The Japanese pteridophyte flora (733 taxa including subspecies and varieties) was used to test the utility of two plastid DNA barcode regions (rbcL and trnH-psbA) with the intention of developing an identification system for native gametophytes. DNA sequences were obtained from each of 689 (94.0%) taxa for rbcL and 617 (84.2%) taxa for trnH-psbA. Mean interspecific divergence values across all taxon pairs (K2P genetic distances) did not reveal a significant difference in rate between trnH-psbA and rbcL, but mean K2P distances of each genus showed significant heterogeneity according to systematic position. The minimum fail rate of taxon discrimination in an identification test using BLAST (12.52%) was obtained when rbcL and trnH-psbA were combined, and became lower in datasets excluding infraspecific taxa or apogamous taxa, or including sexual diploids only. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates the overall effectiveness of DNA barcodes for species identification in the Japanese pteridophyte flora. Although this flora is characterized by a high occurrence of apogamous taxa that pose a serious challenge to identification using DNA barcodes, such taxa are limited to a small number of genera, and only minimally detract from the overall success rate. In the case that a query sequence is matched to a known apogamous genus, routine species identification may not be possible. Otherwise, DNA barcoding is a practical tool for identification of most Japanese pteridophytes, and is especially anticipated to be helpful for identification of non-hybridizing gametophytes."
https://openalex.org/W2085681500,"Background Depression is a leading contributor to the burden of disease worldwide, a critical barrier to HIV prevention and a common serious HIV co-morbidity. However, depression screening and treatment are limited in sub-Saharan Africa, and there are few population-level studies examining the prevalence and gender-specific factors associated with depression. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study of 18–49 year-old adults from five districts in Botswana with the highest prevalence of HIV-infection. We examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms, using a Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Depression (HSCL-D) score of ≥1.75 to define depression, and correlates of depression using multivariate logistic regression stratified by sex. Results Of 1,268 participants surveyed, 25.3% of women and 31.4% of men had depression. Among women, lower education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.07, 95% confidence interval [1.30–3.32]), higher income (1.77 [1.09–2.86]), and lack of control in sexual decision-making (2.35 [1.46–3.81]) were positively associated with depression. Among men, being single (1.95 [1.02–3.74]), living in a rural area (1.63 [1.02–2.65]), having frequent visits to a health provider (3.29 [1.88–5.74]), anticipated HIV stigma (fearing discrimination if HIV status was revealed) (2.04 [1.27–3.29]), and intergenerational sex (2.28 [1.17–4.41]) were independently associated with depression. Discussion Depression is highly prevalent in Botswana, and its correlates are gender-specific. Our findings suggest multiple targets for screening and prevention of depression and highlight the need to integrate mental health counseling and treatment into primary health care to decrease morbidity and improve HIV management efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2064893599,"Background Fungal mating types in self-incompatible Pezizomycotina are specified by one of two alternate sequences occupying the same locus on corresponding chromosomes. One sequence is characterized by a gene encoding an HMG protein, while the hallmark of the other is a gene encoding a protein with an α1 domain showing similarity to the Matα1p protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA-binding HMG proteins are ubiquitous and well characterized. In contrast, α1 domain proteins have limited distribution and their evolutionary origin is obscure, precluding a complete understanding of mating-type evolution in Ascomycota. Although much work has focused on the role of the S. cerevisiae Matα1p protein as a transcription factor, it has not yet been placed in any of the large families of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings We present sequence comparisons, phylogenetic analyses, and in silico predictions of secondary and tertiary structures, which support our hypothesis that the α1 domain is related to the HMG domain. We have also characterized a new conserved motif in α1 proteins of Pezizomycotina. This motif is immediately adjacent to and downstream of the α1 domain and consists of a core sequence Y-[LMIF]-x(3)-G-[WL] embedded in a larger conserved motif. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that extant α1-box genes originated from an ancestral HMG gene, which confirms the current model of mating-type evolution within the fungal kingdom. We propose to incorporate α1 proteins in a new subclass of HMG proteins termed MATα_HMG."
https://openalex.org/W2061820796,"Background Flower colour is of great importance in various fields relating to floral biology and pollinator behaviour. However, subjective human judgements of flower colour may be inaccurate and are irrelevant to the ecology and vision of the flower's pollinators. For precise, detailed information about the colours of flowers, a full reflectance spectrum for the flower of interest should be used rather than relying on such human assessments. Methodology/Principal Findings The Floral Reflectance Database (FReD) has been developed to make an extensive collection of such data available to researchers. It is freely available at http://www.reflectance.co.uk. The database allows users to download spectral reflectance data for flower species collected from all over the world. These could, for example, be used in modelling interactions between pollinator vision and plant signals, or analyses of flower colours in various habitats. The database contains functions for calculating flower colour loci according to widely-used models of bee colour space, reflectance graphs of the spectra and an option to search for flowers with similar colours in bee colour space. Conclusions/Significance The Floral Reflectance Database is a valuable new tool for researchers interested in the colours of flowers and their association with pollinator colour vision, containing raw spectral reflectance data for a large number of flower species."
https://openalex.org/W2095863890,"Little is known about whether associations between childhood adiposity and later adverse cardiovascular health outcomes are driven by tracking of overweight from childhood to adulthood and/or by vascular and metabolic changes from childhood overweight that persist into adulthood. Our objective is to characterise associations between trajectories of adiposity across childhood and a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors measured in adolescence, and explore the extent to which these are mediated by fat mass at age 15.Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we estimated individual trajectories of ponderal index (PI) from 0-2 years and BMI from 2-10 years using random-effects linear spline models (N = 4601). We explored associations between PI/BMI trajectories and DXA-determined total-body fat-mass and cardiovascular risk factors at 15 years (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, glucose, insulin) with and without adjustment for confounders. Changes in PI/BMI during all periods of infancy and childhood were associated with greater DXA-determined fat-mass at age 15. BMI changes in childhood, but not PI changes from 0-2 years, were associated with most cardiovascular risk factors in adolescence; associations tended to be strongest for BMI changes in later childhood (ages 8.5-10), and were largely mediated by fat mass at age 15.Changes in PI/BMI from 0-10 years were associated with greater fat-mass at age 15. Greater increases in BMI from age 8.5-10 years are most strongly associated with cardiovascular risk factors at age 15, with much of these associations mediated by fat-mass at this age. We found little evidence supporting previous reports that rapid PI changes in infancy are associated with future cardiovascular risk. This study suggests that associations between early overweight and subsequent adverse cardiovascular health are largely due to overweight children tending to remain overweight."
https://openalex.org/W1970451495,"Background Specific differences in signaling and antiviral properties between the different Lambda-interferons, a novel group of interferons composed of IL-28A, IL-28B and IL-29, are currently unknown. This is the first study comparatively investigating the transcriptome and the antiviral properties of the Lambda-interferons IL-28A and IL-29. Methodology/Principal Findings Expression studies were performed by microarray analysis, quantitative PCR (qPCR), reporter gene assays and immunoluminometric assays. Signaling was analyzed by Western blot. HCV replication was measured in Huh-7 cells expressing subgenomic HCV replicon. All hepatic cell lines investigated as well as primary hepatocytes expressed both IFN-λ receptor subunits IL-10R2 and IFN-λR1. Both, IL-28A and IL-29 activated STAT1 signaling. As revealed by microarray analysis, similar genes were induced by both cytokines in Huh-7 cells (IL-28A: 117 genes; IL-29: 111 genes), many of them playing a role in antiviral immunity. However, only IL-28A was able to significantly down-regulate gene expression (n = 272 down-regulated genes). Both cytokines significantly decreased HCV replication in Huh-7 cells. In comparison to liver biopsies of patients with non-viral liver disease, liver biopsies of patients with HCV showed significantly increased mRNA expression of IL-28A and IL-29. Moreover, IL-28A serum protein levels were elevated in HCV patients. In a murine model of viral hepatitis, IL-28 expression was significantly increased. Conclusions/Significance IL-28A and IL-29 are up-regulated in HCV patients and are similarly effective in inducing antiviral genes and inhibiting HCV replication. In contrast to IL-29, IL-28A is a potent gene repressor. Both IFN-λs may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic HCV."
https://openalex.org/W1967772712,"Acetaminophen (AAP) is widely prescribed for treatment of mild pain and fever in western countries. It is generally considered a safe drug and the most frequently reported adverse effect associated with acetaminophen is hepatotoxicity, which generally occurs after acute overdose. During AAP overdose, encephalopathy might develop and contribute to morbidity and mortality. Our hypothesis is that AAP causes direct neuronal toxicity contributing to the general AAP toxicity syndrome.We report that AAP causes direct toxicity on rat cortical neurons both in vitro and in vivo as measured by LDH release. We have found that AAP causes concentration-dependent neuronal death in vitro at concentrations (1 and 2 mM) that are reached in human plasma during AAP overdose, and that are also reached in the cerebrospinal fluid of rats for 3 hours following i.p injection of AAP doses (250 and 500 mg/kg) that are below those required to induce acute hepatic failure in rats. AAP also increases both neuronal cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2E1 enzymatic activity and protein levels as determined by Western blot, leading to neuronal death through mitochondrial-mediated mechanisms that involve cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation. In addition, in vivo experiments show that i.p. AAP (250 and 500 mg/kg) injection induces neuronal death in the rat cortex as measured by TUNEL, validating the in vitro data.The data presented here establish, for the first time, a direct neurotoxic action by AAP both in vivo and in vitro in rats at doses below those required to produce hepatotoxicity and suggest that this neurotoxicity might be involved in the general toxic syndrome observed during patient APP overdose and, possibly, also when AAP doses in the upper dosing schedule are used, especially if other risk factors (moderate drinking, fasting, nutritional impairment) are present."
https://openalex.org/W2030758070,"The DEAD box helicase DDX3 assembles IPS-1 (also called Cardif, MAVS, or VISA) in non-infected human cells where minimal amounts of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) protein are expressed. DDX3 C-terminal regions directly bind the IPS-1 CARD-like domain as well as the N-terminal hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein. DDX3 physically binds viral RNA to form IPS-1-containing spots, that are visible by confocal microscopy. HCV polyU/UC induced IPS-1-mediated interferon (IFN)-beta promoter activation, which was augmented by co-transfected DDX3. DDX3 spots localized near the lipid droplets (LDs) where HCV particles were generated. Here, we report that HCV core protein interferes with DDX3-enhanced IPS-1 signaling in HEK293 cells and in hepatocyte Oc cells. Unlike the DEAD box helicases RIG-I and MDA5, DDX3 was constitutively expressed and colocalized with IPS-1 around mitochondria. In hepatocytes (O cells) with the HCV replicon, however, DDX3/IPS-1-enhanced IFN-beta-induction was largely abrogated even when DDX3 was co-expressed. DDX3 spots barely merged with IPS-1, and partly assembled in the HCV core protein located near the LD in O cells, though in some O cells IPS-1 was diminished or disseminated apart from mitochondria. Expression of DDX3 in replicon-negative or core-less replicon-positive cells failed to cause complex formation or LD association. HCV core protein and DDX3 partially colocalized only in replicon-expressing cells. Since the HCV core protein has been reported to promote HCV replication through binding to DDX3, the core protein appears to switch DDX3 from an IFN-inducing mode to an HCV-replication mode. The results enable us to conclude that HCV infection is promoted by modulating the dual function of DDX3."
https://openalex.org/W2160734670,"Childhood diet is important for brain development. Furthermore, the quality of breakfast is thought to affect the cognitive functioning of well-nourished children. To analyze the relationship among breakfast staple type, gray matter volume, and intelligence quotient (IQ) in 290 healthy children, we used magnetic resonance images and applied voxel-based morphometry. We divided subjects into rice, bread, and both groups according to their breakfast staple. We showed that the rice group had a significantly larger gray matter ratio (gray matter volume percentage divided by intracranial volume) and significantly larger regional gray matter volumes of several regions, including the left superior temporal gyrus. The bread group had significantly larger regional gray and white matter volumes of several regions, including the right frontoparietal region. The perceptual organization index (POI; IQ subcomponent) of the rice group was significantly higher than that of the bread group. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, intracranial volume, socioeconomic status, average weekly frequency of having breakfast, and number of side dishes eaten for breakfast. Although several factors may have affected the results, one possible mechanism underlying the difference between the bread and the rice groups may be the difference in the glycemic index (GI) of these two substances; foods with a low GI are associated with less blood-glucose fluctuation than are those with a high GI. Our study suggests that breakfast staple type affects brain gray and white matter volumes and cognitive function in healthy children; therefore, a diet of optimal nutrition is important for brain maturation during childhood and adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W1991111575,"Background Transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance (TDR) is an ongoing public health problem, representing 10–20% of new HIV infections in many geographic areas. TDR usually arises from two main sources: individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who are failing to achieve virologic suppression, and individuals who acquired TDR and transmit it while still ART-naïve. TDR rates can be impacted when novel antiretroviral medications are introduced that allow for greater virologic suppression of source patients. Although several new HIV medications were introduced starting in late 2007, including raltegravir, maraviroc, and etravirine, it is not known whether the prevalence of TDR was subsequently affected in 2008–2009. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed population sequence genotyping on individuals who were diagnosed with acute or early HIV (<6 months duration) and who enrolled in the Options Project, a prospective cohort, between 2002 and 2009. We used logistic regression to compare the odds of acquiring drug-resistant HIV before versus after the arrival of new ART (2005–2007 vs. 2008–2009). From 2003–2007, TDR rose from 7% to 24%. Prevalence of TDR was then 15% in 2008 and in 2009. While the odds of acquiring TDR were lower in 2008–2009 compared to 2005–2007, this was not statistically significant (odds ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.31–1.38; p = 0.27). Conclusions Our study suggests that transmitted drug resistance rose from 2003–2007, but this upward trend did not continue in 2008 and 2009. Nevertheless, the TDR prevalence in 2008–2009 remained substantial, emphasizing that improved management strategies for drug-resistant HIV are needed if TDR is to be further reduced. Continued surveillance for TDR will be important in understanding the full impact of new antiretroviral medications."
https://openalex.org/W2033937045,"Background Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a marker of liver injury. The 2005 American Gastroenterology Association Future Trends Committee report states that serum ALT levels remain constant with age. This study examines the association between serum ALT and age in a community-dwelling cohort in the United States. Methods A cross-sectional study of 2,364 (54% female) participants aged 30–93 years from the Rancho Bernardo Study cohort who attended a research clinic visit in 1984–87. Demographic, metabolic co-variates, ALT, bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), albumin, and adiposity signaling biomarkers (leptin, IL-6, adiponectin, ghrelin) were measured. Participants were divided into four-groups based upon age quartile, and multivariable-adjusted least squares of means (LSM) were examined (p for trend <0.05). Results ALT decreased with increasing age, with mean ALT levels (IU/L) of 23, 21, 20, and 17 for those between quartile ages 30–62, 63–71, 72–77, and 78–93 years (p<0.0001). Trends of decreasing LSM ALT with age and the decreasing prevalence of categorically defined elevated serum ALT with age remained robust after adjusting for sex, alcohol use, metabolic syndrome components, and biomarkers of adiposity (p-value <0.0001), and was not materially changed after adjusting for bilirubin, GGT, and albumin. Conclusions ALT levels decrease with age in both men and women independent of metabolic syndrome components, adiposity signaling biomarkers, and other commonly used liver function tests. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms responsible for a decline in ALT with age, and to establish the optimal cut-point of normal ALT in the elderly."

We examined the relationship between women's self-reported experiences of IPV in their most recent relationship and their laboratory-confirmed HIV serostatus in ten low- to middle-income countries.Data for the study came from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in Dominican Republic, Haiti, India, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Each survey population was a cross-sectional sample of women aged 15-49 years. Information on IPV was obtained by a face-to-face interview with the mother with an 81.1% response rate; information on HIV serostatus was obtained from blood samples with an 85.3% response rate. Demographic and socioeconomic variables were considered as potentially confounding covariates. Logistic regression models accounting for multi-stage survey design were estimated individually for each country and as a pooled total with country fixed effects (n = 60,114). Country-specific adjusted odds ratios (OR) for physical or sexual IPV compared to neither ranged from 0.45 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.90] in Haiti to 1.35 [95% CI: 0.95-1.90] in India; the pooled association was 1.03 [95% CI: 0.94-1.13]. Country-specific adjusted ORs for physical and sexual IPV compared to no sexual IPV ranged from 0.41 [95% CI: 0.12-1.36] in Haiti to 1.41 [95% CI: 0.26-7.77] in Mali; the pooled association was 1.05 [95% CI: 0.90-1.22].IPV and HIV were not found to be consistently associated amongst ever-married women in national population samples in these lower income countries, suggesting that IPV is not consistently associated with HIV prevalence worldwide. More research is needed to understand the circumstances in which IPV and HIV are and are not associated with one another."

To further characterize their genome variation, we employed integration of data from CGH, genome sequencing and putative cellular pathways. Transcontinental strain comparison using CGH data confirmed the emergence of a human-specific hypervirulent cluster. However, there was no correlation between total toxin production and hypervirulent phenotype, indicating the possibility of involvement of additional factors towards hypervirulence. Calculation of C. difficile core and pan genome size using CGH and sequence data estimated that the core genome is composed of 947 to 1,033 genes and a pan genome comprised of 9,640 genes. The reconstruction, annotation and analysis of cellular pathways revealed highly conserved pathways despite large genome variation. However, few pathways such as tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis were found to be variable and could be contributing to adaptation towards virulence such as antibiotic resistance."

Using fluorescence protease protection assays, we show that human TPC1 and TPC2 possess cytosolic N and C termini and therefore an even number of transmembrane regions. Fluorophores placed at position 225 or 347 in TPC1, or 339 in TPC2 were also cytosolic, whereas a fluorophore at position 628 in TPC1 was luminal. These data together with sequence similarity to voltage-gated Ca2+ and Na+ channels, and unbiased in silico predictions are consistent with a topology in which two homologous domains are present, each comprising 6 transmembrane regions and a re-entrant pore loop. Immunocytochemical analysis of selectively permeabilized cells using antipeptide antibodies confirmed that the C-terminal tails of recombinant TPCs are cytosolic and that residues 240–254 of TPC2 prior to putative pore 1 are luminal. Both TPC1 and TPC2 are N-glycosylated with residues 599, 611, and 616 contributing to glycosylation of TPC1. This confirms the luminal position of these residues, which immediately precede the putative pore loop of the second domain. Mutation of all three glycosylation sites in TPC1 enhances NAADP-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Our data establish essential features of the topology of two-pore channels. Two-pore channels (TPCs) localize to the endolysosomal system and have recently emerged as targets for the Ca2+-mobilizing messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). However, their membrane topology is unknown.

https://openalex.org/W2054679538,"Exposure to stress causes differential neural modifications in various limbic regions, namely the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. We investigated whether α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) phosphorylation is involved with these stress effects. Using an acute inescapable stress protocol with rats, we found opposite effects on AMPA receptor phosphorylation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampus (DH) compared to the amygdala and ventral hippocampus (VH). After stress, the phosphorylation of Ser831-GluA1 was markedly decreased in the mPFC and DH, whereas the phosphorylation of Ser845-GluA1 was increased in the amygdala and VH. Stress also modulated the GluA2 subunit with a decrease in the phosphorylation of both Tyr876-GluA2 and Ser880-GluA2 residues in the amygdala, and an increase in the phosphorylation of Ser880-GluA2 in the mPFC. These results demonstrate that exposure to acute stress causes subunit-specific and region-specific changes in glutamatergic transmission, which likely lead to the reduced synaptic efficacy in the mPFC and DH and augmented activity in the amygdala and VH. In addition, these findings suggest that modifications of glutamate receptor phosphorylation could mediate the disruptive effects of stress on cognition. They also provide a means to reconcile the contrasting effects that stress has on synaptic plasticity in these regions. Taken together, the results provide support for a brain region-oriented approach to therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2039725815,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) completes its final envelopment on intracellular membranes before it is released from the cell. The mechanisms underlying these processes are not understood. Here we studied the role of Rab27a, a regulator of lysosome-related organelle transport, in HCMV production. HCMV infection increased Rab27a expression, and recruitment of Rab27a to membranous strutures at the assembly site. Immuno-gold labelling demonstrated association of Rab27a with viral envelopes. CMV production was reduced after knock-down of Rab27a, and in Rab27a-deficient ashen melanocytes. This study shows a requirement for Rab27a in the CMV life cycle and suggests that CMV and LRO biogenesis share common molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2114406183,"Objective Functional studies show that disruption of endothelial surface layer (ESL) is accompanied by enhanced sensitivity of the vasculature towards atherogenic stimuli. However, relevance of ESL disruption as causal mechanism for vascular dysfunction remains to be demonstrated. We examined if loss of ESL through enzymatic degradation would affect vascular barrier properties in an atherogenic model. Methods Eight week old male apolipoprotein E deficient mice on Western-type diet for 10 weeks received continuous active or heat-inactivated hyaluronidase (10 U/hr, i.v.) through an osmotic minipump during 4 weeks. Blood chemistry and anatomic changes in both macrovasculature and kidneys were examined. Results Infusion with active hyaluronidase resulted in decreased ESL (0.32±0.22 mL) and plasma volume (1.03±0.18 mL) compared to inactivated hyaluronidase (0.52±0.29 mL and 1.28±0.08 mL, p<0.05 respectively).Active hyaluronidase increased proteinuria compared to inactive hyaluronidase (0.27±0.02 vs. 0.15±0.01 µg/µg protein/creatinin, p<0.05) without changes in glomerular morphology or development of tubulo-interstitial inflammation. Atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic branches showed increased matrix production (collagen, 32±5 vs. 18±3%; glycosaminoglycans, 11±5 vs. 0.1±0.01%, active vs. inactive hyaluronidase, p<0.05). Conclusion ESL degradation in apoE deficient mice contributes to reduced increased urinary protein excretion without significant changes in renal morphology. Second, the induction of compositional changes in atherogenic plaques by hyaluronidase point towards increased plaque vulnerability. These findings support further efforts to evaluate whether ESL restoration is a valuable target to prevent (micro) vascular disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W1996813635,Intracellular proteins have a great potential as targets for therapeutic antibodies (Abs) but the plasma membrane prevents access to these antigens. Ab fragments and IgGs are selected and engineered in E. coli and this microorganism may be also an ideal vector for their intracellular delivery. In this work we demonstrate that single-domain Ab (sdAbs) can be engineered to be injected into human cells by E. coli bacteria carrying molecular syringes assembled by a type III protein secretion system (T3SS). The injected sdAbs accumulate in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells at levels ca. 10⁵-10⁶ molecules per cell and their functionality is shown by the isolation of sdAb-antigen complexes. Injection of sdAbs does not require bacterial invasion or the transfer of genetic material. These results are proof-of-principle for the capacity of E. coli bacteria to directly deliver intracellular sdAbs (intrabodies) into human cells for analytical and therapeutic purposes.
https://openalex.org/W2092201906,"Background Several studies have established impaired sleep is a common problem among nurses. Overworked, fatigued and stressed nurses are at a higher risk of making mistakes that threaten patient safety as well as their own health. The aim of the present study was to longitudinally monitor the development of sleep quality in nurses, starting from the last semester at the university, with three subsequent annual follow-ups once the nurses had entered working life. Methodology/Principal Findings Nationwide, longitudinal questionnaire study of nursing students and newly qualified nurses in Sweden. The results imply a continuous decline in sleep quality among nurses during the three years of follow-up, starting from their last semester of nursing education and continuing for three years into their working life. The most pronounced short-term decline in sleep quality seems to occur in the transition between student life and working life. Conclusion/Significance This finding is important since it may affect the quality of care and the health of nurses negatively."
https://openalex.org/W2081720088,"Background Auditory mate or prey localisation is central to the lifestyle of many animals and requires precise directional hearing. However, when the incident angle of sound approaches 0° azimuth, interaural time and intensity differences gradually vanish. This poses a demanding challenge to animals especially when interaural distances are small. To cope with these limitations imposed by the laws of acoustics, crickets employ a frequency tuned peripheral hearing system. Although this enhances auditory directionality the actual precision of directional hearing and phonotactic steering has never been studied in the behaviourally important frontal range. Principal Findings Here we analysed the directionality of phonotaxis in female crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) walking on an open-loop trackball system by measuring their steering accuracy towards male calling song presented at frontal angles of incidence. Within the range of ±30°, females reliably discriminated the side of acoustic stimulation, even when the sound source deviated by only 1° from the animal's length axis. Moreover, for angles of sound incidence between 1° and 6° the females precisely walked towards the sound source. Measuring the tympanic membrane oscillations of the front leg ears with a laser vibrometer revealed between 0° and 30° a linear increasing function of interaural amplitude differences with a slope of 0.4 dB/°. Auditory nerve recordings closely reflected these bilateral differences in afferent response latency and intensity that provide the physiological basis for precise auditory steering. Conclusions Our experiments demonstrate that an insect hearing system based on a frequency-tuned pressure difference receiver achieves directional hyperacuity which easily rivals best directional hearing in mammals and birds. Moreover, this directional accuracy of the cricket's hearing system is reflected in the animal's phonotactic motor response."
https://openalex.org/W2021164198,"Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are stress induced proteins with immunomodulatory properties. The Hsp70 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TBHsp70) has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory role on rodent autoimmune arthritis models, and the protective effects were demonstrated to be dependent on interleukin-10 (IL-10). We have previously observed that TBHsp70 inhibited maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and induced IL-10 production by these cells, as well as in synovial fluid cells.We investigated if TBHsp70 could inhibit allograft rejection in two murine allograft systems, a transplanted allogeneic melanoma and a regular skin allograft. In both systems, treatment with TBHsp70 significantly inhibited rejection of the graft, and correlated with regulatory T cells (Tregs) recruitment. This effect was not tumor mediated because injection of TBHsp70 in tumor-free mice induced an increase of Tregs in the draining lymph nodes as well as inhibition of proliferation of lymph node T cells and an increase in IL-10 production. Finally, TBHsp70 inhibited skin allograft acute rejection, and depletion of Tregs using a monoclonal antibody completely abolished this effect.We present the first evidence for an immunosuppressive role for this protein in a graft rejection system, using an innovative approach--immersion of the graft tissue in TBHsp70 solution instead of protein injection. Also, this is the first study that demonstrates dependence on Treg cells for the immunosuppressive role of TBHsp70. This finding is relevant for the elucidation of the immunomodulatory mechanism of TBHsp70. We propose that this protein can be used not only for chronic inflammatory diseases, but is also useful for organ transplantation management."
https://openalex.org/W2035854148,"The success of high resolution genetic mapping of disease predisposition and quantitative trait loci in humans and experimental animals depends on the positions of key crossover events around the gene of interest. In mammals, the majority of recombination occurs at highly delimited 1-2 kb long sites known as recombination hotspots, whose locations and activities are distributed unevenly along the chromosomes and are tightly regulated in a sex specific manner. The factors determining the location of hotspots started to emerge with the finding of PRDM9 as a major hotspot regulator in mammals, however, additional factors modulating hotspot activity and sex specificity are yet to be defined. To address this limitation, we have collected and mapped the locations of 4829 crossover events occurring on mouse chromosome 11 in 5858 meioses of male and female reciprocal F1 hybrids of C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ mice. This chromosome was chosen for its medium size and high gene density and provided a comparison with our previous analysis of recombination on the longest mouse chromosome 1. Crossovers were mapped to an average resolution of 127 kb, and thirteen hotspots were mapped to <8 kb. Most crossovers occurred in a small number of the most active hotspots. Females had higher recombination rate than males as a consequence of differences in crossover interference and regional variation of sex specific rates along the chromosome. Comparison with chromosome 1 showed that recombination events tend to be positioned in similar fashion along the centromere-telomere axis but independently of the local gene density. It appears that mammalian recombination is regulated on at least three levels, chromosome-wide, regional, and at individual hotspots, and these regulation levels are influenced by sex and genetic background but not by gene content."
https://openalex.org/W2154741721,"Yersinia adhesin A (YadA) is an essential virulence factor for the food-borne pathogens Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Surprisingly, it is a pseudogene in Yersinia pestis. Even more intriguing, the introduction of a functional yadA gene in Y. pestis EV76 was shown to correlate with a decrease in virulence in a mouse model. Here, we report that wild type (wt) Y. enterocolitica E40, as well as YadA-deprived E40 induced the synthesis of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) upon contact with neutrophils, but only YadA-expressing Y. enterocolitica adhered to NETs and were killed. As binding seemed to be a prerequisite for killing, we searched for YadA-binding substrates and detected the presence of collagen within NETs. E40 bacteria expressing V98D,N99A mutant YadA with a severely reduced ability to bind collagen were found to be more resistant to killing, suggesting that collagen binding contributes significantly to sensitivity to NETs. Wt Y. pestis EV76 were resistant to killing by NETs, while recombinant EV76 expressing YadA from either Y. pseudotuberculosis or Y. enterocolitica were sensitive to killing by NETs, outlining the importance of YadA for susceptibility to NET-dependent killing. Recombinant EV76 endowed with YadA from Y. enterocolitica were also less virulent for the mouse than wt EV76, as shown before. In addition, EV76 carrying wt YadA were less virulent for the mouse than EV76 expressing YadA(V₉₈D,N₉₉A). The observation that YadA makes Yersinia sensitive to NETs provides an explanation as for why evolution selected for the inactivation of yadA in the flea-borne Y. pestis and clarifies an old enigma. Since YadA imposes the same cost to the food-borne Yersinia but was nevertheless conserved by evolution, this observation also illustrates the duality of some virulence functions."
https://openalex.org/W2049246694,"The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily is a multifunctional hemethiolate enzyme that is widely distributed from Bacteria to Eukarya. The CYP3 family contains mainly the four subfamilies CYP3A, CYP3B, CYP3C and CYP3D in vertebrates; however, only the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) have all four subfamilies and detailed understanding of the evolutionary relationship of Actinopterygii CYP3 family members would be valuable.Phylogenetic relationships were constructed to trace the evolutionary history of the Actinopterygii CYP3 family genes. Selection analysis, relative rate tests and functional divergence analysis were combined to interpret the relationship of the site-specific evolution and functional divergence in the Actinopterygii CYP3 family. The results showed that the four CYP3 subfamilies in Actinopterygii might be formed by gene duplication. The first gene duplication event was responsible for divergence of the CYP3B/C clusters from ancient CYP3 before the origin of the Actinopterygii, which corresponded to the fish-specific whole genome duplication (WGD). Tandem repeat duplication in each of the homologue clusters produced stable CYP3B, CYP3C, CYP3A and CYP3D subfamilies. Acceleration of asymmetric evolutionary rates and purifying selection together were the main force for the production of new subfamilies and functional divergence in the new subset after gene duplication, whereas positive selection was detected only in the retained CYP3A subfamily. Furthermore, nearly half of the functional divergence sites appear to be related to substrate recognition, which suggests that site-specific evolution is closely related with functional divergence in the Actinopterygii CYP3 family.The split of fish-specific CYP3 subfamilies was related to the fish-specific WGD, and site-specific acceleration of asymmetric evolutionary rates and purifying selection was the main force for the origin of the new subfamilies and functional divergence in the new subset after gene duplication.

To address this disparity, we investigated isolated brain and in situ neuronal and astrocytic mitochondria from cypD-deficient and wild-type mice. Isolated mitochondria were challenged by high Ca2+, and the effects of substrates and respiratory chain inhibitors were evaluated on permeability transition pore opening by light scatter. In situ neuronal and astrocytic mitochondria were visualized by mito-DsRed2 targeting and challenged by calcimycin, and the effects of glucose, NaCN, and an uncoupler were evaluated by measuring mitochondrial volume. In isolated mitochondria, Ca2+ caused a large cypD-dependent change in light scatter in the absence of substrates that was insensitive to Ruthenium red or Ru360. Uniporter inhibitors only partially affected the entry of free Ca2+ in the matrix. Inhibition of complex III/IV negated the effect of substrates, but inhibition of complex I was protective.

Ever since, the contribution of cypD in a variety of diseases has been strongly suggested or proven (for review, see Ref. 5Giorgio V. Soriano M.E. Basso E. Bisetto E. Lippe G. Forte M.A. Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), a momentum that was assisted by the wide availability of cypD knock-out (KO) mice. These studies converged to the conclusion that cypD-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) regulates some forms of necrotic, but not apoptotic death. The notion in which PTP is involved in necrosis but not apoptosis has been originally suggested by the group of Crompton and colleagues (6Li Y. Johnson N. Capano M. Edwards M. Crompton M. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A major difference among prerequisites for the manifestation of necrosis versus apoptosis is energy availability; a sufficient decline in energy reserves, primarily in ATP concentration, is a switch for a cell to die by necrosis rather than apoptosis (7Leist M.

Sci. 2003; 991: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the conundrum appears that excessive Ca2+ induces PTP under conditions unfavorable for electrophoretic Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria (13Vajda S.

Some studies address this by proposing that in ischemia-reperfusion, Ca2+-induced PTP occurs during reperfusion of the affected tissue, but in several experimental models mimicking pathology, mitochondrial damage caused by excessive Ca2+ uptake did not involve restoration of bioenergetic functions. Partial resolution of this apparent contradiction came from an insightful work by the group of Bernardi demonstrating that the threshold for PTP induction by Ca2+ is modulated by the proton electrochemical gradient (14Bernardi P.

Specifically, they have shown that the more depolarized mitochondria are, the higher the likelihood that they will exhibit PTP induced by Ca2+. Later on, the same group extended its findings by showing that pyridine nucleotides and dithiol oxidation of specific sites also modulate the pore (19Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V.

All experiments were performed at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity was measured in a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) using 517-nm excitation and 535-nm emission wavelengths. Swelling of isolated mitochondria was assessed by measuring light scatter at 520 nm in a GBC UV/visible 920 spectrophotometer.

At the end of each experiment, the nonselective pore-forming peptide alamethicin (40 μg) was added as a calibration standard to cause maximal swelling. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. ΔΨm was estimated fluorometrically with safranine O (27Akerman K.E. Wikström M.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar).

Fluorescence was recorded in a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer at a 5-Hz acquisition rate, using 495- and 585-nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Experiments were performed at 37 °C. To convert safranine O fluorescence into millivolts, a voltage-fluorescence calibration curve was constructed. To this end, safranine O fluorescence was recorded in the presence of 2 nm valinomycin and stepwise increasing K+ (in the 0.2–120 mm range) which allowed calculation of ΔΨm by the Nernst equation assuming a matrix K+ = 120 mm (27Akerman K.E. Wikström M.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Visualization of isolated mitochondria under epifluorescence imaging (Nikon Plan Fluor 100 × 1.3 NA) was achieved by loading mitochondria with fura-2/AM (8 μm for 20 min at 30 °C). Mitochondria were diluted to 1 mg/ml, and 5 μl was dropped on a coverslip, allowed to stand for 4 min prior to starting the perfusion. Image sequences (10 s/ratio frame, 50-ms exposure time, 2 × 2 binning) were acquired using an Micromax cooled digital CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) mounted on a Nikon Diaphot 200 inverted microscope (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Image acquisition was controlled by Metafluor 3.5 (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). The perfusate (120 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6, 50 ml/h flow rate) was temperature-controlled at 37 °C. Mixed primary cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes were prepared from cypD-KO or wild-type (WT) mice pups (P 0–1). Cells were grown on poly-l-ornithine-coated 8-well LabTek II chambered coverglasses (Nunc, Rochester, NY) for 7–12 days, at a density of ∼105 cells/well in Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 supplement and 2 mm glutamine (Sigma). Cultures were transfected at 7–9 days with mito-DsRed2 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Neurobasal medium at a 3:2 ratio of Lipofectamine (μl) to plasmid DNA (μg). Experiments were carried out at day 1–2 after transfection. Typical transfection rates were low, and therefore individual, nonoverlapping cells were visualized. Time lapse epifluorescence microscopy was carried out to image cells expressing mito-DsRed2 at 37 °C without superfusion in a medium containing 120 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 15 mm glucose at pH 7.4. For some experiments (detailed below) neurons were loaded with fura-FF/AM (2 μm) for 20 min before imaging. Experiments were performed on an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a 60 × 1.4 NA oil immersion lens, a Bioprecision-2 xy-stage (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd., Hawthorne, NY), and a 75W xenon arc lamp (Lambda LS; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). For DsRed2 an 535/20 nm exciter, a 555LP dichroic mirror, and an 570LP emitter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) were used. Time lapses of z-series of 16 planes of 512 × 512-pixel frames (digitized at 14bit with no binning, 250-ms exposure time, yielding 0.1-μm pixel size and 0.8-μm z-spacing) were acquired using an ORCA-ER2 cooled digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) under control of MetaMorph 6.0 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For fura-FF a 340/26-nm and a 387/11-nm exciter (Semrock, Rochester, NY), a 405LP dichroic mirror, and a 475LP emitter (Omega Optical) were used, and single plane images were recorded after each DsRed2 z-stack. Mitochondrial swelling was measured by the thinness ratio (TR) technique (28Gerencser A.A. Doczi J. Töröcsik B. Bossy-Wetzel E. Adam-Vizi V. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 2583-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, the TR technique measures changes of average diameters of thread-like or punctate structures in fluorescence images using a pair of (high and low frequency) bandpass spatial filters. A calibration image series of mito-DsRed2 fluorescence showing mitochondrial swelling by valinomycin (200 nm) was recorded and used to train a spatial bandpass filter set in Image Analyst MKII (Image Analyst Software, Novato, CA). To calculate TR, for each time point the z-stack was mean intensity-projected, and the projection image was duplicated. Then, both images were spatially filtered, and the absolute value of pixels was taken. The TR was calculated as the ratio of the average fluorescence intensity in the high frequency bandpass-filtered over the low frequency bandpass-filtered image. Mitochondrial swelling causes the loss of high spatial frequency image details, therefore a decrease in the TR value. Base-line normalized TR is given as δTR = (TR − TR0)/TR0. Isolated brain and liver mitochondria were solubilized at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set I; Calbiochem). Solubilized mitochondria were rapidly frozen and stored at −70 °C until further manipulation. Upon thawing, the protein concentration of the samples was estimated by the Bradford assay. Subsequently, samples were mixed with 50 mm dithiothreitol and NuPage loading buffer (Invitrogen) and heated to 70° for 10 min. The samples were then loaded (25 μg/lane) on a 4–12% BisTris gel, and separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide and sodium bisulfite (10% w/v). Separated proteins were transferred to a methanol-activated polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Mouse monoclonal anti-cypD (Mitosciences, Eugene, OR) primary antibody was used at 1 μg/ml. Immunoreactivity was detected using the appropriate peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Jackson Immunochemicals Europe, Cambridgeshire, UK) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (ECL system; Amersham Biosciences). Upon completion of Western blotting the blots were stained with Ponceau S (0.5% Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid), and loading of individual lanes was assessed by densitometric analysis (Scion Image, version alpha 4.0.3.2; Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Standard laboratory chemicals, cys A, calcimycin, and alamethicin were from Sigma. Ru360 was from Calbiochem. SF 6847 was from BIOMOL. Calcium Green 5N 6K+ salt was from Invitrogen. Mito-DsRed2 was purchased from Clontech. Mitochondrial substrate stock solutions were dissolved in bi-distilled water and titrated to pH 7.0 with KOH. Electrophoretic Ca2+ uptake for induction of PTP is allowed either in the presence of respiratory substrates or in a substrate-free medium containing KSCN; diffusion of the lipophilic SCN− anion provides the driving force for electrophoretic Ca2+ accumulation (29Selwyn M.J. Dawson A.P. Dunnett S.J. FEBS Lett. 1970; 10: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, in the original studies by Hunter and Haworth it was shown that PTP can be induced by Ca2+ in the absence of respiratory substrates (31Hunter D.R. Haworth R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that has been subsequently reproduced (32Yamamoto T. Yoshimura Y. Yamada A. Gouda S. Yamashita K. Yamazaki N.

Furthermore, it was also shown that substrates delay Ca2+-induced PTP (33Rigobello M.P. Turcato F. Bindoli A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Moore G.A. Jewell S.A. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), in accordance to the Bernardi scheme mentioned above. To reproduce these findings for our studies, isolated brain mitochondria were challenged by CaCl2, in the presence and absence of glutamate and malate, and light scattering was recorded spectrophotometrically at 520 nm. A three-pulse CaCl2 protocol was used for this and all subsequent similar experiments: 20 μm CaCl2 was given at 100 s, followed by 200 μm CaCl2 at 300 s and again at 500 s. Orange lines appearing in Figs. 1, 2, and 4 are control trace lines obtained from WT mitochondria not exposed to CaCl2. As shown in Fig. 1A, addition of 20 μm CaCl2 to substrate-supplemented or substrate-starved brain mitochondria of WT mice did not cause a decrease in light scatter; instead, a cessation in the initial base-line decrease was observed. However, the subsequent 200 μm CaCl2 pulse induced a large decrease in light scatter in substrate-starved but not substrate-supplemented mitochondria. The next 200 μm CaCl2 pulse given at 500 s did not induce any further changes in substrate-starved mitochondria, but caused a decrease in substrate-supplemented mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 1B, the effect of the first 200 μm CaCl2 pulse was cys A-sensitive; however, the second addition of 200 μm CaCl2 overrode the protective effect of cys A, consistent with the findings by Brustovetsky and Dubinsky (23Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8229-8237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B the effect of the pore-forming peptide alamethicin is also shown, so that the extent of changes in light scatter induced by CaCl2 can be better appreciated compared with maximum changes. Subsequent experiments benefitted from the availability of cypD-KO mice. We isolated mitochondria from the brains of WT and cypD-KO mice (see Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, results obtained from substrate-starved mitochondria from cypD-KO mice were strikingly similar to those obtained from cys A-treated WT mice (Fig. 1B). The presence of substrates, however, did not provide additional protection in the cypD-KO mitochondria (Fig. 1E). Maximum swelling rates pooled from all experiments (expressed as percentage of swelling rate/minute and accounting for the condition producing the highest swelling rate as “maximum”) for each condition and after each Ca2+ pulse is shown in Fig. 1G. These results are in accord with earlier reports on various types of mitochondria and conditions, showing that high Ca2+ loads can induce PTP in the absence of substrates. In our hands, absence of substrates prevented isolated mitochondria from building a membrane potential of higher than −10 mV (data not shown). At this ΔΨm value, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is unfavorable (13Vajda S. Mándi M. Konràd C. Kiss G. Ambrus A. Adam-Vizi V. Chinopoulos C. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2713-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Indeed, recordings of extramitochondrial Ca2+ by Calcium Green 5N revealed that in the absence of substrates (Fig. 1F, traces c, d, and e) mitochondria were unable to perform Ca2+ sequestration, yet exhibited large changes in light scatter. Electron microscopy imaging of mitochondria that exhibited large changes in light scatter confirmed that this was due to swelling (data not shown). We therefore considered the possibilities that Ca2+ was either inducing cypD-sensitive swelling by acting on an extramitochondrial site, or because high amounts of CaCl2 were required, Ca2+ was entering mitochondria simply by a chemical gradient.FIGURE 2Effect of SF 6847 and/or inhibitors of the Ca2+ uniporter on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake; modulation by cyclosporin A or genetic deletion of cyclophilin D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10223-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, WT mitochondria still exhibited high Ca2+-induced changes in light scatter in the presence of Ru360, at a concentration that was found to prevent the uptake of extramitochondrial Ca2+ (Fig. 1F, trace e). The lack of effect of Ru360 was also observed in the presence of cys A (Fig. 2A), or when the effect of Ca2+ was compared in WT versus cypD-KO mitochondria (Fig. 2B). To depolarize mitochondria completely, 1 μm SF 6847 was added to the medium, and the effects of Ca2+ and Ru360 were recorded. As shown in Fig. 2C, the presence of the uncoupler failed to provide extra protection against high Ca2+-induced swelling. Furthermore, the presence of the uncoupler negated the protective effects of substrates in WT mitochondria (Fig. 2D). Maximum swelling rates pooled from all experiments (expressed as in Fig. 1) for each condition and after each Ca2+ pulse are shown in Fig. 2E. The failure of Ru360 to protect against the Ca2+-induced large changes in light scatter shown in Fig. 2, A and B, could be explained by assuming that Ca2+ acted on the extramitochondrial side. To provide further evidence for this, we loaded isolated mitochondria with fura-2 and imaged them under wide field epifluorescence (Fig. 3A). This experimental setup (i) benefits from the spatial resolution in fura-2 imaging, avoiding a “contaminant” signal of leaked fura-2 in the extramitochondrial space and (ii) provides a valid quantitative signal of matrix [Ca2+] in the submicromolar range. Surprisingly, isolated mitochondria perfused with a buffer containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 showed robust increases in matrix-entrapped fura-2 fluorescence that exhibited only a partial sensitivity to Ru360 (10 μm) and Ruthenium red (10 μm) (Fig. 3B), arguing against the assumption that Ca2+ was acting exclusively on an extramitochondrial site when inducing changes in light scatter. To address the contribution of respiratory chain components to the protective effect of substrates against the Ca2+-induced changes in light scatter, we pretreated mitochondria with complex I (rotenone or piericidin A), complex III (myxothiazol or stigmatell"
https://openalex.org/W2149786015,"Background A trend towards automation of scientific research has recently resulted in what has been termed “data-driven inquiry” in various disciplines, including physics and biology. The automation of many tasks has been identified as a possible future also for the humanities and the social sciences, particularly in those disciplines concerned with the analysis of text, due to the recent availability of millions of books and news articles in digital format. In the social sciences, the analysis of news media is done largely by hand and in a hypothesis-driven fashion: the scholar needs to formulate a very specific assumption about the patterns that might be in the data, and then set out to verify if they are present or not. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we report what we think is the first large scale content-analysis of cross-linguistic text in the social sciences, by using various artificial intelligence techniques. We analyse 1.3 M news articles in 22 languages detecting a clear structure in the choice of stories covered by the various outlets. This is significantly affected by objective national, geographic, economic and cultural relations among outlets and countries, e.g., outlets from countries sharing strong economic ties are more likely to cover the same stories. We also show that the deviation from average content is significantly correlated with membership to the eurozone, as well as with the year of accession to the EU. Conclusions/Significance While independently making a multitude of small editorial decisions, the leading media of the 27 EU countries, over a period of six months, shaped the contents of the EU mediasphere in a way that reflects its deep geographic, economic and cultural relations. Detecting these subtle signals in a statistically rigorous way would be out of the reach of traditional methods. This analysis demonstrates the power of the available methods for significant automation of media content analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1979861299,"Background Proteomic studies of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are frustrated by the inability to extract proteins from archival tissue in a form suitable for analysis by 2-D gel electrophoresis or mass spectrometry. This inability arises from the difficulty of reversing formaldehyde-induced protein adducts and cross-links within FFPE tissues. We previously reported the use of elevated hydrostatic pressure as a method for efficient protein recovery from a hen egg-white lysozyme tissue surrogate, a model system developed to study formalin fixation and histochemical processing. Principal Findings In this study, we demonstrate the utility of elevated hydrostatic pressure as a method for efficient protein recovery from FFPE mouse liver tissue and a complex multi-protein FFPE tissue surrogate comprised of hen egg-white lysozyme, bovine carbonic anhydrase, bovine ribonuclease A, bovine serum albumin, and equine myoglobin (55∶15∶15∶10∶5 wt%). Mass spectrometry of the FFPE tissue surrogates retrieved under elevated pressure showed that both the low and high-abundance proteins were identified with sequence coverage comparable to that of the surrogate mixture prior to formaldehyde treatment. In contrast, non-pressure-extracted tissue surrogate samples yielded few positive and many false peptide identifications. Studies with soluble formalin-treated bovine ribonuclease A demonstrated that pressure modestly inhibited the rate of reversal (hydrolysis) of formaldehyde-induced protein cross-links. Dynamic light scattering studies suggest that elevated hydrostatic pressure and heat facilitate the recovery of proteins free of formaldehyde adducts and cross-links by promoting protein unfolding and hydration with a concomitant reduction in the average size of the protein aggregates. Conclusions These studies demonstrate that elevated hydrostatic pressure treatment is a promising approach for improving the recovery of proteins from FFPE tissues in a form suitable for proteomic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2067887162,"Humans react strongly to unfairness, sometimes rejecting inequitable proposals even if this sacrifices personal financial gain. Here we explored whether emotional dispositions - trait tendencies to experience positive or negative feelings – shape the rejection of unfair financial offers. Participants played an Ultimatum Game, where the division of a sum of money is proposed and the player can accept or reject this offer. Individuals high in trait positivity and low in trait negativity rejected more unfair offers. These relationships could not be explained by existing accounts which argue that rejection behaviour results from a failure to regulate negative emotions, or serves to arbitrate social relationships and identity. Instead, the relationship between dispositional affect and rejection behaviour may be underpinned by perceived self worth, with those of a positive disposition believing that they are “worth more than that” and those of a negative disposition resigning themselves to “taking the crumbs from under the table”."
https://openalex.org/W2135049046,"Introduction CYP19A1 encodes aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens, and may play a role in variation in outcomes among men and women with cardiovascular disease. We sought to examine genetic variation in CYP19A1 for its potential role in sex differences in cardiovascular disease outcomes. Methods Caucasian individuals from two independent populations were assessed: 1) a prospective cohort of patients with acute coronary syndromes with 3-year mortality follow-up (n = 568) and 2) a nested case-control study from a randomized, controlled trial of hypertension patients with stable coronary disease in which the primary outcome was death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or nonfatal stroke (n = 619). Six CYP19A1 SNPs were genotyped (-81371 C>T, -45965 G>C, M201T, R264C, 80 A>G, and +32226 G>A). The sex*genotype interaction term was assessed for the primary outcome and compared by genotype in men and women when a significant interaction term was identified. Results We identified a significant interaction between -81371 C>T and sex (p = 0.025) in the ACS population. The variant allele was associated with a 78% increase in mortality in men (HR 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-2.94) and a nonsignificant 42% decrease in mortality among women (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.22-1.54). We identified a similar association in the hypertensive CAD group, the -81371 C>T*sex interaction term was p<0.0001, with an associated 65% increase in death, MI, or stroke (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.00-2.73) in men and a 69% decrease (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16-0.6) in women. Conclusions Using two independent populations, this study is the first to document a significant interaction between CYP19A1 genotype and sex on cardiovascular outcomes. These findings could illuminate potential mechanisms of sex differences in cardiovascular disease outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2026367532,"The relative contribution of extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms to cortical development is an intensely debated issue and an outstanding question in neurobiology. Currently, the emerging view is that interplay between intrinsic genetic mechanisms and extrinsic information shape different stages of cortical development. Yet, whereas the intrinsic program of early neocortical developmental events has been at least in part decoded, the exact nature and impact of extrinsic signaling are still elusive and controversial. We found that in the mouse developing visual system, acute pharmacological inhibition of spontaneous retinal activity (retinal waves-RWs) during embryonic stages increase the rate of corticogenesis (cell cycle withdrawal). Furthermore, early perturbation of retinal spontaneous activity leads to changes of cortical layer structure at a later time point. These data suggest that mouse embryonic retina delivers long-distance information capable of modulating cell genesis in the developing visual cortex and that spontaneous activity is the candidate long-distance acting extrinsic cue mediating this process. In addition, these data may support spontaneous activity to be a general signal coordinating neurogenesis in other developing sensory pathways or areas of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2052976932,"High density oligonucleotide probe arrays have increasingly become an important tool in genomics studies. In organisms with incomplete genome sequence, one strategy for oligo probe design is to reduce the number of unique probes that target every non-redundant transcript through bioinformatic analysis and experimental testing. Here we adopted this strategy in making oligo probes for the earthworm Eisenia fetida, a species for which we have sequenced transcriptome-scale expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Our objectives were to identify unique transcripts as targets, to select an optimal and non-redundant oligo probe for each of these target ESTs, and to annotate the selected target sequences. We developed a streamlined and easy-to-follow approach to the design, validation and annotation of species-specific array probes. Four 244K-formatted oligo arrays were designed using eArray and were hybridized to a pooled E. fetida cRNA sample. We identified 63,541 probes with unsaturated signal intensities consistently above the background level. Target transcripts of these probes were annotated using several sequence alignment algorithms. Significant hits were obtained for 37,439 (59%) probed targets. We validated and made publicly available 63.5K oligo probes so the earthworm research community can use them to pursue ecological, toxicological, and other functional genomics questions. Our approach is efficient, cost-effective and robust because it (1) does not require a major genomics core facility; (2) allows new probes to be easily added and old probes modified or eliminated when new sequence information becomes available, (3) is not bioinformatics-intensive upfront but does provide opportunities for more in-depth annotation of biological functions for target genes; and (4) if desired, EST orthologs to the UniGene clusters of a reference genome can be identified and selected in order to improve the target gene specificity of designed probes. This approach is particularly applicable to organisms with a wealth of EST sequences but unfinished genome."
https://openalex.org/W2097698156,"Behavioral ecologists assume that animals use a motivational mechanism for decisions such as action selection and time allocation, allowing the maximization of their fitness. They consider both the proximate and ultimate causes of behavior in order to understand this type of decision-making in animals. Experimental psychologists and neuroeconomists also study how agents make decisions but they consider the proximate causes of the behavior. In the case of patch-leaving, motivation-based decision-making remains simple speculation. In contrast to other animals, human beings can assess and evaluate their own motivation by an introspection process. It is then possible to study the declared motivation of humans during decision-making and discuss the mechanism used as well as its evolutionary significance. In this study, we combine both the proximate and ultimate causes of behavior for a better understanding of the human decision-making process. We show for the first time ever that human subjects use a motivational mechanism similar to small insects such as parasitoids [1] and bumblebees [2] to decide when to leave a patch. This result is relevant for behavioral ecologists as it supports the biological realism of this mechanism. Humans seem to use a motivational mechanism of decision making known to be adaptive to a heterogeneously distributed resource. As hypothesized by Hutchinson et al. [3] and Wilke and Todd [4], our results are consistent with the evolutionary shaping of decision making because hominoids were hunters and gatherers on food patches for more than two million years. We discuss the plausibility of a neural basis for the motivation mechanism highlighted here, bridging the gap between behavioral ecology and neuroeconomy. Thus, both the motivational mechanism observed here and the neuroeconomy findings are most likely adaptations that were selected for during ancestral times."
https://openalex.org/W2108016768,"Plants defend themselves against infection by biotic attackers by producing distinct phytohormones. Especially jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) are well known defense-inducing hormones. Here, the effects of MeJA and SA on the Arabidopsis thaliana kinome were monitored using PepChip arrays containing kinase substrate peptides to analyze posttranslational interactions in MeJA and SA signaling pathways and to test if kinome profiling can provide leads to predict posttranslational events in plant signaling. MeJA and SA mediate differential phosphorylation of substrates for many kinase families. Also some plant specific substrates were differentially phosphorylated, including peptides derived from Phytochrome A, and Photosystem II D protein. This indicates that MeJA and SA mediate cross-talk between defense signaling and light responses. We tested the predicted effects of MeJA and SA using light-mediated upward leaf movement (differential petiole growth also called hyponastic growth). We found that MeJA, infestation by the JA-inducing insect herbivore Pieris rapae, and SA suppressed low light-induced hyponastic growth. MeJA and SA acted in a synergistic fashion via two (partially) divergent signaling routes. This work demonstrates that kinome profiling using PepChip arrays can be a valuable complementary ∼omics tool to give directions towards predicting behavior of organisms after a given stimulus and can be used to obtain leads for physiological relevant phenomena in planta."

Laser capture microdissection and In Situ hybridization were used to determine cellular origin of MMP1 in human sarcomas. A xenogenic model of tumor progression was then used and mice were divided in two groups: each harboring either the control or a stably MMP1 silenced cell line. Animals were sacrificed; the neovascularization, primary tumor volumes, and metastatic burden were assessed. LCM and RNA-ISH analysis revealed MMP1 expression was predominantly localized to the tumor cells in all samples of sarcoma (p = 0.05). The percentage lung metastatic volume at 5 weeks (p = 0.08) and number of spontaneous deaths secondary to systemic tumor burden were lower in MMP1 silenced cell bearing mice. Interestingly, this group also demonstrated a larger primary tumor size (p<0.04) and increased angiogenesis (p<0.01). These findings were found to be consistent when experiment was repeated using a second independent MMP1 silencing sequence. Prior clinical trials employing MMP1 inhibitors failed because of a poor understanding of the role of MMPs in tumor progression. The current findings indicating tumor cell production of MMP1 by sarcoma cells is novel and highlights the fundamental differences in MMP biology between carcinomas and sarcomas. The results also emphasize the complex roles of MMP in tumor progression of sarcomas. Not only does metastasis seem to be affected by MMP1 silencing, but also local tumor growth and angiogenesis are affected inversely."
https://openalex.org/W2071295911,"Background Lethal toxin (LT), the major virulence factor produced by Bacillus anthracis, has been shown to suppress the immune system, which is beneficial to the establishment of B. anthracis infections. It has been suggested that the suppression of MEK/MAPK signaling pathways of leukocytes contributes to LT-mediated immunosuppressive effects. However, the involvement of MAPK independent pathways has not been clearly elucidated; nor has the crucial role played by LT in the early stages of infection. Determining whether LT exerts any pathological effects before being enriched to an MEK inhibitory level is an important next step in the furtherance of this field. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a cell culture model, we determined that low doses of LT inhibited phagocytosis of macrophages, without influencing MAPK pathways. Consistent low doses of LT significantly suppressed bacterial clearance and enhanced the mortality of mice with bacteremia, without suppressing the MEK1 of splenic and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Conclusion/Significance These results suggest that LT suppresses the phagocytes in a dose range lower than that required to suppress MEK1 in the early stages of infection."

Previously, the ATP binding site was revealed in x-ray crystal structures of the cytoplasmic region of this membrane protein. Disruption of this site by mutagenesis (Y617A-ClC-5) reduced the functional expression and ATP-dependent regulation of the full-length transporter in Xenopus oocytes. However, insight into the conformational changes underlying ATP-dependent regulation is lacking. Here, we show that ATP binding induces a change in protein conformation. Specifically, small angle x-ray scattering experiments indicate that ATP binding promotes a clamp-like closure of the isolated ClC-5 carboxyl-terminal region. Limited proteolysis studies show that ATP binding induces conformational compaction of the carboxyl-terminal region in the intact membrane protein as well. In the context of fibroblasts and proximal tubule epithelial cells, disruption of the ATP binding site in full-length ClC-5 (Y617A-ClC-5) led to a defect in processing and trafficking out of the endoplasmic reticulum. These latter findings account for the decrease in functional expression previously reported for this ATP-binding mutant and prompt future study of a model whereby conformational compaction caused by ATP binding promotes biosynthetic maturation.

https://openalex.org/W2075848681,"When testing association between rare variants and diseases, an efficient analytical approach involves considering a set of variants in a genomic region as the unit of analysis. One factor complicating this approach is that the vast majority of rare variants in practical applications are believed to represent background neutral variation. As a result, analyzing a single set with all variants may not represent a powerful approach. Here, we propose two alternative strategies. In the first, we analyze the subsets of rare variants exhaustively. In the second, we categorize variants selectively into two subsets: one in which variants are overrepresented in cases, and the other in which variants are overrepresented in controls. When the proportion of neutral variants is moderate to large we show, by simulations, that the both proposed strategies improve the statistical power over methods analyzing a single set with total variants. When applied to a real sequencing association study, the proposed methods consistently produce smaller p-values than their competitors. When applied to another real sequencing dataset to study the difference of rare allele distributions between ethnic populations, the proposed methods detect the overrepresentation of variants between the CHB (Chinese Han in Beijing) and YRI (Yoruba people of Ibadan) populations with small p-values. Additional analyses suggest that there is no difference between the CHB and CHD (Chinese Han in Denver) datasets, as expected. Finally, when applied to the CHB and JPT (Japanese people in Tokyo) populations, existing methods fail to detect any difference, while it is detected by the proposed methods in several regions."
https://openalex.org/W1973646585,"ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are regulated by a variety of cytosolic factors (adenine nucleotides, Mg2+, phospholipids, and pH). We previously reported that KATP channels are also regulated by endogenous membrane-bound SNARE protein syntaxin-1A (Syn-1A), which binds both nucleotide-binding folds of sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)1 and 2A, causing inhibition of KATP channel activity in pancreatic islet β-cells and cardiac myocytes, respectively. In this study, we show that ATP dose-dependently inhibits Syn-1A binding to SUR1 at physiological concentrations, with the addition of Mg2+ causing a decrease in the ATP-induced inhibitory effect. This ATP disruption of Syn-1A binding to SUR1 was confirmed by FRET analysis in living HEK293 cells. Electrophysiological studies in pancreatic β-cells demonstrated that reduced ATP concentrations increased KATP channel sensitivity to Syn-1A inhibition. Depletion of endogenous Syn-1A in insulinoma cells by botulinum neurotoxin C1 proteolysis followed by rescue with exogenous Syn-1A showed that Syn-1A modulates KATP channel sensitivity to ATP. Thus, our data indicate that although both ATP and Syn-1A independently inhibit β-cell KATP channel gating, they could also influence the sensitivity of KATP channels to each other. These findings provide new insight into an alternate mechanism by which ATP regulates pancreatic β-cell KATP channel activity, not only by its direct actions on Kir6.2 pore subunit, but also via ATP modulation of Syn-1A binding to SUR1.

These ATP-binding cassette proteins uniformly contain two nucleotide-binding folds (NBF1 and NBF2), with each NBF containing Walker A and B motifs, which are sites of the action by adenine nucleotides. Regulation of KATP channels by adenine nucleotides is complex, with ATP and ADP having both stimulatory and inhibitory effects (9Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Haug T. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition to adenine nucleotides, KATP channels can also be regulated by a variety of cytosolic factors, including phospholipids (18Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G.

HEK293 cells were cultured in the same DMEM but without G418 and hygromycin and INS-1E cells in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. HEK293 and INS-1E cells were transiently transfected with Syn-1A or BoNT/C1 or co-transfected with both plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 18–24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested for Western blotting, or cells were trypsinized, plated on glass coverslips, and cultured overnight before performing electrophysiological experiments. For FRET imaging, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with Syn-1A-mCherry, SUR1-EGFP, and Kir6.2 or with EGFP and mCherry (control). The cells were used for FRET imaging 2 days after transfection. In vitro binding assays were performed according to the methods we described previously (22Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol.

Briefly, GST (as a negative control) and GST-Syn-1A (350 pmol protein each) were bound to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with 0.5 ml SUR1 overexpressing HEK293 cell lysate extract (400 μg protein in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 1.5% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of ATP (Sigma) along with or without 2 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C for 2 h with constant agitation, followed by washing the beads three times with washing buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm KOAC, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The samples were then separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and identified with specific primary antibodies against SUR1 (1:1000; a gift from J. Ferrer, Barcelona, Spain). The blots were quantified by densitometry scanning followed by analysis with Scion Image (beta release version 4.0.2; Scion Corp.). Data analysis and curve fitting were performed using Origin (version 6.0; Microcal Software Inc.). Transfected cells were imaged in intracellular buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm NaCl, 140 mm K-gluconate, and 2 mm MgCl2 and pre-equilibrated with O2:CO2 = 95:5, pH 7.4 at 37 °C using a Nikon TE-2001U inverted microscope fitted with an argon laser unit (480 ± 10 nm, Spectra-Physics), an He-Ne laser unit (545 ± 10 nm, Melles Griot), and a Quantum 512SC charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics). For FRET measurements, a Plan Apo 60× oil immersion objective (1.65 numerical aperture), a Dual-View imaging system (Optical Insights) containing a dichroic splitter (565dcxr) and two emission filters (HQ530/30 for EGFP and HQ630/50 for mCherry) were combined together to allow simultaneous two-channel monitoring of emission fluorescence. The cells were permeabilized by incubation in intracellular buffer containing 10 μm digitonin for 4 min at 37 °C and then were applied for FRET imaging in the absence or presence of 0.5 or 2 mm ATP. For FRET analysis, EGFP fused with SUR1 was used as FRET donor and mCherry fused with Syn-1A as an acceptor. Four images, including donor excitation/donor emission (Dd), donor excitation/acceptor emission, acceptor excitation/acceptor emission (Aa), and acceptor excitation/donor emission were acquired in the same condition and a fixed 500-ms exposure time in each FRET experiment. In addition, the donor-only sample and acceptor-only sample were imaged before each experiment for calculation of bleed-through. FRET efficiency was used to indicate the interaction of the two proteins, calculated as follows: FRETcorr = FRETraw − (CoB × DdFRET) − (CoA × AaFRET). FRET efficiency % = (FRETcorr/DdFRET) × 100%. Here, CoA is the amount of acceptor bleed-through in the absence of a donor, and CoB is the amount of donor bleed-through in the absence of an acceptor. Rat islet β-cells isolated from male Sprague-Dawley as described previously were voltage-clamped in a whole-cell configuration (23Cui N. Kang Y. He Y. Leung Y.M. Xie H. Pasyk E.A. Gao X. Sheu L.

The external solution contained the following: 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH. The pipette solution contained the following: 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.3 or 1.0 mm MgATP, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 with KOH. GST or GST-Syn-1A fusion proteins (all at 1 μm) were added to the pipette solution for dialysis into the cells. Membrane potential was held at −80 mV and a pulse of −140 mV (500 ms) was given every 10 s to monitor KATP current magnitude. As the pipette contained a low concentration of ATP (when adding 0.3 or 1.0 mm MgATP), which gradually equilibrated with cell cytosol, KATP currents gradually developed to the maximum amplitude. INS-1E cells (a gift from C. Wollheim, Geneva, Switzerland) were used for standard inside-out patch-clamp recordings. The cells were transfected with EGFP and BoNT/C1 (to cleave endogenous Syn-1A) or EGFP alone as indicated under “Results.” To increase macroscopic KATP currents, all cells were subsequently co-infected with three recombinant adenoviruses containing Kir6.2, tetracycline-inhibited transactivator, and tetracycline-inhibited transactivator-regulated gene expressing fSUR1 (FLAG epitope-tagged SUR1) (24Lin Y.W. Bushman J.D. Yan F.F. Haidar S. MacMullen C. Ganguly A. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. J. Biol.

The typical pipette resistance when filled with solution was 1.0–1.5 MΩ. Syn-1A or GST recombinant proteins were added to bath solutions as indicated. Macroscopic currents were recorded with membrane patches held at −50 mV to evoke inward currents. All electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C) using an EPC9 amplifier with Pulse acquisition software (version 8.6; HEKA Electroniks, Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences in means were compared using unpaired (electrophysiological studies) or paired (FRET assay) Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered as statistically significant.

In addition, the physical interaction between SNAP-25 and SUR1 was not observed. These results indicate that the interaction of Syn-1A with NBFs of SUR1 does not require a ternary protein. Because ATP (and ADP), in addition to its direct actions on Kir6.2, can also bind NBFs to modulate KATP channel activity, we speculated that ATP might induce conformational changes in the NBFs, which could influence SUR1 binding to Syn-1A with consequent effects on KATP channel gating. First, we used GST-Syn-1A bound to agarose glutathione beads to pull down SUR1 from SUR1/Kir6.2 stably expressing BA8 cell lysate extract in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP. As shown in Fig. 1A, ATP (without Mg2+) dose-dependently inhibited the binding of Syn-1A to SUR1 (n = 4). As Mg2+ is present physiologically to influence ATP actions, we examined ATP inhibition of Syn-1A binding to SUR1 in the presence of a cellular level of Mg2+. Addition of 2 mm MgCl2 shifted the dose-response curve to higher ATP concentrations (Fig. 1B), suggesting a reduction in the ATP-induced inhibitory effect on Syn-1A binding to SUR1. The actions of Mg2+ in regulating KATP channels are complex, and in particular, MgATP would activate KATP channels, thus counteracting free ATP inhibition of KATP channels (9Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Haug T. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7185-7190Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Ashcroft F.M. Kakei M. J. Physiol. 1989; 416: 349-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We, therefore, calculated free [Mg2+], free [ATP], and [MgATP] using the Maxchelator program. It appears that it is increasing [MgATP] and not free Mg2+ that accounted for, at least in part, the rightward shift in free ATP inhibition of Syn-1A binding to SUR1. For example, at the estimated free ATP concentration of 3 mm, with 2 mm MgCl2, calculated MgATP was 1.94 mm, whereas free [Mg2+] was only 60 μm (Fig. 1B), suggesting that free Mg2+ in this condition may not be relevant; and this caused a 48% inhibition (Fig. 1B), whereas in absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1A), the estimated inhibition was stronger at ∼74%. At lower [ATP] of 0.5–1 mm, where we observed significant effects on SUR1-Syn-1A binding in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1A), adding 2 mm MgCl2, greatly reduced these effects, causing a rightward shift of the dose response (Fig. 1B), and here, the calculated free [Mg2+] in these conditions, which ranged between 1.1–1.5 mm are quite similar and close to the physiologic values of free [Mg2+] reported in the literature (26Grubbs R.D. Biometals. 2002; 15: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).

These proteins were fluorophore-tagged (EGFP or mCherry) and their bona fide cellular interactions were examined by FRET analysis in the presence and absence of ATP. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with SUR1 tagged with EGFP as a donor and Syn-1A tagged with mCherry as an acceptor, plus Kir6.2 for complete and functional KATP channel expression at the plasma membrane. A previous study has shown that spectral properties of EGFP and mCherry are well suited for measuring molecular rearrangements by the FRET technique (27Tramier M. Zahid M. Mevel J.C. Masse M.J. Coppey-Moisan M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2006; 69: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Due to some overlap in EGFP and mCherry spectra, measured mCherry emission caused by FRET was contaminated by both direct excitation of mCherry and by EGFP cross-talk emission in the mCherry range. To overcome this problem, a sensitive spectral method for FRET efficiency quantification was used as described under “Materials and Methods.” To examine the molecular interactions of Syn-1A and SUR1 on the surface of the plasma membrane, we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to optically isolate the plasma membrane, enabling high spatial image resolution of the protein interactions on the entire surfaces of the plasma membrane. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, with an exponentially decaying evanescent wave, illuminates the FRET signal within a thin layer (< 200 nm) at and beneath the plasma membrane, thus significantly reducing out-of-focus background fluorescence. First, we examined the FRET in HEK293 cells co-transfected with SUR1-EGFP, Syn-1A-mCherry and Kir6.2, and permeabilized with digitonin in the buffer without ATP. We applied a 488-nm laser to excite EGFP and then recorded the mCherry signal (FRET) with a 605–655 nm band-pass filter, which elicited strong FRET signals on the plasma membrane of the cell (Fig. 2, A, ia), indicating very close proximity between SUR1 and Syn-1A, and thus their presumed interactions. The FRET efficiency, expressed as the mean value of FRETcorr/DdFRET, was 44.20 ± 3.91% (n = 12) (Fig. 2, A, ib, and B). Note that the discrete punctuate spots indicated by arrows showing the highest FRET signals. When 0.5 mm ATP (in presence of 2 mm MgCl2, giving free [ATP] = 0.04 mm, free [Mg2+] = 1.54 mm, and [MgATP] = 0.46 mm) was applied to these permeabilized HEK cells for 3 min, we observed a dramatic decrease in the FRET signal (purple indicating background FRET) precisely at the same high FRET spots (indicated by arrows, compare Fig. 2, A, ia with 2, A, iia, and Fig. 2, A, ib, with 2, A, iib). Specifically, FRET efficiency decreased by 55.2% from 44.2 ± 3.91% to 19.8 ± 2.32% (Fig. 2B). Then, 2 mm ATP (in presence of 2 mm MgCl2, giving free [ATP] = 0.44 mm, free [Mg2+] = 0.44 mm, and [MgATP] = 1.56 mm) was applied to the same cells for another 3 min, and no significant decrease in FRET efficiency was observed (from 19.8 ± 2.32 to 15.3 ± 1.88, p > 0.05) (Fig. 2, A, iiia, 2, A, iiiB, and Fig. 2B). As a negative control, no FRET signal was observed in HEK293 cells co-transfected with EGFP and mCherry (Fig. 2, B, iva), showing 0% FRET efficiency (Fig. 2, A, ivb). Because our binding studies showed that increasing ATP concentration inhibited Syn-1A binding to SUR1, we examined whether Syn-1A inhibition of pancreatic β-cell KATP currents could be modified by similar physiological changes in cytosolic ATP concentrations. At low ATP concentration (0.3 mm MgATP in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 giving free [ATP] = 0.03 mm, free [Mg2+] = 0.94 mm and [MgATP] = 0.27 mm, which did not affect Syn-1A binding to SUR1 in Fig. 1B) in the patch pipette, KATP currents gradually developed in rat β-cells, reaching a maximum current density of 183 ± 17 pA/pF (picoampere/picofarad) (Fig. 3). Dialyzing 1 μm Syn-1A into the cell reduced the currents by 33% (Fig. 3, A and C), similar to our previous report (23Cui N. Kang Y. He Y. Leung Y.M. Xie H. Pasyk E.A. Gao X. Sheu L. Hansen J.B. Wahl P. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53259-53265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Addition of a higher concentration of 1 mm MgATP (in presence of 1 mm MgCl2, giving free [ATP] = 0.10 mm, free [Mg2+] = 1.00 mm and [MgATP] = 0.90 mm) in the pipette, maximum current density developed was 53 ± 13 pA/pF. However, dialyzing 1 μm Syn-1A into the cells did not significantly reduce the currents (Fig. 3, B and C), though the kinetics of current development (Fig. 3B) appeared slower than control. Thus, addition of 1 mm MgATP shown to cause only moderate inhibition of Syn-1A binding to SUR1 (Fig. 1B) was sufficient to abrogate Syn-1A inhibition of the β-cell KATP channel. Taken together, these results indicate that reduced cellular ATP concentration enhances β-cell KATP channel sensitivity to Syn-1A inhibition. We then explored whether endogenous Syn-1A levels could influence β-cell KATP channel sensitivity to ATP. This is of clinical relevance as islet Syn-1A in diabetics has been shown severely reduced by 79% (28Ostenson C.G. Gaisano H. Sheu L. Tibell A. Bartfai T. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here, we depleted endogenous Syn-1A in INS-1E cells by transfection of the cells with BoNT/C1 and EGFP, the latter to identify the BoNT/C1-transfected cells. EGFP alone-transfected cells were used as control. We also performed parallel transfection of HEK293 cells with Syn-1A. 48 h after transfection, Syn-1A was observed to be cleaved completely in INS-1E cells (Fig. 4, Aii) and with only a small residual Syn-1A (85% reduction) in Syn-1A-overexpressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 4, Ai). Next, we performed inside-out patch recording on the INS-1E cells to test the effects of different ATP concentrations. Note that KATP channels from inside-out patches are known to be much more sensitive (i.e. 7–26 times) to ATP than those in whole cell configuration in part due to reduced levels of inositol phospholipids (3Tarasov A.I. Girard C.A. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Lin C.W. Yan F. Shimamura S. Barg S. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2852-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); hence, we used lower ATP concentrations. As shown in Fig. 4, B–D, membrane patches were first exposed to 500 μm MgATP (free [ATP] = 193.9 μm, free [Mg2+] = 175.4 μm, and [MgATP] = 306.6 μm) to close the channel, followed by 0 μm ATP to obtain maximum KATP currents (Imax). Patches were then held at various concentrations of ATP in sequential presence of GST (0.3 μm, indicated as open bars) or exogenous Syn-1A (0.3 μm, indicated as solid bars). In both BoNT/C1-transfected and control cells, 1 μm MgATP (free [ATP] = 0.99 μm, free [Mg2+] = 0.90 μm, and [MgATP] = 0.01 μm) caused partial KATP channel inhibition and addition of 20 μm MgATP (free [ATP] = 17.5 μm, free [Mg2+] = 15.8 μm, and [MgATP] = 2.5 μm) induced further inhibition of the KATP channels. The differences (Δ) in KATP currents between applications of GST and Syn-1A were determined at 1 μm MgATP (Δ1) and 20 μm MgATP (Δ2). In control cells (Fig. 4, Bi), addition of exogenous Syn-1A did not affect KATP currents compared with GST at either 1 μm MgATP (Δ1) or 20 μm MgATP (Δ2). In contrast, in BoNT/C1-transfected cells (Fig. 4, Ci), application of 0.3 μm exogenous Syn-1A caused much further KATP channel inhibition at 1 μm MgATP as compared with GST (Δ1). However, at a higher concentration of 20 μm MgATP, the exogenous Syn-1A could not further inhibit the KATP channel current compared with control cells (Δ2). We summarized these data in Fig. 4, Bii and Cii. Here, Δ1 and Δ2, which indicate reduction in the KATP channel current caused by exogenous Syn-1A compared with GST, were calculated as a percentage of the maximal current (Imax) of each individual patch. Note that Δ1 (at 1 μm MgATP) Syn-1A inhibition was much greater in BoNT/C1 transfected cells than the control cells. Our findings therefore show that the effects of ATP on Syn-1A modulation of native KATP channels is apparent only when endogenous Syn1A is depleted. This suggests that endogenous Syn-1A can rapidly interact with SUR1 when ATP levels are reduced. These results indicate an important role for endogenous Syn-1A and its dynamic interaction with ATP in regulating KATP channels. Syn-1A is a versatile protein that serves as a platform to which exocytic (30Südhof T.C. Rothman J.E. Science. 2009; 323: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar) and ion channel (31Atlas D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 972-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Leung Y.M. Kwan E.P. Ng B. Kang Y. Gaisano H.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) proteins bind and become activated or form functional complexes, consequently modulating the different steps in exocytosis and ion channel gating. Our previous studies have shown that Syn-1A binds to NBF1 and NBF2 domains of SUR subunits to regulate KATP channel activity in both rat pancreatic β-cells (22Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N.

Leung Y.M. Manning-Fox J.E. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsushima R.G. Light P.E. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol.

In the present study, we demonstrated that ATP can regulate the physical association of Syn-1A with SUR1 and modulate the inhibitory actions of Syn-1A on KATP channels. There are two major features. First, ATP is able to dose-dependently inhibit Syn-1A binding to SUR1. Addition of Mg2+, generating MgATP and free Mg2+ reduced this ATP-induced inhibition. Second, our electrophysiological studies revealed that ATP modulated KATP channel sensitivity to endogenous Syn-1A inhibition. Below, we discuss each of these features. Our results examining the effect of ATP on the physical association between Syn-1A and SUR1 clearly demonstrate an ATP concentration-dependent reduction in the interaction. This ATP-induced inhibitory effect is not dependent on Mg2+, and in fact, addition of Mg2+ reduced Syn-1A-SUR1 binding. A number of studies have shown that Mg2+ play an important role in regulation of many ion channels, such as the voltage-dependent calcium channel (34McHugh D. Beech D.J. J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and KATP channel (9Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Haug T. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7185-7190Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). ATP and ADP regulate KATP channel activity by interaction with two physically distinct sites on the channel. Interaction with one site causes channel closure, whereas interaction with the other site leads to channel opening (10Hopkins W.F. Fatherazi S. Peter-Riesch B. Corkey B.E. Cook D.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 129: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The properties of these two sites differ in their requirement for Mg2+ (9Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Haug T. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7185-7190Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our results show that Mg2+ can decrease ATP-induced inhibitory effect on Syn-1A binding to SUR1. Although our finding cannot yet provide the precise Mg2+ acting sites on SUR1, we speculate there are three possible explanations for the reduction of ATP-induced Syn-1A binding to SUR1 by Mg2+. The first and most likely explanation is that Mg2+ binding to ATP results in reduction of free ATP concentration (see Fig. 1B) and the generation of MgATP, the former known to be the potent inhibitor of KATP channels and the latter to activate the channel (9Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Haug T. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7185-7190Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Ashcroft F.M. Kakei M. J. Physiol. 1989; 416: 349-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), thus counteracting the ATP inhibitory effect. Second, Mg2+ may alter SUR1 conformation to form a complex with Syn-1A that becomes resistant to ATP inhibition. Third, Mg2+ increases the affinity of SUR1 to Syn-1A, but this Syn-1A-SUR1 complex remains receptive to ATP disruption. Further detailed work is needed to investigate how these complex interactions of ATP and Mg2+ on SUR1 translate to actual regulation of KATP channel activity. When comparing the FRET and binding assays, the ATP sensitivity, in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 for abolishing the Syn-1A·SUR1 complex, is higher in the FRET study in live cells, particularly at the lower ATP concentration (0.5 mm ATP plus 2 mm MgCl2), wherein disruption of the Syn-1·SUR1 complex was 55.2 versus 3.1% for FRET versus binding assays, respectively. The reason for this apparent discrepancy may be that Mg2+ binds to other endogenous proteins in intact cells employed in the FRET assay; thus, the higher concentration of free ATP would cause a stronger inhibitory effect on Syn-1A binding to SUR1. To address this possibility, we tested whether Mg2+ per se can affect the Syn-1-SUR1 interaction. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, 2 mm MgCl2 in itself had no effect on the Syn-1A-SUR1 FRET signal. However, addition of 2 mm MgCl2 to 0.5 mm ATP indeed reduced the ability of 0.5 mm ATP to disrupt the Syn-1A-SUR1 FRET signal. This supports our thinking that Mg2+ could affect Syn-1A-SUR1 interaction only in the presence of ATP and that the cytosolic proteins very likely might be chelating endogenous Mg2+ as to have caused the increased inhibitory effects of low ATP (0.5 mm ATP) in the FRET experiments. Of course, there may be other undefined reasons. Based on the binding data discussed above, one would predict that at physiological concentrations of ATP, there may be only little Syn-1A binding to SUR1. In inside-out patch recording experiments, Syn-1A modulation of KATP channel activity was only apparent after depletion of endogenous Syn-1A with BoNT/C1. Taken together, these results suggest that endogenous Syn-1A can rapidly complex with SUR1 in β-cells when ATP levels are lowered. Type 2 diabetes is associated with lower ATP levels in β-cells as a result of diminished efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production in part due to perturbation of uncoupling proteins (35Zhang C.Y. Baffy G. Perret P. Krauss S. Peroni O. Grujic D. Hagen T. Vidal-Puig A.J. Boss O. Kim Y.B. Zheng X.X. Wheeler M.B. Shulman G.I. Chan C.B. Lowell B.B. Cell. 2001; 105: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Here, lower β-cell ATP concentration in diabetes patients would increase KATP channel sensitivity to Syn-1A-induced inhibition, consequently increasing insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells during states of low ATP generation, as a compensatory mechanism. Cytosolic ATP levels undergo considerable changes or lack of changes in health and disease in many cell types (pancreatic islet β- and α-cells, heart, and brain) to regulate their KATP channels and consequent membrane excitability. The present study demonstrates that Syn-1A and ATP could modulate the sensitivity of KATP channels to either mediator in an autoregulatory fashion, thus providing a more versatile mechanism to regulate the KATP channel in different cell types.

Here the molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the crystallized structures to visualize the dynamic conformational change for state 1 (S1) or state 2 (S2) Lec domain with respective bent (B) or extended (E) EGF orientation. Simulations illustrated that both S1 and S2 conformations were unable to switch from one to another directly. Instead, a novel S1' conformation was observed from S1 when crystallized B-S1 or reconstructed ""E-S1"" structure was employed, which was superposed well with that of equilibrated S1 Lec domain alone. It was also indicated that the corresponding allosteric pathway from S1 to S1' conformation started with the separation between residues Q30 and K67 and terminated with the release of residue N87 from residue C109. These results provided an insight into understanding the structural transition and the structure-function relationship of P-selectin allostery."
https://openalex.org/W1971691482,"Background Gene amplification is thought to promote over-expression of genes favouring tumour development. Because amplified regions are usually megabase-long, amplification often concerns numerous syntenic or non-syntenic genes, among which only a subset is over-expressed. The rationale for these differences remains poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Finding To address this question, we used quantitative RT-PCR to determine the expression level of a series of co-amplified genes in five xenografted and one fresh human gliomas. These gliomas were chosen because we have previously characterised in detail the genetic content of their amplicons. In all the cases, the amplified sequences lie on extra-chromosomal DNA molecules, as commonly observed in gliomas. We show here that genes transcribed in non-amplified gliomas are over-expressed when amplified, roughly in proportion to their copy number, while non-expressed genes remain inactive. When specific antibodies were available, we also compared protein expression in amplified and non-amplified tumours. We found that protein accumulation barely correlates with the level of mRNA expression in some of these tumours. Conclusions/Significance Here we show that the tissue-specific pattern of gene expression is maintained upon amplification in gliomas. Our study relies on a single type of tumour and a limited number of cases. However, it strongly suggests that, even when amplified, genes that are normally silent in a given cell type play no role in tumour progression. The loose relationships between mRNA level and protein accumulation and/or activity indicate that translational or post-translational events play a key role in fine-tuning the final outcome of amplification in gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2141525676,"Escape mutations in HIV-1 cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitopes can abrogate recognition by the TCR of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells, but may also change interactions with alternative MHC class I receptors. Here, we show that mutational escape in three HLA-A11-, B8- and B7- restricted immunodominant HIV-1 CTL epitopes consistently enhances binding of the respective peptide/MHC class I complex to Immunoglobulin-like transcript 4 (ILT4), an inhibitory myelomonocytic MHC class I receptor expressed on monocytes and dendritic cells. In contrast, mutational escape in an alternative immunodominant HLA-B57-restricted CTL epitope did not affect ILT4-mediated recognition by myelomonocytic cells. This suggests that in addition to abrogating recognition by HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells, mutational escape in some, but not all CTL epitopes may mediate important immunoregulatory effects by increasing binding properties to ILT4, and augmenting ILT4-mediated inhibitory effects of professional antigen-presenting cells."
https://openalex.org/W2121696588,"Undescended testis, or cryptorchidism, occurs in 2-5% of boys born at term, and by 12 months of age about 1% of all boys have manifest cryptorchidism. Several hormonal substances control this process and disruption of the foetal sex-hormones balance is a potential cause of undescended testis, however, to a great extent the aetiology of cryptorchidism is unclear.To study risk factors involved in the aetiology of undescended testis, we assessed cancer risk in 15,885 mothers of men operated for undescended testis in Sweden. Women were followed-up for a median period of 23 years during which 811 first primary malignancies occurred. Their cancer incidence was compared with that in the general population estimating standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).The overall cancer risk experienced by the mothers of cryptorchid men did not differ significantly from that of the general population (SIR = 0.94; 95% C.I. = 0.88-1.01). Specifically, there was a reduction in ovarian cancer risk (SIR = 0.72; 95% C.I. = 0.51-0.99), while the risk of lung (SIR = 1.38 95% C.I. 1.03-1.81) and biliary tract/liver cancer (SIR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.03-2.82) were increased.Although we cannot rule out the role of chance, our data suggest a positive association between undescended testis and maternal lung cancer and a negative association with ovarian cancer, where the first may be partly attributable to smoking and the second to an altered hormonal milieu during pregnancy and thus both exposures may be risk factors for cryptorchidism."
