https://openalex.org/W2123829995,"Trophectoderm (TE), the first differentiated cell lineage of mammalian embryogenesis, forms the placenta, a structure unique to mammalian development. The differentiation of TE is a hallmark event in early mammalian development, but molecular mechanisms underlying this first differentiation event remain obscure. Embryonic stem (ES) cells can be induced to differentiate into the TE lineage by forced repression of the POU-family transcription factor, Oct3/4. We show here that this event can be mimicked by overexpression of Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2), which is sufficient to generate proper trophoblast stem (TS) cells. Cdx2 is dispensable for trophectoderm differentiation induced by Oct3/4 repression but essential for TS cell self-renewal. In preimplantation embryos, Cdx2 is initially coexpressed with Oct3/4 and they form a complex for the reciprocal repression of their target genes in ES cells. This suggests that reciprocal inhibition between lineage-specific transcription factors might be involved in the first differentiation event of mammalian development."
https://openalex.org/W2003574450,"An RNA virus population does not consist of a single genotype; rather, it is an ensemble of related sequences, termed quasispecies. Quasispecies arise from rapid genomic evolution powered by the high mutation rate of RNA viral replication. Although a high mutation rate is dangerous for a virus because it results in nonviable individuals, it has been hypothesized that high mutation rates create a 'cloud' of potentially beneficial mutations at the population level, which afford the viral quasispecies a greater probability to evolve and adapt to new environments and challenges during infection. Mathematical models predict that viral quasispecies are not simply a collection of diverse mutants but a group of interactive variants, which together contribute to the characteristics of the population. According to this view, viral populations, rather than individual variants, are the target of evolutionary selection. Here we test this hypothesis by examining the consequences of limiting genomic diversity on viral populations. We find that poliovirus carrying a high-fidelity polymerase replicates at wild-type levels but generates less genomic diversity and is unable to adapt to adverse growth conditions. In infected animals, the reduced viral diversity leads to loss of neurotropism and an attenuated pathogenic phenotype. Notably, using chemical mutagenesis to expand quasispecies diversity of the high-fidelity virus before infection restores neurotropism and pathogenesis. Analysis of viruses isolated from brain provides direct evidence for complementation between members in the quasispecies, indicating that selection indeed occurs at the population level rather than on individual variants. Our study provides direct evidence for a fundamental prediction of the quasispecies theory and establishes a link between mutation rate, population dynamics and pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1996441871,"MicroRNAs play important roles in cell differentiation by acting as translational inhibitors of specific target genes. Here we show that human granulocytic differentiation is controlled by a regulatory circuitry involving miR-223 and two transcriptional factors, NFI-A and C/EBPalpha. The two factors compete for binding to the miR-223 promoter: NFI-A maintains miR-223 at low levels, whereas its replacement by C/EBPalpha, following retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation, upregulates miR-223 expression. The competition by C/EBPalpha and the granulocytic differentiation are favored by a negative-feedback loop in which miR-223 represses NFI-A translation. In line with this, both RNAi against NFI-A and ectopic expression of miR-223 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells enhance differentiation, whereas miR-223 knockdown inhibits the differentiation response to RA. Altogether, our data indicate that miR-223 plays a crucial role during granulopoiesis and point to the NFI-A repression as an important molecular pathway mediating gene reprogramming in this cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1981184799,"Spatial and functional organization of cells in tissues is determined by cell-cell adhesion, thought to be initiated through trans-interactions between extracellular domains of the cadherin family of adhesion proteins, and strengthened by linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. Prevailing dogma is that cadherins are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through beta-catenin and alpha-catenin, although the quaternary complex has never been demonstrated. We test this hypothesis and find that alpha-catenin does not interact with actin filaments and the E-cadherin-beta-catenin complex simultaneously, even in the presence of the actin binding proteins vinculin and alpha-actinin, either in solution or on isolated cadherin-containing membranes. Direct analysis in polarized cells shows that mobilities of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and alpha-catenin are similar, regardless of the dynamic state of actin assembly, whereas actin and several actin binding proteins have higher mobilities. These results suggest that the linkage between the cadherin-catenin complex and actin filaments is more dynamic than previously appreciated."

Contrary to the idea that α-catenin links the adhesion protein E-cadherin through β-catenin to the actin cytoskeleton, in the accompanying paper we report that α-catenin does not bind simultaneously to both E-cadherin-β-catenin and actin filaments. Here we demonstrate that α-catenin exists as a monomer or a homodimer with different binding properties. Monomeric α-catenin binds more strongly to E-cadherin-β-catenin, whereas the dimer preferentially binds actin filaments. Different molecular conformations are associated with these different binding states, indicating that α-catenin is an allosteric protein. Significantly, α-catenin directly regulates actin-filament organization by suppressing Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization, likely by competing with the Arp2/3 complex for binding to actin filaments.

Epithelial cell-cell junctions are organized by adhesion proteins and the underlying actin cytoskeleton. They provide adaptable interfaces that can respond to signals for cell movement during convergent extension in gastrulation (Keller, 2002Keller R.

Analysis of how migrating cells initiate cell-cell adhesion has revealed dramatic changes in membrane dynamics and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Migrating cells have characteristic forward-moving lamellipodia produced by rapid Arp2/3-nucleated assembly of a branched actin network perpendicular to the leading edge (Pollard and Borisy, 2003Pollard T.D.

Upon cell-cell adhesion, lamellipodial activity is reduced over the contacting area, and there is a concomitant reorganization of actin filaments (Adams et al., 1998Adams C.L. Chen Y.-T. Smith S.J.

It is unknown how engagement of cadherins between migrating cells causes these dramatic changes in actin-filament assembly and organization. The intracellular domain of cadherins binds cytoplasmic proteins that are thought to recruit and organize actin filaments (Gumbiner, 2000Gumbiner B.M. Regulation of cadherin adhesive activity.J.

Since α-catenin can also bind actin filaments in vitro (Pokutta et al., 2002Pokutta S. Drees F. Takai Y. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I.

USA. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), it is widely accepted that α-catenin bound to the cadherin-β-catenin complex bridges these components to actin. In addition, many actin binding proteins have been reported to bind α-catenin, including vinculin and α-actinin (Kobielak and Fuchs, 2004Kobielak A.

Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) are involved in cell-cell adhesion and may regulate actin dynamics around the cadherin-catenin complex. In the accompanying paper (Yamada et al., 2005Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Deconstructing the cadherin-catenin-actin complex.Cell. 2005; 123 (this issue): 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]), experiments with purified proteins demonstrated that the ternary complex of cadherin-β-catenin-α-catenin does not bind directly to actin filaments or indirectly through vinculin or α-actinin. Moreover, live-cell imaging showed that the cadherin-catenin complex has dynamics that are very different from those of actin, consistent with the lack of a stable linkage between the cadherin-catenin complex and actin in cells. The inability of α-catenin to bind simultaneously to the cadherin-β-catenin complex and actin indicates that it may function as a molecular switch, whereby binding to one partner changes the ability to interact with the other. Here we provide evidence that these changes are associated with distinct conformational states of α-catenin and that dimerization of α-catenin influences its ability to selectively bind to β-catenin or actin. Given the highly dynamic properties of the actin network at cell-cell contacts, we further examined the role of α-catenin in regulating actin assembly. We show that α-catenin suppresses actin polymerization by the Arp2/3 complex, suggesting that assembly and clustering of the cadherin-catenin complex at cell-cell contacts may provide a pool of α-catenin that can locally regulate actin dynamics and organization. Purified α-catenin has been reported to be a homodimer in solution (Koslov et al., 1997Koslov E.R. Maupin P. Pradhan D. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. α-catenin can form asymmetric homodimeric complexes and/or heterodimeric complexes with β-catenin.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27301-27306Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of α-catenin revealed that the dimerization domain overlaps the β-catenin binding domain (Pokutta and Weis, 2000Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Structure of the dimerization and β-catenin binding region of α-catenin.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Since the stoichiometry of the α-catenin-β-catenin heterodimer is 1:1, the α-catenin homodimer would have to dissociate before α-catenin could bind β-catenin (Pokutta and Weis, 2000Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Structure of the dimerization and β-catenin binding region of α-catenin.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular state of α-catenin (monomer, homodimer, heterodimer with β-catenin) appears to be critical for interactions with potential binding partners. A pool of α-catenin is found in MDCK cell cytoplasm, and another is associated with the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex at the plasma membrane (Hinck et al., 1994Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. Dynamics of cadherin/catenin complex formation: novel protein interactions and pathways of complex assembly.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Fractionation of a 100,000 × g cytosol supernatant by gel filtration revealed two peaks of α-catenin (Figure 1A) with elution volumes similar to those of purified recombinant His-tagged α-catenin (Figure 1B). The molecular mass of the two peaks of His-tagged α-catenin, determined by multiangle light scattering (MALS), corresponded to an α-catenin monomer and homodimer, respectively (Figure 1B). Data from several independent experiments indicated that 60%–75% of cytosolic α-catenin in MDCK cells was monomeric (Figure 1A), and the proportion of monomer was independent of the cell plating density (data not shown). Although the first peak of α-catenin observed in the cytosol fractionation can be superimposed on the elution profile of the recombinant α-catenin homodimer, we found that endogenous β-catenin also coeluted with this peak. Since recombinant β-catenin elutes at a smaller apparent molecular weight (e.g., Figures 2A and 2B), the observed coelution of β-catenin and α-catenin may indicate that there is a β-/α-catenin heterodimer in MDCK cell cytosol. Indeed, α-catenin coimmunoprecipitated with β-catenin from the higher-molecular-weight peak (Figure 1C). However, a β-/α-catenin heterodimer does not account for all α-catenin in this peak, as endogenous α-catenin can be coimmunoprecipitated with a green fluorescent protein-α-catenin fusion protein (GFP-α-catenin), indicating the presence of α-catenin homodimer in cytosol (Figure 1C). Comparison of the amount of α-catenin in the pellet and supernatant after coimmunoprecipitation with β-catenin indicates that approximately 20% of α-catenin in the higher-molecular-weight fraction was bound to β-catenin, with approximately 80% an α-catenin homodimer. Thus, in contrast to previous reports, purified α-catenin can exist as a monomer and homodimer in solution, and most of endogenous α-catenin in MDCK cell cytosol is monomeric. The concentration of α-catenin in the MDCK cell cytosol was estimated from α-catenin Western blots by comparing the intensities of bands from cytosol to those from known amounts of input recombinant α-catenin. The most intense monomer fractions had a concentration of 7 nM. Accounting for cell volume and dilution during cell lysis and column chromatography, we obtain an estimate of 0.6 μM α-catenin in cytosol. Recombinant α-catenin appears as a mixture of monomer and dimer when run on gel filtration columns at concentrations of 2–20 μM (e.g., Figure 1B). This places the homodimerization constant in the micromolar range, which is consistent with the observation that the majority of cytosolic α-catenin is monomeric. Since α-catenin forms a 1:1 complex with β-catenin and the homodimerization and β-catenin binding domains of α-catenin overlap (Pokutta and Weis, 2000Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Structure of the dimerization and β-catenin binding region of α-catenin.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that α-catenin monomer should bind more readily to β-catenin. Formation of the β-catenin-α-catenin complex was monitored in solution by gel filtration chromatography. Mixtures of α-catenin and β-catenin were applied to an analytical gel filtration column at 26 μM, which then became diluted approximately 10-fold on the column. Under these conditions, α-catenin homodimer did not bind β-catenin, and both proteins eluted separately (Figure 2A), whereas the majority of α-catenin monomer eluted in a 1:1 complex with β-catenin (Figure 2B). We assessed whether the presence of E-cadherin affects the relative affinities of α-catenin monomer or homodimer for β-catenin. Pull-down assays were established using glutathione-agarose beads to capture bacterially expressed GST-E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (GST-Ecyto), full-length recombinant β-catenin, and increasing amounts of full-length His-tagged α-catenin monomer or homodimer; note that recombinant GST-Ecyto and β-catenin bind with 36 nM affinity in a 1:1 stoichiometry in solution (Huber et al., 2001Huber A.H. Stewart D.B. Laurents D.V. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. The cadherin cytoplasmic domain is unstructured in the absence of β-catenin: a possible mechanism for regulating cadherin turnover.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12301-12309Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Choi et al., 2006Choi H.-J. Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Thermodynamics of β-catenin-ligand interactions. The roles of the N- and C-terminal tails in modulating binding affinity.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). The resulting bead bound complexes showed that the α-catenin monomer has a higher apparent affinity for β-catenin than the homodimer (saturation reached at approximately 20 μM monomer versus 50 μM for the homodimer) (Figure 2C). Gel filtration and pull-down assays using plakoglobin, a homolog of β-catenin that also binds E-cadherin and α-catenin, gave similar results (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). We tested whether α-catenin monomer and homodimer have different apparent affinities for actin filaments in an in vitro actin pelleting assay. Greater than 90% of the α-catenin homodimer pelleted with actin filaments, whereas less than 40% of the monomer bound (Figure 2D). As a fraction of purified α-catenin monomer rapidly converts to the homodimer (see above), it is impossible to obtain samples that are 100% pure monomeric α-catenin. Therefore, it is possible that the α-catenin bound to actin filaments in this experiment is due to contaminating homodimer and that the monomer does not bind actin filaments under these conditions. In the accompanying paper (Yamada et al., 2005Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Deconstructing the cadherin-catenin-actin complex.Cell. 2005; 123 (this issue): 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), we showed that binding of α-catenin to β-catenin and actin is mutually exclusive. This was confirmed by using the chimeric β-catenin-α-catenin protein, which mimics the interaction of the two proteins by covalently linking the α-catenin binding site of β-catenin to the β-catenin binding domain of α-catenin (Pokutta and Weis, 2000Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Structure of the dimerization and β-catenin binding region of α-catenin.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Gel filtration chromatography (data not shown) and MALS (Figure 1D) demonstrated that the β-catenin-α-catenin chimera is monomeric. Therefore, the inability of the chimera to bind to actin could be due to its oligomeric state. Alternatively, binding of β-catenin induces a conformation of α-catenin that is unable to bind actin. The inability of α-catenin to bind both β-catenin and actin simultaneously suggests that the N- and C-terminal domains of α-catenin are allosterically coupled, whereby binding to one partner alters its ability to bind to the other. Interestingly, the homologous protein vinculin shows the opposite behavior: the head and tail regions of vinculin bind to talin and actin, respectively, only if an autoinhibitory head-tail interaction is relieved (Bass et al., 2002Bass M.D. Patel B. Barsukov I.G. Fillingham I.J. Mason R. Smith B.J. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Further characterization of the interaction between the cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin.Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, Johnson and Craig, 1995Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. F-actin binding site masked by the intramolecular association of vinculin head and tail domains.Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Purified vinculin behaves as a globular protein on a sizing column, whereas monomeric α-catenin displays a considerably larger apparent molecular mass (Figure 3A), indicating a more extended, open conformation. Moreover, we could not detect an interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of α-catenin (S.P., unpublished data). The βα-catenin chimera has a gel filtration elution profile similar to that of monomeric α-catenin, implying that its inability to bind to actin is not due to an interaction between α-catenin N- and C-terminal domains. Furthermore, proteolytic-sensitivity experiments indicate that the α-catenin monomer has a conformation different from that of the βα-catenin chimera (Figure 3B). Thus, the inability of α-catenin to bind actin in the presence of β-catenin is probably due to conformational changes produced when α-catenin monomer binds to the β-catenin-E-cadherin complex. Further structural studies will be needed to analyze these conformational changes in α-catenin. The mutually exclusive binding of α-catenin to β-catenin or actin implies that α-catenin must dissociate from the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex before it can bind to actin. This was tested by incubating actin filaments with preassembled, gel filtration-purified cadherin-catenin complex containing a 1:1:1 molar ratio of E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain, β-catenin, and α-catenin at a series of concentrations (Figure 4A) or for different times (Figure 4B). The actin filaments were then pelleted, and bound proteins were identified. E-cadherin or β-catenin did not pellet above background levels (see also Yamada et al., 2005Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Deconstructing the cadherin-catenin-actin complex.Cell. 2005; 123 (this issue): 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). However, a significant fraction of α-catenin dissociated from the complex and pelleted with actin filaments independently of incubation time (Figure 4B). The data obtained from the purified, recombinant proteins show that α-catenin can exchange between an E-cadherin-β-catenin complex and actin filaments in solution. We next tested whether this exchange occurs in cells. It was shown in the accompanying paper that GFP-labeled catenins display significant fluorescence recovery after photobleaching at the membrane (Yamada et al., 2005Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Deconstructing the cadherin-catenin-actin complex.Cell. 2005; 123 (this issue): 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Fluorescence recovery of peripheral membrane proteins can occur in two ways: lateral diffusion along the membrane surface in association with an integral membrane protein or exchange with the cytoplasmic pool. There is a significant cytoplasmic pool of α-catenin that could exchange with membrane bound α-catenin (Figure 4C). To test the extent of α-catenin exchange between these pools, we measured the fluorescence loss of GFP-α-catenin at cell-cell contacts while continuously photobleaching the cytoplasmic pool of GFP-α-catenin (fluorescence loss in photobleaching, FLIP; Figure 4D and Movie S1). The membrane bound pool of α-catenin, measured by subtracting the cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity from that at cell-cell contacts, decreased by an average of ∼10% over a period of 9 min (n = 15; Figures 4D and 4E), suggesting that a fraction of membrane bound α-catenin dissociated from β-catenin and entered the cytoplasm. Since the fluorescence intensity of cytoplasmic GFP-β-catenin was near background levels (see Yamada et al., 2005Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Deconstructing the cadherin-catenin-actin complex.Cell. 2005; 123 (this issue): 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), as expected (Näthke et al., 1994Näthke I.S. Hinck L. Swedlow J.R. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. Defining interactions and distributions of cadherin and catenin complexes in polarized epithelial cells.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), we could not reliably measure the dynamics of membrane bound GFP-β-catenin. It is possible that the observed exchange of α-catenin, as well as the recovery of GFP-tagged cadherins and catenins reported in the accompanying paper, is due to endocytosis of cadherin-catenin complexes from the membrane and fusion of cadherin-containing cytoplasmic vesicles at the membrane. However, no vesicle fusion events that coincided with the fluorescence recovery of E-cadherin or catenins were detected, although the temporal and spatial resolution of our microscope may not be sufficient to reliably detect these events. Moreover, the half-life of E-cadherin in MDCK cells is ∼5 hr (Shore and Nelson, 1991Shore E.M. Nelson W.J. Biosynthesis of the cell adhesion molecule uvomorulin (E-cadherin) in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19672-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which converts to a turnover of ∼1% of E-cadherin over the period that the recovery was measured. In addition, the putative recycling pool of cadherin vesicles is <2% of total E-cadherin (Le et al., 1999Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Recycling of E-cadherin: a potential mechanism for regulating cadherin dynamics.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Thus, these mechanisms may contribute to a small portion of α-catenin turnover, but direct exchange with the cytosolic pool is most likely to be the dominant mechanism. The mobility of the cadherin-catenin complex is quantitatively different from those of the membrane-associated and cytoplasmic pools of actin and several other actin binding proteins, observations consistent with in vitro binding experiments showing that the cadherin-catenin complex does not bind actin (Yamada et al., 2005Yamada S.

Nevertheless, actin is associated with cell-cell contacts, and actin dynamics are important for induction of cell-cell adhesion (Adams et al., 1998Adams C.L. Chen Y.-T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J.

Therefore, we examined whether α-catenin can influence Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly, which plays a central role in actin assembly and branching in lamellipodia (Pollard and Borisy, 2003Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cellular motility driven by assembly and disassembly of actin filaments.Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3106) Google Scholar) and is localized to sites of initiating cell-cell contact (Kovacs et al., 2002Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Cadherin-directed actin assembly: E-cadherin physically associates with the Arp2/3 complex to direct actin assembly in nascent adhesive contacts.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Actin polymerization in the presence of α-catenin, purified Arp2/3 complex, and the activation domain (VCA) of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp-VCA) was measured in a standard pyrene-actin fluorescence assay. As expected, Arp2/3 complex alone had little effect on actin polymerization, but it strongly enhanced actin polymerization in the presence of WASp-VCA (Figure 5A; Prehoda et al., 2000Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Integration of multiple signals through cooperative regulation of the N-WASP-Arp2/3 complex.Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The presence of α-catenin monomer or homodimer had little or no effect on actin polymerization (data not shown). However, in the presence of the Arp2/3 complex and WASp-VCA, α-catenin monomer increased the initial lag phase of actin polymerization (Figure 5B). This effect was significantly reduced by the addition of an equimolar amount of β-catenin (Figure 5C); β-catenin alone did not have an effect on actin polymerization in the presence of Arp2/3-WASp (Figure 5D). The βα-catenin chimera (βα-cat), which mimics the β-catenin-α-catenin interaction and does not bind actin filaments (Yamada et al., 2005Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Deconstructing the cadherin-catenin-actin complex.Cell. 2005; 123 (this issue): 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), also had no effect on actin polymerization induced by the Arp2/3 complex and WASp-VCA (Figure 5E). In contrast to monomeric α-catenin, α-catenin homodimer completely suppressed actin polymerization"

We demonstrate that the mechanism underlying this long-standing observation of subclass dominance in function is provided by the differential affinities of IgG subclasses for specific activating IgG Fc receptors compared with their affinities for the inhibitory IgG Fc receptor. The significant differences in the ratios of activating-to-inhibitory receptor binding predicted the in vivo activity. We suggest that these highly predictable functions assigned by Fc binding will be an important consideration in the design of therapeutic antibodies and vaccines."

We report that adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) is the key neurotransmitter in this system. Genetic elimination of ionotropic purinergic receptors (P2X 2 and P2X 3 ) eliminates taste responses in the taste nerves, although the nerves remain responsive to touch, temperature, and menthol. Similarly, P2X-knockout mice show greatly reduced behavioral responses to sweeteners, glutamate, and bitter substances. Finally, stimulation of taste buds in vitro evokes release of ATP. Thus, ATP fulfils the criteria for a neurotransmitter linking taste buds to the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2166280318,"The adipose tissue-derived hormone adiponectin improves insulin sensitivity and its circulating levels are decreased in obesity-induced insulin resistance. Here, we report the generation of a mouse line with a genomic disruption of the adiponectin locus. We aimed to identify whether these mice develop insulin resistance and which are the primary target tissues affected in this model. Using euglycemic/insulin clamp studies, we demonstrate that these mice display severe hepatic but not peripheral insulin resistance. Furthermore, we wanted to test whether the lack of adiponectin magnifies the impairments of glucose homeostasis in the context of a dietary challenge. When exposed to high fat diet, adiponectin null mice rapidly develop glucose intolerance. Specific PPARgamma agonists such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) improve insulin sensitivity by mechanisms largely unknown. Circulating adiponectin levels are significantly up-regulated in vivo upon activation of PPARgamma. Both TZDs and adiponectin have been shown to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the same target tissues. We wanted to address whether the ability of TZDs to improve glucose tolerance is dependent on adiponectin and whether this improvement involved AMPK activation. We demonstrate that the ability of PPARgamma agonists to improve glucose tolerance in ob/ob mice lacking adiponectin is diminished. Adiponectin is required for the activation of AMPK upon TZD administration in both liver and muscle. In summary, adiponectin is an important contributor to PPARgamma-mediated improvements in glucose tolerance through mechanisms that involve the activation of the AMPK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2028469454,"The mechanism of the arginine-rich peptide-mediated cellular uptake is currently a controversial issue. Several factors, including the type of peptide, the nature of the cargo, and the linker between them, appear to affect uptake. One of the less studied factors, which may affect the uptake mechanism, is the effect of peptide density on the surface of the cargo. Here, we examined the mechanism of cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of liposomes modified with different densities of the octaarginine (R8) peptide. Liposomes modified with a low R8 density were taken up mainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, leading to extensive lysosomal degradation, whereas those modified with a high R8 density were taken up mainly through macropinocytosis and were less subject to lysosomal degradation. Furthermore, the high density R8-liposomes were able to stimulate the macropinocytosis-mediated uptake of other particles. When plasmid DNA was condensed and encapsulated in R8-liposomes, the levels of gene expression were three orders of magnitude higher for the high density liposomes. The enhanced gene expression by the high density R8-liposomes was highly impaired by blocking uptake through macropinocytosis. The different extents of gene expression from different densities of the R8 peptide on the liposomes could be explained principally by the existence of an intracellular trafficking route, but not by the uptake amount, of internalized liposomes. These results show that the density of the R8 peptide on liposomes determines the uptake mechanism and that this is directly linked to intracellular trafficking, resulting in different levels of gene expression.

The attachment of TAT directly to the liposome surface without a spacer or the presence of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol spacers abolished liposome internalization, indicating the importance of the direct contact of TAT with the cell surface (4Torchilin V.P.

Despite the well demonstrated ability of TAT to internalize different cargos, the internalization mechanism of the peptide itself or its cargo remains a controversial issue. According to early studies, none of the classic receptor-, transporter-, or endocytosis-mediated processes seemed to be involved in the uptake of TAT and other similar peptides (8Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar, 9Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J.

Direct penetration- and inverted micelle-driven delivery have been suggested as possible internalization mechanisms (10Trehin R. Merkle H.P. Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 2004; 58: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of entry was recently re-evaluated based on possible problems that may occur due to cell fixation prior to microscopy observation, and more evidence appeared to support the involvement of endocytosis (11Richard J.P.

Ther. 2003; 8: 284-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The TAT sequence, which is critical for translocation, contains several arginine residues (19Futaki S.

Homopolymers of arginine are similar to the TAT peptide in terms of efficiency and uptake mechanism (19Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, 20Suzuki T. Futaki S. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2437-2443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), making them a possible candidate for mimicking the TAT peptide. The optimum number of arginine residues for efficient internalization was shown to be ∼8 residues (19Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). The octaarginine (R8) peptide could mediate the efficient intracellular delivery of macromolecules, and similar to the TAT peptide but less studied, the exact uptake mechanism of R8-cargos is still largely unknown. The diversity of results regarding the uptake mechanism of arginine-rich peptides suggests that some factors may affect the entry mechanism. These factors include the type of peptide, its mode of exposure to the cell surface, the nature of the cargo, and the chemical linkage between the peptide and the cargo (21Brooks H. Lebleu B. Vives E. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). For example, we have previously shown that the R8 peptide and its complexes with DNA were taken up by different mechanisms, suggesting that the nature of the interaction between the peptide and the cell surface (i.e. the peptide in free or complexed state) affects the uptake mechanism (22Khalil I.A. Futaki S. Niwa M. Baba Y. Kaji N. Kamiya H. Harashima H. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Another possible factor that has been less studied is the effect of peptide density on the internalization mechanism. It was previously shown that a single TAT peptide was sufficient to allow the cellular delivery of an unfolded fusion construct of the same protein (23Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Other studies showed that several TAT peptides attached to the surface of the cargo were required to permit efficient cellular delivery (24Eguchi A. Akuta T. Okuyama H. Senda T. Yokoi H. Inokuchi H. Fujita S. Hayakawa T. Takeda K. Hasegawa M. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26204-26210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, no direct comparison to show the effect of peptide density on the uptake mechanism was conducted. Liposomes are good tools for use in such a comparison, because their surface can be easily modified with different densities of peptide and they can provide localized areas of high peptide density that are available to interact with the cell membrane. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of peptide density on the internalization mechanism and intracellular trafficking of cargos modified with arginine-rich peptides. The R8 peptide was chosen as a prototype of arginine-rich peptides and liposomes were chosen as an example of cargos. Here, we present results showing that the mechanism of uptake of liposomes modified with a low R8 density shifted from clathrin-mediated endocytosis to macropinocytosis when the density of R8 was increased. The uptake route influenced intracellular trafficking, resulting in a remarkable difference in gene expression when condensed plasmid DNA was encapsulated into each type of liposome. These results highlight important features concerning the mechanism of entry and intracellular fate of R8-modified nanoparticles and demonstrate the role of the peptide density in determining the cellular uptake pathways of cargos. Furthermore, the data provided here indicate that uptake through macropinocytosis is more efficient in terms of avoiding lysosomal degradation resulting in an enhanced gene expression. Materials—Egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC), cholesterol (Chol), N-(lissaminerhodamine-B-sulfonyl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Rh-PE), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (NBD-PE), and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Sulforhodamine B, Syto-24, tetramethylrhodamine-labeled neutral dextran (70 kDa), FITC-labeled transferrin, and LysoSensor Green were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS), poly-l-lysine, amiloride, and filipin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Stearylated-octaarginine was synthesized as described previously (25Futaki S. Ohashi W. Suzuki T. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Harashima H. Sugiura Y. Bioconjug. Chem. 2001; 12: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Other chemicals were purchased from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Plasmid DNA Pcmv-luc-encoding luciferase was prepared by using an EndFree Plasmid Mega Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Preparation of the Octaarginine-modified Liposomes—Liposomes were basically composed of EPC and Chol (7:3 molar ratio), and stearylated-R8 (STR-R8) was incorporated at 0-10 mol % of the total lipid. To label the lipid phase, Rh-PE or NBD-phosphoethanolamine was incorporated at 1 mol % of the total lipid. Liposomes were prepared by hydration method followed by extrusion with a Mini-Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids), through polycarbonate membrane filters (Nucleopore) of 400, 200, and 100 nm. Sulforhodamine B was used as an aqueous phase marker, when required. Liposomes were purified on a Bio-Gel A-1.5m column (100-200 mesh). The particle sizes of the liposomes were measured by a quasi-elastic light scattering method, and the zeta potential was determined by means of an electrophoretic light scattering spectrophotometer (ELS-8000, Photal Otsuka Electronics). Preparation of the Octaarginine-modified DNA-coated Particles—Plasmid DNA was condensed with poly-l-lysine as described previously (26Kogure K. Moriguchi R. Sasaki K. Ueno M. Futaki S. Harashima H. J. Control. Release. 2004; 98: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A condensed DNA solution was then added to the lipid film, formed by the evaporation of a chloroform solution of the lipids: EPC/Chol/STR-R8 (7:3:0.086 or 0.52 molar ratio), or DOPE/CHEMS (9:2 molar ratio) on the bottom of a glass tube, followed by incubation for 10 min to hydrate the lipid film. The glass tube was then sonicated for ∼1 min in a bath-type sonicator (125 W, Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT). In the case of DOPE/CHEMS, the particles, after sonication, were incubated with an aqueous solution of STR-R8 (0.86 or 5.2 mol % of total lipids) for 30 min at room temperature. The size and zeta potential of the coated particles were measured as described above. Confocal Laser Microscopy—To investigate the cellular uptake of the R8-modified liposomes (R8-Lip), NIH3T3 cells were treated with double-labeled R8-Lip (NBD-labeled lipid and rhodamine-labeled aqueous phase, final concentration of 0.1 mm lipid) in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and analyzed by confocal laser microscopy (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). To investigate the mechanism of internalization of R8-Lip, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of sucrose (0.4 m) for 30 min or amiloride (5 mm) for 10 min. Different R8-liposomes, containing a rhodamine aqueous phase, were then added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. The cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS supplemented with heparin and observed by confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with Syto-24 in the last 20 min of incubation. For the colocalization study, in the case of transferrin, cells were first incubated with R8-Lip containing rhodamine aqueous phase for 30 min, the medium was then removed, a new medium containing FITC-labeled transferrin (5 μm) was added, and incubation was continued for 5 min before observation within 5 min. In the case of neutral dextran, NBD-labeled R8-liposomes were added to cells followed by adding tetramethylrhodamine-labeled neutral dextran (5 μm) and incubation continued for 30 min. The medium was then exchanged with liposome-free medium containing neutral dextran followed by incubation for 10 min. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and observed. To investigate the intracellular fate of the liposomes, NIH3T3 cells were treated with different R8-liposomes containing an aqueous rhodamine phase at 37 °C for 30 min. The medium was then removed; the cells were washed with new medium, incubated in fresh liposome-free medium for a total of 1, 3, or 6 h, and then observed with confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with Syto-24 in the last 20 min of incubation. The same experiment was repeated using R8-Lip modified with low density of STR-R8 and containing rhodamine aqueous phase in the absence or presence of non-labeled R8-Lip modified with a high density of STR-R8 (a 5-fold increase, calculated as R8 content). To quantify the intracellular fluorescence, the total pixel areas of the fluorescence were measured using AquaCosmos software (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). To investigate the colocalization of R8-Lip with lysosomes, cells were incubated with different R8-Lip preparations containing rhodamine aqueous phase at 37 °C for 30 min. The medium was then removed; the cells were washed with new medium and incubated in fresh liposome-free medium for a total of 3 h. Thirty minutes before observation by confocal microscopy, the LysoSensor was applied at a final concentration of 1 μm to stain the acidic compartments. Flow Cytometry—To investigate the cellular uptake of R8-Lip, NIH3T3 cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing different R8-Lip (final concentration, 0.1 mm lipids) for 1 h at 37°C. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS with or without heparin (20 units.ml-1). The cells were then trypsinized and washed twice by centrifugation at 4°C(± heparin), suspended in 1 ml of PBS, and, after passing through a nylon mesh, they were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). To investigate the cellular association in the presence of heparin, NIH3T3 cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing increasing concentrations of heparin for 5 min at 37 °C. Different R8-Lip preparations containing rhodamine aqueous phase were then added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, trypsinized, washed twice by centrifugation at 4 °C, suspended in 1 ml of PBS, passed through a nylon mesh, and analyzed by flow cytometry. To examine the mechanism of internalization of R8-Lip, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of a mixture of metabolic inhibitors (sodium azide, 0.1%, sodium fluoride, 10 mm, and antimycin A, 1 μg.ml-1) for 30 min, sucrose (0.4 m) for 30 min, amiloride (5 mm) for 10 min, or filipin (1 μg.ml-1) for 1 h. Different R8-Lip preparations, containing rhodamine aqueous phase, were then added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. Then cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after washing 3 times with PBS supplemented with heparin, as described above. To investigate the uptake of neutral dextran, cells were incubated with tetramethylrhodamine-labeled neutral dextran (5 μm) in the presence or absence of empty (non-labeled) R8-Lip modified with a high density of STR-R8 for 30 min at 37 °C then analyzed. To investigate the stimulation of macropinocytosis, cells were incubated with R8-Lip modified with low density of STR-R8 and containing a rhodamine aqueous phase mixed with increasing concentrations of empty (non-labeled) R8-Lip modified with a high density of STR-R8 for 1 h at 37 °C. The experiment was performed in the presence or absence of amiloride (5 mm) to inhibit macropinocytic uptake. Transfection Assay—One day before transfection, NIH3T3 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 4 × 104 cells per well. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.25 ml of serum-free medium containing different R8-modified DNA-coated particles containing 0.4 μg of DNA. Next, 1 ml of medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added, and the incubation continued for an additional 23 h. The cells were then washed and solubilized with reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity in the cell lysate was then measured by means of a luminometer (Luminescencer-PSN, ATTO, Japan). The amount of protein in the cell lysate was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). To investigate the contribution of different uptake pathways in gene expression, cells were pretreated with or without sucrose (0.4 m) or amiloride (2.5 mm) for 10 min and R8-modified DNA-coated particles (lipid composition DOPE/CHEMS) containing 5.2 mol % STR-R8 were then added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. The medium was then removed, and the cells were washed 3 times with PBS containing 20 units.ml-1 heparin and once with PBS. The cells were then incubated in the presence of serum-free medium for 70 min followed by further incubation in the presence of 1 ml of medium containing 10% FBS for periods of up to 12 h. To control the effects of sucrose or amiloride on intracellular events, cells were first loaded with R8-modified DNA-coated particles for 1 h, then washed and incubated for 70 min in the presence of these reagents, after which, 1 ml of medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added, and the cells were further incubated for a total of 12 h. Preparation and Characterization of Octaarginine-modified Liposomes—A series of R8-Lip containing various concentrations of STR-R8 peptide was prepared. In this preparation, the stearyl moiety acts as an anchor to the lipid membrane leaving the R8 peptide freely attached to the surface. The zeta potential of the prepared liposomes was determined as a measure of their net charge (Fig. 1A). Increasing the concentration of STR-R8 peptide caused an initial rapid increase in zeta potential followed by a slower increase for concentrations up to ∼5mol %. No further increase in zeta potential was observed >5 mol % STR-R8, indicating that the liposomal surface was saturated with the cationic peptide. In the next experiments, we chose liposomes modified with a low density (0.86 mol %) of STR-R8 (R8-Lip-LD), which had a low positive charge, and those modified with a high density (5.2 mol %) of STR-R8 (R8-Lip-HD), which had the highest possible positive charge. Data related to the characterization of the different liposomes used in this study are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Characterization of R8-modified liposomesLipid composition (molar ratio)DiameteraData represent means ± S.D. of at least two different determinations.Zeta potentialaData represent means ± S.D. of at least two different determinations.nmmVR8-Lip-LD-RAbRA, liposomes containing rhodamine-labeled aqueous phase.EPC:Chol:STR-R8 (7:3:0.086)152 ± 1813 ± 11R8-Lip-HD-RAbRA, liposomes containing rhodamine-labeled aqueous phase.EPC:Chol:STR-R8 (7:3:0.52)102 ± 1035 ± 4R8-Lip-LD-FLcFL, liposomes containing NBD-labeled lipid phase.EPC:Chol:NBD-PE:STR-R8 (7:3:0.1:0.085)170 ± 27 ± 1R8-Lip-HD-FLcFL, liposomes containing NBD-labeled lipid phase.EPC:Chol:NBD-PE:STR-R8 (7:3:0.1:0.52)149 ± 340 ± 1a Data represent means ± S.D. of at least two different determinations.b RA, liposomes containing rhodamine-labeled aqueous phase.c FL, liposomes containing NBD-labeled lipid phase. Open table in a new tab Cellular Uptake of R8-liposomes—First, we quantitatively compared the cellular uptake of R8-Lip-LD and R8-Lip-HD containing an aqueous rhodamine phase by flow cytometry. We confirmed that the surface-bound liposomes could be removed by means of heparin wash (data not shown). The measured intracellular fluorescence in the case of R8-Lip-HD was higher than that for R8-Lip-LD by less than one order of magnitude (Fig. 1B). When we measured the total fluorescence (surface-bound plus internalized liposomes) by excluding the heparin washes, we found that the fluorescence in the case of R8-Lip-HD was about one order of magnitude higher than that in the case of R8-Lip-LD (data not shown). Liposomes that were devoid of STR-R8 did not show any intracellular or surface-bound fluorescence (data not shown). The cellular uptake of both liposomes was further confirmed using confocal laser microscopy of living cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Surface-bound fluorescence was higher in the case of R8-Lip-HD. Taken together; these results indicate that both R8-Lip-LD and R8-Lip-HD can bind to the cell surface, especially R8-Lip-HD, and that they are efficiently internalized. Transfection Activities of R8-Lip Containing Plasmid DNA—Because R8-Lip showed a high potential for the intracellular delivery of macromolecules encapsulated in their cores, we investigated the cellular uptake of R8-Lip-containing plasmid DNA, for use in gene delivery. We prepared condensed DNA particles coated with a lipid envelope consisting of EPC and Chol and modified with the R8 peptide (R8-modified coated particles, R8-Cps) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We incubated the cells for 1 h with R8-Cps containing FITC-labeled DNA modified with 0.86 or 5.2 mol % STR-R8 (R8-Cps-LD and R8-Cps-HD) and then observed the cells by confocal microscopy. In both cases, the intracellular fluorescence was similar to the pattern of distribution obtained earlier with R8-Lip (data not shown), indicating the efficient cellular uptake of plasmid DNA encapsulated in the R8-Lip. We next investigated the transfection efficiency of R8-Cps containing plasmid DNA encoding a luciferase reporter gene. R8-Cps-LD did not show a significant gene expression, whereas the R8-Cps-HD produced gene expression levels about 3 orders of magnitude higher (Fig. 1C). This difference in gene expression is not correlated with the difference in cellular uptake as indicated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Therefore, the superiority of the R8-Cps-HD regarding gene expression cannot be explained by differences in the amount of DNA internalized, but that there are intracellular events responsible for this difference. Mechanism of Uptake of Different R8-liposomes—Because the gene expression levels of the R8-Cps were not correlated with the amount of liposomes internalized, we investigated the mechanism of uptake of different R8-Lip as a candidate to explain the difference in the intracellular fate of the particles. It has previously been shown that the cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as nonspecific receptors in the cellular binding of different protein transduction domain (PTD) peptides (27Richard J.P.

As mentioned above, several washings with a buffer containing heparin were sufficient to remove the surface-bound liposomes. Furthermore, the addition of heparin to the medium prior to the addition of R8-Lip dramatically inhibited the cellular binding and internalization of R8-Lip especially in the case of R8-Lip-LD (supplemental Fig. S1). In both cases, concentrations as low as 1 unit·ml-1 were sufficient to completely block the interaction of the liposomes with the cell surface. Taken together, these data probably show the involvement of cell-surface HSPGs in the uptake of R8-Lip, similar to other PTD-liposomes (6Marty C. Meylan C. Schott H. Ballmer-Hofer K. Schwendener R.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of the endocytic pathway in the internalization of R8-Lip, we"

GroEL2 is essential--presumably providing the housekeeping chaperone functions--while groEL1 is nonessential, contains the attB site for phage Bxb1 integration, and encodes a putative chaperone with unusual structural features. Inactivation of the Mycobacterium smegmatis groEL1 gene by phage Bxb1 integration allows normal planktonic growth but prevents the formation of mature biofilms. GroEL1 modulates synthesis of mycolates--long-chain fatty acid components of the mycobacterial cell wall--specifically during biofilm formation and physically associates with KasA, a key component of the type II Fatty Acid Synthase involved in mycolic acid synthesis. Biofilm formation is associated with elevated synthesis of short-chain (C56-C68) fatty acids, and strains with altered mycolate profiles--including an InhA mutant resistant to the antituberculosis drug isoniazid and a strain overexpressing KasA--are defective in biofilm formation."

Calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is one of the most important transducers of Ca2+ signals in a variety of cell types and is highly conserved across animal species (Hudmon and Schulman, 2002Hudmon A. Schulman H. Structure-function of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 593-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A fundamental difference between CaMKII, which assembles into a dodecameric holoenzyme, and other CaM-dependent kinases is that CaMKII has the capacity to retain a “memory” of prior activation by Ca2+/CaM because of a two step activation process. In the first step, which is similar to the activation process of the monomeric CaM kinases (Goldberg et al., 1996Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J.

This releases the catalytic activity of the enzyme and makes accessible a regulatory residue, Thr 286 (mouse CaMKIIα isoform numbering, used throughout the text). The second step is the phosphorylation of Thr 286 by another kinase domain within the oligomeric holoenzyme (Lai et al., 1986Lai Y. Nairn A.C. Greengard P.

C-terminal to the autoinhibitory segment in CaMKII is the “association domain,” which assembles CaMKII into a dodecameric holoenzyme (Gaertner et al., 2004Gaertner T.R. Kolodziej S.J. Wang D.

Once a kinase subunit is activated by Ca2+/CaM, it can phosphorylate adjacent subunits that are also bound to Ca2+/CaM. If the concentration of Ca2+ is high, phosphorylation on Thr 286 will spread rapidly through the holoenzyme, leading to the onset of Ca2+/CaM-independent activity. When the Ca2+ concentration is low, Thr 286 is dephosphorylated before activation can proceed. Little is known at present about how the structure of the holoenzyme controls the acquisition of Ca2+/CaM autonomous activity. Also poorly understood is how the architecture of the holoenzyme prevents the high local concentration of kinase domains from generating background phosphorylation levels that would interfere with the proper response to Ca2+. The crystal structure of the association domain of mouse CaMKIIα has been determined and reveals a stacked arrangement of two 7-fold symmetric rings (Hoelz et al., 2003Hoelz A. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Crystal structure of a tetradecameric assembly of the association domain of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1241-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The formation of 14-membered rather than the expected dodecameric rings by the isolated association domain is a consequence of removing the kinase domains (O.S.R., S.D., L. Comolli, A. Hoelz, K. Downing, A.C.N., and J.K., unpublished data). The fundamental unit of assembly is a dimer of association domains, consisting of one subunit each from the upper and lower rings. The N-terminal segments of each association domain form α helices that are arrayed around the edges of the midplane of the assembly and serve as the connection points for the kinase domains. A model for the dodecameric association-domain ring can be generated by removing one dimeric element from the 14-membered ring and closing the gap while maintaining symmetry (Hoelz et al., 2003Hoelz A. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Crystal structure of a tetradecameric assembly of the association domain of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1241-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar; O.S.R., S.D., L. Comolli, A. Hoelz, K. Downing, A.C.N., and J.K., unpublished data). We describe here the crystal structure of the autoinhibited kinase domain of CaMKII and discuss how it is maintained in an inactive state by the Ca2+/CaM responsive regulatory element. An unexpected feature of the structure is the organization of the autoinhibited kinase domains into dimers, in a manner that is suggestive of a mechanism for controlling autophosphorylation within the holoenzyme. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis suggests that the autoinhibited and dimeric kinase domains are arranged in a ring that is coplanar with and tightly packed against the ring formed by the association domain. Arrangement of the kinase domains in this manner has important consequences for the mechanism by which CaMKII is activated and acquires Ca2+/CaM-independent activity. We crystallized the kinase and regulatory domains (residues 1–340, referred to in this text as “the autoinhibited kinase domain”) of Caenorhabditis elegans CaMKII, UNC-43 (all C. elegans constructs described here were derived from the splice variant K11E8.d) The use of an inactive mutant enzyme (Asp 135 Asn) was required for prevention of heterogeneity due to phosphorylation (data not shown). This fragment of C. elegans CaMKII is 77% identical in sequence to the corresponding region of human CaMKIIα (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). There are two structurally similar autoinhibited kinase domains in the asymmetric unit of the crystal (Table S1; Experimental Procedures). The regulatory segment (residues 273–317) emerges from the base of the kinase domain and runs, at its N-terminal end, through the channel formed between helices αD and αF of the kinase (Figure 1, Figure 2). It ends in a long α helix. The regulatory segment separates from the main body of the kinase at residue Arg 297, at which point it begins to make hydrophobic interactions with the regulatory helix from the other kinase domain in the asymmetric unit. The CaM binding residues span residues 290 to 314 within the regulatory segment (Figures 1B and 1C; see also Meador et al., 1993Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Modulation of calmodulin plasticity in molecular recognition on the basis of x-ray structures.Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The two regulatory helices form a left-handed and antiparallel coiled coil, ending at residue 315 (Crick, 1953Crick F. The packing of [alpha]-helices: simple coiled-coils.Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar, Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001Walshaw J. Woolfson D.N. Socket: a program for identifying and analysing coiled-coil motifs within protein structures.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1427-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The region between residues 291 and 320 of CaMKII is predicted to form a coiled coil with a low but significant probability (Lupas et al., 1991Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Predicting coiled coils from protein sequences.Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3404) Google Scholar). In contrast, the monomeric CaM-dependent kinases show little or no probability of coiled-coil formation in the regulatory segment (Figure S2). Gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments demonstrate that the autoinhibited kinase domain is monomeric in solution at concentrations below ∼100 μM (data not shown). Electron microscopic images of the most expanded forms of CaMKII correspond to a cylinder of radius ∼100 Å and height ∼200 Å (Kolodziej et al., 2000Kolodziej S.J. Hudmon A. Waxham M.N. Stoops J.K. Three-dimensional reconstructions of calcium/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase IIalpha and truncated CaM kinase IIalpha reveal a unique organization for its structural core and functional domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14354-14359Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Using these dimensions, the local concentration of subunits is estimated to be in the range of 3 mM within the holoenzyme. The two elements of the coiled coil are linked to spatially adjacent points on the association domain, which is likely to further strengthen their interaction. At the same time, the coiled coil cannot be so strong that the binding of Ca2+/CaM to it is impeded. It is therefore not surprising that the isolated autoinhibited kinase domains are monomeric at low concentration rather than dimeric. In order to determine whether the autoinhibited kinase domains interact with one another within the holoenzyme, we compared the binding of fluorescent Ca2+/CaM to C. elegans CaMKII holoenzyme (Asp 135 Asn mutant) and to an isolated autoinhibited kinase domain fragment. The CaMKII holoenzyme binds to Ca2+/CaM with an EC50 value of 145 nM (±12) and with an apparent Hill coefficient of 2.3 (±0.4) (Figure S3). These values are similar to those presented previously for mammalian CaMKII (Gaertner et al., 2004Gaertner T.R. Kolodziej S.J. Wang D. Kobayashi R. Koomen J.M. Stoops J.K. Waxham M.N. Comparative analyses of the three-dimensional structures and enzymatic properties of alpha, beta, gamma and delta isoforms of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12484-12494Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding of the isolated autoinhibited kinase domain (Asp 135 Asn mutant) to Ca2+/CaM occurs with an EC50 value of 40 nM ± 18 and an apparent Hill coefficient of 1.2 ± 0.4. Although these data do not directly confirm that the particular dimer we see in the crystal structure is relevant for holoenzyme function, the Hill coefficient of ∼2 for Ca2+/CaM binding to the holoenzyme is consistent with a sequential binding model in which the first Ca2+/CaM to bind to the holoenzyme disrupts a higher-order structure, thereby facilitating the binding of a second Ca2+/CaM molecule. Taken together with the evidence that the autoregulatory domains form a classical coiled coil it is reasonable to hypothesize that the interactions we see in the crystal structure of the autoinhibited kinase domain are similar to those that exist in the holoenzyme. CaMKII does not require phosphorylation for catalytic activity, and the structure of the autoinhibited kinase domain of CaMKII displays many hallmarks of active protein kinases (Nolen et al., 2004Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Regulation of protein kinases: Controlling activity through activation segment conformation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar; Figure S4A). Nevertheless, the kinase is held in an inactive state by the regulatory segment, which blocks substrate binding (Figure 2). The affinity of ATP for CaMKII is reduced significantly in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (Colbran, 1993Colbran R.J.

It is surprising, therefore, to find that the regulatory segment of CaMKII avoids the ATP binding site of the N lobe of the kinase. This contrasts with the close interactions seen between the regulatory segment and the ATP binding site in monomeric CaM kinases (Figure 2B). The reduced ATP affinity of autoinhibited CaMKII could be due to a significant change in the orientation of helix αD in the C lobe of the kinase (Figure 3A), which is rotated by 45° and translated by 5 Å with respect to its orientation in active phosphorylase kinase, a closely related CaM-activated kinase (Lowe et al., 1997Lowe E.D.

In CaMKII, the regulatory segment causes the rotation of helix αD, which swings Glu 96 away from the ATP binding site. His 282 forms a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen in the backbone of Tyr 108 and anchors the D helix in its inactive state (Figure 3A). Mutation of His 282 has been shown experimentally to alter ATP binding to CaMKII (Brickey et al., 1994Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R.

ATP binding to CaMKII may also be weakened by an ∼15° outward rotation in the relative orientations of the N and C lobes of the kinase domain that is stabilized by the formation of a network of ionic interactions among residues Glu 17, Arg 28, and Glu 38 in the dimer (Figure S4B). The altered orientation of helix αD has been seen in other inactive CaM kinases (Goldberg et al., 1996Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J.

We therefore analyzed the consequences of removing the regulatory segment on the orientation of helix αD by using molecular dynamics simulations. Four simulations were generated: one each for the dimer unit and a monomer with the regulatory segment, and two for the kinase-domain monomer without the regulatory segment. Each of these trajectories was calculated for a fully solvated protein using periodic boundary conditions and the program AMBER (Case et al., 2004Case, D.A., Darden, T.A., Cheatham, I.T.E., Simmerling, C.L., Wang, J., Duke, R.E., Luo, R., Merz, K.M., Wang, B., Pearlman, D.A., et al. (2004). AMBER (computer program). University of California San Francisco.Google Scholar, University of California, San Francisco) and extends to 9.0 ns, 16.5 ns, 20.0 ns, and 39.2 ns, respectively. As expected, in the dimer structure and in the monomer with the regulatory domain in place there were no gross changes in the overall conformation. Strikingly, in both of the simulations with the regulatory segment removed, the orientation of helix αD changed after ∼10 ns in one simulation and after ∼30 ns in the other simulation so that it more closely resembled the conformation seen in active kinases. Glu 96 can now interact readily with the hydroxyl groups of the ribose of ATP (Figures 3B, 3C, and S5). This spontaneous transition into the active conformation suggests that removal of the constraints imposed by the regulatory segment would lead to the ready acquisition of catalytic activity by the kinase domain. Thr 286, the phosphorylation of which renders the enzyme Ca2+/CaM independent, is buried between the surface of the αD/αF channel and the regulatory segment. The threonine side chain is located almost precisely at the negative pole of the helix dipole of helix αF (Figure 2A), and phosphorylation will clearly destabilize the docking of Thr 286 in the αD/αF channel. There is a clear spatial separation between the region of the regulatory segment involved in inhibiting the kinase domain (residues 280 to 295 on one face of the helix) and the region that forms the coiled-coil interaction (residues 293 to 317 on the other face of the helix). This implies that a transient release of the regulatory segment from the αD/αF channel of the kinase domain can occur with retention of the coiled-coil interaction, which serves as a strut to keep the two active sites away from either of the Thr 286 sites of phosphorylation (Figure 4A). Likewise, a spontaneous disruption of the coiled-coil interaction would still have the regulatory segment bound to the kinase domain (Figure 4B). Transautophosphorylation would require the simultaneous breakage of the coiled-coil interaction and the release of the autoinhibitory segments from both kinase domains, which appears much less likely without the addition of Ca2+/CaM. Two quite different models have been proposed, based on electron microscopy, to describe the assembly of the CaMKII holoenzyme (Kolodziej et al., 2000Kolodziej S.J. Hudmon A. Waxham M.N. Stoops J.K. Three-dimensional reconstructions of calcium/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase IIalpha and truncated CaM kinase IIalpha reveal a unique organization for its structural core and functional domains.J.

Biol. 2001; 308: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In one model the kinase domains are arranged in a plane around the central ring of the association domain, forming a flattened disc (Morris and Torok, 2001Morris E.P. Torok K. Oligomeric structure of alpha-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the other model the holoenzyme is roughly cylindrical with a height of ∼200 Å, and the kinase domains are located above and below the plane of the association-domain ring in an alternating pattern such that they do not interact (Kolodziej et al., 2000Kolodziej S.J. Hudmon A. Waxham M.N. Stoops J.K. Three-dimensional reconstructions of calcium/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase IIalpha and truncated CaM kinase IIalpha reveal a unique organization for its structural core and functional domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14354-14359Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In order to distinguish between these two models, we made a series of SAXS measurements for full-length C. elegans CaMKII and compared the results to the predicted scattering from a set of model dodecameric holoenzyme structures. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the holoenzyme was determined to be 72 Å from our SAXS data. Six dimeric autoinhibited kinase domains were arrayed around the central ring of a dodecameric association domain, modeled on the basis of the crystal structure (Hoelz et al., 2003Hoelz A. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Crystal structure of a tetradecameric assembly of the association domain of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1241-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Calculations of the Rg of the holoenzyme model are very sensitive to changes in the distance from the center of the association-domain ring to the centers of mass of the autoinhibited kinase domains. We fixed the radial position of the kinase dimer (in the plane of the association domain) at a distance that resulted in a calculated Rg value that is closest to the experimental value. This model places the kinase dimers such that they pack against the α helices extending from the association domain (Figure 5A; see also Figure 7A for a cartoon rendering). Examination of maps of electrostatic surfaces of the association domain and of the autoinhibited kinase-domain dimer reveals a striking complementarity between the edges of the association-domain disk and the regulatory segments of the kinase domains (Figures S6A and S6B). We rotated the autoinhibited kinase domain dimers so as to align their surfaces based on the electrostatic complementarity. The calculated Rg values are not very sensitive to rotations of the kinase dimer around axes that are parallel to the midplane of the association-domain ring. Thus, this rotational placement is not constrained significantly by the SAXS data and should simply be considered as a reasonable juxtaposition of the two assemblies. Starting from this model, each kinase dimer was then separated into individual kinase domains arrayed symmetrically in planes above and below the midplane. By varying the vertical separation of the kinase-domain rings, a series of structural models was generated (Figures 5A and 5B). The radius of gyration of each model in the series was calculated using the program package Crysol (Svergun et al., 1995Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. Crysol—a program to evaluate X-ray solution scattering of biological macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2624) Google Scholar) and compared to the experimental value of Rg (72 Å). As the autoinhibited kinase domains move out of the plane of the association domain, the calculated values of Rg deviate sharply from the experimental value (Figure 5C). We also generated a series of models that had the same calculated value of Rg (matching the experimental value for the C. elegans holoenzyme) by displacing the rings of the autoinhibited kinase domains above and below the association domains while simultaneously shrinking the radius of the autoinhibited kinase rings (Figure 5D). The fit of the calculated scattering curve to the experimental curve was found to be best for a model in which the individual autoinhibited kinase domains are held together as dimer pairs in an outer ring that is coplanar with the central plane (Figures 5E and 5F). In the next step of the SAXS analysis, we generated shape reconstructions for the holoenzyme using a simulated annealing procedure (Svergun, 1999Svergun D.I. Restoring low resolution structure of biological macromolecules from solution scattering using simulated annealing.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). Based on earlier electron microscopic data showing 6-fold symmetry in the holoenzyme (Morris and Torok, 2001Morris E.P. Torok K. Oligomeric structure of alpha-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and crystallographic data showing a 2-fold symmetry in the association domain (Hoelz et al., 2003Hoelz A. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Crystal structure of a tetradecameric assembly of the association domain of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1241-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we imposed a constraint of 622 symmetry on the reconstruction of the shape of the holoenzyme. The final shape reconstruction (see Experimental Procedures) is a flattened disk with a diameter of ∼200 Å and a height of ∼60 Å (Figures 6A and 6B). The reconstruction has a hole in its center with a diameter of ∼20 Å, and the 6-fold symmetric model of the association domain can be readily docked into the reconstruction so that it wraps around the hole. Arranged around this central core of the shape reconstruction are six protrusions that extend out parallel to the plane of the association-domain ring. We interpret these protuberances as general indications of the positions of the kinase-/regulatory-domain dimers and have docked the holoenzyme model (described above and shown in Figure 6B) into the SAXS shape reconstruction. As the C lobes of the kinases are mainly helical and expected to be more rigid, we speculate that the six stalks arrayed from the central association-domain ring represent two adjacent C lobes, with the intervening weaker features in the shape reconstruction corresponding to pairs of adjacent N lobes. This alternating pattern of electron density is compatible with the two-dimensional reconstructions of Morris and Torok, 2001Morris E.P. Torok K. Oligomeric structure of alpha-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar. We have checked the robustness of these results by carrying out shape reconstructions with 32 symmetry (one 3-fold axis with perpendicular 2-fold axes) instead of 622 symmetry (Figure S7A ). We also did a SAXS-based shape reconstruction for the M. musculus CaMKIIα holoenzyme (Figure S7B) that was generally very similar to that of the C. elegans holoenzyme. As a further control, we also carried out a shape reconstruction for the mouse CaMKIIα association domain (residues 334–472), for which the crystal structure is known (Hoelz et al., 2003Hoelz A. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Crystal structure of a tetradecameric assembly of the association domain of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1241-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The shape reconstruction, obtained without imposing any constraints of symmetry, shows satisfactory agreement with the crystal structure (Figure S7C). One of the most intriguing properties of CaMKII is its ability to respond to Ca2+ signals in a manner that depends on the frequency with which Ca2+ levels rise and fall (De Koninck and Schulman, 1998De Koninck P. Schulman H. Sensitivity of CaM kinase II to the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations.Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). When the frequency of Ca2+ pulses is low, the kinase activity of CaMKII directly tracks the concentration of Ca2+. When the frequency of Ca2+ pulses is increased, there is a remarkable change in the behavior of the enzyme, and it acquires constitutive activity due to transautophosphorylation on Thr 286 (Hudmon and Schulman, 2002Hudmon A. Schulman H. Structure-function of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 593-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Transautophosphorylation of Thr 286, which occurs within one holoenzyme, requires both the phosphorylating kinase subunit and the “substrate” kinase subunit to be bound to Ca+2/CaM (Bradshaw et al., 2002Bradshaw J.M. Hudmon A. Schulman H. Chemical quenched flow kinetic studies indicate an intraholoenzyme autophosphorylation mechanism for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28424-28429Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In order for the holoenzyme to be sensitive to the frequency and not just the amplitude of Ca2+ pulses, there has to be a delay between the first activation event (the binding of Ca2+/CaM to one regulatory segment) and the activation of a second kinase domain (Hudmon and Schulman, 2002Hudmon A. Schulman H. Structure-function of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 593-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Schulman and coworkers have posited that this delay arises from the greater probability of the second activation event occurring at a more distantly located kinase domain within the holoenzyme rather than an adjacent one, thereby considering the holoenzyme to be a “coincidence detector” for Ca2+/CaM binding. This model is consistent with experiments that show noncooperative acquisition of substrate-directed kinase activity as a function of CaM concentration (Bradshaw et al., 2003Bradshaw J.M. Kubota Y. Meyer T. Schulman H. An ultrasensitive Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-protein phosphatase 1 switch facilitates specificity in postsynaptic calcium signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 10512-10517Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we show here that Ca2+/CaM binds to the CaMKII holoenzyme with an apparent Hill coefficient of ∼2 (see also Gaertner et al., 2004Gaertner T.R. Kolodziej S.J. Wang D. Kobayashi R. Koomen J.M. Stoops J.K. Waxham M.N. Comparative analyses of the three-dimensional structures and enzymatic properties of alpha, beta, gamma and delta isoforms of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12484-12494Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). If the dimer is the fundamental unit of the holoenzyme assembly, it is very likely that once Ca2+/CaM has bound to one autoinhibited kinase domain, the next binding event will occur within the same dimer pair and not at a more distantly located one. Such a process, if unconstrained, would generate pairs of activated kinase domains that would be free to phosphorylate each other immediately. We have considered whether there are elements to the structure of the holoenzyme that may bring about a delay in transautophosphorylation after the initial binding of Ca2+/CaM. If Ca2+/CaM binding were to separate the two kinase domains in a dimer pair above and below the midplane of the association domains, as suggested by some of the electron microscopic reconstructions (Kolodziej et al., 2000Kolodziej S.J. Hudmon A. Waxham M.N. Stoops J.K. Three-dimensional reconstructions of calcium/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase IIalpha and truncated CaM kinase IIalpha reveal a unique organization for its structural core and functional domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14354-14359Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), then transphosphorylation might require adjacent kinase dimers to be activated, so that kinase domains located on the same side of the midplane can reach each other. This kind of mechanism might enable the holoenzyme to serve as a coincidence detector as proposed by Schulman and coworkers, even though two Ca2+/CaM bind cooperatively to each kinase dimer. The connection between the helical regulatory segment of the kinase domain and the first helix of the association domain is almost certainly flexible, as indicated by the sequence and by the location of alternative splice sites at this junction (Figure S1). The outer surface of the association domain, which is mainly negatively charged, has a localized region of positive charge located alongside the edge of the N-terminal α helix of the association domain (Figure 7B, inset). The residues that form this positively charged patch (Arg 371, Arg 453, and Arg 461 in the C. elegans CaMKII association domain) are conserved (Figure S1). The linker segment that leads into the N-terminal α helix of the association domain contains 3 to 4 acidic residues that are also conserved (Figure S1). These residues are either disordered or have variable structure in the association domains and serve no obvious structural function. We speculate that this negatively charged linker region could fold back onto the surface of the association domain when the kinase is activated and thereby interact with the positively charged patch, which is located close to the connection point of the linker. Such an interaction would result in the separation of the two kinase domains from a dimer pair above and below the midplane of the association domain upon activation (Figure 7B). Such separation of adjacent kinase domains would generate an activated holoenzyme assembly that bears similarity to the electron microscopic reconstructions of Waxham and coworkers (Gaertner et al., 2004Gaertner T.R. Kolodziej S.J. Wang D. Kobayashi R. Koomen J.M. Stoops J.K. Waxham M.N. Comparative analyses of the three-dimensional structures and enzymatic properties of alpha, beta, gamma and delta isoforms of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12484-12494Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), as shown schematically (Figure 7C). SAXS data for mouse CaMKIIα holoenzyme measured in the presence and absence of Ca2+/CaM show that the radius of gyration increases from 72.15 ± 0.06 Å (maximum diameter of 235 Å) to 90.48 ± 0.06 Å (maximum diameter of 260 Å) upon the addition of Ca2+/CaM (Figures 7D and 7E). We interpret the ∼18 Å increase in the radius of gyration upon the addition of Ca2+/CaM to represent the release of the kinase domains from the dimeric assembly and their movement away from the centrally docked positions. These results do not allow us to build a meaningful model of the activated state of the holoenzyme, but such a dramatic change in conformation may have an effect on the binding of the many proteins that interact with CaMKII in the postsynaptic density. Our structure of the autoinhibited kinase domain of CaMKII is quite different from those of monomeric Ca2+/CaM-activated enzymes, and one unexpected aspect is the formation of a dimeric coiled-coil strut by the CaM-responsive regulatory segments. The architecture of the dimer is such that the intrinsically active kinase domains are held apart in a way that requires Ca2+/CaM for transphosphorylation and the acquisition of “memory.” The organization of the dimer most likely reflects an evolutionary solution to the problem of preventing accidental transautophosphorylation despite the high concentration of kinase domains in the holoenzyme, ensuring that the activity of this signaling device responds appropriately to Ca2+ levels."

https://openalex.org/W2148379230,"Chromatin modification is considered to be a fundamental mechanism of regulating gene expression to generate coordinated responses to environmental changes, however, whether it could be directly regulated by signals mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest surface receptor family, is not known. Here, we show that stimulation of delta-opioid receptor, a member of the GPCR family, induces nuclear translocation of β-arrestin 1 (βarr1), which was previously known as a cytosolic regulator and scaffold of GPCR signaling. In response to receptor activation, βarr1 translocates to the nucleus and is selectively enriched at specific promoters such as that of p27 and c-fos, where it facilitates the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase p300, resulting in enhanced local histone H4 acetylation and transcription of these genes. Our results reveal a novel function of βarr1 as a cytoplasm-nucleus messenger in GPCR signaling and elucidate an epigenetic mechanism for direct GPCR signaling from cell membrane to the nucleus through signal-dependent histone modification."

In addition, we review the use of RIP-Cre mice and discuss possible molecular underpinnings and ramifications of our findings. Cre-mediated deletion of genomic DNA fragments bracketed by loxP sites has become a standard tool for determining the function of specific genes in mouse development, physiology and disease. In the mouse, the expression of Cre is most frequently accomplished through conventional or BAC-derived fusion genes, infection with Cre-expressing recombinant viruses, or through the insertion of Cre coding sequences into endogenous genes by gene targeting. By varying the regulatory control regions, Cre can be directed to specific cell types and lineages and the temporal aspects of expression can also be modulated. However, the method used to direct Cre to a specific cell type may lead to undesired effects and often involves specific compromises. For instance, although easily and widely performed, the generation of transgenic mice by the method of pronuclear microinjection does not control for site of integration, which can both modulate and extend the expression pattern of Cre. This is more often an issue with short promoter-driven transgenes, since they appear to be more prone to so-called position effects than are much larger BAC-derived transgenes. On the other hand, specific transgenic lines may exhibit traits that are advantageous, such as high levels of expression. It has long been assumed that the expression of Cre recombinase does not adversely affect the physiology of the host cell. However, there have been reports on the apparent toxic effects of Cre (1de Alboran I.M. O'Hagan R.C. Gartner F. Malynn B. Davidson L. Rickert R. Rajewsky K. DePinho R.A. Alt F.W.

Although it is not difficult to test for the independent effect of Cre when performing a conditional knock-out experiment, mice carrying only the Cre transgene are not always used as controls, perhaps due to the widespread impression that the expression of Cre has minimal if any effects on the cell. Experiments on the RIP-Cre mice were performed independently in three laboratories (laboratories of L. H., M. F. W., and M. R.). In the Hennighausen laboratory, six RIP-Cre mice (three males and three females) and 10 control mice (five males and five females) in a pure C57BL/6 background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and were maintained on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle and fed water an open formula National Institutes of Health-specified diet for maintenance, growth, and reproduction (NIH-07 rodent diet). Glucose tolerance tests were performed by intraperitoneal injection of sterile-filtered d-glucose (2 g/kg of fasted body weight). Mice were food-deprived for 15 h prior to the injection. Blood glucose values were measured immediately before and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection using MediSense Precision Xtra (Abbott Laboratories, Bedford, MA). All procedures and studies were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by the NIDDK Animal Care and Use Committee. In the White laboratory, mice were obtained by intercrossing RIP-Cre mice with wild type C57BL/6::129 mice to generate heterozygous offspring. Blood insulin levels were measured by rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Crystal Chem Inc., Chicagi, IL) at the indicated time intervals after intraperitoneal injection of d-glucose (3 g/kg body weight). Glucose tolerance test were performed after intraperitoneal loading with d-glucose (2 g/kg body weight) on 2-month-old male RIP-Cre and wild type mice. All the data used in Fig. 2 were from mixed genetic background mice, and S.E. instead of S.D. was used for Y error. Both male and female C57BL/6::129 mice heterozygous for the RIP-Cre transgene displayed similarly impaired glucose tolerance. Identical results were obtained with mice housed at the Joslin Diabetes Center or at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the Ristow laboratory, RIP-Cre founders (kindly derived from Dr. Kulkarni's colony) were reported to be 66% C57BL/6 initially and were backcrossed with C57BL/6 (Charles River, Munich, Germany) three times prior to breeding of the study group.

A minimum of three animals per sex and genotype were tested. Mice were food-deprived for 16 h before injection. Blood was drawn by retro-orbital puncture at given time points. Serum glucose was immediately determined using MediSense Precision Plus Electrodes (Abbott GmbH & Co KG, Wiesbaden, Germany). Mouse serum insulin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rat insulin using a mouse insulin standard (both from CrystalChem). RIP-Cre Mice—The role of more than 20 genes in either the development or function of pancreatic β-cells has been studied through cell-specific deletion using Cre-expressing transgenic mice. In particular, transgenic mice have been used that express Cre recombinase under control of regulatory regions from either the rat insulin II gene or the mouse Pdx1 gene. The so-called RIP-Cre strain (5Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) of mice has been used successfully in at least 21 studies targeting at least 17 different genes. This strain carries a fusion gene in which the expression of Cre is determined by a 706-bp fragment of the rat insulin II promoter. This strain was initially selected due to the high level at which Cre is expressed, and the efficient manner in which recombination was achieved within more than 80% of the β-cells (6Gannon M. Shiota C. Postic C. Wright C.V. Magnuson M. Genesis. 2000; 26: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In most settings robust Cre expression is considered advantageous, since the rate of recombination is thought to directly parallel the amount of Cre. Although this line of mice is also known to express Cre in the brain (21Ristow M. Mulder H. Pomplun D. Schulz T.J. Muller-Schmehl K. Krause A. Fex M. Puccio H. Muller J. Isken F. Spranger J.

These studies have yielded important new insights into genetic pathways controlling β-cell development and function as well as metabolism controlled by the hypothalamus. In many of these studies the inactivation of the gene under investigation was associated with glucose intolerance, diabetes, and disrupted islet architecture.

https://openalex.org/W1975652448,"Innate immunity is the first line of defense against infection, protecting the host during the development of adaptive immunity and critically affecting the nature of the adaptive response. We show that, in contrast to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), the related protein TWEAK attenuates the transition from innate to adaptive mechanisms. TWEAK-/- mice had overabundant natural killer (NK) cells and displayed hypersensitivity to bacterial endotoxin, with their innate immune cells producing excess interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-12. TWEAK inhibited stimulation of the transcriptional activator STAT-1 and induced p65 nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB association with histone deacetylase 1, repressing cytokine production. TWEAK-/- mice developed oversized spleens with expanded memory and T helper 1 (TH1) subtype cells upon aging and mounted stronger innate and adaptive TH1-based responses against tumor challenge. Thus, TWEAK suppresses production of IFN-gamma and IL-12, curtailing the innate response and its transition to adaptive TH1 immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1982491440,"Proper chromosome segregation requires the attachment of sister kinetochores to microtubules from opposite spindle poles to form bi-oriented chromosomes on the metaphase spindle. The chromosome passenger complex containing Survivin and the kinase Aurora B regulates this process from the centromeres. We report that a de-ubiquitinating enzyme, hFAM, regulates chromosome alignment and segregation by controlling both the dynamic association of Survivin with centromeres and the proper targeting of Survivin and Aurora B to centromeres. Survivin is ubiquitinated in mitosis through both Lys 48 and Lys 63 ubiquitin linkages. Lys 63 de-ubiquitination mediated by hFAM is required for the dissociation of Survivin from centromeres, whereas Lys 63 ubiquitination mediated by the ubiquitin binding protein Ufd1 is required for the association of Survivin with centromeres. Thus, ubiquitinaton regulates dynamic protein-protein interactions and chromosome segregation independently of protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1973615192,"Cathelicidins comprise a family of antimicrobial peptides sharing a highly conserved cathelin domain. Here we report that the entire chicken genome encodes three cathelicidins, namely fowlicidin-1 to -3, which are densely clustered within a 7.5-kb distance at the proximal end of chromosome 2p. Each fowlicidin gene adopts a fourexon, three-intron structure, typical for a mammalian cathelicidin. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that fowlicidins and a group of distantly related mammalian cathelicidins known as neutrophilic granule proteins are likely to originate from a common ancestral gene prior to the separation of birds from mammals, whereas other classic mammalian cathelicidins may have been duplicated from the primordial gene for neutrophilic granule proteins after mammals and birds are diverged. Similar to ovine cathelicidin SMAP-29, putatively mature fowlicidins displayed potent and salt-independent activities against a range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains, with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.4-2.0 μm for most strains. Fowlicidin-1 and -2 also showed cytotoxicity, with 50% killing of mammalian erythrocytes or epithelial cells in the range of 6-40 μm. In addition, two fowlicidins demonstrated a strong positive cooperativity in binding lipopolysaccharide (LPS), resulting in nearly complete blockage of LPS-mediated proinflammatory gene expression in RAW264.7 cells. Taken together, fowlicidin-1 and -2 are clearly among the most potent cathelicidins that have been reported. Their broad spectrum and salt-insensitive antibacterial activities, coupled with their potent LPS-neutralizing activity, make fowlicidins excellent candidates for novel antimicrobial and anti-sepsis agents.

Their broad spectrum and salt-insensitive antibacterial activities, coupled with their potent LPS-neutralizing activity, make fowlicidins excellent candidates for novel antimicrobial and anti-sepsis agents. Cationic antimicrobial peptides comprise a large group of gene-encoded molecules that have been discovered in virtually all species of life, playing a critical role in innate host defense and disease resistance (1Yang D. Biragyn A. Hoover D.M. Lubkowski J. Oppenheim J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 181-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 2Brogden K.A. Ackermann M. McCray Jr., P.B. Tack B.F. Int. J.

Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 407-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two major families of antimicrobial peptides exist in mammals, namely defensins and cathelicidins. Whereas defensins are characterized by the presence of six cysteines at well defined positions (5Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar, 6Lehrer R.I. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), all cathelicidins share a highly conserved “cathelin” pro-sequence at the N terminus, followed by diversified, cationic mature sequences at the C terminus (7Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Skerlavaj B. Tomasinsig L. Circo R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Zaiou M. Gallo R.L. J. Mol.

Cathelicidins are most abundantly present in the granules of phagocytic cells and also to a lesser extent in many other cell types such as mucosal epithelial cells and skin keratinocytes (7Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Skerlavaj B. Tomasinsig L. Circo R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Zaiou M. Gallo R.L. J. Mol.

Upon activation, most cathelicidin precursors are proteolytically cleaved to release the cathelin domain and the C-terminal mature peptides with antimicrobial activities, although the unprocessed or differentially processed forms are often found in the biological fluids where cathelicidins are expressed (8Zaiou M. Gallo R.L. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 9Zanetti M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The physiological role of the cathelin domain or uncleaved precursors remains elusive but is more likely to be involved in immune modulation other than just bacterial killing (10Zarember K.A. Katz S.S. Tack B.F. Doukhan L. Weiss J. Elsbach P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Zaiou M. Nizet V. Gallo R.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 810-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition to their ability to directly kill a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses, mature cathelicidins are actively involved in various phases of host defense. Certain cathelicidins are found to chemoattract and activate a variety of immune cells, inhibit NADPH oxidase, kill activated lymphocytes, and promote angiogenesis and wound healing (1Yang D. Biragyn A. Hoover D.M. Lubkowski J. Oppenheim J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 181-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 8Zaiou M. Gallo R.L. J. Mol.

Consistent with their critical role in host defense and disease resistance, aberrant expression of cathelicidins is often associated with various disease processes. For example, LL-37/hCAP-18 deficiency correlates with recurrent skin infections in the atopic dermatitis patients (12Ong P.Y. Ohtake T. Brandt C. Strickland I. Boguniewicz M. Ganz T. Gallo R.L. Leung D.Y. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar) and chronic periodontal disease in morbus Kostmann patients (13Putsep K. Carlsson G. Boman H.G. Andersson M. Lancet. 2002; 360: 1144-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of the cathelicidin gene (CRAMP) in mice resulted in a loss of protection against skin infection by Group A Streptococcus (14Nizet V. Ohtake T. Lauth X. Trowbridge J. Rudisill J. Dorschner R.A. Pestonjamasp V. Piraino J. Huttner K. Gallo R.L.

Kagnoff M.F. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4901-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Conversely, local or systemic administration of cathelicidins conferred enhanced protection against experimental infections (16Carretero M. Del Rio M. Garcia M. Escamez M.J. Mirones I. Rivas L.

Immun. 1999; 67: 6084-6089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A common mechanism by which cathelicidins kill bacteria appears to be mediated through physical interactions with negatively charged microbial membrane phospholipids, followed by membrane disruption (3Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6798) Google Scholar, 21Shai Y. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Many cathelicidins exhibit LPS 2The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NGP, neutrophilic granule protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; WGS, whole-genome shotgun sequence; CFU, colony forming units; MIC90, minimum inhibitory concentration of an antimicrobial that reduces bacterial growth by 90%; EC50, 50% effective concentration; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; contig, group of overlapping clones; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum. binding activity, and the binding affinity is often positively correlated with their antibacterial activity (7Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Skerlavaj B. Tomasinsig L. Circo R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because of this physical mechanism, these peptide antibiotics are equally effective in killing both drug-resistant and susceptible strains with little possibility of developing resistance (3Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6798) Google Scholar, 7Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Skerlavaj B. Tomasinsig L. Circo R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One side effect commonly associated with cathelicidins is their cytotoxicity to mammalian cells; however, the concentrations that are required to exert an appreciable degree of cytolytic effect are often much higher than the microbicidal concentrations (7Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Skerlavaj B. Tomasinsig L. Circo R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To date, cathelicidins have been discovered in a range of mammalian species (8Zaiou M. Gallo R.L. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 9Zanetti M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). In contrast to the vast majority of “classic” cathelicidins, P15 in rabbits (22Levy O. Weiss J. Zarember K. Ooi C.E. Elsbach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neutrophilic granule protein (NGP) in mice (23Moscinski L.C. Hill B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) are distantly related to classic cathelicidins with less homology in the cathelin domain. Hagfish was also found recently to contain two cathelicidin-like sequences (24Uzzell T. Stolzenberg E.D. Shinnar A.E. Zasloff M. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1655-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the evolutionary relationship of these cathelicidins remains uncertain. Following our genome-wide computational screening and molecular cloning, here we report identification and functional analysis of the complete repertoire of the cathelicidin gene family in the chicken. Discovery of these nonmammalian cathelicidins helped reveal for the first time the origin and evolution of mammalian cathelicidins. Our data clearly suggested that fowlicidins and mammalian NGPs are likely to originate from a common ancestral gene prior to the separation of birds from mammals and that other classic mammalian cathelicidins may have been duplicated from the NGP gene after the split of mammals and birds. Moreover, a series of functional analyses indicated that these chicken cathelicidins are among the most efficacious cathelicidins that have been identified to date with potent antibacterial and LPS-neutralizing activities, making them attractive candidates as novel antimicrobial and anti-sepsis agents. Computational Search for Novel Chicken Cathelicidins—To identify potential novel cathelicidins in the chicken, all known cathelicidin peptide sequences discovered in the hagfish and mammals were individually queried against the translated chicken expressed sequence tags (EST), nonredundant sequences, unfinished high throughput genomic sequences, and whole genome shotgun sequences (WGS) in GenBank™ by using the TBLASTN program (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) as we described (26Xiao Y. Hughes A.L. Ando J. Matsuda Y. Cheng J.F. Skinner-Noble D. Zhang G. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 56Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 27Patil A. Hughes A.L. Zhang G. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Patil A.A. Cai Y. Sang Y. Blecha F. Zhang G. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 23: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). All potential hits were then examined for the presence of the characteristic cathelin domain, including the highly conserved four cysteines. If necessary, the genomic sequences containing chicken cathelicidin genes were retrieved from GenBank™ to predict the exon sequence and genomic structure by using GenomeScan (29Yeh R.F. Lim L.P. Burge C.B. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Cloning of the Chicken Fowlicidin Genes—Because no complete genomic sequence is available in GenBank™ for any of the three fowlicidin genes, the missing sequence of each gene was cloned separately from chicken genomic DNA that was isolated from liver using a genomic DNA isolation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). The first exon/intron sequence of the fowlicidin-2 gene that is missing in the WGS sequence (AADN01005055) was cloned by using a genome walking approach, namely vectorette PCR, as previously described (30Munroe D.J. Haas M. Bric E. Whitton T. Aburatani H. Hunter K. Ward D. Housman D.E. Genomics. 1994; 19: 506-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Riley J. Butler R. Ogilvie D. Finniear R. Jenner D. Powell S. Anand R. Smith J.C. Markham A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2887-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Briefly, chicken genomic DNA was digested separately with the blunt end restriction enzymes (DraI, EcoRV, PuvI, RsaI, and StuI), followed by ligation with annealed, bubble oligonucleotides (5′-CAAGGGAGGACGCTGTCTGTCGAAGGTAAGGAACGGACGAGAGAAGGGAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCTCCCTTCTCGAATCGTAACCGTTCGTACGAGAATCGCTGTCCTCTCCTTG-3′). Subsequent PCR was performed by using the forward primer indicated in the underlined region of the bubble oligonucleotide and a gene-specific reverse primer. Nested PCR was further performed with the same forward primer and a second gene-specific reverse primer. Two rounds of vectorette PCR were performed to obtain a total of 1.8 kb upstream sequence of the fowlicidin-2 gene. Because only partial sequence of the last exon of the fowlicidin-1 gene is present in AADN01081708, the entire fowlicidin-1 gene sequence was directly cloned from genomic DNA by PCR using the primers (forward: 5′-GTTTCCGCATTGCCCAACTTCAG-3′; reverse: 5′-GGAACAGTGCTAACAGTGGCTC-3′) that are located in the first and last exons flanking the open reading frame, according to the EST sequence. The missing first intron sequence of the fowlicidin-3 gene (i.e. the gap between AADN01005055 and AADN01005056) was cloned from chicken genomic DNA by PCR using primers (forward: 5′-GCTGTGGACTCCTACAACCAAC-3′; reverse: 5′-TTGAGGTTGTGCAGGGAGCTGA-3′) located in two flanking exons. All PCR products were recovered from agarose gel, ligated into pGEM T-Easy Vector (Promega), and sequenced from both directions. Assembly of the Chicken Cathelicidin Gene Cluster—To confirm the orientation of three fowlicidin genes on the chromosome, additional PCRs were performed to clone the intergenic sequences with chicken genomic DNA and combinations of gene-specific primers located in the first and last exons of each fowlicidin gene. The DNA sequence between fowlicidin-1 and fowlicidin-2 was obtained by using the primers (forward: 5′-CGCTGGTCATCAGGACTGTGAT-3′; reverse: 5′-CCATCGTGTCTCCATTCTATC-3′), whereas the sequence between fowlicidin-2 and fowlicidin-3 was obtained by using the primers (forward: 5′-CACCGTGTTGATGGCCACTGG-3′; reverse: 5′-TGAGGCCACCGAGTGTCACCT-3′). PCR products were subsequently cloned into pGEM T-Easy Vector and sequenced from both directions. No other primer combinations yielded any PCR products. To generate a continuous, gap-free cathelicidin gene cluster, three WGS sequences containing fowlicidin genes (AADN01005055, AADN01005056, and AADN01081708) were retrieved from GenBank™ and annotated together with our newly cloned intra- and intergenic sequences. Structures of fowlicidin genes were determined by comparing their cDNA sequences with the genomic contig that we assembled. Chromosomal location of the chicken cathelicidin gene cluster was revealed by using the Map Viewer Program (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/) in the most current chicken genome assembly (Build 1.1) released on July 1, 2004. Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis of Chicken Cathelicidins—Multiple sequence alignment was constructed by using the ClustalW program (version 1.82) (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method (33Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) by calculating the proportion of amino acid differences (p-distance) among all known cathelicidin precursors with and without the last exon sequence. The reliability of each branch was tested by 1000 bootstrap replications. Peptide Synthesis—Given that valine is the preferred cleavage site for elastase in the processing and maturation of bovine and porcine cathelicidins (34Scocchi M. Skerlavaj B. Romeo D. Gennaro R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 35Panyutich A. Shi J. Boutz P.L. Zhao C. Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 978-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that the first valine in the fourth exon of fowlicidin-1 and -2 (Fig. 1) is likely to be cleaved by chicken elastase. Therefore, putative mature fowlicidin-1 (RVKRVWPLVIRTVIAGYNLYRAIKKK) and fowlicidin-2 (LVQRGRFGRFLRKIRRFRPKVTITIQGSARF) were chemically synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA), and a sheep cathelicidin, SMAP-29 (RGLRRLGRKIAHGVKKYGPTVLRIIRIA-NH2), was synthesized by Bio-Synthesis (Lewisville, TX) by the standard solid-phase synthesis method. All peptides were purified to >95% purity through reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The mass and purity of each peptide was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the Voyager DE-PRO instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) housed in the Recombinant DNA/Protein Core Facility of Oklahoma State University. The molecular masses of three peptides are as follows: fowlicidin-1 (calculated: 3141.9; observed: 3141.6), fowlicidin-2 (calculated: 3760.6; observed: 3760.1), and SMAP-29 (calculated: 3199.0; observed: 3198.7). Bacterial Culture—Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 700728, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) were purchased from either ATCC (Manassas, VA) or MicroBiologics (St. Cloud, MN) and tested individually against fowlicidins and SMAP-29. Three multidrug-resistant bacterial strains (S. typhimurium DT104 ATCC 700408, S. aureus ATCC BAA-39, and S. aureus ATCC 43300) were also purchased from ATCC and used in the antibacterial testing. All bacteria were maintained on trypticase soy agar plates. Fresh colonies were cultured and subcultured in trypticase soy broth with shaking at 250 rpm at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. Antibacterial Assays—Standard colony counting assay was used to determine the antibacterial activity of fowlicidins, as previously described (36Shi J. Zhang G. Wu H. Ross C. Blecha F. Ganz T. Infect.

Briefly, overnight cultures of bacteria were subcultured for an additional 3-5 h at 37 °C in trypticase soy broth to the midlogarithmic phase, washed once with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and suspended to 4 × 105 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml in the same buffer. Bacteria (90 μl) were dispensed into 96-well microtiter plates, followed by the addition of 10 μl of serial 2-fold dilutions of peptides in duplicate. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, surviving bacteria were counted (CFU/ml) after serial plating onto trypticase soy agar plates and overnight incubation. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) of individual peptides against each bacterial strain was determined as the lowest concentration that reduced bacterial growth by 90%. For the kinetics of bacterial killing, fowlicidin-1 (0.1 μm), fowlicidin-2 (0.16 μm), and SMAP-29 (0.1 μm)atMIC90 concentrations were incubated separately with E. coli ATCC 25922 at 37 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold PBS at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 min and plated immediately for counting viable bacteria. To study the effect of salinity on the antimicrobial activity, fowlicidin-1 (0.1 μm) and fowlicidin-2 (0.16 μm) were incubated separately with E. coli ATCC 25922 for 2 h with different concentration of NaCl (0, 25, 50, 100, and 150 mm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Surviving bacteria were counted, following overnight incubation on trypticase soy agar plates. To examine the antibacterial spectrum of each peptide, a modified broth microdilution assay was used essentially as described (37Turner J. Cho Y. Dinh N.N. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were subcultured to the midlog phase, washed with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, and suspended to 5 × 105 CFU/ml in 1% cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (BBL, Cockeysville, MD) with and without 100 mm of NaCl. Bacteria (90 μl) were then dispensed into 96-well plates, followed by the addition in duplicate of 10 μl of serially diluted peptides in 0.01% acetic acid. Because of poor growth of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 in 1% Mueller Hinton broth, this strain was grown in 10% cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth with peptides in the presence and absence of 100 mm NaCl. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the MIC value of each peptide will be determined as the lowest concentration that gave no visible bacterial growth. Hemolysis Assay—The hemolytic activities of fowlicidins were determined essentially as described (38Shin S.Y. Park E.J. Yang S.T. Jung H.J. Eom S.H. Song W.K. Kim Y. Hahm K.S. Kim J.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Yu K. Park K. Kang S.W. Shin S.Y. Hahm K.S. Kim Y. J. Pept. Res. 2002; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh human and chicken blood were collected, washed twice with PBS, and diluted to 0.5% in PBS with and without the addition of 10% FBS, followed by dispensing 90 μl into 96-well plates. Different concentrations of peptides (10 μl) dissolved in 0.01% acetic acid were added in duplicate to cells and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Following centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were transferred to new 96-well plates and monitored by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm for released hemoglobin. Controls for 0 and 100% hemolysis consisted of cells suspended in PBS only and in 1% Triton X-100, respectively. The percentage of hemolysis was calculated as ((A405 nm, peptide - A405 nm, PBS)/(A405 nm, 1% Triton X-100 - A405 nm, PBS)) × 100. The effective concentration (EC50) was defined as the peptide concentration that caused 50% lysis of erythrocytes. Cytotoxicity Assay—The cytotoxic effect of fowlicidins on mammalian cells was measured by using the alamarBlue dye (BIOSOURCE), which has been shown to be equivalent to the classic 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-based assay (40Nociari M.M. Shalev A. Benias P. Russo C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 213: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. MDCK cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 1.5 × 105/well. Following overnight growth, the cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, followed by the addition of 90 μl of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 10% FBS, together with 10 μl of serially diluted peptides in 0.01% acetic acid in duplicate. After incubation for 18 h, 10 μl of alamarBlue dye was added to cells for 6 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The fluorescence of dye was read with excitation at 545 nm and emission at 590 nm. The percentage of cell death was calculated as (1 - (Fpeptide - Fbackground)/(Facetic acid - Fbackground)) × 100, where Fpeptide is the fluorescence of cells exposed to different concentrations of peptides, Facetic acid is the fluorescence of cells exposed to 0.01% acetic acid only, Fbackground is the background fluorescence of 10% alamarBlue dye in cell culture medium without cells. Cytotoxicity (EC50) of individual peptides was defined as the peptide concentration that caused 50% cell death. LPS Binding Assay—The binding of LPS to fowlicidins was measured by the kinetic chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Kinetic-QCL 1000 kit; BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) as previously described (37Turner J. Cho Y. Dinh N.N. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Tack B.F. Sawai M.V. Kearney W.R. Robertson A.D. Sherman M.A. Wang W.

Briefly, 25 μl of serially diluted peptide were added in duplicate into 25 μl of E. coli O111:B4 LPS containing 0.5 endotoxin units/ml and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 50 μl of the amebocyte lysate reagent for 10 min. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 10 and 16 min after the addition of 100 μl of chromogenic substrate, Ac-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-p-nitroanilide. Percentage LPS binding was calculated as ((ΔD1-ΔD2 +ΔD3)/ΔD1) × 100, where ΔD1 represents the difference in the absorbance between 10 and 16 min for the sample containing LPS only, ΔD2 represents the difference in the absorbance between 10 and 16 min for the samples containing LPS and different concentrations of peptides, and ΔD3 represents the difference in the absorbance between 10 and 16 min for the samples containing different concentrations of peptides with no LPS. The Hill plot was graphed as described (37Turner J. Cho Y. Dinh N.N. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Tack B.F. Sawai M.V.

Modulation of LPS-induced Proinflammatory Gene Expression by Fowlicidins—Mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were plated in 12-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and allowed to grow overnight. The cells were pretreated for 30 min with 1, 5, and 20 μm of fowlicidin-1, fowlicidin-2, and SMAP-29 in duplicate, followed by stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS from E. coli O114:B4 (Sigma) for 4 h. The supernatant was removed and total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand cDNA from 1.5 μg of each RNA sample was synthesized at 42 °C for 30 min by using QuantiTect® reverse transcription kit (Qiagen), which includes removal of genomic DNA contamination prior to cDNA synthesis. The first-strand cDNA of each sample was then used as a template for subsequent real time PCR amplification by using the QuantiTect® SYBR Green qRT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and MyiQ® real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Three common proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (namely interleukin-1β, CC chemokine ligand 2/MCP-1, and CCL3/MIP-1α) were selected. All primers were designed"

Disruption of PhoP-PhoR in Mycobacterium tuberculosis dramatically attenuates virulence, implying that this system directly and/or indirectly coordinates the expression of important virulence factors whose identity remains to be established. Interestingly, in knockingout the PhoP-PhoR two-component system in M. tuberculosis Mt103, dramatic changes in the colonial morphology, cording properties, and reactivity of the mutant strain to the basic dye neutral red, all intrinsic properties of tubercle bacilli known to correlate with virulence, were noted. Because deficiencies in the ability of the mutant to form serpentine cords and stain with the dye are likely the results of alterations of its cell envelope composition, we undertook to analyze the lipid content of phoP and phoP-phoR mutants constructed in two different strains of M. tuberculosis. Our results indicate that PhoP coordinately and positively regulates the synthesis of methyl-branched fatty acid-containing acyltrehaloses known to be restricted to pathogenic species of the M. tuberculosis complex, namely diacyltrehaloses, polyacyltrehaloses, and sulfolipids. Evidence is also provided that PhoP but not PhoR is required for the production of these lipids. This work represents an important step toward the functional characterization of PhoP-PhoR and the understanding of complex lipid synthesis in M. tuberculosis.

This work represents an important step toward the functional characterization of PhoP-PhoR and the understanding of complex lipid synthesis in M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis in humans, is one of the leading causes of mortality due to a single infectious agent (1World Health Organization (2004) http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/print.htmlGoogle Scholar). In the tubercle bacillus as in other prokaryotes, two-component signal transduction systems are important elements of the adaptative response to a variety of stimuli (2Fontan P.A. Walters S. Smith I. Curr. Sci. 2004; 86: 122-134Google Scholar). So far, of the 11 paired two-component systems, 5 unpaired response regulators and 2 unpaired protein sensors that M. tuberculosis possesses, the two-component system PhoP-PhoR is the one whose disruption was shown to affect the most dramatically the ability of M. tuberculosis to replicate in cellular and animal models (3Pérez E. Samper S. Bordat Y. Guilhot C. Gicquel B. Martín C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PhoP shows high similarity to the PhoP response regulator of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, which senses Mg2+ starvation and controls the expression of at least 40 genes, among which some encoding important virulence determinants (4Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Further supporting the concept that PhoP is important for virulence and transmissibility of tubercle bacilli, a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium bovis (strain B) responsible for large tuberculosis outbreaks in Spain was found to carry an IS6110 insertion in the promoter region of phoP causing a strong up-regulation of the expression of this gene (5Soto C.Y. Menéndez M.C. Pérez E. Samper S. Gomez A.B. Garcia M.J. Martín C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2004; 42: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To date, the stimuli sensed by the sensor histidine kinase PhoR and the genes controlled by the DNA-binding response regulator PhoP are not known. The identification of the environmental signals regulating PhoP-PhoR and the characterization of the PhoP regulon would provide important information about the stresses encountered by the tubercle bacillus in vivo and allow the discovery of novel virulence factors. In constructing a phoP mutant of M. tuberculosis (clinical isolate Mt103), it was noted that the mutant was smaller in size and different from the wild-type strain in its cording properties (3Pérez E. Samper S. Bordat Y. Guilhot C. Gicquel B. Martín C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Given the relationship that exists between cording properties and virulence on the one hand (6Middlebrook G. Dubos R.J. Pierce C. J. Exp. Med. 1947; 86: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and between the cording of tubercle bacilli and their lipid composition on the other hand (7Middlebrook G. Coleman C.M.

Bacterial Strains and Culture Media—Escherichia coli XL1-blue was maintained in Luria Bertani (LB) broth (pH 7.5) (BD Biosciences). M. tuberculosis 1237 (a clinical isolate belonging to the W Beijing family) and Mt103 (10Jackson M. Raynaud C. Lanéelle M.-A. Guilhot C. Laurent-Winter C. Ensergueix D. Gicquel B. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium supplemented with ADC (0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.085% NaCl, 0.0003% beef catalase) (Difco) and 0.05% Tween 80 or on solid Middlebrook 7H10 medium supplemented with OADC (0.005% oleic acid, 0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, NaCl, 0.085% 0.0003% beef catalase) (Difco). The antibiotics, kanamycin (25μg ml –1) and hygromycin (50 μg ml–1) were added when appropriate. Construction of phoP and phoP-phoR Mutants of M. tuberculosis Mt103 and M. tuberculosis 1237—The plasmids used to disrupt phoP or both the phoP and phoR genes in M. tuberculosis were constructed as follows. For the disruption of phoP and phoR, a 3,804-bp DNA fragment carrying both genes was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and primers PhoPF (5′-aatctagatcaagcatcagcc-3′) and PhoRR (5′-aatctagacgagtttgacggc-3′). A 774-bp EcoRV-BspEI restriction fragment encompassing part of the phoP and phoR coding sequences was released from this PCR product and replaced with an hygromycin resistance cassette from Streptomyces hygroscopicus. The disrupted allele phoPR::hyg was then introduced into a nonreplicative plasmid harboring the counter-selectable marker sacB and the colored marker xylE (11Jackson M. Camacho L.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Parish T. Stocker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. 54. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 59-75Google Scholar). For the disruption of the only phoP gene, a 2,057-bp DNA fragment carrying the entire phoP was PCR-amplified using Pfu polymerase and primers PhoPF (described above) and PhoPR (5′-aatctagacccgaacgtagaa-3′). An EcoRV-BclI restriction fragment internal to the phoP gene was cut out and replaced by an hygromycin resistance cassette, and the disrupted allele phoP::hyg was then introduced into the suicide vector described above. Mutants were obtained following a two-step homologous recombination strategy as described (11Jackson M. Camacho L.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Parish T. Stocker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. 54. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 59-75Google Scholar). Complementation of the phoP and phoP-phoR Mutants—The kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) was cloned into the PstI restriction site of pSO5 (a mycobacterial replicative plasmid carrying the entire coding sequence of phoP and 1 kb of its promoter region) (3Pérez E. Samper S. Bordat Y. Guilhot C. Gicquel B. Martín C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) to yield pSO5K, the vector used to complement 1237ΔphoPR::hyg. A 3.8-kb DNA fragment carrying the phoP-phoR genes from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was PCR-amplified using the couple of primers phoPFtb (5′-aatctagatcaagcatcagccgaggtac-3′) and phoRRtb (5′-aatctagacgagtttgacggcggcttta-3′), cut with XbaI, and cloned into the unique XbaI site of pNBV1 (12Howard N.S. Gomez J.E. Ko C. Bishai W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to yield pJUZ1. The kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K was then cloned into the PstI restriction site of pJUZ1 to yield pJUZ1K, the vector used to complement 1237ΔphoPR::hyg. Preparation and Analysis of Lipids and Fatty Acids—Radiolabeling of whole M. tuberculosis cells with [1,2-14C]acetic acid (specific activity, 113 Ci mol–1, MP Biomedicals Inc.) and [1-14C]propionate (specific activity, 56.7 Ci mol–1, MP Biomedicals Inc.), preparation of mycolic acids and extraction of total cellular and exocellular lipids from cold or radiolabeled bacterial cultures were performed as described (13Rousseau C.

Lipids and fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by TLC on silica gel 60-precoated plates F254 (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in various solvent systems (see the legend to Fig. 2). Radiolabeled lipids and fatty acids were visualized by exposure of TLC to Kodak BioMax MR films at –70 °C.

Morphological and Cytochemical Traits of phoP and phoP-phoR Deletion Mutants of M. tuberculosis—Dramatic changes in the morphological characteristics of a phoP allelic exchange mutant of M. tuberculosis Mt103 have been reported (3Pérez E. Samper S. Bordat Y. Guilhot C. Gicquel B. Martín C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) with Mt103phoP::km bacilli aligning along their long axes in parallel arrays instead of forming the typical braided bundles (or cords) of wild-type Mt103 and pathogenic M. tuberculosis strains in general (6Middlebrook G. Dubos R.J. Pierce C. J. Exp. Med. 1947; 86: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because differences in cording properties are likely the result of changes in cell surface composition (7Middlebrook G. Coleman C.M. Schaefer W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2004; 431: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), we first sought to disrupt the PhoP-PhoR two-component system in another clinical isolate of M. tuberculosis harboring a slightly different cell envelope composition than Mt103. Isogenic mutants of 1237 (a clinical isolate belonging to the W-Beijing family), in which the phoP or both phoP and phoR genes were disrupted by deletion of an internal fragment and insertion of an hygromycin resistance cassette, were constructed by homologous recombination. Following the same strategy, a phoP-phoR and a novel phoP mutant of Mt103 were also constructed to ensure that these mutants carried exactly the same mutations as their 1237 counterparts. Recombination at the phoP or phoP-phoR loci was confirmed in each mutant by Southern hybridization (data not shown). As reported earlier for Mt103phoP::km (3Pérez E. Samper S. Bordat Y. Guilhot C. Gicquel B. Martín C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), all of the newly constructed phoP and phoP-phoR mutants formed smaller colonies than their wild-type parental strains on 7H10 Middlebrook agar plates (data not shown). Auramine staining of cultures grown to late stationary phase in liquid broth devoid of Tween 80 also revealed that all of the mutants exhibited the same cording defect (3Pérez E. Samper S. Bordat Y. Guilhot C. Gicquel B. Martín C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Finally, staining of the phoP and phoP-phoR mutants with neutral red, a classical cytochemical test used to differentiate virulent from attenuated or avirulent isolates of M. tuberculosis (18Dubos R.J. Middlebrook G. Amer. Rev. Tuberc. 1948; 58: 698-699PubMed Google Scholar), also revealed that all of the mutant strains had lost the ability to fix the dye (Fig. 1). As observed in M. tuberculosis Mt103 earlier (3Pérez E. Samper S. Bordat Y. Guilhot C. Gicquel B. Martín C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), disruption of phoP-phoR in M. tuberculosis Beijing 1237 dramatically impaired the ability of this strain to grow inside human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages. While the number of intracellular wild-type colony forming units increased ∼52-fold after 7 days of infection, the number of mutant colony forming units increased only about 10-fold during the same period (data not shown). Normal intracellular growth was restored in the mutant upon complementation with wild-type copies of the phoP and phoR genes carried by pJUZ1K (data not shown). phoP and phoP-PhoR Mutants of M. tuberculosis Are Deficient in the Production of Multiple Methyl-branched Fatty Acid-containing Acyltrehaloses—We next undertook to compare the cell envelope composition of the phoP and phoP-phoR mutants to that of their wild-type parental strains. Lipid extracts from bacterial cells and culture filtrates were examined by TLC following metabolic labeling of all classes of lipids with [1,2-14C]acetate and that of methyl-branched fatty acids with [1-14C]propionate. In all cases, mutants were found to contain the same amounts of extractable lipids as their wild-type parents. Analyses of [1-14C]propionate-derived lipids from bacterial cells revealed that all of the mutants clearly lacked two families of methyl-branched fatty acid-containing acyltrehaloses, namely 2,3-di-O-acyltrehaloses (DAT) (19Lemassu A.

Saunders Co., Philadelphia1979: 63-193Google Scholar, 23Goren M.B. Kates M. Handbook of Lipid Research. Glycolipids, Phosphoglycolipids and Sulfoglycolipids. 6. Plenum Press, New York1990: 363-461Google Scholar) was abolished in 1237ΔphoP::hyg and 1237ΔphoPR::hyg (Figs. 2A and 3). M. tuberculosis Mt103 being naturally devoid of this latter family of acyltrehaloses, this phenotype was only visible in the 1237 background. All of the lipids found to be absent from the mutant cells were also absent from their culture filtrates indicating that their absence from bacterial cells was not the result of secretion into the culture medium (data not shown). Analyses of labeled lipids in a variety of solvent systems revealed no other qualitative or quantitative differences between the wild-type and the mutant strains. Likewise, a combination of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and TLC analyses revealed that all of the M. tuberculosis mutants produced the same types and amounts of mycolates as their parent strains (data not shown). Finally, gas chromatography (GC) analysis of short chain (up to C26) fatty acid methyl esters from total lipids showed that the mutants generate all of the classes of fatty acids produced by the wild-type strains (data not shown). Since the non-mycoloylated trehalose esters, DAT, PAT, and SL, mainly contain methyl-branched fatty acids such as mycolipenic acids, mycosanoic acids, and (hydroxy)phthioceranic acids (Fig. 3), further analyses were performed comparing wild-type and mutant strains for the presence of these fatty acids. To this aim, fatty acid methyl esters and acetylated fatty acid methyl esters were prepared from the non-radiolabeled and [1-14C]propionate-derived lipids of each of the strains described in this study and analyzed by GC and TLC, respectively. Although the autoradiograms of the TLC plates showed bands of significantly lower intensity in the mutants as compared with the wild-type strains, it was not possible to accurately compare the long-chain methyl-branched fatty acid composition of the different strains due to the co-migration of the fatty acids of interest with other [1-14C]propionate-derived compounds (mycocerosic acids in particular) (data not shown). Unfortunately, the low quantities of SL, DAT, and PAT produced by the M. tuberculosis isolates 1237 and Mt103 also hampered the detection of the long-chain methyl-branched fatty acids esterifying these lipids by GC. Interestingly, both the complementation of 1237ΔphoPR::hyg with the phoP and phoR genes carried by the multicopy vector pJUZ1K and with the phoP gene alone carried by pSO5K restored SL, PAT, and DAT production (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that phoP but not phoR is required for the production of methyl-branched fatty acid-containing acyltrehaloses in M. tuberculosis. Moreover, the amounts of SL produced by 1237 (but not those of DAT and PAT) appeared to be directly correlated to the level of expression of phoP as overexpression of this gene in 1237 from the multicopy plasmid pSO5K resulted in a significant increase in the amounts of 14C incorporated into SL (Fig. 2A). Paralleling the recovery of acyltrehaloses synthesis, the ability of the complemented 1237 mutants to fix neutral red was restored (Fig. 1). A previous study had reported that disruption of phoP slightly increased the ratio of monoacylated to triacylated lipoarabinomannan in M. tuberculosis Mt103, already pointing to the existence of a relationship between PhoP and lipid metabolism (24Ludwiczak P. Gilleron M. Bordat Y. Martín C. Gicquel B. Puzo G. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we provided evidence that phoP is required for the synthesis of complex acyltrehaloses restricted to pathogenic species of the M. tuberculosis complex, namely DAT, PAT, and SL. Moreover, there seems to be a direct correlation between the level of expression of phoP and the amounts of some of these lipids as overexpression of phoP from a multicopy plasmid in strain 1237 resulted in a significant increase in the amounts of SL synthesized. These results suggest that the two-component regulator PhoP-PhoR up-regulates the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of SL, DAT, and PAT. Considering that the synthesis of trehalose mono- and dimycolates is unaffected in the mutants (Fig. 2C), it seems unlikely that PhoP-PhoR exerts its control at the level of trehalose synthesis. It is more likely that it regulates the expression of the acyltransferase, polyketide synthase (pks) or pks-associated genes involved in the synthesis or transfer of the methyl-branched fatty acyl substituents found in SL, DAT, and PAT. Interestingly, the histidine kinase encoded by phoR does not seem to be required for the synthesis of these lipids as complementation of 1237ΔphoPR::hyg with the phoP gene alone was sufficient to restore their synthesis. As already described in other two-component systems, phosphorylation might not be an absolute requirement for the binding of PhoP to its DNA targets and might only serve to increase the affinity of the response regulator for certain promoters (25Himpens S. Locht C. Supply P. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Alternatively, as is the case in Salmonella, it is possible that instead of phosphorylating PhoP, PhoR catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phospho-PhoP, thereby abolishing the transcription of PhoP-activated genes (4Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In that case, the lack of PhoR expression in 1237ΔphoP-phoR::hyg complemented with phoP would not abolish the production of acyltrehaloses. The abolition of the synthesis of PAT, DAT, and SL probably accounts, at least in part, for the decreased ability of the phoP mutants to form cords and to fix neutral red, morphological and cytochemical traits, which have been associated with virulence attenuation of tubercle bacilli since Dubos and Middle-brook's seed studies in the 1940s. Indeed, trehalose esters are located at or near the surface of M. tuberculosis where their fatty acid chains have been proposed to interact with the mycolic acids of the cell wall core to provide a mycobacterial”outer membrane“system, while their sugar moiety interacts with the hydrophilic capsule (26Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of Mycobacteria. 1. Academic Press, London1982: 95-184Google Scholar). In good agreement with this model, we have found that the absence of some forms of DAT and PAT in a pks3-4 mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv resulted in defects in capsule attachment causing the mutant to expose a more hydrophobic surface and, consequently, to aggregate in liquid broth (27Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and to interact differently with phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells (13Rousseau C.

More recently, in a search for the molecular determinants underlying the different cording properties of the M. tuberculosis H37Ra and H37Rv strains using the microarray technology, Gao et al. (28Gao Q. Kripke K. Arinc Z. Voskuil M. Small P. Tuberculosis. 2004; 84: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) identified two polyketide synthase-associated genes, fadD21 and papA1, among the 22 genes whose expression was consistently higher in the cord-forming strain H37Rv. The pks3-4-associated gene fadD21 is expected to encode a fatty acid-activating enzyme involved in DAT and PAT synthesis (27Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), while papA1, which is associated to pks2, is likely to encode an acyltransferase required for SL formation (29Sirakova T.D.

As the cording strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv is proficient in the synthesis of SL and mycolipenate-containing DAT and PAT, while the noncording M. tuberculosis H37Ra and phoP mutants are not (7Middlebrook G.

If the association between cording and virulence has been well established (6Middlebrook G. Dubos R.J. Pierce C. J. Exp. Med. 1947; 86: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it is at present not as clear to what extent the lack of SL, DAT, and PAT accounts for the virulence attenuation and, perhaps, reduced transmissibility (5Soto C.Y.

The fact that, within the Mycobacterium genus, SL, PAT, and DAT are relatively restricted to the virulent strains of the M. tuberculosis complex (15Cason J. Freeman Allen C. DeAcetis W. Fonken G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 220: 893-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Daffé M. Lacave C. Lanéelle M.-A. Gillois M. Lanéelle G. Eur. J.

Plenum Press, New York1990: 363-461Google Scholar) strongly suggests that this family of lipids serves important functions in the pathogenicity of tubercle bacilli, an assumption further supported by multiple in vitro and in vivo studies (for a review, see Refs. 13Rousseau C.

Somewhat tempering the above assumption, our recent work has indicated that M. tuberculosis isogenic mutants specifically impaired in their ability to synthesize SL or PAT and DAT did not display any marked reduction of virulence in cellular and animal models (13Rousseau C. Neyrolles O. Bordat Y. Giroux S. Sirakova T.D. Prevost M.-C. Kolattukudy P.E. Gicquel B. Jackson M. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Rousseau C.

Nevertheless, as the mutants analyzed in both studies retained the ability to synthesize some methyl-branched fatty acid-containing acyltrehaloses, one could not exclude that the remaining families of acyltrehaloses in the mutant compensated for the missing types. The fact that the production of all of these molecules is coordinately regulated by PhoP actually tends to suggest that they act synergistically. Therefore, the effects of these lipids in virulence might only be clearly visible when the synthesis of all of them is abolished simultaneously. It is noteworthy that this is not the first report of a two-component system regulating the synthesis of polyketides or polyketide-derived products in prokaryotes. In Streptomyces lividans and Streptomyces coelicolor, it was shown that phosphate control of antibiotic biosynthesis is mediated by the two-component PhoP-PhoR system (35Sola-Landa A. Moura R.S. Martin J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6133-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 36Martin J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5197-5201Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It is interesting that actinomycetes have adopted similar strategies to regulate the production of polyketide-derived products, despite the structural and functional diversity of these molecules. Although much work remains to be done in identifying the PhoP regulon and understanding the virulence attenuation of phoP mutants, this work represents an important step toward the functional characterization of PhoP and the understanding of complex lipid synthesis in M. tuberculosis. Identifying the specific signals sensed by the histidine kinase PhoR, whether Mg2+ as in Salmonella (4Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), phosphate as in Streptomyces (36Martin J.F. J.

Several approaches, including promoter fishing and proteomics, have been undertaken by our laboratories to complete our understanding of this important two-component regulator."
https://openalex.org/W2086764112,"Animal cloning by nuclear-transfer experiments frequently fails due to the inability of transplanted nuclei to support normal embryonic development. We show here that the formation of mitotic chromosomes in the egg context is crucial for adapting differentiated nuclei for early development. Differentiated erythrocyte nuclei replicate inefficiently in Xenopus eggs but do so as rapidly as sperm nuclei if a prior single mitosis is permitted. This mitotic remodeling involves a topoisomerase II-dependent shortening of chromatin loop domains and an increased recruitment of replication initiation factors onto chromatin, leading to a short interorigin spacing characteristic of early developmental stages. It also occurs within each early embryonic cell cycle and dominantly regulates initiation of DNA replication for the subsequent S phase. These results indicate that mitotic conditioning is crucial to reset the chromatin structure of differentiated adult donor cells for embryonic DNA replication and suggest that it is an important step in nuclear cloning."

The iswi mutant germline stem cells are lost rapidly because of defects in responding to bone morphogenetic protein niche signals and in repressing differentiation, whereas the dom mutant somatic stem cells are lost because of defective self-renewal.

https://openalex.org/W2025128415,"Meiosis resembles mitosis but employs a unique ""reductional"" nuclear division to allow the production of haploid gametes from diploid cells. The crucial ploidy reduction step requires that sister kinetochores attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole, achieving ""monopolar attachment,"" which ensures that maternal and paternal chromosomes are segregated. Here we screened for factors required to establish monopolar attachment in fission yeast and identified a novel protein, Moa1. Moa1 is meiosis specific and localizes exclusively to the central core of the centromere, a region that binds meiotic Rec8-containing cohesin complexes but not mitotic Rad21/Scc1-containing complexes. Enforced cleavage of Rec8 in the central core region led to the disruption of monopolar attachment, as in moa1Delta cells, without diminishing Moa1 localization. Moa1 physically interacts with Rec8, implying that Moa1 functions only through Rec8, presumably to facilitate central core cohesion. These results prove that monoorientation of kinetochores is established in a cohesion-mediated manner."
https://openalex.org/W2127464971,"Formation of normal olfactory memory requires the expression of the wild-type amnesiac gene in the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons. Imaging the activity in the processes of DPM neurons revealed that the neurons respond when the fly is stimulated with electric shock or with any odor that was tested. Pairing odor and electric-shock stimulation increases odor-evoked calcium signals and synaptic release from DPM neurons. These memory traces form in only one of the two branches of the DPM neuron process. Moreover, trace formation requires the expression of the wild-type amnesiac gene in the DPM neurons. The cellular memory traces first appear at 30 min after conditioning and persist for at least 1 hr, a time window during which DPM neuron synaptic transmission is required for normal memory. DPM neurons are therefore “odor generalists” and form a delayed, branch-specific, and amnesiac-dependent memory trace that may guide behavior after acquisition."

These effects are entirely independent of TIMP-2 inhibitory activity against MMPs, as demonstrated by the Ala + TIMP-2 mutant that lacks MMP inhibitory function but retains anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo (6Seo D.W.

The mechanism of these effects involves integrin-mediated heterologous receptor inactivation, specifically, α3β1-mediated inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase activation. In hMVECs, TIMP-2 induces protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity, independently of MMP inhibitory activity. The effects of TIMP-2 on endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis are sensitive to the nonspecific PTP inhibitor orthovanadate (6Seo D.W. Li H. Guedez L. Wingfield P.T. Diaz T. Salloum R. Wei B.Y. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The relevant PTP activity was putatively identified as the Src-homology 2 (SH2)-containing PTP-1 (Shp-1) using a dominant-negative approach (6Seo D.W. Li H. Guedez L. Wingfield P.T. Diaz T. Salloum R. Wei B.Y. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). TIMP-2 also inhibits migration of endothelial cells by directly enhancing cell surface expression of RECK (5Oh J. Seo D.-W. Diaz T. Wei B. Ward Y. Ray J.M. Morioka Y. Shi S. Kitayama H. Takahashi C. Noda M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. (2004) Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9062-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a novel, cell membrane-associated protease inhibitor. Enhanced expression of RECK reduces cell-associated MMP activity required for cell migration and also appears to involve an Shp-1-dependent mechanism.These findings lead us to posit that Shp-1 is an important negative regulator of endothelial cell growth in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. In addition, the observation that TIMP-2 can modulate gene expression (i.e. RECK) in an orthovanadate-sensitive manner through binding to α3β1 (5Oh J. Seo D.-W. Diaz T. Wei B. Ward Y. Ray J.M. Morioka Y. Shi S. Kitayama H. Takahashi C. Noda M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. (2004) Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9062-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) suggests that TIMP-2 may also activate signal transduction pathways important in cell growth regulation. Here we investigate the cellular pathways and effectors responsible for TIMP-2-mediated suppression of hMVEC proliferation in response to mitogenic growth factor stimulation. TIMP-2 inhibits mitogenic stimulation of hMVECs, resulting in G1 growth arrest. The TIMP-2-mediated arrest of hMVEC growth is Shp-1-dependent. Furthermore, TIMP-2 anti-angiogenic activity is completely ablated in Shp-1 deficient (motheaten viable) mice. These results lead us to suggest that Shp-1 is a critical negative regulator of endothelial cell growth in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines, Growth Factors, and Antibodies—hMVECs and growth factors were purchased from commercial sources and used as previously described (6Seo D.W.

The following antibodies were also purchased from commercial sources; anti-PTP1C/Shp-1 and anti-p27Kip1 (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-Cdk2, cyclin E, p16INK4a, Cdk4, and cyclin D (Upstate Biotechnology); anti-p27Kip1 (Thr-187) and p27Kip1 (Ser-10) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-p21WAF1/CiP1, Shp-2, Skp2, α3, and lamin B, actin antibodies, and mouse and rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rb-C fusion protein and polyclonal antibodies against phospho-pRb (S780), phospho-pRb (S807/811), and pRb were from Cell Signaling. TIMP-2 and Ala + TIMP-2 were prepared and characterized as described previously (10Wingfield P.T. Sax J.K. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Chung V. Corcoran M.L. Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21362-21368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Subconfluent cells in gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes were serum-starved for 24 h in endothelial cell basal medium and replaced with fresh media at 37 °C. Cells were then pretreated with or without TIMP-2 or Ala + TIMP-2 (50 nm) for 15 min before growth factor (FGF-2 or VEGF-A, 50 ng/ml) stimulation for 24 h unless otherwise noted. After treatment with growth factors and/or TIMP-2, cell lysates were prepared and clarified, and the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot as described previously (6Seo D.W. Li H. Guedez L. Wingfield P.T. Diaz T. Salloum R. Wei B.Y. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).Cell Cycle Assay by Flow Cytometry—For cell cycle analysis, hMVECs after FGF-2 stimulation in the presence or absence of TIMP-2 were harvested with trypsin-EDTA and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for at least 1 h. After cells were treated with RNase, DNA was stained with propidium iodide. The profile of cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer.Cell Growth Assays—The p27+/+ and p27-/- immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), plated on 96-well plates (4 × 103 cells/well), were serum-starved for 36 to 48 h before treatment with TIMP-2 or Ala + TIMP-2. After subsequent growth factor stimulation and culture for 48 h, the cell numbers were quantified as previously described (6Seo D.W. Li H. Guedez L. Wingfield P.T. Diaz T. Salloum R. Wei B.Y. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blots analysis was performed using standard techniques. Blots were sequentially hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes (p27Kip1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) for 14 h at 42 °C in prehybridization/hybridization buffer (Quality Biologicals). The probes for p27Kip1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were prepared using PCR products by High Prime DNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). After hybridization, the blots were washed in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at room temperature and in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C before autoradiography at -80 °C.In Vitro Cyclin-dependent Kinase Assays—For pRb kinase assays, anti-Cdk4 and anti-Cdk2 immunoprecipitates were rinsed 3 times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl-)benzene sulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.05 μg/ml leupeptin, 8 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and re-suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μg/ml Rb-C fusion protein (Cell Signaling), 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedical Inc., 6000 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 5× SDS-sample loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of substrate was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by the use of National Institutes of Health Image 1.6 software.siRNA Preparation and Transfection—For design of siRNA inserts, a cDNA sequence of integrin α3 AGCAACACAGACTACCTGGAG was selected according to the InvivoGen siRNA Wizard program based on a BLAST search. As a control we used the scrambled oligonucleotide sequence AGCATATGTGCGTACCTAGCT, available prepackaged in the psiRNA-hH1zeo vector (InvivoGen).Both the siRNA-targeting integrin α3 gene and control sequences were cloned into psiRNA-hH1zeo vector (InvivoGen), and these vectors are designated psiRNA-hH1zeo-α3 and psiRNA-hH1zeo-scr, respectively. These vector constructs were transfected into A549 lung carcinoma cells using LyoVec (InvivoGen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, the cells were selected with zeocin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 1-2 weeks until colony formation.Dominant Negative Shp-1 Adenovirus—The role of Shp-1 on TIMP-2-mediated cell growth arrest was investigated using dominant negative Shp-1 adenovirus as previously described (6Seo D.W. Li H. Guedez L. Wingfield P.T. Diaz T. Salloum R. Wei B.Y. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pcDNA3.1 vector containing wild type human Shp-1 (PTPN6) cDNA was first constructed, and the Shp-1 dominant-negative mutant was constructed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to convert the active site cysteine to a serine residue (C453S). Replication defective, human adenovirus (Ad5ΔE1ΔE3) with both wild type (wtShp-1) and the C453S mutation (dominant-negative (dn) Shp-1) sequences of Shp-1 were generated using the AdEasy Vector System (Qbiogene). Expression of dn Shp-1 in adenovirus-infected cells was verified by Western blotting using anti-PTP1C/Shp-1 antibody (BD Biosciences) and PTP assay (Upstate Biotechnology) of whole cell lysates.Subcellular Fractionation—Following treatments as indicated, hMVECs were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions.Immunofluorescence Analysis—For p27Kip1 immunofluorescence, the hMVECs were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plates after FGF-2 stimulation in the presence or absence of Ala+TIMP-2, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with PBS, and incubated with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Primary antibody diluted 1:500 in 1% NGS-PBS was incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes). The slides were sealed using Vectashield mounting medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vectashield) for nuclei counterstaining. Images were obtained with a SPOT digital camera (Model 1.3.0, Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) attached to Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Zeiss Plan-neofluor 100× oil objective lens, Carl Zeiss Inc.).Directed in Vivo Angiogenesis Assays—Wild type and homozygous motheaten viable (mevv/mev) mice were generated from the intercrosses of mev/mev/+ mice and genotyped by PCR detection of wild type and mutant Shp-1 loci from the tail genomic DNA as previously reported (15Kim C.H. Qu C.K. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Anzai N. Feng G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Quantification of the angiogenic responses in both wild type and motheaten viable mice were performed using the directed in vivo angiogenesis assay as previously described (6Seo D.W. Li H. Guedez L.

Briefly, angioreactors were filled with cold matrigel alone (negative controls) or matrigel containing 500 ng/ml either FGF-2 or VEGF-A. To test for in vivo antiangiogenic activity, angioreactors were filled with matrigel containing FGF-2 or VEGF-A plus either TIMP-2 or Ala + TIMP-2 (200 nm). Filled angioreactors were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal flank of wt or mev/mev mice. Angioreactors were recovered at day 11 after tail vein injection of 100 μl of 25 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (Mr 150 kDa). All data were obtained using a single angioreactor per mouse with experiments performed in quadruplicate. Negative controls show slight background fluorescence but contain no vessels or endothelial cells upon histological examination (16Guedez L. Rivera A.M. Salloum R. Miller M.L. Diegmueller J.J.

Li H. Guedez L. Wingfield P.T. Diaz T. Salloum R. Wei B.Y. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 17Murphy A.N. Unsworth E.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that TIMP-2 prevents entry of cells into the S phase of the cell cycle, which is usually associated with mitogenic growth factor stimulation. In the G1 phase of the cell cycle, retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is sequentially phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activities, and this hyperphosphorylation of pRb controls the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (18Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of TIMP-2 pretreatment on the pRb phosphorylation status in hMVECs. Specifically, we analyzed the phosphorylation of pRb on residues Ser-780 and Ser-807/811, sites specific for Cdk4 and Cdk2 phosphorylation, respectively (19Ezhevsky S.A. Ho A. Becker-Hapak M. Davis P.K. Dowdy S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4773-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As anticipated, FGF-2 stimulation for 24 h significantly increases pRb phosphorylation at both sites when compared with quiescent hMVECs. However, pretreatment with TIMP-2 or the Ala + TIMP-2 mutant lacking MMP inhibitory activity completely blocks FGF-2-induced pRb phosphorylation to levels observed in untreated cells (Fig. 1A). This finding is consistent with TIMP-2 preventing S phase entry, possibly through inhibition of Cdk activities.In addition, we studied the effects of TIMP-2 or Ala + TIMP-2 pretreatment on cell cycle by DNA content flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis of hMVECs after FGF-2 stimulation for 24 h increases the percentage of cells in S phase ∼2-fold compared with untreated cells (6.6 versus 12.2%) along with a concomitant reduction of cells in G1 phase (70 versus 62%) (Fig. 1B). This 2-fold increase in S phase is consistent with our previous cell growth experiments (6Seo D.W. Li H. Guedez L. Wingfield P.T. Diaz T. Salloum R. Wei B.Y. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). However, pretreatment with TIMP-2 or Ala + TIMP-2 before FGF-2 stimulation prevents the anticipated increase in S phase associated with FGF-2 mitogenic stimulation and leads to a corresponding increase in cells in G1 phase (70%) compared with hMVECs treated with FGF-2 alone (62% in G1). Pretreatment with either TIMP-2 or Ala + TIMP-2 alone did not alter the cell cycle pattern of hMVECs when compared with untreated cells (data not shown). These data are consistent with the pRb phosphorylation studies (Fig. 1A) as well as previous reports demonstrating that TIMP-2 inhibits [3H]thymidine incorporation upon FGF-2 stimulation (17Murphy A.N. Unsworth E.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that TIMP-2 pretreatment inhibits the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle, resulting in G1 arrest.TIMP-2 Enhances de Novo Synthesis of p27Kip1—It is currently appreciated that transition of cells from G1 to S phase specifically requires activation of Cdks, such as Cdk4 and Cdk2, through complex formation with their cognate regulatory subunits, cyclin D and cyclin E, respectively (18Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of these complexes is regulated by Cdk inhibitors, such as p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1, which inhibit a wide range of Cdks as well as p15 and p16 members of the INK family that selectively inhibit cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes (20Vidal A. Koff A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Enhanced expression of these inhibitors attenuates proliferative responses in a variety of cells, whereas reduced levels of the Cdk inhibitors are associated with S-phase entry and increased cellular proliferation. Thus, we analyzed the expression of Cdk inhibitors associated with the G1-to S-phase transition. After FGF-2 stimulation for 24 h the levels of p27Kip1 expression were markedly reduced to ∼20% of levels observed in untreated cells. In contrast, the levels of p16INK4A and p21WAF1/Cip1 show little or no change after FGF-2 stimulation alone. This decrease in p27Kip1 after mitogenic stimulation is expected, as previous studies have demonstrated increased proteasomal degradation of this protein before S-phase entry (21Servant M.J. Coulombe P. Turgeon B. Meloche S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Ala + TIMP-2 prevented the FGF-2-mediated decrease in p27Kip1 protein levels (Fig. 2A). Ala + TIMP-2 pretreatment also slightly reduced the levels of p21WAF1/Cip1, but no change in p21WAF1/Cip1 levels was observed after FGF-2 treatment alone. These findings suggest that TIMP-2 may suppress FGF-2-stimulated hMVEC proliferation by augmenting expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1. Increased cellular levels of p27Kip1 are indicative of G1 cell cycle arrest, as previously demonstrated (22Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) and are consistent with the G1 arrest of endothelial cell growth after TIMP-2 treatment.FIGURE 2TIMP-2 enhances expression of Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1. hMVECs stimulated with FGF-2 in the presence or absence of Ala + TIMP-2 for different time periods as indicated were subjected to Northern and Western blot analysis. A, cells collected at the 24-h time point were Western-blotted with anti-Cdk inhibitors antibodies. Expression levels of p27Kip1 were normalized to actin loading control. B, TIMP-2 induces transcriptional activation of p27Kip1. Untreated hMVECs (control) were stimulated with FGF-2 in the absence (FGF-2) or presence (FGF-2 + Ala-TIMP-2) of Ala + TIMP-2 for the times indicated. Average p27Kip1 mRNA ± S.E. is expressed as the change relative to that observed in untreated hMVECs. Data shown are the results from three independent experiments. C, TIMP-2 increases p27Kip1 protein expression. Ala + TIMP-2 treatment results in increases of p27Kip1 protein level with (FGF-2 + Ala-TIMP-2) or without (Ala-TIMP-2) subsequent FGF-2 stimulation compared with that in untreated (control) or FGF-2-stimulated (FGF-2) hMVECs. Values represent the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. D, TIMP-2 induction of p27Kip1 expression requires de novo protein synthesis. Cells were treated with Ala + TIMP-2 (50 nm), FGF-2 (50 ng/ml) alone, or both Ala + TIMP-2 and FGF-2 in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX, 10 μm) or N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (LLnL, 20 μm) for 6 h. Results shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The regulation of cellular p27Kip1 levels is complex, involving both de novo protein synthesis and/or protein degradation via the proteasomal pathway (23Viglietto G.

To examine possible mechanisms via which TIMP-2 increases cellular p27Kip1 levels, we examined the time course of p27Kip1 expression during the growth inhibition experiments. FGF-2 stimulation of hMVECs results in a slight increase (<30%) in p27Kip1 mRNA expression over 24 h (Fig. 2B), whereas FGF-2 decreased p27Kip1 total protein levels below those observed in control cells (Fig. 2C). These findings are consistent with the patterns of p27Kip1 mRNA and total cellular protein levels observed after stimulation by a variety of mitogenic factors (21Servant M.J. Coulombe P. Turgeon B. Meloche S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).In contrast, pretreatment with Ala + TIMP-2 before FGF-2 stimulation results in statistically significant increases in both p27Kip1 transcripts and protein lev"

We have obtained Elovl3-ablated mice and report here that, although cold-acclimated Elovl3-ablated mice experienced an increased heat loss due to impaired skin barrier, they were unable to hyperrecruit their brown adipose tissue. Instead, they used muscle shivering in order to maintain body temperature. Lack of Elovl3 resulted in a transient decrease in the capacity to elongate saturated fatty acyl-CoAs into very long chain fatty acids, concomitantly with the occurrence of reduced levels of arachidic acid (C20:0) and behenic acid (C22:0) in brown adipose tissue during the initial cold stress. This effect on very long chain fatty acid synthesis could be illustrated as a decrease in the condensation activity of the elongation enzyme. In addition, warm-acclimated Elovl3-ablated mice showed diminished ability to accumulate fat and reduced metabolic capacity within the brown fat cells. This points to ELOVL3 as an important regulator of endogenous synthesis of saturated very long chain fatty acids and triglyceride formation in brown adipose tissue during the early phase of the tissue recruitment.

Brown adipose tissue is the only tissue that functions exclusively to combust fat for heat production (1Jansky L. Biol. Rev. 1973; 48: 85-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Foster D.O. Frydman M.L.

Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). When mammals encounter cold, there is an induced synthesis of specific mRNA species in brown adipose tissue, which encode enzymes regulating energy expenditure and lipid metabolism (4Trayhurn P. Trayhurn P. Nichols D.G. Brown Adipose Tissue. Edward Arnold Ltd., London, UK1986: 299-338Google Scholar, 5Jacobsson A. Mühleisen M. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J.

Most notable is the increased mRNA level of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which can uncouple the mitochondrial respiratory chain and thereby dissipate heat instead of conserving energy in the form of ATP. The induction of processes needed for increased brown adipose tissue activity is referred to as brown fat recruitment. The process is controlled by norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve endings found in the tissue (7Trayhurn P. Ashwell M. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1987; 46: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Cannon B. Jacobsson A. Rehnmark S. Nedergaard J. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 20: S36-S42Google Scholar) and can roughly be divided into two major phases, depending on how the animal experiences the cold (4 °C) (i.e. cold stress or cold acclimation). During the first days of cold exposure (i.e. cold stress), the major effect on brown adipose tissue is the initiation of hypertrophy, and a few days later, during the onset of cold acclimation, hyperplasia occurs (9Cameron I.L. Smith R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 23: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Bukowiecki L.J. Collet A.J. Follea N. Guay G. Jahjah L. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: E353-E359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 days of cold exposure, there is a doubling in DNA amount, and after 3 weeks, a 3-fold increase is detected, which is the maximal level achieved with this degree of cold (11Géloën A.

Cell Res. 1989; 180: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The increase in the total amount of protein in cold-exposed mice occurs also as a two-phase phenomenon (5Jacobsson A. Mühleisen M. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: R999-R1007PubMed Google Scholar). The first phase is completed within 3 days, and the second phase of protein increase (i.e. during cold acclimation) is found in the tissue after 2–3 weeks of cold exposure. During these events, protein synthesis mainly reflects an increase in mRNA levels (5Jacobsson A. Mühleisen M. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: R999-R1007PubMed Google Scholar). During the process of identifying specific cDNA molecules corresponding to mRNA species that are induced in the brown adipose tissue upon cold stimulation (13Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16250-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Elovl3 (elongation of very long chain fatty acid) was identified. Elovl3, formerly denoted as Cig30 (cold-induced glycoprotein of 30 kDa), is a member of a mammalian gene family whose products have been determined as being involved in the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) 2The abbreviations used are: VLCFA, very long chain fatty acid; NE, norepinephrine; Tes, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; fluorescamine, 4-phenylspiro-[furan-2(3H), 1-phthalan]-3,3′-dione.

Except for brown adipose tissue, Elovl3 mRNA was also detected in liver, skin, kidney, white adipose tissue, and heart, whereas no signal was detected in lung, testis, muscle, spleen, brain, thymus, and intestine (14Tvrdik P.

Of particular interest is the fact that the expression of Elovl3 was selectively elevated by more than 200-fold in brown adipose tissue of mice exposed to a 3-day cold stress. Prolonged cold exposure of mice for 1 month gradually decreased Elovl3 expression, but the level still remained 100-fold above the control level. This phenomenon was qualitatively mimicked both by the continuous administration of norepinephrine via osmotic minipumps in mice kept at 28 °C and by intake of a calorie-rich diet (14Tvrdik P.

A similar increase in expression was detected during perinatal development, reaching a maximum level immediately after birth, demonstrating that Elovl3 expression is highly correlated with recruitment of brown adipose tissue (14Tvrdik P.

In recent years, the characterization of the ELOVL members has indicated that they are condensing enzymes and, as such, rate-limiting in the elongation machinery (16Nugteren D.H. Biochim. Biophys.

In order to ascribe a role to the ELOVL3 protein within brown adipose tissue during the recruitment process, we have obtained, by homologous recombination, a mouse strain that lacks a functional ELOVL3 protein. These mice exhibit a distinct skin phenotype, including impaired barrier function (25Westerberg R. Tvrdik P. Undén A.B. Månsson J.E. Norlén L. Jakobsson A. Holleran W.M. Elias P.M. Asadi A. Flodby P. Toftgård R. Capecchi M.R. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5621-5629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although the Elovl3-ablated mice, compared with control mice, had a more than 100-fold reduced level of Elovl3 mRNA in their brown adipose tissue when exposed to cold, a majority of the mice endured 4 °C cold exposure for several months. However, although the Elovl3-ablated mice experienced the cold more acutely, they were unable to hyperrecruit their brown adipose tissue. Instead, the Elovl3-ablated mice generated more heat by muscle shivering. As anticipated, the VLCFA elongation activity was significantly reduced in the brown adipose tissue of Elovl3-ablated mice exposed to the cold. Surprisingly, this phenomenon was only seen in mice during the initial cold stress. Cold-acclimated Elov3-ablated mice were equally efficient as normal mice at elongating fatty acids. In addition, warm-acclimated Elovl3-ablated mice showed dramatically reduced lipid accumulation within the brown adipocytes as well as reduced metabolic capacity when stimulated by norepinephrine. Since the difference in lipid formation between wild-type and Elovl3-ablated mice was transient (i.e. only seen in nonstimulated and acutely stimulated tissue), it implies that ELOVL3 is a critical enzyme for lipid accumulation and metabolic activity in brown adipocytes during the early phase of the tissue recruitment. Animals—Elovl3-ablated mice were generated as described previously (25Westerberg R. Tvrdik P. Undén A.B. Månsson J.E. Norlén L. Jakobsson A. Holleran W.M. Elias P.M. Asadi A. Flodby P. Toftgård R. Capecchi M.R. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5621-5629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and were back-crossed with C57Bl/6 (B & K Universal, Stockholm, Sweden). As control mice, age-matched mice from this back-cross, which were bred under the same conditions as the Elovl3-ablated mice, were used. Where indicated, wild-type or heterozygote littermates from heterozygote Elovl3-ablated (+/-) intercrosses were used as control mice. During the course of the described experiments, no difference in results between the two control groups was noticed. Animals were fed ad libitum (Rat and Mouse Standard Diet No. 1; BeeKay Feeds; B & K Universal), had free access to water, and were kept in a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle in single cages. Wild-type and Elovl3-ablated mice were bred at room temperature. Before the cold exposure experiments, the mice were kept at 30 °C (thermoneutrality) for 10 days where not indicated otherwise. After this period, animals were exposed to 4 °C for the indicated times or remained at 30 °C. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using Ultraspec (Biotecx Laboratory) from 50–100 mg (w/w) of each tissue, as described earlier (14Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was separated on a 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in 20× SSC. The membrane was prehybridized with a solution containing 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 0.5% SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50% formamide, and 100 mg/ml degraded DNA from herring sperm (Sigma) at 45 °C. After prehybridization, the membrane was transferred to a similar solution containing the denatured probe. The hybridization was carried out overnight at 45 °C. The membrane was then washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 30 °C for 20–30 min each and then twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 50 °C for 45 min. Corresponding cDNA fragments of Ucp1 (680 bp), Elovl1 (923 bp), and Elovl3 (980 bp) were used as probes as previously described (14Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) with [32P]dCTP. The filters were analyzed on an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and quantified with the ImageQuant program. Reverse Transcription-PCR Transcription Analysis—DNase-treated total RNA (2.5 mg from interscapular brown fat) was reverse-transcribed using a Fermentas RevertAid™ H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. The PCR reaction was carried out with Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/μl) and primers forward (exon 3) (5′-CGTAGTCAGATTCTGGTCCT-3′) and reverse (exon 4) (5′-CCAGAAGAAGTGTTCCGTTG-3′) for the Elovl3 mRNA amplification, with the following cycle parameters: 94 °C for 2 min (1 cycle); 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s (35 cycles); 72 °C for 2 min (1 cycle). The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE and photographed. Body Temperature Measurement—Mice were housed at room temperature in single cages, and colonic temperature was measured (model BAT-12 thermometer; Physitemp Instruments Inc.) once before the experiment. The animals were then exposed to 4 °C for 8 h, during which colonic temperature was measured every 30 min. In Vivo O2 Consumption Measurement—Oxygen consumption measurements were performed in an open circuit system, as described by Dicker et al. (26Dicker A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R767-R774PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments, oxygen consumption was recalculated to ml of O2·min-1·(kg of body weight-0.75). Before the experiment, the mice had been exposed to 30 °C or 4 °C for 3 weeks as indicated. Resting metabolic rate was measured at 30 °C for 3 h with the Somedic indirect calorimeter (50Alberts P. Johansson B.G. McArthur R.A. Current Protocols in Pharmacology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2005: 5.39.1-5.39.15Google Scholar). The resting metabolic rate was defined as the mean of the three lowest 2-min oxygen consumption measuring points, during the last hour of the experimental period. A few days after the resting metabolic rate measurements, the thermogenic response to norepinephrine (NE) was measured. The animals were injected with sodium pentobarbital (pentobarbital natricum; 90 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally, final volume 0.3 ml; Apoteksbolaget, Stockholm, Sweden) and transferred to the calorimetric chamber at 30 °C. After about 30 min, when the metabolic rate during anesthesia had stabilized, NE (1 mg/kg of body weight, (-)-arterenol bitartrate; Sigma) was injected subcutaneously dissolved in physiological saline in a final volume of 0.1 ml. For measurements of metabolic rate at different environmental temperatures (thermoneutrality (30 °C), room temperature (21 °C), and acute response to mild (15 °C) and heavy (4 °C) cold stress), the animals were kept in the chamber at the relevant temperature for 1 h. The metabolic rate was determined as the mean rate of oxygen consumption within the last 20 min of the 1-h period. Mitochondrial O2 Consumption Measurement—Brown adipose tissue mitochondria were isolated and analyzed in parallel from male 10–14-week-old wild-type and Elovl3-ablated mice. Interscapular, periaortic, and axillary brown adipose tissue of four mice was pooled and used for isolation of mitochondria. The standard procedure of differential centrifugation was modified as described by Cannon and Nedergaard (27Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 155: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated using medium consisting of 250 mm sucrose that in final centrifugation was changed to medium containing 20 mm K+-Tes (pH 7.2), 100 KCl, 0.6% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in order to re-expand the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial protein concentration was measured using the 4-phenylspiro-[furan-2(3H),1-phthalan]-3,3′-dione (fluorescamine) method (28Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar), and the suspensions were diluted to stock concentrations of 25 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml in 20 mm K+-Tes (pH 7.2), 100 KCl with 0.3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Oxygen consumption rates were monitored with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (YSI Inc.) in a sealed chamber at 30 °C. The output signal from the oxygen electrode amplifier was electronically time-differentiated and collected every 0.5 s by a PowerLab/ADInstrument (application program Chart version 4.1.1). Mitochondria (0.3 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in medium consisting of 100 mm KCl, 20 mm K+-Tes (pH 7.2), 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm KPi, 3 mm malate, and 0.3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Palmitoyl-CoA, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), oligomycin, GDP (sodium salt), l-(-)-malic acid (disodium salt), pyruvic acid (sodium salt), and EDTA were all from Sigma. GDP was dissolved in 20 mm K+-Tes (pH 7.2), and the solution was readjusted in pH. Fluorescamine was from Fluka. FCCP was dissolved in 50% ethanol; oligomycin was dissolved in 95% ethanol. Palmitate (sodium salt) and palmitoyl-l-carnitine were dissolved in 90% ethanol. Ethanol in a final concentration of 0.1% did not in itself have any effects on the parameters measured. Preparations of Microsomes and the Fatty Acid Elongation Assay—Interscapular brown adipose tissue was dissected and homogenized in 4 ml of ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose. Following a 30-min stepwise centrifugation (10 min at 700 × g, 8,000 × g, and 17,000 × g) at 4–10 °C, the supernatant was carefully transferred to fresh tubes, and microsomes were sedimented at 105,000 × g for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.4 m KCl and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 45 min. The final microsomal pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and the protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Chem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Total fatty acid elongation activity was measured essentially according to Suneja et al. (19Suneja S.K. Nagi M.N. Cook L. Cinti D.L. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The assay mixtures (0.5 ml total, including a 25-μg protein addition) contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4); either 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0) or 15 μm arachidoyl-CoA (C20:0); substrate/bovine serum albumin ratio of 2:1; 1 mm NADPH; and 50 μm malonyl CoA (containing 0.050 μCi of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA). The reaction was carried out for 17 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 15% KOH in methanol and saponified at 65 °C for 45 min. The samples were cooled and acidified with 0.5 ml of cold 5 m HCl. Free fatty acids were extracted from the mixture three times with 1.5 ml of n-hexane and dried under vacuum. The extract was dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform and measured for radioactivity, after the addition of 10 ml of scintillation mixture, in a Beckman liquid scintillation system 3801. The assay conditions for determining the condensation reaction were the same as for total elongation activity, except that NADPH was omitted from the mixture. Lipid Analysis—Samples of about 100 mg of tissue were used for lipid extraction with 3 ml of chloroform/methanol/water 4:8:3 (by volume) (30Svennerholm L. Fredman P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the sediment was extracted with another portion of the same solvent. The combined supernatants were evaporated to dryness and dissolved in chloroform/methanol/water 60:30:4.5 (by volume). Low molecular weight contaminants and gangliosides were removed by partition against 0.1 m KCl in the proportion chloroform/methanol/KCl, 4:2:1. After centrifugation, the upper phase was removed and discarded. Lipid extract corresponding to 10 mg of tissue was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. Heptadecenoic acid methyl ester was added as an internal calibrator. Transmethylation was performed with 0.2 m sodium methylate in methanol for 2 h at 60°C. The fatty acid methyl esters formed from glycerolipids and cholesterol esters were purified from cholesterol and sphingolipids by thin layer chromatography with methylene chloride as developing solvent. The purified fatty acid methyl ester fraction was assayed by gas chromatography on a DB-23 column (30 m × 0.53 mm inner diameter, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The total amount of fatty acids was calculated using the internal calibrator and expressed as μmol/g of fresh tissue, and the fatty acid compositions are given as molar distributions/mol %. The between-day coefficients of variation varied between 0.9 and 3.5% for the different fatty acids. Total fat content was measured in three or four anesthetized mice of each group using a DEXA scanner from Lunar/GE Medical Systems (PIXImus2). DEXA scans, except for head regions, were analyzed using the PIXImus2 software (version 1.46.007). The percentage of fat was obtained by dividing total fat content (g) by total tissue mass. Electromyogram Measurements—Electromyogram recordings were obtained principally as in Ref. 31Golozoubova V. Hohtola E. Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2048-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar. Mice were anesthetized with halothane, and then safety pin-type electrodes (two recording, one reference) were placed over the back muscles of the mice. After recovery from anesthesia, the mice were placed in the chamber with a defined ambient temperature. Recording was started at 4 °C, and then the temperature in the chamber was increased to 30 °C, where basal muscle activity was measured. The electromyogram signal picked up by the electrodes was amplified (×1,000) and noise-filtered (high pass filter 10 Hz, low pass filter 3 kHz) with a low noise preamplifier (World Precision Instruments) and rectified and integrated in a purpose-built RC integrator, principally as in Ref. 32Hohtola E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 73A: 159-166Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar. The signal from the RC integrator, corresponding to a running mean over 37.6 s, was digitalized and recorded with a MacLab system at a rate of 40 data points/min. The data obtained in this way represented the mean rectified value (Umrv), as defined in Ref. 32Hohtola E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 73A: 159-166Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, which is equivalent to the mean deviation around the sample mean. Electromyogram measurements in cold and at thermoneutrality were performed on the same experimental occasion. Histology—Interscapular brown adipose tissue was taken from age- and sex-matched animals. Specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formaline for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at 4 μm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined by light microscopy. Normal Body Temperature in Elovl3-ablated Mice—We have shown previously that Elovl3 gene expression is induced in brown adipose tissue in mice under circumstances when a high demand for heat production is required (14Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Northern blot in Fig. 1A shows the increase in Elovl3 mRNA in mice exposed to the cold, reaching maximum levels between days 1 and 3. This corresponds to an approximately 100-fold increase in Elovl3 mRNA, compared with the level in control mice housed at 30 °C. Prolonged exposure of the mice to 1 month of cold gradually decreased the Elovl3 mRNA expression to about 60% of the maximum value. In the Elovl3-ablated mice, there was no detectable Elovl3 mRNA species in cold-exposed (i.e. 3 days at 4 °C) or in cold-acclimated (i.e. 3 weeks at 4 °C) mice (Fig. 1B). Compared with wild-type mice, Elovl3-ablated mice displayed a tousled hair coat. In addition, the mice exhibit a disturbed hair lipid content, resulting in a severe defect in water repulsion and increased transepidermal water loss (25Westerberg R. Tvrdik P. Undén A.B. Månsson J.E. Norlén L. Jakobsson A. Holleran W.M. Elias P.M. Asadi A. Flodby P. Toftgård R. Capecchi M.R. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5621-5629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This has dramatic effects on the thermoregulation of the Elovl3-ablated mice, since wet fur led to a severe drop in body temperature within 1 h (25Westerberg R. Tvrdik P. Undén A.B. Månsson J.E. Norlén L. Jakobsson A. Holleran W.M. Elias P.M. Asadi A. Flodby P. Toftgård R. Capecchi M.R. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5621-5629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To further investigate the ability of the Elovl3-ablated mice to control their body temperature, we acutely exposed the mice to cold (4 °C) and measured their colonic temperature during an 8-h period. Surprisingly, although there was a slight drop in body temperature during the first hours in cold, there was no significant difference between wild-type and Elovl3-ablated mice (Fig. 1C). However, with increased number of experiments and mice used, we could detect a sporadic mortality among Elovl3-ablated mice within the first 24 h of cold exposure. The majority of the Elovl3-ablated mice seemed, however, to be fully normal with respect to their ability to maintain body weight and body temperature even after several weeks of cold exposure (data not shown). Hyperinduced Metabolic Rate in Cold-exposed Elovl3-ablated Mice—Since the Elovl3-ablated mice were capable of sustaining normal body temperature, we assumed that a normal heat-producing function of brown adipose tissue is maintained in the ablated mice. In order to confirm this, we measured oxygen consumption in cold-acclimated wild-type and Elovl3-ablated mice. As seen in Fig. 2A, no difference in oxygen consumption between cold-acclimated wild-type and Elovl3-ablated mice could be detected at th"
https://openalex.org/W2057765745,We demonstrate reversible wetting and filling of open single-wall carbon nanotubes with mercury by means of electrocapillary pressure originating from the application of a potential across an individual nanotube in contact with a mercury drop. Wetting improves the conductance in both metallic and semiconducting nanotube probes by decreasing contact resistance and forming a mercury nanowire inside the nanotube. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate the electrocapillarity-driven filling process and provide estimates for the imbibition speed and electrocapillary pressure.

The new specimen confirms the presence of a hyperextendible second toe as in dromaeosaurs and troodontids. Archaeopteryx had a plesiomorphic tetraradiate palatine bone and no fully reversed first toe. These observations provide further evidence for the theropod ancestry of birds. In addition, the presence of a hyperextendible second toe blurs the distinction of archaeopterygids from basal deinonychosaurs (troodontids and dromaeosaurs) and challenges the monophyly of Aves."
https://openalex.org/W2074487053,"Germ line alterations in BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 acts as a scaffold protein implicated in multiple cellular functions, such as transcription, DNA repair, and ubiquitination. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for tumorigenesis are not yet fully understood. We have recently demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts in vivo with acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase α (ACCA) through its tandem of BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) domains. To understand the biological function of the BRCA1·ACCA complex, we sought to determine whether BRCA1 is a regulator of lipogenesis through its interaction with ACCA. We showed here that RNA inhibition-mediated down-regulation of BRCA1 expression induced a marked increase in the fatty acid synthesis. We then delineated the biochemical characteristics of the complex and found that BRCA1 interacts solely with the phosphorylated and inactive form of ACCA (P-ACCA). Finally, we demonstrated that BRCA1 affects lipid synthesis by preventing P-ACCA dephosphorylation. These results suggest that BRCA1 affects lipogenesis through binding to P-ACCA, providing a new mechanism by which BRCA1 may exert a tumor suppressor function. Germ line alterations in BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 acts as a scaffold protein implicated in multiple cellular functions, such as transcription, DNA repair, and ubiquitination. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for tumorigenesis are not yet fully understood. We have recently demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts in vivo with acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase α (ACCA) through its tandem of BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) domains. To understand the biological function of the BRCA1·ACCA complex, we sought to determine whether BRCA1 is a regulator of lipogenesis through its interaction with ACCA. We showed here that RNA inhibition-mediated down-regulation of BRCA1 expression induced a marked increase in the fatty acid synthesis. We then delineated the biochemical characteristics of the complex and found that BRCA1 interacts solely with the phosphorylated and inactive form of ACCA (P-ACCA). Finally, we demonstrated that BRCA1 affects lipid synthesis by preventing P-ACCA dephosphorylation. These results suggest that BRCA1 affects lipogenesis through binding to P-ACCA, providing a new mechanism by which BRCA1 may exert a tumor suppressor function. BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) was the first susceptibility gene linked to breast and ovarian cancer (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q.

Germ line mutations of BRCA1 are found in about 50% of patients with inherited breast cancer and up to 90% of families with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility (1Miki Y. Swensen J.

Mutat. 1996; 8: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Frequent loss of the wild-type allele in tumors of BRCA1 mutation carriers suggests that BRCA1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. However, although BRCA1 has been implicated in a number of cellular processes including the DNA damage repair (3Starita L.M. Parvin J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), the biological role of BRCA1 remains unclear. The BRCA1 gene encodes an 1863-amino acid protein with a tandem of two BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) 5The abbreviations used are: BRCT, BRCA1 C terminus; ACCA, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase α; FAS, fatty acid synthase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; SCD-1, stearoyl-coA desaturase-1; SREBP-1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1; LXR, liver X receptor; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside; λPPase, λ protein phosphatase; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA inhibition; P-ACCA, phosphorylated and inactive form of ACCA. domains at its C-terminal region (4Koonin E.V.

The majority of disease-associated BRCA1 mutations results in a truncated product with loss of one or two BRCT domains (2Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). BRCT domains function as protein-protein interaction modules (7Huyton T. Bates P.A. Zhang X. Sternberg M.J. Freemont P.S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that a subset of tandem of BRCT domains, including those of BRCA1, function as phosphopeptide-binding modules (8Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 9Rodriguez M. Yu X. Chen J. Songyang Z. J. Biol.

Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). We previously identified acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (ACCA) as a novel partner of BRCA1 (11Magnard C. Bachelier R. Vincent A. Jaquinod M. Kieffer S. Lenoir G.M. Venezia N.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6729-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Notably, the binding of ACCA is mediated by the tandem of BRCT domains of BRCA1, and it is abolished by tumor-associated mutations that affect these domains. Thus, the in vivo interaction of ACCA and BRCA1 is likely to be important for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. ACCA is the rate-limiting enzyme for long chain fatty acid synthesis that catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA (12Kim K.S. Lee J.K. Kim K.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA is then used for long chain fatty acid synthesis by fatty acid synthase (FAS). A number of critical ACCA phosphorylation sites have been identified (13Davies S.P. Sim A.T. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). More specifically, phosphorylation on Ser79 by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is responsible for the inactivation of ACCA (14Winder W.W. Wilson H.A. Hardie D.G. Rasmussen B.B. Hutber C.A. Call G.B. Clayton R.D. Conley L.M. Yoon S. Zhou B. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 82: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To explore new functions of BRCA1 that may contribute to its tumor suppressor activity, we investigated functional features of the BRCA1·ACCA complex (11Magnard C. Bachelier R. Vincent A. Jaquinod M. Kieffer S. Lenoir G.M. Venezia N.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6729-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We first examined the biological properties of BRCA1 with respect to those of ACCA and found that BRCA1 silencing increases cellular lipid synthesis. We then explored the biochemical characteristics of the complex BRCA1·ACCA: BRCA1 interacts solely with the phosphorylated and inactive form of ACCA (P-ACCA), and the formation of the BRCA1·P-ACCA complex interferes with ACCA activity by preventing P-ACCA dephosphorylation. Therefore, we identified a new function of BRCA1 that is to modulate lipid synthesis through its phospho-dependent binding to ACCA. Chemicals—The primary antibodies used were as follows: monoclonal antibody to human BRCA1 (OP92) (Oncogene Research Products), monoclonal antibody to actin (ICN Biochemicals), polyclonal antibody to ACCA (ACCAL3) as previously described (11Magnard C. Bachelier R. Vincent A. Jaquinod M. Kieffer S. Lenoir G.M. Venezia N.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6729-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and polyclonal antibody to P-ACCA (P-ACCA (S79)) (Upstate Biotechnology). The specificity of the P-ACCA(S79) antibody was tested by pretreatment of the antibody with the phosphopeptide immunogen and by pretreating the blot with phosphatase (Upstate Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Amersham Biosciences). 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals. λ protein phosphatase (λPPase) was purchased from Biolabs. Expression Vectors—The pCDNA3β plasmid expressing human BRCA1 protein was previously described (15Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The ACCA sequence corresponding to N-terminal (4019 bp) fragment (ACCA-N) was PCR-amplified from human cDNA library, using respectively the primers Nter-F 5′-GCCTCGAGGAATAATGGATGAACCATC-3′ and Nter-R 5′-AAGCGGCCGCTGTGCAACCAGGAAAGTAAG-3′. The cDNA fragment was subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pCDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The ACCA-N-S79A mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) with the following primers: 5′-CATAAGGTCCAGCATGGCTGGCTTGCACCTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGGTGCAAGCCAGCCATGCTGGACCTTATG-3′ and sequenced. Cell Culture and Plasmid Transfections—MCF7 human breast cancer cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 g/liter of glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin. When indicated, 0.5 mm of AICAR was added to cell medium. Bosc human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter of glucose supplemented as above. MCF10A normal mammary epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented as described (16Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). For transfection, MCF7 cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/plate in a 6-well flask 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid and 10 μl of ExGen 500 (Euromedex) following the supplier procedure. 48 h after transfection, the cells were processed for immunoblotting or metabolic labeling. Bosc cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid and 20 μl of ExGen 500 (Euromedex) following the supplier procedure. 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed. The lysates were pooled and then divided in the desired number of samples that were further processed for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA free; Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (11Magnard C. Bachelier R. Vincent A. Jaquinod M. Kieffer S. Lenoir G.M. Venezia N.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6729-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the intensity of the bands corresponding to the immunoreactive proteins were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). GST Pull-down Assay—The cells were lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (as above). Where indicated as “No stress,” the cells were lysed in culture dish and scraped afterward. Where indicated as “AICAR,” the cells were treated for 1 h with 0.5 mm of AICAR followed by lysis in culture dish and scraping. Otherwise, the cells were treated with trypsin before lysis. GST pull-down assay was performed as described (11Magnard C. Bachelier R. Vincent A. Jaquinod M. Kieffer S. Lenoir G.M. Venezia N.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6729-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The presence of GST fusion proteins was examined by Coomassie Blue staining. Where indicated, the protein complexes were treated with 40 units of λPPase for 1 h at 30 °C, before analysis by Western blotting. Alternatively, GST pull-down was performed on cell lysates previously treated with 2000 units of λPPase. RNAi—MCF7 cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/plate in a 6-well flask 24 h before transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA duplexes (Proligo, France) were provided as purified and annealed duplexes. The sequences were as follows: Si-BRCA1 5′-AAGGAACCUGUCUCCACAAAGUU-3′ and Si-control 5′-AACACGAUGUGACAGUGAUAUUU-3′. The DNA sequences were subjected to a BLAST analysis. The cells were transfected with 0.125 nmol of siRNA and 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using the protocol of the supplier. The cells were processed for RT-PCR, immunoblotting, or metabolic labeling 72 h after transfection. Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). After extraction, the integrity and quantity of RNA were examined by gel electrophoresis. Total RNA was quantified by densitometry on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide in comparison with serial dilutions of known amount of standard RNA (Roche Applied Science). The RT-PCR assay was performed by coamplification of 0.3 μg of total RNA and of a known amount of competitor RNA. Primers used were designed to amplify the cDNA fragment from exons 6 to 8 of the BRCA1 gene (C3F, 5′-TGTGCTTTTCAGCTTGACACAGG-3′, and C3R, 5′-CGTCTTTTGAGGTTGTATCCGCTG-3′) (17Ribieras S. Magdinier F. Leclerc D. Lenoir G. Frappart L. Dante R. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reactions were performed using the One Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The procedure used was as described by the supplier. The aliquots were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and the intensity of the bands corresponding to the wild-type BRCA1 PCR products and to the competitor PCR products were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). A PCR using the same primers was realized on total RNA to confirm the absence of DNA in the RNA samples (17Ribieras S. Magdinier F. Leclerc D. Lenoir G. Frappart L. Dante R. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared as above. The real time RT-PCR was performed mainly as described (18Gosmain Y. Dif N. Berbe V. Loizon E. Rieusset J. Vidal H. Lefai E. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 697-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). First strand cDNAs were first synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA in the presence of 100 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) using both random hexamers and oligo(dT) primers (Promega). Real time PCR was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 5 μl of a 60-fold dilution of the RT reaction medium, 15 μl of reaction buffer from the fastStart DNA Master SYBR Green kit (Roche Applied Science), and 10.5 pmol of the specific forward and reverse primers (Eurobio, France). The list of the primers and real time PCR conditions for each mRNA assay are available upon request. 6E. Lefai, personal communication. For quantification, a standard curve was systematically generated with six different amounts (150–30,000 molecules/tube) of purified target cDNA cloned in the pGEM plasmid (Promega). Each assay was performed in duplicate, and validation of the real time PCR runs was assessed by evaluation of the melting temperature of the products and by the slope and error obtained with the standard curve. The analyses were performed using Light-Cycler software (Roche Applied Science). The results are presented as relative levels after normalization by hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 mRNA abundance. Metabolic Labeling—2-14C-Labeled acetate (53 mCi/mmol; 2 μCi/dish) (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the culture medium. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested, and the lipids were extracted according to Folch's technique (19Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The values were normalized for sample protein contents. Acetate incorporation into specific lipids was analyzed after separation of lipids by TLC. Therefore, lipid extracts and appropriate lipid standards were spotted on silica gel (60 Å; Whatman). For separation of lipids, the plates were developed in hexane-diethyl ether-acetic acid (70/30/1, v/v/v). The lipid samples and standards were visualized by coloration in staining solution (0.12 m NaCl, 20% methanol, 300 mg/liter Coomassie Blue). The gel lipid fractions were resuspended into 50% methanol solution, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The values were normalized for sample protein contents. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with a two-tailed paired Student's t test. For the analysis of lipid synthesis, the statistical significance of the results was determined using the nonparametric one-tailed Mann-Whitney test. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.05. BRCA1 Affects Fatty Acid Synthesis—To investigate the role of BRCA1 in modulating fatty acid synthesis, we used a siRNA approach on MCF7 cells. Inhibition of endogenous BRCA1 expression after transfection with the BRCA1-specific siRNA oligonucleotide (Si-BRCA1) was analyzed by a quantitative RT-PCR assay using a chimeric BRCA1 RNA as a competitor (17Ribieras S. Magdinier F. Leclerc D. Lenoir G. Frappart L. Dante R. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and by Western blotting. RNAi reduced the expression of BRCA1 mRNA by 73% and BRCA1 protein by 65% compared with MCF7 cells transfected with the control siRNA (Si-control), with no effect on the amount of ACCA protein (Fig. 1, A and B). To assess potential effects of RNAi-mediated BRCA1 silencing on lipid synthesis, MCF7 cells transfected with Si-BRCA1 or Si-control siRNAs were exposed to 2-14C-labeled acetate. Incorporation of 2-14C-labeled acetate into cellular lipids of MCF7 cells transfected with Si-BRCA1 was significantly increased to 150 ± 3% (mean ± S.E.; n = 4; p < 0.001) of the level in the cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 1C). To investigate the impact of RNAi-mediated BRCA1 silencing on the different lipid species, the lipid extracts were analyzed by TLC. The majority of 2-14C-labeled acetate in cells was incorporated into phospholipids, as previously described (20De Schrijver E. Brusselmans K. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3799-3804PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zhou W. Simpson P.J. McFadden J.M. Townsend C.A. Medghalchi S.M. Vadlamudi A. Pinn M.L. Ronnett G.V. Kuhajda F.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7330-7337PubMed Google Scholar). BRCA1 down-regulation caused 2-14C-labeled acetate incorporation into phospholipids to significantly increase by ≈1.7-fold (p = 0.025, z = 1.96) (Fig. 1D). Free fatty acid synthesis was also largely increased with a clear significance (2.79 ± 0.48-fold, p = 0.023, z = 1.99), and triglyceride synthesis was increased by 1.59 ± 0.35 with a near limit significance (p = 0.075, z = 1.44). In contrast, no significant increase was found regarding the slight difference of cholesterol synthesis (1.3-fold, p = 0.25, z = 0.65). It is noteworthy that this slight difference of cholesterol synthesis fits in with recent studies reporting that ACCA RNAi slightly reduced the synthesis of cholesterol, whereas FAS RNAi did not (22Brusselmans K. De Schrijver E. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6719-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Taken together, our findings concerning different lipid species are in agreement with the above increase into total cellular lipids (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the fact that BRCA1 knockdown increased lipogenesis through fatty acid synthesis independently of cholesterol synthesis strongly sustains the notion that BRCA1 acts through modulation of lipogenesis. To verify that the increase in lipogenesis was not due to transcriptional up-regulation of lipid synthesis enzymes, we examined gene expression of proteins involved in lipogenesis. We first assessed expression of SREBP-1 transcription factor, a master regulator of lipogenesis (23Eberle D. Hegarty B. Bossard P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Measurement of SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c transcripts using real time RT-PCR showed a small difference in cells transfected with Si-BRCA1. Because this slight decrease was not significant (p = 0.11 and p = 0.19, respectively) and was not consistent with the increase of lipogenesis obtained in Si-BRCA1-transfected cells, it likely does not account for increase in lipogenesis (Fig. 1E). We then analyzed the expression of key lipogenic enzymes ACCA and FAS, both highly regulated by SREBP-1, and the downstream enzyme SCD-1, also SREBP-1-regulated. As expected, the amounts of ACCA, FAS, and SCD-1 mRNAs were not significantly modified by BRCA1 silencing (ACCA: p = 0.48; FAS: p = 0.08; SCD-1: p = 0.94) (Fig. 1E). Finally, because SREBP-1, FAS and SCD-1 are also regulated by LXR receptors, we analyzed expression of LXRα and LXRβ (24Li A.C. Glass C.K. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 2161-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). As anticipated, no significant difference was found regarding amounts of LXRα and LXRβ (Fig. 1E). We also examined the expression of ACCA and FAS proteins. Western blot analysis using anti-ACCA and anti-FAS antibodies showed that the expression of both proteins was not affected by BRCA1 silencing (Fig. 1F). Collectively these data show that the increase in lipogenesis was independent of transcriptional regulation. To further ascertain the role of BRCA1 in lipogenesis, MCF7 cells were transfected with expression plasmid encoding BRCA1 and were exposed to 2-14C-labeled acetate. In these cells, expression of BRCA1 protein was significantly increased to 250 ± 13% (mean ± S.E.; n = 3; p < 0.001) without affecting the amount of ACCA protein (Fig. 2, A and B). In these cells that overexpressed BRCA1, incorporation of 2-14C-labeled acetate into cellular lipids was significantly decreased to 51 ± 2% (mean ± S.E.; n = 5; p < 0.001) of the level in control cells (Fig. 2C). Therefore, overexpression of BRCA1 efficiently repressed lipogenesis, to the same extent as BRCA1 silencing increased it, thus confirming the role of BRCA1 in lipogenesis. We also analyzed the impact of RNAi-mediated gene silencing of BRCA1 on untransformed breast epithelial cells MCF10A. Similar to MCF7 cells, siRNA targeting of BRCA1 decreased the expression of BRCA1 mRNA and BRCA1 protein without affecting the expression of ACCA (Fig. 3, A and B); incorporation of 2-14C-labeled acetate into cellular lipids was significantly increased in comparison with the control cells (Fig. 3C). Altogether, these results show that down-regulation of BRCA1 induces an increase in cellular lipid synthesis independently of a transcriptional regulation and imply that endogenous BRCA1 negatively influences fatty acid synthesis. BRCA1 Associates with Phosphorylated ACCA—Our previous observations that BRCA1 interacts with ACCA (11Magnard C. Bachelier R. Vincent A. Jaquinod M. Kieffer S. Lenoir G.M. Venezia N.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6729-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) prompted us to further investigate how BRCA1 affects fatty acid synthesis through this interaction. It has been shown that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of ACCA cause its inactivation and activation, respectively, and serve as the short term regulation mechanism of the enzyme. More specifically, inactivation of ACCA is driven by AMPK-mediated phosphorylation on Ser (14Winder W.W. Wilson H.A. Hardie D.G. Rasmussen B.B. Hutber C.A. Call G.B. Clayton R.D. Conley L.M. Yoon S. Zhou B. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 82: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).79 Therefore, to explain how BRCA1 negatively modulates fatty acid synthesis, we tested whether BRCA1 associates with phosphorylated and inactive form of ACCA, namely P-ACCA. For this purpose, we used the P-ACCA(S79) antibody purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. To first ascertain the specificity of this antibody toward Ser79, we assayed it in Western blotting and immunoprecipitation assays. Western blotting experiments performed on Bosc cell lysates treated with λPPase that release phosphate groups from serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in proteins showed that this antibody did not recognize the dephosphorylated form of ACCA, unlike ACCAL3 antibody (Fig. 4A, left panel). In a more specific approach, Western blotting was performed on Bosc cells transfected with expression plasmid encoding the N-terminal moiety of ACCA (ACCA-N) or its form specifically mutated on Ser79 to Ala79 (ACCA-N-S79A). As expected, P-ACCA(S79) antibody did not detect the mutated N-terminal moiety of ACCA (ACCA-N-S79A), whereas it detected the wild-type ACCA-N. As control, ACCAL3 antibody detected both ACCA-N and ACCA-N-S79A forms (Fig. 4A, left panel). For immunoprecipitation experiments, the specificity of the antibody was checked using Bosc cells transfected as above. P-ACCA(S79) antibody immunoprecipitated only the nonmutated ACCA-N form, whereas ACCAL3 immunoprecipitated both forms (Fig. 4A, right panel). Therefore, the specificity of the P-ACCA(S79) antibody for phosphorylated form of ACCA on Ser79 was clearly demonstrated to support its use in the following experiments. To test whether BRCA1 associates with P-ACCA, two approaches were carried out. First, GST pull-down assays using a GST-BRCT fusion protein were performed on MCF7 cells. Western blotting analysis using the P-ACCA(S79) antibody clearly showed that the BRCA1 BRCT domains bound endogenous P-ACCA (Fig. 4B). Second, to determine whether BRCA1 interacts with P-ACCA in vivo, lysates prepared from Bosc cells transfected with expression plasmid encoding full-length BRCA1 were immunoprecipitated with P-ACCA(S79) antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4C, faint signals were obtained with the controls (a nonimmune serum and an assay performed in the absence of antibody) (lanes 2 and 3), in contrast to the marked signal obtained with P-ACCA(S79) antibody (lane 4). We ensured that the quantity of IgG used in each immunoprecipitation reaction was similar by performing Western blotting using secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody (lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, BRCA1 associated with endogenous P-ACCA in mammalian cells. In the reciprocal immunoprecipitation we could not detect P-ACCA in association with BRCA1, this was possibly due to a limited sensitivity of the P-AC-CA(S79) antibody. The bulk of these data demonstrate that ACCA phosphorylated at Ser79 interacts with the BRCT domains in vitro as well as with BRCA1 in vivo. Phosphorylation-dependent Interaction between BRCA1 and ACCA—To determine whether BRCA1 bound both P-ACCA and ACCA or only P-ACCA, GST pull-down assays were performed on MCF7 lysates that had first been treated with λPPase to dephosphorylate proteins. Western blot analysis using P-ACCA(S79) antibody revealed no P-ACCA in treated lysates, whereas the total amount of ACCA remained unchanged (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Furthermore, Western blot analysis of the GST pull-down using ACCAL3 antibody that detects both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of ACCA showed that λPPase treatment abolished the interaction between BRCA1 BRCT domains and ACCA (Fig. 5A, lower panel). Because λPPase treatment had no effect on the amount of ACCA, these results demonstrate that the BRCA1·ACCA interaction depends on the phosphorylation state of ACCA. We further investigated whether the amount of BRCA1·ACCA complexes was dependent on the quantity of cellular P-ACCA. It has been shown that several stresses that deplete cellular ATP activate AMPK, leading to phosphorylation and inactivation of ACCA. Similar effects are observed by incubation of cells with AICAR, which causes AMPK activation without affecting intracellular levels of AMP, ADP, or ATP (25Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Therefore, three different treatments were applied to MCF7 cells: mechanical harvesting in culture dish, 0.5 mm AICAR incubation for 1 h, or trypsination to induce low, moderate, or hyperphosphorylation of ACCA, respectively. In these conditions, cell lysates showed increasing amounts of P-ACCA without modification in the amount of ACCA (Fig. 5B, upper panel), and the amounts of BRCT·ACCA complexes correlated with the amount of P-ACCA present in the c"
https://openalex.org/W1998140525,"Different plasma membrane receptors are internalized through saturable/noncompetitive pathways, suggesting cargo-specific regulation. Here, we report that TTP (SH3BP4), a SH3-containing protein, specifically regulates the internalization of the transferrin receptor (TfR). TTP interacts with endocytic proteins, including clathrin, dynamin, and the TfR, and localizes selectively to TfR-containing coated-pits (CCP) and -vesicles (CCV). Overexpression of TTP specifically inhibits TfR internalization, and causes the formation of morphologically aberrant CCP, which are probably fission impaired. This effect is mediated by the SH3 of TTP, which can bind to dynamin, and it is rescued by overexpression of dynamin. Functional ablation of TTP causes a reduction in TfR internalization, and reduced cargo loading and size of TfR-CCV. Tyrosine phosphorylation of either TTP or dynamin prevents their interaction, pointing to a possible mechanism of exclusion of TTP from some CCP. Thus, TTP might represent one of the long sought for molecules that allow cargo-specific control of clathrin endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2012607933,"Somatic mutations induced by oxidative damage of DNA might play important roles in atherogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Myeloperoxidase, a heme protein expressed by select populations of artery wall macrophages, initiates one potentially mutagenic pathway by generating hypochlorous acid. This potent chlorinating agent reacts rapidly with primary amines to yield long-lived, selectively reactive <i>N</i>-chloramines. In the current studies, we demonstrate that myeloperoxidase produced by human macrophages differentiated in the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor generates 5-chlorouracil, a mutagenic thymine analog. The primary amine taurine fails to block the reaction, suggesting that <i>N</i>-haloamines produced by macrophages might oxidize uracil. Model system studies demonstrated that <i>N</i>-chloramines convert uracil to 5-chlorouracil. Interestingly, the tertiary amine nicotine dramatically enhances uracil chlorination, suggesting that cigarette smoke might promote nucleobase oxidation by <i>N</i>-chloramines. To look for evidence that myeloperoxidase promotes uracil oxidation <i>in vivo</i>, we measured 5-chlorouracil levels in human aortic tissue, using isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The level of 5-chlorouracil was 10-fold higher in atherosclerotic aortic tissue obtained during vascular surgery than in normal aortic tissue, suggesting that halogenated nucleobases produced by macrophages might contribute to atherogenesis. Because 5-chlorouracil can be incorporated into nuclear DNA, our observations raise the possibility that halogenation reactions initiated by phagocytes provide one pathway for mutagenesis, phenotypic modulation, and cytotoxicity during atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1989718073,"The vaccinia virus E9 protein, the catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme, is inherently distributive under physiological conditions, although infected cells contain a highly processive form of the enzyme. The viral A20 protein was previously characterized as a stoichiometric component of the processivity factor, and an interaction between A20 and E9 was documented in vivo. A20 has been shown to interact with D4, the virally encoded uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), by yeast-two hybrid and in vitro analysis. Here we confirm that UDG and A20 interact in vivo and show that temperature-sensitive viruses with lesions in the D4R gene show a profound defect in DNA synthesis at the non-permissive temperature. Moreover, cytoplasmic extracts prepared from these infections lack processive polymerase activity in vitro, implicating D4 in the assembly or activity of the processive polymerase. Upon overexpression of 3×FLAG-UDG, A20, and E9 in various combinations, we purified dimeric and trimeric UDG-A20 and UDG-A20-polymerase complexes, respectively. These complexes are stable in 750 mm NaCl and can be further purified by Mono Q chromatography. Notably, the trimeric complex displays robust processive polymerase activity, and the dimeric complex can confer processivity on purified E9. Consistent with previous reports that the catalytic activity of UDG is dispensable for virus replication in tissue culture, we find that the role of UDG role in the polymerase complex is not diminished by mutations targeting residues involved in uracil recognition or excision. Our cumulative data support the conclusion that A20 and UDG form a heterodimeric processivity factor that associates with E9 to comprise the processive polymerase holoenzyme.

Vaccinia virus, the prototypic orthopoxvirus, shows a significant degree of genetic autonomy from the host cell. Because all stages of the viral life cycle take place in the cytoplasm, vaccinia encodes most, if not all, of the factors involved in the replication of its 192-kb genome. The repertoire of essential replication functions appears to include: E9 (replicative DNA polymerase), A20 (stoichiometric component of the processivity factor), D5 (DNA-independent dNTPase), B1 (Ser/Thr protein kinase), I3 (single strand DNA-binding protein), A22 (Holliday junction resolvase), and D4 (uracil DNA glycosylase, UDG) 2The abbreviations used are: UDG, uracil DNA glycosylase; araC, arabinofuranosylcytosine; ts, temperature-sensitive; ORF, open reading frame; wt, wild type; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; pol, polymerase; IVTT, in vitro transcription-translation; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; RFII, replicative form II; hpi, hours post-infection; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; CMV, cytomegalovirus.

Other proteins implicated in the process of genome replication or maintenance include A50 (DNA ligase), H6 (topoisomerase), F2 (dUTPase), J2 (thymidine kinase), A48 (thymidylate kinase), and F4/I4 (ribonucleotide reductase) (reviewed in Refs. 2Beaud G.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 775-798Google Scholar). In most cases, a processive DNA polymerase comprises the core of the replication machinery. Processivity, which enables polymerases to replicate long templates rapidly and accurately, is not an intrinsic property of most polymerases but rather is conferred by accessory proteins. Indeed, the vaccinia virus E9 protein, which is the catalytic subunit of the polymerase, is inherently distributive under physiological conditions (4McDonald W.F. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31190-31197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our efforts to purify and characterize the vaccinia virus processivity factor, we described the identification of A20 as a stoichiometric component of the processivity factor (5Klemperer N. McDonald W. Boyle K. Unger B. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12298-12307Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A20 and E9 were shown to interact in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation, and overexpression of A20 and E9 led to a corresponding increase in processive polymerase activity as assayed in vitro. Additionally, temperature-sensitive (ts) viruses with targeted lesions in A20 had a DNA- phenotype in vivo (6Punjabi A. Boyle K. DeMasi J. Grubisha O. Unger B. Khanna M. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12308-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and extracts prepared from infected cells showed a defect in processive DNA synthesis in vitro (6Punjabi A. Boyle K. DeMasi J. Grubisha O. Unger B. Khanna M. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12308-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, reconstitution of the processive holoenzyme in vitro has been elusive, and we have considered the possibility that additional proteins might participate in this process. Uracil DNA glycosylase enzymes are ubiquitous in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and function as DNA repair enzymes by initiating the base excision repair pathway. They scan DNA and, upon encountering a dUMP residue generated by dUTP misincorporation or dCMP deamination, catalyze the excision of the uracil moiety. The vaccinia virus D4R gene, which encodes the viral UDG, is essential for replication in tissue culture, although the catalytic activity of the protein is dispensable (7De Silva F.S. Moss B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A role for the D4 protein (UDG) in DNA replication emerged from early studies of a ts mutant derived from the Dales collection (ts4149, now renamed Dts30) (8Millns A.K. Carpenter M.S. DeLange A.M. Virology. 1994; 198: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Upton C. Stuart D.T. McFadden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4518-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This tsD4 mutant showed a strong DNA- phenotype when infections were performed at the non-permissive temperature. In contrast, ongoing DNA replication appeared to be spared if Dts30 infections were initiated at the permissive temperature and shifted to the non-permissive temperature at 6 hpi (10Stuart D.T. Upton C. Higman M.A. Niles E.G. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore hypothesized that D4 might be a component of a multiprotein replication complex that would remain stable and functional if assembled at the permissive temperature. Support for this hypothesis emerged later with the observation that UDG shows a strong interaction with A20 in yeast two-hybrid analyses and in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments (11Ishii K. Moss B. Virology. 2002; 303: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12McCraith S. Holtzman T. Moss B. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4879-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The interaction of UDG with A20, and its apparent role in DNA replication, suggested that it might participate in the assembly of a processive polymerase holoenzyme. We therefore undertook further analysis of the role of UDG in vivo, its interaction with A20, and its contribution to polymerase function. These studies were aided by the availability of two ts mutants with lesions in the D4R gene, by our construction of a recombinant virus encoding epitope-tagged UDG at the endogenous locus, and by the overexpression and purification of epitope-tagged UDG alone or in the context of overexpressed A20 and/or E9. In sum, our data support the conclusion that A20 and UDG, along with E9, are necessary and sufficient components of the processive polymerase holoenzyme. African green monkey kidney BSC40 cells and human TK- 143 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7.5 was a gift from B. Moss (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); the temperature-sensitive viruses Dts27 and Dts30, from the Dales collection, were provided by R. Condit (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). The pTM1-3×FLAG plasmid, which enables the T7 RNA polymerase-mediated expression of N-terminally 3×FLAG-tagged proteins, has been previously described (13Punjabi A. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2171-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Viral stocks were prepared by ultracentrifugation of cytoplasmic lysates through 36% sucrose; titration was performed on confluent monolayers of BSC40 cells, which were stained with crystal violet at 48 hpi except where indicated. Arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC), pancreatic RNase, α-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, α-FLAG-agarose beads, and 3×FLAG peptide were purchased from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, Taq polymerase, and calf intestinal phosphatase were purchased from Roche Applied Science, whereas Geneticin (G418 sulfate) was purchased from Invitrogen. Protein molecular weight markers, 14C-labeled, were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and DNA molecular weight standards were purchased from Invitrogen. [32P]Orthophosphate and [35S]methionine were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Analytical Sciences, Inc. (Boston, MA). DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA). Protein standards were purchased from Invitrogen, and Escherichia coli SSB was acquired from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). A primed M13 template was prepared by annealing a 24-mer primer (5′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) to M13mp10 single-stranded DNA at a molar ratio of 20:1 (5Klemperer N. McDonald W. Boyle K. Unger B. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12298-12307Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Extracts of infected cells or eluates retrieved after affinity chromatography on agarose beads containing immobilized α-FLAG antibody were assayed in 25-μl reactions containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 40 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 8% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm MgCl2, 25 fmol of singly primed M13mp10 single-stranded DNA, 750 ng of E. coli SSB (10 pmol of tetramer), 60 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, and dATP, and 20 μm α-[32P]TTP (2400 cpm/pmol). Preparations containing purified vaccinia virus DNA polymerase (E9 protein, purified as described in Ref. 14McDonald W.F. Traktman P. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were added where indicated. As previously described, the 20-min primer extension reaction was initiated by adding dATP and [32P]TTP after a 3-min preincubation that was performed in the presence of only dCTP and dGTP (5Klemperer N. McDonald W. Boyle K. Unger B. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12298-12307Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS-40 mm EDTA and resolved on 0.8% agarose gels containing 0.125 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gels were cast and run in Tris borate-EDTA buffer; radiolabeled products were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated on a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The data were quantitated using ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences) and plotted using SigmaPlot (SSPS, Chicago, IL) software. Autoradiographic films were scanned and adjusted with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.) or Canvas 8.0 (Deneba Systems, Miami, FL.) software. Figures were labeled with Canvas 8.0. vvfUDG: Recombinant Virus in Which 3×FLAG-UDG Is Expressed from the Endogenous D4R Locus—For preparation of pUCneo-D3-3XFLAG-D4, a cassette comprised of the 3′ 300 bp of D3R, 66 bp encoding the 3×FLAG epitope, and the 5′ 300 bp of the D4R ORF was prepared by overlap PCR. One of the initial PCR reactions was performed with an upstream primer (A: 5′-CGGGATCCTATTCGTACAGGTACCTC-3′), which introduces a BamHI site (underlined) upstream of sequences derived from the 3′ region of the D3R gene and a downstream primer (5′-GATGTCATGATCTTTATAATCACCGTCATGGTCTTTGTAGTCCATTATATCAAATTAGATAC-3′), which contains 43 nucleotides from the 3×FLAG sequence (underlined) and anneals to the terminal 19 bp of D3R. A second reaction was performed with an upstream primer (5′-TATAAAGATCATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGAATTCAGTGACTGTATCA-3′) that also carries sequences derived from the 3×FLAG sequence (underlined) and anneals to the 5′ region of the D4R sequence, and a downstream primer (B: 5′-CGGGATCCCTTTATAATCAATTACTCCGG-3′) that introduces a unique BamHI site (underlined) downstream of sequences located within the D4R gene. The products derived from these two reactions overlap by 17 bp and were used together as the templates for a second round of PCR performed with the outside primers A and B. The 730-bp product generated in this reaction was digested with BamHI and ligated into pUCneo DNA that had been previously digested with BamHI and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. This plasmid also encodes the NEO gene under the regulation of a constitutive viral promoter (15Franke C.A. Rice C.M. Strauss J.H. Hruby D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 1918-1924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For generation of vvfUDG, the overall strategy was to replace the endogenous D4 locus with one encoding a 3XFLAG-tagged allele; this was accomplished using the plasmid described above and wt virus. Generation of the virus was achieved by transient dominant selection as described (6Punjabi A. Boyle K. DeMasi J. Grubisha O. Unger B. Khanna M. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12308-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16DeMasi J. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Grubisha O. Traktman P. J.

The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pTM-3×FLAG vector DNA that had been similarly digested and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. For generation of vT7fUDG, the overall strategy was to place the T7-driven 3XFLAG-UDG cassette within the non-essential TK locus of wt virus. Generation of this virus was achieved by selection of TK- viruses after transfecting wt-infected cells with the plasmid described above; the strategy followed has been previously described (13Punjabi A. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2171-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14McDonald W.F. Traktman P. Protein Expr.

Virol. 1987; 61: 3152-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). vvT7fUDG: Recombinant Virus Enabling T7 Polymerase-mediated Overexpression of 3×-FLAG-tagged Catalytically Null UDG—For generation of pTM-3XfUDG, two rounds of overlap PCR were used to introduce two mutations into the D4R ORF that render the UDG catalytically inactive (Gly202 → Ala and Ala542 → Thr). First, PCR was performed using the previously described upstream primer (UpD4), which places an NdeI site at the D4R initiation codon and a downstream primer (Down202A: 5′-ATACGGATTTATACCACACACAC-3′) that encodes the Cys202 → Thr substitution (underlined). A second PCR was performed using an upstream primer (Up202: 5′-GTGGTATAAATCCGTATCCGAAA-3′) that encodes the Gly202 → Ala (underlined) and the previously described downstream primer (DownD4) that places a BamHI site downstream of the D4R termination codon. The 225-bp and 469-bp products generated in these two PCR reactions overlap by 17 bp and were used together as the template for a second round of PCR, which was performed with the outside primers UpD4 and DownD4. This 675-bp product represented a variant of the complete D4R ORF containing an internal Gly202 → Ala substitution. This product was used as the template for a second round of overlap PCR designed to introduce the Ala542 → Thr mutation. The primer sets used for the introduction of this mutation were 1: UpD4 and Down542 (5′-CCGCTGGAAGATATCCCACTATG-3′; mutation underlined) and 2: Up524 (5′-GGGATATCTTCCAGCGGCTAGAG-3′; mutation underlined) with DownD4. The resulting products, which were of 130 and 562 bp in length and overlapped by 17 bp, were used together as the template for a final round of PCR performed with the outside primers UpD4 and DownD4. The final 675-bp product represented a variant of the complete D4R ORF containing both the Gly202 → Ala and Cys542 → Thr mutations. This product was digested with NdeI and BamH1 and cloned into pTM3×FLAG as described above. Isolation of vT7fUDG from cells infected with wt virus and transfected with pTM3xfUDG was performed as described above. pTM3×FLAG-fUDG⊗: Plasmid Enabling T7 Polymerase-mediated Overexpression of 3×-FLAG-tagged (Tyr70-Phe79-Asn120 → Ala) Mutant UDG—For generation of pTM-3XfUDG⊗, three rounds of overlap PCR were used to introduce three mutations into the D4R ORF that render the UDG unable to recognize and bind uracil (Tyr70-Phe79-Asn120 → Ala). First, PCR was performed using the previously described upstream primer (UpD4), which places an NdeI site at the D4R initiation codon and a downstream primer (DownT70A: 5′-GTTCCATCTTTCGGAGCCGGATCTA-3′) that encodes the substitution (underlined). A second PCR was performed using an upstream primer (UpY70A: 5′-TAGATCCGGCTCCGAAAGATGGAAC-3′) and the previously described downstream primer (DownD4) that places a BamHI site downstream of the D4R termination codon. The 230- and 445-bp products generated in these two PCR reactions overlap by 17 bp and were used together as the template for a second round of PCR, which was performed with the outside primers UpD4 and DownD4. This 675-bp product represented a variant of the complete D4R ORF containing an internal substitution that leads to the Tyr70 → Ala mutation. This product was used as the template for a second round of overlap PCR designed to introduce the Phe79 → Ala mutation. The primer sets used for the introduction of this mutation were 1: UpD4 and DownF79A (5′-AATTTGGTGATTCGGCCGGTACAC-3′; mutation underlined) and 2: UpF79A (5′-GTGTACCGGCCGAATCACCAAATT-3′; mutation underlined) with DownD4. The resulting products, which were of 250 and 430 bp in length and overlapped by 17 bp, were used together as the template for the overlap PCR performed with the outside primers UpD4 and DownD4. The final 675-bp product represented a variant of the complete D4R ORF containing both the Y70A and F79A mutations. The primer sets used to introduce the N120A mutation were 1: UpD4 and Down N120A (5′-CAACTTAAGTAATAAGCCCAGGGTA-3′; mutation underlined) and 2: DownD4 with UpN120A (5′-TACCCTGGGCTTATTACTTAAGTTG-3′; mutation underlined). The resulting products (375 and 300 bp, respectively) were used together as the template for the final round PCR using the two outside primers UpD4 and DownD4. This product was digested with NdeI and BamH1 and cloned into pTM3×FLAG as described above. Overexpression of fUDG, A20, and E9, singly and in combination, was achieved by co-infecting confluent monolayers of BSC40 cells with vTF7.5, which constitutively expresses the T7 polymerase, and vT7fUDG, vT7A20, and/or vT7pol (each at m.o.i. 2) as appropriate (5Klemperer N. McDonald W. Boyle K. Unger B. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12298-12307Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14McDonald W.F. Traktman P. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Infections were initiated at 37 °C and shifted to 31.5 °C at 4 hpi to increase the yield of soluble protein. Cells were harvested at 24 hpi and solubilized in FLAG-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100; 1 ml/107 cells). Lysates were clarified by low speed centrifugation (800 × g, 10 min); lysates that were assayed directly for processive polymerase activity were subjected to further clarification by sedimentation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Affinity purification of fUDG was performed on agarose beads containing immobilized α-FLAG antibody (∼20 μl of packed beads/107 cells). Non-specifically bound proteins were removed by 3 washes with FLAG-TBS buffer (fTBS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl). Where indicated, the beads were incubated with FLAG-TBS buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl, and finally fUDG and any associated proteins were eluted by the subsequent application of 3×FLAG peptide (150 ng/μl). Aliquots were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were either visualized by silver-staining or transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to immunoblot analysis as indicated. In some cases, the fUDG-A20-pol complex was further purified from excess free fUDG by anion exchange chromatography. Approximately 25 μg of the fUDG-A20-pol protein complex purified on α-FLAG beads as described above was diluted in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) before being applied to a 1-ml Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with buffer A and then developed with a 10-ml linear gradient of 150-1000 mm NaCl. The trimeric complex was retrieved in three fractions containing 550-590 mm NaCl. Aliquots were stored in 15% glycerol at -20 °C. The plasmids pTM-3xfUDG, pTM-A20 (5Klemperer N. McDonald W. Boyle K. Unger B. Traktman P. J.

To construct the plasmids pTM-3xfUDGts27 and pTM-3xfUDGts30, the previously described UpD4 and DownD4 primers were used to amplify the D4R ORFs from the genomes of Dts27 and Dts30; the products were digested with NdeI and BamH1 and ligated to similarly digested pTM3×FLAG DNA. The products of IVTT reactions were either analyzed directly or diluted in FLAG-lysis buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with α-FLAG-agarose beads. IVTT products and immunoprecipitates were fractionated on 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography or by quantitative PhosphorImager analysis. Cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol). Blots were incubated with α-FLAG M2 according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Sigma) or with α-A20 (5Klemperer N. McDonald W. Boyle K. Unger B. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12298-12307Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or α-D5 sera (1:500 dilution) and subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:20,000) (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using Pierce Super Signal reagents. To monitor the temporal expression of fUDG, confluent monolayers of BSC40 cells were infected with vvfUDG (m.o.i. 15); controls were left uninfected or infected with wt virus. At the times indicated, cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and labeled for 45 min with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine containing [35S]methionine at 100 μCi/ml. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of 1× phospholysis buffer lacking sodium deoxycolate (0.1 m NaPO4 (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 ml/3 × 106 cells). Clarified lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal α-FLAG M2 antibody; immunoprecipitates were retrieved on protein A-Sepharose beads, resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography and/or immunoblot analysis. 35-mm dishes of BSC40 cells were infected with Dts27 or Dts30 at an m.o.i. of 0.03 and incubated at 31.5 °C. At 4 hpi, cells were transfected with 3.5 μg of linearized plasmid DNA preparations containing no insert, the D4R ORF, or the genomic HindIII D fragment. At 7 hpi, cultures were shifted to 39.7 °C; cells were harvested at 48 hpi, and the yield of temperature-insensitive virus was determined by titration at 39.7 °C. Confluent 35 mm-diameter dishes of BSC40 cells were infected with vfUDG, Dts27, or Dts30 (m.o.i. 2) and incubated at 31.5 or 39.7 °C. At 24 hpi cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 mm Tris, pH 9. Viral yields were determined by titration at 31.5 °C. 35-mm diameter dishes of BSC40 cells were infected with either vfUDG, Dts27, or Dts30 (m.o.i. of 2) and were maintained at 31.5 or 39.7 °C. At 3, 6, 9, and 24 hpi, cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in loading buffer (10× SSC (1× is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate)/1 m ammonium acetate). 25-μl aliquots of each sample were applied to a Zeta probe membrane using a Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (both from Bio-Rad). Samples were denatured (with 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m NaOH) and washed twice in situ (with 10×SSC). The membrane was hybridized to a 32P-labeled probe representing the genomic HindIII E and F fragments. Data were analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis. Purification of the E9 protein, the catalytic polymerase, was described previously using the hybrid vaccinia T7 system (14McDonald W.F. Traktman P. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In brief, overexpression of DNA polymerase was achieved by co-infecting BSC40 cells with vTF7.5 and vT7pol (each at m.o.i. = 2). Infections were initiated at 37 °C and shifted to 31.5 °C at 4 hpi to increase the yield of soluble protein. Cells were harvested at 24 hpi, and clarified cytoplasmic lysates were fractionated sequentially on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, hydroxyapatite, and heparin-agarose. Enzymatic activity of the purified DNA polymerase was assayed using an activated salmon sperm DNA template; protein concentration was determined by digital evaluation of silver-stained gels. Several lines of evidence have confirmed that the vaccinia virus A20 protein plays an essential role as a stoichiometric component of the processive form of the viral DNA polymerase (5Klemperer N. McDonald W. Boyle K. Unger B. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12298-12307Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Punjabi A. Boyle K. DeMasi J. Grubisha O. Unger B. Khanna M. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12308-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, confirmation that A20 is the bona fide processivity factor has been hampered by our inability to express and purify soluble A20 for the purpose of reconstituting the processive polymerase holoenzyme in vitro. We reasoned that A20 might require an additional protein partner for solubility; indeed, a strong interaction between A20 and D4, the viral uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), has been demonstrated through the use of yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down analyses (11Ishii"

It is a multisubunit enzyme composed of membrane-bound flavocytochromeb558 as well as cytosolic components, including p47phox, which is essential for assembly of the complex. When phagocytes are activated, the cytosolic components of the NADPH oxidase translocate to flavocytochrome b558 due to binding of the tandem Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of p47phox to a proline-rich region in p22phox, a subunit of flavocytochrome b558. Using NMR titration, we first identified the proline-rich region of p22phox that is essential for binding to the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox. We subsequently determined the solution structure of the p47phox tandem SH3 domains complexed with the proline-rich peptide of p22phox using NMR spectroscopy. In contrast to the intertwined dimer reported for the crystal state, the solution structure is a monomer. The central region of the p22phox peptide forms a polyproline type II helix that is sandwiched by the N- and C-terminal SH3 domains, as was observed in the crystal structure, whereas the C-terminal region of the peptide takes on a short α-helical conformation that provides an additional binding site with the N-terminal SH3 domain. Thus, the C-terminal α-helical region of the p22phox peptide increases the binding affinity for the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox more than 10-fold.

NADPH oxidase plays a crucial role in the killing of invading microbes by neutrophils and other phagocytic cells by reducing oxygen to superoxide anion using NADPH as an electron donor. NADPH oxidase is composed of the membrane-bound flavocytochromeb558, a heterodimer of gp91phox and p22phox and four cytosolic regulatory components, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac (1Nauseef W.M.

Upon activation of the cell, the p47phox-p67phox-p40phox complex is relocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where it associates with flavocytochrome b558, forming an active NADPH oxidase complex. The interaction between p47phox and p22phox plays a critical role in the formation of this complex (7Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc.

The membrane-bound protein p22phox also contains a PRR in its C-terminal cytosolic region. In the resting state, the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox are masked by an intramolecular interaction with the PBR/AIR, which maintains the enzyme in an inactive form (10Dahan I. Issaeva I.

Upon cell stimulation, some serine residues in the PBR/AIR domain of p47phox are phosphorylated by a specific kinase, which induces a conformational change. This leads to changes in intramolecular interactions (13El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14El Benna J. Faust L.P.

The p47phox-p22phox interaction is thought to be essential for activation of NADPH oxidase because p22phox mutants incapable of this interaction cause severe chronic granulomatous disease in humans (17Roos D. van Bruggen R. Meischl C. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Dinauer M.C. Orkin S.H. Annu. Rev.

Cross A.R. Curnutte J.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We and another group (21Groemping Y. Lapouge K. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Cell. 2003; 113: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 22Yuzawa S. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) recently reported a crystal structure of the tandem SH3 domains in the autoinhibited form of p47phox. The tandem SH3 domains form an intertwined dimer in which the distal loop of the N-terminal SH3 domain serves as a hinge. Both crystal structures suggested that the autoinhibited form is a globular module that is split in half by the hinge region. However, we found that p47phox exists in solution not as a dimer but rather as a monomer that is similar in structure to this globular module (23Yuzawa S. Ogura K. Horiuchi M. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Kataoka M. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29752-29760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, the globular module rather than the intertwined dimer is thought to be the physiologically relevant structure. The crystal structure of the activated form of the tandem SH3 domains was also reported (21Groemping Y. Lapouge K. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Cell. 2003; 113: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), but it again showed an intertwined dimer. This prompted us to use small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to examine the solution structure of the tandem SH3 domains complexed with the PRR of p22phox as a model of the activated form of p47phox. The results presented here should help clarify the mechanism by which NADPH oxidase is activated. Sample Preparation—phoxA truncated form of human p47phox containing residues 151-286 (p47phox-(151-286)), which corresponds to the tandam SH3 domains without the PBR/AIR, was prepared as described previously (23Yuzawa S.

The p47phox-(151-286) protein was purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 149-162 and 149-168 of human p22phox (p22phox-(149-162) and p22phox-(149-168), respectively) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant p22phox-(149-168) was cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) to produce a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The cells were disrupted by sonication at 4 °C in 25 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The lysate was first applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4, and then eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 25 mm reduced glutathione. The GST tag was removed by incubation for 12 h at 4 °C with PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences). Next, p22phox-(149-168) was purified by reverse-phase chromatography on a Poros R2/M column (PerSeptive Biosystems) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (1-90%) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The recombinant p22phox-(149-168) contains five additional N-terminal residues derived from the protease cleavage site (GPLGS). Small Angle X-ray Scattering—SAXS data were collected for p47phox-(151-286) in the presence and absence of p22phox-(149-168). The concentration of the proteins was varied from 2 to 16 mg/ml to assess the effects of the protein concentration on the structural parameters. All measurements were made using a SAXS diffractometer in the BL-10C Beamline at the Photon Factory in Tukuba, Japan (25Ueki T. Hiragi Y. Kataoka M. Inoko Y. Amemiya Y. Izumi Y. Tagawa H. Muroga Y.

The data acquisition time was 300 s for each measurement. Scattering by the protein was determined by subtracting scattering for the solvent (buffer alone) from the scattering for the protein solution. The scattering data were first analyzed using the Guinier approximation I(Q) = I(0) exp(-Rg2Q2/3), where Q is the momentum transfer, Rg is the radius of gyration, and I(0) is the intensity at a zero scattering angle (27Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-ray. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1955Google Scholar). Q was calculated from the following relationship: Q = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ and λ are the scattering angle and wavelength of the X-rays, respectively. I(0) and Rg were calculated from the linear regression intercept and slope (-Rg2/3), respectively, from Guinier plots in the range of Q × Rg < 1.8 (26Kataoka M. Head J.F. Seaton B.A. Engelman D.M.

The relative molecular weight of the scattering species was estimated using I(0), obtained from the scattering data for bovine carbonic anhydrase (Sigma-Aldrich), a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 29 kDa. The distance distribution function, P(r), defined as P(r) = 1/2π2∫I(Q)Qr sin(Qr) dQ, corresponds to the distribution of the distance, r, between the volume elements. P(r) was calculated by indirect Fourier transformation using the GNOM program (29Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2965) Google Scholar). The Q values used for the P(r) analysis were between 0.03 and 0.19 Å-1. The Rg value, calculated from Rg2 = ∫r2P(r) dr/(2∫P(r)dr), was estimated from the distance distribution function, P(r). Dmax was the maximum dimension. Structural parameters were derived using both Guinier analysis and the distance distribution function, P(r). Fluorescence Titration—The binding affinity of p22phox peptides for p47phox-(151-286) was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy using a Shimadzu RF-5300PC fluorometer (excitation at 295 nm and emission at 330 nm). Aliquots of synthetic p22phox peptides were incubated for 2 h with 3.0 μm p47phox-(151-286) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. All measurements were performed at 25 °C. Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) assuming a simple bimolecular association. NMR Spectroscopy—Protein samples were dialyzed against 25 mmsodium phosphate buffer in 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5. The dialysate was adjusted to 5% D2O (v/v), resulting in a protein concentration of ∼0.8 mm. NMR measurements were carried out at 25 °C on Unity Inova 800 or 600 spectrometers (Varian), each equipped with three radiofrequency channels and a triple resonance pulsed field gradient probe. A steady-state heteronuclear{1H}-15N NOE (hetNOE) experiment (30Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E.

The hetNOE data were analyzed using NMRView software (One Moon Scientific).

One-bond 1H-15N coupling constants were measured on a Unity Inova 800 spectrometer at 25 °C using two-dimensional 1H-15N IPAP-HSQC spectra (38Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 39Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The RDC values were determined by comparing the spectra of the sample in the isotropic medium with those in the weakly oriented medium, which ranged from -17 Hz to +16 Hz. Analysis of the powder pattern of dipolar couplings revealed an axial component of the 1DNH alignment tensor of -8.5 Hz and a rhombicity of 0.4. The dipolar coupling restraints were not included in structural calculations for residues having hetNOE values less than 0.7, suggesting an appreciable amide-bond vector reorientation on a subnanosecond time scale. Structure Calculation—The cross-peak intensities on the NOESY spectra were integrated and partially assigned using NMRDraw (36Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11554) Google Scholar). The NOE data, along with a table of chemical shifts, were used as an input to ARIA 1.2 (40Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) implemented in CNS 1.1 (41Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

A total of 48 ϕ and 48 ψ torsion angle restraints were predicted by the TALOS program (42Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). The 24 distance restraints for hydrogen bonds were incorporated based on the characteristic NOE patterns. The RDC restraints were used for each iteration of ARIA. The calculations were performed starting from random templates, using the standard parameters of ARIA. The restraints used for the structural calculations are summarized in Table 1. The structural calculations in combination with iterative NOE peak assignments were performed in nine cycles, and a total of 100 structures were finally obtained. The mean structure (referred as the final structure) was obtained by averaging the coordinates of the 20 lowest energy structures. The Ramachandran plot of the final structure was analyzed using the Procheck-NMR program (43Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

Open table in a new tab In Vitro Pull-down Binding Assays—Mutations in the cDNA fragments of p47phox-(151-286) and p22phox-(132-195) leading to the indicated amino acid substitutions were introduced by PCR-mediated, site-directed mutagenesis. All of the constructs were sequenced for confirmation of their identities. The PCR products were ligated to the following vectors: pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) for the generation of GST fusion proteins; or pMALc2 (New England Biolabs) for the generation of maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins. GST- or MBP-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli strain DH5 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) or amylose resin (New England Biolabs), respectively, according to the manufacturers' protocols. For in vitro pull-down binding assays, a GST and an MBP fusion protein (5 μg each) were mixed in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. To pull down the GST fusion protein, a slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS, the GST fusion protein and associated proteins were eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm glutathione. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, after which the proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Identification of the Region of p22phox Essential for p47phox Binding—Based on an in vitro overlay binding assay, the region containing residues 151-160 of p22phox (p22phox-(151-160)) was initially proposed as a core region essential for the binding of p47phox (7Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In contrast, Dahan et al. (10Dahan I. Issaeva I. Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Hirshberg M. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8421-8432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed that its C-terminal flanking region enhanced the interaction with p47phox. Groemping et al. (21Groemping Y. Lapouge K. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Cell. 2003; 113: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) used a peptide corresponding to residues 149-166 of p22phox (p22phox-(149-166), which has a higher binding affinity than p22phox-(151-160), in a crystallographic study of the activated form of p47phox. The crystal structure indicated that the tandem SH3 domains form an intertwined dimer with p22phox-(149-166) Furthermore, because an electron density was observed only for residues 151-160 of p22phox-(149-166), the contribution of non-core regions to binding has remained elusive. Therefore, in the current studies, we used NMR spectroscopy to examine the solution structure of the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox complexed with the p22phox peptide. To identify the region of p22phox essential for p47phox binding in solution, we performed NMR titration experiments using two synthetic peptides, p22phox-(149-162) and p22phox-(149-168). Aliquots of each peptide solution were added to the sample solution of the 15N-labeled tandem SH3 domains of p47phox, and the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were analyzed (Fig. 1). We found that many of the signals decreased and finally disappeared as the concentration of p22phox-(149-162) increased (Fig. 1a). Notably, three of five tryptophan signals disappeared, leaving only two observed signals (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 1a). This shows that a structural change occurs in the tandem SH3 domains upon complex formation. This produces an intermediate slow-exchange limit in the NMR spectra so that some signals cannot be observed because of exchange broadening. In contrast, an increase in concentration of p22phox-(149-168) caused changes in the chemical shifts for a number of resonances (Fig. 1b). In particular, all five tryptophan signals (indicated by asterisks in Fig 1b), which consist of two Trp residues in the N- terminal SH3 domain and three Trp residues in the C-terminal SH3 domain, showed significant changes in their chemical shifts during titration with p22phox-(149-168), indicating that p22phox-(149-168) stably interacts with both SH3 domains. The Kd values for complex formation between p47phox-(151-286) and the two p22phox peptides were subsequently determined by fluorescence titration method. The fluorescence data gave Kd values of 8.67 μm for p22phox-(149-162) and 0.64 μm for p22phox-(149-168), respectively (Fig. 1, c and d), indicating that residues 163-168 of p22phox enhance the binding affinity of p22phox for p47phox by more than 10-fold. Comparison of the Molecular Dimensions of p47phox-(151-286) in the Presence and Absence of p22phox-(149-168) Using SAXS—We next used SAXS to determine the molecular masses and dimensions of free and complexed p47phox-(151-286). Guinier analysis (27Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-ray. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1955Google Scholar) showed that the molecular masses of the tandem SH3 domains in both forms were 15 and 18 kDa, respectively (data not shown). We therefore concluded that p47phox-(151-286) exists as a monomer in solution, regardless of whether it is free or in a complex. Next, we calculated the distance distribution function, P(r), for p47phox-(151-286) from a set of scattering data using indirect Fourier transformation (29Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2965) Google Scholar). The peptide-free form showed a curve with a peak top located at ∼25 Å and a skirt of distribution extending up to 80 Å (Fig. 2a), suggesting a relatively elongated structure. In contrast, the P(r) for the complex showed a peak at ∼20 Å and a skirt extending up to 60 Å (Fig. 2b). From these findings, we concluded that p47phox-(151-286) has a compact globular structure when complexed with p22phox-(149-168), whereas the peptide-free form has an extended structure. Consistent with the P(r) analysis, Guinier analysis determined that the radius of gyration is 25.3 Å for the free form and 19.5 Å for the complex form. Comparison of Backbone Dynamics for p47phox-(151-286) in the Presence and Absence of p22phox-(149-168)—To characterize the dynamics of p47phox-(151-286), we measured the hetNOE spectra of the free and complexed forms. To assign backbone resonances for the tandem SH3 domains, we first performed a series of NMR experiments using 0.3 mm 13C/15N-labeled protein in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 25 °C in the presence or absence of p22phox-(149-168). More than 92% (excluding proline) of the resonances could be assigned, and the 1H-15N backb"

We purified and characterized l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.46), catalyzing the conversion of l-arabinose to l-arabino-γ-lactone as an enzyme responsible for the first step of this alternative pathway of l-arabinose metabolism. The purified enzyme preferred NADP+ to NAD+ as a coenzyme. Kinetic analysis revealed that the enzyme had high catalytic efficiency for both l-arabinose and d-galactose. The gene encoding l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase was cloned using a partial peptide sequence of the purified enzyme and was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fully active enzyme. The enzyme consists of 308 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 33,663.92 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence had some similarity to glucose-fructose oxidoreductase, d-xylose 1-dehydrogenase, and d-galactose 1-dehydrogenase. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the enzyme possesses unique catalytic amino acid residues. Northern blot analysis showed that this gene was induced by l-arabinose but not by d-galactose. Furthermore, a disruptant of the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene did not grow on l-arabinose but grew on d-galactose at the same growth rate as the wild-type strain. There was a partial gene for l-arabinose transport in the flanking region of the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene. These results indicated that the enzyme is involved in the metabolism of l-arabinose but not d-galactose.

These results indicated that the enzyme is involved in the metabolism of l-arabinose but not d-galactose. This is the first identification of a gene involved in an alternative pathway of l-arabinose metabolism in bacterium. l-Arabinose is a major constituent of some plant materials (1Zaldivar J. Nielsen J. Olsson L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), and l-arabinose catabolism is therefore relevant for microorganisms using plant material as a carbon source. The metabolic pathway from l-arabinose to d-xylulose 5-phosphate in bacterium (Fig. 1A) has been investigated extensively. Many bacteria, including Escherichia coli, depend on protein products of the araBAD operon, which contains araB (ribulokinase, EC 2.7.1.16), araA (l-arabinose isomerase, EC 5.3.1.4), and araD (l-ribulose-phosphate 4-epimerase, EC 5.1.3.4) to convert l-arabinose to d-xylulose 5-phosphate through l-ribulose and l-ribulose 5-phosphate (2Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1988: 805-807Google Scholar). Richard et al. (3Richard P. Londesborough J. Putkonen M. Kalkkinen N. Penttila M. J. Biol.

In this pathway, NAD(P)H-dependent aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21) produces l-arabinitol; l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.12) produces l-xylulose; l-xylulose reductase (EC 1.1.1.10) produces d-xylitol; and d-xylulose reductase (EC 1.1.1.9) produces d-xylulose. d-Xylulose is then phosphorylated by xylulokinase (EC 2.7.1.17) to yield d-xylulose 5-phosphate. It is believed that there are two alternative pathways for bacterial l-arabinose metabolism, which do not involve a phosphorylation reaction, in contrast to the known bacterial and fungal pathways (6Welmberg R. Doudoroff M. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 607-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Welmberg R. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 629-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dagley S.

In the first pathway, l-arabinose is oxidized to l-arabino-γ-lactone by NAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenase. The lactone is cleaved by a lactonase to l-arabonate, followed by two successive dehydration reactions forming l-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate (l-KDA) 2The abbreviations used are: l-KDA, l-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate; GDH, glucose 1-dehydrogenase; ED pathway, Entner-Doudoroff pathway; GFOR, glucose-fructose oxidoreductase; CNBr, cyanogen bromide; DD, dihydrodiol dehydrogenase; ZmGFOR, GFOR from Z. mobilis; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; LmG6PDH, G6PDH from L. mesenteroides; CAPS, cyclohexylaminopropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ORF, open reading frame; ABC, ATP-binding cassette. 2The abbreviations used are: l-KDA, l-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate; GDH, glucose 1-dehydrogenase; ED pathway, Entner-Doudoroff pathway; GFOR, glucose-fructose oxidoreductase; CNBr, cyanogen bromide; DD, dihydrodiol dehydrogenase; ZmGFOR, GFOR from Z. mobilis; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; LmG6PDH, G6PDH from L. mesenteroides; CAPS, cyclohexylaminopropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ORF, open reading frame; ABC, ATP-binding cassette. and α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde. The last step is the NAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenation of the semialdehyde to α-ketoglutaric acid. The second pathway has the same initial three steps, but l-KDA is cleaved through an aldolase reaction to glycoaldehyde and pyruvate. No gene-encoding enzyme involved in these alternative pathways of l-arabinose metabolism has been identified so far. Dehydrogenases for d-arabinose, d-glucose, d-xylose, and d-galactose are known in many organisms. d-Arabinose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.117) is involved in the biosynthesis of d-erythroascorbic acid (15Kim S.T. Huh W.K. Lee B.H. Kang S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1429: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Glucose 1-dehydrogenase (GDH) is classified into two types, pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone-dependent GDH (EC 1.1.5.2) and NAD(P)-dependent GDH. According to primary structure analysis, these GDH types are not related. NAD(P)-dependent GDH is further classified into two different protein families (16Edwards K.J. Barton J.D. Rossjohn J. Thorn J.M. Taylor G.L. Ollis D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One GDH (EC 1.1.118 (119)) belongs to a medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, which contains an active zinc ion (17Lamble H.J. Heyer N.I. Bull S.D. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. J. Biol.

GFOR belongs to the Gfo/Idh/MocA family, which also contains d-xylose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.175 (179)) and d-galactose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.48 (120)) (21Johnsen U. Schonheit P. J.

It is interesting that enzymes of the nonphosphorylative ED pathway are used for the metabolism of both d-glucose and d-galactose in archaeal Sulfolobus solfataricus (17Lamble H.J. Heyer N.I.

In this study, we focused on a proposed NAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenase that converts l-arabinose to l-arabino-γ-lactone (referred to as l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.46) (Fig. 1C). It has been reported that Azospirillum brasiliense, a bacterium used in this study, can grow on l-arabinose as a sole carbon source and has the first alternative pathway of l-arabinose metabolism (13Novick N.J. Tyler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 364-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is the first enzymological and molecular biological analysis of the proposed pathway of l-arabinose metabolism. Bacterial Strain, Culture Conditions, and Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—A. brasiliense ATCC29145 was purchased from RIKEN BioResource Center (Saitama, Japan) and cultured aerobically with vigorously shaking at 30 °C for 24 h in a minimal medium (13Novick N.J. Tyler M.E. J.

The grown cells were harvested by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min, washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (referred to as Buffer A), and stored at -35 °C until used. The washed cells were suspended in Buffer A, disrupted by sonication for 20 min with appropriate intervals on ice using ASTRASON® Ultrasonic Liquid Processor XL2020 (Misonix Inc., New York), and then centrifuged at 108,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain cell-free extracts. PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE was performed by omitting SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol from the solution used in SDS-PAGE. Proteins on the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 7.5% (v/v) acetic acid in 25% methanol. Enzyme Activity Assay—l-Arabinose 1-dehydrogenase activity was assayed routinely in the direction of l-arabinose oxidation by measuring the reduction of NAD(P)+ at 340 nm at 30 °C using Jasco spectrophotometer model V-550 (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The standard assay mixture contained 10 mm l-arabinose in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 mm NAD(P)+ solution (100 μl) with a final reaction volume of 1 ml. The kinetic parameters, Km and kcat values, were calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plot. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Zymogram Staining Analysis—The cell-free extracts or purified enzyme were separated on nondenaturing PAGE with 12% gel at 4 °C. The gels were then soaked in 10 ml of staining solution (31Gennady P.M. Handbook of Detection of Enzymes on Electrophoretic Gels. 2nd Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2002: 27-33Google Scholar) consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 100 mm l-arabinose, 0.25 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.06 mm phenazine methosulfate, and 1 mm NAD(P)+ at room temperature for 15 min. The dehydrogenase activity appeared as a dark band. Purification of l-Arabinose 1-Dehydrogenase—All purification steps were performed below 4 °C. The cell-free extracts were fractionated between 50 and 60% saturation of (NH4)2SO4. The precipitate was dissolved in a small volume of Buffer A, and the solution was then dialyzed against a large volume of Buffer A containing 1.3 m (NH4)2SO4 overnight. All chromatography was carried out using an ΔKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). After insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a HiPrep 16/10 Butyl FF column (1.6 × 10 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 1.3 m (NH4)2SO4 and washed with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted using a reversed linear gradient of 1.3–0 m (NH4)2SO4 in Buffer A (300 ml). The fractions with high enzymatic activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against a large volume of Buffer A. The enzyme solution was loaded onto a column of HiPrep 16/10 Q FF (1.6 × 10 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A and washed thoroughly with the same buffer. The column was developed with 300 ml of linear gradient 0–1 m NaCl in Buffer A. The fractions containing l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase activity were combined and dialyzed against a large volume of 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (referred to as Buffer B) overnight. The enzyme solution was applied to a column of Ceramic Hydroxyapatite Type I (1.6 × 5 cm, Bio-Rad), equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed thoroughly with the same buffer and developed with 200 ml of linear gradient 0.005–0.5 m potassium phosphate in Buffer B. The fractions with high enzymatic activity were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centriplus YM-30 (Millipore) at 18,000 × g for ∼2 h. The enzyme solution was loaded onto a column of HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column (1.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and re-loaded onto the same column. Proteins in the fractions containing high activity l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing a single protein were collected, concentrated, dialyzed against Buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), containing 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm l-arabinose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol), and stored at -35 °C until used. The native molecular mass of l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase was estimated by gel filtration. The purified enzyme was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. High and low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences) were used as molecular markers. Product Identification by HPLC—The product of the dehydrogenation reaction of l-arabinose was identified by HPLC with a Multistation LC-8020 model II system (Tosoh). l-Arabino-γ-lactone was chemically synthesized with boiling potassium arabonate in 0.2 m HCl for 5 min. Potassium arabonate was prepared by the hypoiodite-in-methanol oxidization of l-arabinose (32Moore S. Link K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1940; 133: 293-311Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). A solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 10 mm l-arabinose, 10 mm NADP+, and the purified enzyme (10 μg) was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and 100 μl of this solution was then analyzed. Samples were applied at 30 °C into an Aminex HPX-87H Organic Analysis column (300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad) linked to an RID-8020 refractive index detector (Tosoh) and eluted with 5 mm H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Determination of N-terminal and Internal Amino Acid Sequences—To determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence of l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase, the purified enzyme was separated by SDS-PAGE with 12% (w/v) gel, and then transferred to Hybond™-P (Amersham Biosciences) at 3 mA/cm2 for 0.5 h in a transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS (pH 11) containing 10% (v/v) methanol) with a horizontal electrophoretic blotting system (model AE-7500, Atto). After staining and destaining the protein, an area of the membrane corresponding to the protein band of l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase was excised and analyzed with a Procise™ 492 HT protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Chemical digestion with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) was carried out to determine internal amino acid sequences (33Gross E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 238-255Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The purified l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase (100 μg) was dialyzed overnight against deionized water and lyophilized. The enzyme protein was digested chemically at room temperature in 70% (v/v) formic acid containing 1% (w/v) CNBr (100 μl) in the dark and under N2 overnight. The solution was diluted with 900 μl of deionized water, frozen with liquid N2, and lyophilized. The sample was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), containing 5% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and separated by SDS-PAGE with 18% (w/v) gel. Peptide fragments on the gel were transferred to a Hybond™-P membrane as described above. After staining and destaining, areas of the membrane corresponding to the two peptide fragments from the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase (see in Fig. 2B) were excised and sequenced. Cloning of l-Arabinose 1-Dehydrogenase Gene—The N-terminal and internal peptide sequences were used to design PCR primers for amplification of a partial DNA fragment of the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene. Eight upstream primers (U1–U8, 26-mer) were designed from (M)SDQVSLGV, the N-terminal amino acid sequence, as follows: 5′-ATG(TCN/AGY)GAYCARGTN(TCN/AGY) (CTN/TTR)GGNGT-3′. Two downstream primers (D1 and D2, 26-mer) were designed from the internal amino acid sequence (M)LEKPPGAT, as follows: 5′-GTNGCNCCNGGNGGYTTYTC(NAG/YAA)CAT-3′. A. brasiliense genomic DNA was prepared using a DNeasy™ tissue kit (Qiagen). PCR was carried out using a PCR Thermal Cycler-Personal (Takara) for 30 cycles in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 10 pmol of primers, 1.25 units of Ex Taq® DNA polymerase (Takara), and 300 ng of A. brasiliense genomic DNA under the following conditions: denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, each for 30 cycles. Based on the results of genomic PCR using each set of primers, U6 and D1 were chosen for cloning. The sequences of U6 and D1 were 5′-ATGAGYGAYCARGTNTCNTTRGGNGT-3′ and 5′-GTNGCNCCNGGNGGYTTYTCNAGCAT-3′, respectively. A single PCR product with a length of ∼300 bp was purified, cloned into a pGEM®-T vector (Promega) (referred to as pGEM1), and sequenced using a Dual CyDye™ terminator sequencing kit (Veritas) and appropriate primers with Long-Read Tower, UBC DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). The inserted fragment was amplified with U6 and D1 primers and with pGEM1 as a template DNA, and the PCR product was purified and utilized as a probe for Southern and Northern blot analysis and colony hybridization (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 6.33-7.45Google Scholar). For Southern blot analysis, ∼1.8 μg of A. brasiliense genomic DNA was digested with six restriction enzymes, EcoRI, HindIII, NotI, PstI, SalI, and XbaI, separated on 1% (w/v) agarose gel and blotted to Hybond™-N (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer using 10× SSC as a transfer buffer (1× SSC is 15 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), and 0.15 m NaCl). The blotted filter was cross-linked in an UV cross-linker CX-2000 (Ultra-Violet Products, Ltd.). A double-stranded probe DNA was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP and hybridized using a DIG-High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit (Roche Applied Science). Membrane was visualized using a nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate reagent detection system (Roche Applied Science). A. brasiliense partial genomic library was prepared with genomic DNA with NotI based on the results of Southern blot analysis. The DNA fragments corresponding to a positive band in size (∼2.0 kbp of the length) were ligated to a plasmid pBluescript® SK(-) (Stratagene). Colony hybridization was carried out under the same conditions as Southern blot analysis except for the use of nylon membranes for colony and plaque hybridization (Roche Applied Science). The plasmid from a positive clone (referred to as pBS1) was purified, and the inserted A. brasiliense genome fragment was sequenced. Northern Blot Analysis—A. brasiliense cells were cultured at 30 °C to the mid-log phase (A600 = 0.6–0.8) in minimal medium supplemented with 37 mm appropriate sugar (d-glucose, l-arabinose, d-galactose, or d-xylose) or nutrient medium (10 g of peptone, 10 g of meat extract, and 5.0 g of NaCl (pH 7.0–7.2)) and harvested by centrifugation. Total RNAs from A. brasiliense were prepared with an RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen) and subsequently treated with RNase-free DNase I. The isolated RNA (4 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis on 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel containing 0.66 m formaldehyde. The subsequent steps were performed using the same methods as for Southern blot analysis. Cloning of the l-Arabinose 1-Dehydrogenase Gene into Expression Plasmid Vector—To introduce the restriction site for BglII at the 5′-end and PstI at the 3′-end of the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene, PCR was carried out using pBS1 as a template and the following two primers (lowercase letters indicate additional bases for introducing digestion sites of BglII and PstI (underlined letters)): 5′-caccatagaTCTGATCAGGTTTCGCTGGGTG-3′ (HISBglII) and 5′-gcttggctgcagTCAGCGGCCGAACGCGTCG-3′ (HISPstI). The amplified DNA fragment was introduced into BamHI-PstI sites in pQE-80L (Qiagen), a plasmid vector for conferring N-terminal His6 tag on the expressed proteins, to obtain pHISWT. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The following sense and antisense primers were designed to introduce the mutations into the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene (the mutated regions are underlined): to substitute Ala for Asp168 (D168A), 5′-CGGCGTGTTCGCGCCGGGCATC-3′ (D168AS) and 5′-GATGCCCGGCGCGAACACGCCG-3′ (D168AAS); to substitute Ala for Asn172 (N172A), 5′-CCCGGGCATCGCGGCGCTGTCG-3′ (N172AS) and 5′-CGACAGCGCCGCGATGCCCGGG-3′ (N172AAS). The mutations were introduced by sequential steps of PCR (35Penning T.M. Jez J.M. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3027-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with small modifications. In the first round, two reactions, I and II, were performed with the appropriate primers and pHISWT as a template: reaction I, HISBglII and one of the antisense primers containing the mutations; and reaction II, one of the sense primers containing the mutations and HISPstI. In the final amplification step, purified overlapping PCR products were used as templates and HISBglII and HISPstI as primers. The final PCR products were cloned into pQE-80L to obtain plasmids pHISD168A and pHISN172A, respectively. The coding region of the mutated genes was confirmed by subsequent sequencing in both directions. Functional Expression and Purification of His6-tagged l-Arabinose 1-Dehydrogenase—E. coli DH5α harboring the expression plasmid for the His6-tagged wild-type and mutated enzymes was grown at 37 °C to a turbidity of 0.6 at 600 nm in Super Broth medium (12 g of tryptone, 24 g of yeast extract, 5 ml of glycerol, 3.81 g of KH2PO4, and 12.5 g of K2HPO4/liter (pH 7.0)) containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin. After the addition of 1 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the culture was further grown for 6 h to induce the expression of His6-tagged l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase protein. Cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer D (50 mm sodium phosphate containing 2 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm l-arabinose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)). The cells were then disrupted by sonication, and the solution was centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column (Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer D. The column was washed three times with Buffer E (Buffer D containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 50 mm imidazole instead of 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)). The enzymes were then eluted with Buffer F (Buffer E containing 250 mm imidazole instead of 50 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)). The elutant was dialyzed against Buffer C and stored at -35 °C until use. Western Blot Analysis of His6-tagged l-Arabinose 1-Dehydrogenase—For Western blot analysis, the purified l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase from A. brasiliense and/or recombinant His6-tagged l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase from E. coli was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins on the gels were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™-ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Western blot analysis was carried out using the ECL™ Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences) and RGS·His horseradish peroxidase antibody, a horseradish peroxidase-fused mouse monoclonal antibody against Arg-Gly-Ser-His6 in the N-terminal additional peptide of the expressed recombinant proteins (Qiagen). Disruptant Construction—The overall scheme of the plasmid construction for disruption of the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene is shown in Fig. 9A. The Tn5-derived 1.3-kb BamHI kanamycin resistance (Kmr) cassette of pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) was inserted into the single BamHI site in the coding sequence of the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene of pHISWT to yield pHISWT::Km. To introduce the restriction site for MfeI at the 5′- and 3′-end of the DNA fragment containing the Kmr gene in the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene, PCR was carried out using pHISWT::Km as a template and the following two primers (lowercase letters indicate additional bases for introducing digestion sites of MfeI (underlined letters)): 5′-caccatcaattgGATCAGGTTTCGCTGGGTGTCGTCGGCATCG-3′ (MfeI-up) and 5′-gcttggcaattgTCAGCGGCCGAACGCGTCGGTCTGCACGCGC-3′ (MfeI-down). The 2.3-kbp MfeI DNA fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI site in the chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr) cassette of the suicide vector pSUP202 (36Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 789-791Crossref Scopus (5562) Google Scholar) to yield pSUPWT::Km. E. coli S17-1 (36Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 789-791Crossref Scopus (5562) Google Scholar) was transformed with pSUPWT::Km, and then the transformant was further mobilized to A. brasiliense by biparental mating. The transconjugants were selected on a minimal medium agar plate supplemented with 5 g of sodium malate and 25 μg of kanamycin/liter using Kmr (the presence of Kmr cassette) and TcS (loss of pSUP202) phenotypes. The construction was confirmed by genomic PCR and Southern hybridization on total DNA digested with NotI. One of the resulting disruptants of A. brasiliense was named ΔARA5034 and was used in this study. Amino Acid Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis—Protein sequence of l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase from A. brasiliense was analyzed using the Protein-BLA"
https://openalex.org/W2045377288,"Cells have ingenious mechanisms for interpreting complex signals from their external microenvironment. Previously, we have shown that phosphophoryn (PP) regulates the expression of bone/dentin marker genes via the integrin/MAPK signaling pathway (Jadlowiec, J., Koch, H., Zhang, X., Campbell, P. G., Seyedain, M., and Sfeir, C. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 53323–53330). We hypothesize that other signaling pathways important for mineralized tissue morphogenesis such as the Smad pathway could be involved in PP signaling. We determined activation of the Smad pathway in human adult mesenchymal stem cells following treatment with recombinant PP (rPP). We observed that PP enhanced phosphorylation of Smad1 within 30 min and Smad1 translocation to the nucleus within 1 h. PP up-regulated the expression of Smad1 target genes, Smad6, Dlx5, and Runx2. The timing of PP activation of Smad1 implies this is a direct effect; however, we also investigated the possible involvement of bone morphogenetic proteins in PP stimulation of the Smad pathway. PP was shown to up-regulate Bmp-2 gene expression 12 h post-treatment with PP, which is much later than initial detection of Smad1 phosphorylation at 30 min. Furthermore, addition of Noggin did not block Smad1 phosphorylation by PP. We propose that PP could signal via the Smad pathway by either directly stimulating the phosphorylation of Smad1 via integrins or other mechanisms. These might include integrin/bone morphogenetic protein receptor interactions or involvement of PP with other growth factors leading to the modulation of intracellular signaling. It is noteworthy that a non-transforming growth factor-β family member activates the Smad pathway. The role of PP in regulating the Smad pathway raises very interesting questions regarding the role of PP during bone and tooth development.

The ECM relays complex signals from the microenvironment to cells. This directs proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis for proper tissue development and remodeling. During formation of mineralized tissues such as bone and dentin, the cell utilizes several intracellular signaling pathways representing an interconnected network of proteins with the goal to decipher cues from the ECM. We focused our current work on the role of the non-collagenous proteins of dentin such as phosphophoryn (PP) 2The abbreviations used are: PP, phosphophoryn; rPP, recombinant PP;MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TGF, transforming growth factor; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; hMSC, human adult mesenchymal stem cells; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; qPCR, quantitative real-time PCR. 2The abbreviations used are: PP, phosphophoryn; rPP, recombinant PP;MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TGF, transforming growth factor; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; hMSC, human adult mesenchymal stem cells; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; qPCR, quantitative real-time PCR. in cell signaling and differentiation. We have determined the involvement of the MAPK pathway in PP's signaling (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53323-53330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the present study, our hypothesis is that the Smad pathway might be involved since many of the genes up-regulated by PP are critical to bone differentiation. The Smad pathway is one such pathway important in signal interpretation from the ECM during osteogenesis/dentinogenesis. Smad proteins are intracellular signaling molecules that are activated by members of the transforming growth factor (TGF-β) family of growth factors which includes the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Smads are the initial responders to receptor activation of the TGF-β family and have been studied as transcriptional activators of cell differentiation. There are three types of Smads: receptor-regulated (R-Smads), common mediator (Co-Smads), and inhibitory (I-Smads) (2Souchelnytskyi S. Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 304-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Signaling initiates with ligand binding to type I and type II receptor serine/threonine kinases on the cell surface. The type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor which then phosphorylates the R-Smads (Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8) within the C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad1/2. Following phosphorylation of the R-Smads (Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 primarily by BMPs and Smad2 and Smad3 primarily by TGF-β1), heteromeric complexes with Smad4 are formed and translocate to the nucleus where they regulate transcription of target genes together with other nuclear cofactors. Several excellent reviews on Smad signaling are available in the literature and discuss the caveats and specifics of Smad signaling (2Souchelnytskyi S. Moustakas A. Heldin C.H.

Their functions have been studied in many organisms from Drosophila to humans and their role in development is highly specialized and critical. For example, during limb development, BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-7 are essential signals for apoptosis (16Guha U. Gomes W.A. Kobayashi T. Pestell R.G. Kessler J.A. Dev.

Biol. 1999; 15: 411-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Conversely, neural differentiation and dorsal mesoderm formation is favored when BMP signals are attenuated by inhibitors such as Noggin (13De Robertis E.M. Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. Wessely O.

The Smad pathway can be influenced by factors other than TGF-β/BMP via the MAPK pathway (25Pera E.M. Ikeda A. Eivers E. De Robertis E.M.

Smad activity may be a point of convergence from complex interconnected signaling networks and could help interpret the diverse messages from the ECM into cell fate decisions (26Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that a non-collagenous protein, PP, has a signaling role in mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1), and fibroblasts (NIH3T3) cells (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53323-53330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). PP is localized in dentin and bone and is a regulator of matrix mineralization (27Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cadena E. Ridall A. Tsujigiwa H. Nagatsuka H. Nagai N. Butler W.T. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). PP is highly negatively charged and consists of many repeats of Asp-Ser-Ser (DSS)n, where n could be as high as 28 (28Veis A. Wei K. Sfeir C. George A. Malone J. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our recent work has demonstrated that PP activates many of the same target genes as BMP-2, including Runx2, Osx, alkaline phosphatase (Alp), and osteocalcin (Ocn) (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53323-53330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We further showed that PP triggers activation of the MAPK pathway (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53323-53330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We suspect that BMP-2 and PP might be functioning cooperatively to stimulate progression of the osteogenic pathway and this could involve multiple signaling pathways. In the present study, we hypothesized that the Smad pathway is mediated by PP. To test our hypothesis, we exposed human adult mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to recombinant PP (rPP) and determined the levels of Smad1 phosphorylation, its subsequent nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity. We found that PP regulates the Smad pathway and this may be independent of BMPs. hMSC were obtained from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Mesenchymal stem cell medium, mesenchymal cell growth supplement, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from BioWhittaker, Inc. and added to the medium according to the manufacturer’s specifications to prepare complete mesenchymal stem cell medium (basal medium). rhBMP-2 and BMP-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was obtained from R&D Systems.

For Western blotting and immunocytochemical assays, cells were cultured in medium containing 0.5% serum for 12–16 h prior to treatment with either rhBMP-2 or rPP. For all experiments, the dose of rhBMP-2 and rPP was 250 ng/ml. In our previous studies, this was optimal for activation of signal transduction pathways (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G.

Non-phosphorylated rPP was produced in Escherichia coli (BL21) in our laboratory using standard glutathione S-transferase fusion protein methodology where the glutathione S-transferase was cleaved and pure rPP was purified as described previously (1Jadlowiec J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 53323-53330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and is maintained in solution with double distilled H2O. Detection of Smad1 Activation—Cells were cultured in 35-mm plates as described above. Cells were treated in triplicate with either 250 ng/ml rhBMP-2 or rPP. Basal medium (0.5% serum) was the negative control. Cells were treated for 30 min and 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Cells were lysed on ice in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors. The lysed cells were then pooled and protein concentration determined. The lysates were stored at –80 °C at least 2 h prior to use. Sixty micrograms of total protein were loaded onto 10% SDS gels and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with anti-phosphorylated Smad1 (1:200) by Western blotting. Bands were detected by chemiluminescence of HRP and exposure to X-Omat Kodak film was performed. Where noted, quantification of band intensities was performed using Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were cultured as described above on 12-mm round glass coverslips. Cells were then treated with either rhBMP-2 or rPP for 1, 6, and 12 h. All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Fixed cells were rinsed twice in wash buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were then rinsed twice with wash buffer and incubated in a blocking buffer containing 5% goat serum in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then incubated for 1 h in primary antibody (anti-pSmad1, 1:200 in blocking buffer). Cells were then washed three times in wash buffer and incubated with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with wash buffer and a final wash with double distilled H2O. Coverslips were mounted inverted on glass microscope slides using Gelvatol mounting medium and visualized using epi-fluorescence and a Cy3 filter set. Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis—Cells were cultured in complete basal medium in 35-mm plates to ∼70% confluence. Cells were then treated in triplicate with rhBMP-2 or rPP for 30 min and 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit with DNase I digestion. After RNA extraction, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis was carried out as described previously (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J. Biol.

Gene expression levels were calculated as fold changes compared with basal medium controls for each time point based on the comparative ΔΔCT method (separate tubes) (29pplied Biosystems (2001) User Bulletin No. 2, ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CAGoogle Scholar). Fold differences were calculated for each treatment group using normalized CT values for the negative control at the appropriate time point as the calibrator. All target genes were normalized to the reference housekeeping gene, 18S.TABLE 1Sequences for qPCR primers and probesGeneAccession numberForward primerReverse primerTaqman® probeHuman Smad6NM005585GCCACTGGATCTGTCCGATTCACCCGGAGCAGTGATGAGCACATTGTCTTACACTGAAACGGAGGCTACCAHuman Dlx5NM005221CAGACGTCCGCAGCTATGCGCTGAAGACTCGGGCAAAGTCCA TCCGTCTCAGGAATCGCCHuman Runx2NM004348AACCCACGAATGCACTATCCACGGACATACCGAGGGACATGCCTTTACTTACACCCCGCCAGTCACCTCHuman BMP-2NM001200GGGCATCCTCTCCACAAAAGTTACAGCTGGACTTAAGGCGTTTAAAACGTCAAGCCAAACACAAACAGCG Open table in a new tab Inhibition of BMP-2 Signaling—Cells were cultured as described above. To determine the dose of Noggin required to inhibit BMP-2 activity in hMSC, cells were treated with 250 or 500 ng/ml Noggin-Fc for 1 h in the presence of rhBMP-2. Noggin had been added to the rhBMP-2-containing media and preincubated 30 min at 37 °C prior to addition to the cells. To determine whether Smad1 signaling by PP involved BMP-2, cells were incubated with PP and Noggin (also preincubated) for 30 min and 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Cell lysates were harvested and analyzed for pSmad1 by Western blotting as described above. Statistical Analyses—All experiments were performed at least three times, and one representative experiment is reported as the mean of three treatment triplicates ± S.E. For qPCR assays, the coefficient of variation was calculated from three assay replicates. For all treatment groups and target genes analyzed, the coefficient of variation did not exceed 3%. One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer’s post-hoc test using SYSTAT 9 software (Richmond, CA) was performed to determine significance among treatment groups. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. PP Activates pSmad1—We hypothesized that the Smad pathway, a key regulatory pathway of osteogenic lineage progression, was involved in PP-mediated signaling, as PP was previously shown to up-regulate several key bone/dentin marker genes (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53323-53330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the activation of the Smad pathway by analysis of the phosphorylation of the BMP-2 site on Smad1 (Ser463/Ser465), nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity following treatment of hMSC with PP. We detected an increase in phosphorylated Smad1 (pSmad1) within 30 min of treatment (Fig. 1A). Our positive control, BMP-2, is a known stimulator of Smad1. BMP-2-treated cells maintained enhanced pSmad1 for at least 24 h compared with control. The optimal dose of rPP for pSmad1 activation appeared to be 250 ng/ml, which was comparable with stimulation with rhBMP-2 (Fig. 1B). By immunocytochemical analysis, pSmad1 was primarily cytoplasmic in cells maintained in basal medium (Fig. 2, A–C). pSmad1 nuclear translocation occurred within 1 h of treatment with either rhBMP-2 (Fig. 2, D–F) or rPP (Fig. 2, G–I). A higher magnification of Fig. 2G is shown in Fig. 2K, exhibiting the intense nuclear pSmad1 in hMSC treated with rPP for 1 h.FIGURE 2Localization of pSmad1 by immunocytochemistry. hMSC were serum-deprived (0.5% serum) for 12–16 h and then treated with basal medium (0.5% serum) as negative control (A–C), 250 ng/ml rhBMP-2 (D–F), or rPP (G–I) for 1, 6, or 12 h.

In hMSC, Smad6 and Dlx5 gene expression was enhanced following treatment with rPP (Fig. 3). A 3.2-fold increase in Smad6 gene expression was observed 12 h following stimulation with rPP (Fig. 3A). This increased to 4.5-fold through 18 h and then declined to basal levels by 24 h. Similarly, Dlx5 gene expression was elevated 3-fold at 18 h following rPP treatment and returned to basal levels at 24 h (Fig. 3B). For both genes, PP-stimulated gene expression followed a similar pattern to BMP-2; however, in both cases, BMP-2-stimulated expression occurred earlier and induced higher fold changes for both Smad6 (up to 21.5-fold at 18 h) and Dlx5 (up to 13-fold at 18 h). We have previously reported that Runx2 is up-regulated in hMSC by PP after 48 h of culture (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53323-53330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have found that Runx2 is up-regulated also earlier at 12 h (2.6-fold) and is maintained at this level up to 18 h (Fig. 3C) using a higher dose of rPP (250 ng/ml versus 50 ng/ml). Runx2 declined to basal level at 24 h. Osx was not affected by treatment with rPP over this time course (levels were below threshold of detection, data not shown). BMP-2 treatment groups induced Osx within 18 h (data not shown), which is consistent with our previous reports (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53323-53330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Celil A.B. Hollinger J.O. Campbell P.G. J. Cell Biochem. 2005; 95: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that induction of Runx2 gene expression can occur without subsequent expression of Osx (30Koch H. Jadlowiec J.A. Campbell P.G. Stem Cell Dev. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar, 31Jadlowiec J. Dongell D. Smith J. Conover C. Campbell P. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3765-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). BMP-2 Gene Expression Is Enhanced by PP—To determine whether PP activates the Smad pathway via BMP-2, qPCR analysis for Bmp-2 gene expression was performed on hMSC treated with PP (Fig. 4A). In PP-treated hMSC, Bmp-2 gene expression remained at basal levels up to 6 h following treatment. Then, Bmp-2 gene expression was significantly enhanced at 12 h (8.0-fold) and 18 h (4.6-fold) following treatment with rPP. BMP-2 gene expression returned to basal levels 24 h post-PP treatment. This suggests that PP directly activates the Smad pathway independent of BMP during earlier time points (prior to 12 h). PP Activation of pSmad1 Does Not Require BMP-2 Signaling—Following an analysis of PP-stimulated Smad1 activation in hMSC, we did not expect that BMP would be directly involved in initial Smad1 activation due to timing of activation (within 30 min) and that BMP-2 gene expression is not up-regulated until at least 6–12 h later. However, we pursued the possibility that BMP binding to its receptor could be required for Smad activation by PP. Therefore, we inhibited BMP binding to its receptor by addition of Noggin, a competitive receptor antagonist of BMP signaling. Thus, if PP-mediated activation of the Smad pathway involved BMP-2 receptor binding, we hypothesized that Noggin would interfere with such a mechanism. We demonstrated the dose dependence of Noggin on inhibition of BMP-2-stimulated pSmad1 in hMSC (Fig. 5A). 500 ng/ml of Noggin significantly reduced the level of pSmad1 to basal levels (Fig. 5B). In the presence of PP, the pSmad1 activation was not inhibited in the presence of Noggin (Fig. 5C). This suggests that PP activates the Smad pathway in a mechanism that is independent of BMP-2/receptor binding. Our finding that a protein distinct from the TGF-β family stimulated the Smad pathway was quite intriguing. We have previously determined the role of PP in signaling in human mesenchymal stem cells via the MAPK pathway. In the present study, we have demonstrated the involvement of the Smad pathway in PP-mediated signaling. The current study provides the necessary data to validate the proposed theories of others, which suggest direct involvement of non-collagenous proteins of the ECM during key stages of tissue development, morphogenesis, and regeneration (32Fisher L.W. Fedarko N.S. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 33-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PP-treated hMSC showed enhanced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad1 with increased expression of Smad target genes. Noggin, an inhibitor of BMP-2-mediated signaling, did not block phosphorylation of Smad1 in hMSC treated with PP. BMP-2 receptor binding does not appear to be required for induction of Smad1 by PP. This suggested to us that PP does not stimulate Smad1 by first stimulating additional autocrine or paracrine BMP-2 production or by increasing BMP-2 bioavailability. PP activated Smad1 within 30 min and was maintained at least for 24 h. Furthermore, PP did not up-regulate Bmp-2 gene expression significantly over control until 6–12 h later. Rapid activation of pSmad1 and failure of Noggin to inhibit PP signaling indicate a direct effect. Taken together, the data collectively indicate that PP activates the Smad pathway independently of BMP-2. Based on the data presented previously (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53323-53330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and in this manuscript, we propose a model for PP signaling depicted in Fig. 6. Not only is the phosphorylation of Smad1 important for transduction of the pathway, but it must also translocate into the nucleus as a complex with the Co-Smads. Phosphorylated Smad1 exhibited nuclear translocation following PP treatment. Once in the nucleus, the Smad complex was transcriptionally active and stimulated the expression of Smad1 target genes Smad6, Dlx5, and Runx2. Although this correlates with induction of Bmp-2 gene expression, failure of Noggin to prevent pSmad1 activation by PP suggests this occurs independently of BMP2/4/7. Smad6 is an inhibitory Smad and a direct target of BMP/Smad signaling. Smad6 provides feedback inhibition of BMP-receptor activation by blocking continued Smad1 phosphorylation by the BMP receptors. Here, we have shown that PP also up-regulates Smad6. Perhaps, PP activates Smad6 as a feedback mechanism to block further stimulation of Smad and MAPK pathways. Smad6 has been shown to inhibit p38 signaling by directly interacting with TAK-1 (33Kimura N. Matsuo R. Shibuya H. Nakashima K. Taga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17647-17652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Runx2 was activated by PP, but not Osx, providing further evidence that BMP-2 is likely not the primary mechanism of action for induction of the Smad pathway by PP. It appears that PP activation of the Smad pathway follows a similar profile as BMP-2, with aspects of the pathway becoming activated from initial phosphorylation by PP at the same site as BMPs (Ser463/465) followed by nuclear translocation over a similar time course and activation of the same Smad target genes. Thus, it appears the Smad pathway is intact, although not stemming from a BMP stimulus but rather PP. It is unclear at this time what additional mediators upstream of the MAPKs and Smad1 may be involved with PP signaling and activation of Smad target genes and what other pathways might be involved. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that PP activates the integrin/MAPK signaling (1Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53323-53330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and this could give clues to possible mechanisms by which PP affects the Smad pathway. Integrin signaling could modulate Smad transcriptional activity. For example, when focal adhesion kinase is inhibited by antisense, Smad transcriptional activity is reduced in the presence of BMP (34Tamura Y. Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Fukumoto S. Kato M. Miyazono K. Fujita T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus a link between integrins and growth factors pathways (Smads) could be influenced by additional ECM signals. Could PP activate the Smad pathway via integrins? Does this involve an interaction between integrins and BMP receptors or other growth factor receptor(s)? These questions are pertinent in light of the many opportunities for cross-talk between the intracellular signaling pathways triggered by ECM stimuli (25Pera E.M. Ikeda A. Eivers E. De Robertis E.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3023-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 35Aubin J. Davy A. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 36Massague J.

Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar), which are relevant to mineralized tissue morphogenesis. The MAPK pathway can influence the Smad pathway by modulating Smad nuclear translocation. A link between the Smad and MAPK pathways was described by Kretzschmar et al. (26Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The authors reported that BMP-2 and EGF trigger opposing signals which converge on Smad1 (26Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Activation of Erk kinases by fibroblast growth factor 2, hepatocyte growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor II were shown to prevent nuclear translocation of Smads and thus inhibit BMP signaling in Xenopus (25Pera E.M. Ikeda A. Eivers E. De Robertis E.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3023-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). From this work, it was postulated that Smad1 receives opposing phosphorylation signals at different sites within the protein and the net effect determines the distribution of Smad1 in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Since Smad1 is important in the transcriptional activity of many bone-related genes such as Runx2 (38Zaidi S.K. Sullivan A.J. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8048-8053Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the signaling network of Smads and MAPK and their interconnectivity should be further investigated to understand progression of the osteogenic lineage. Multiple opportunities for cross-talk between pathways exist in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. As mentioned above for focal adhesion kinase and Smads, it is possible that signals from integrins and growth factor receptors could merge in the nucleus to control osteoblast differentiation (34Tamura Y. Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Fukumoto S. Kato M. Miyazono K. Fujita T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This is evident in a recent study demonstrating the importance of the growth factor-regulated kinase RSK2, which was shown to be required for osteoblast differentiation (39Elefteriou F. Ahn J.D. Takeda S. Starbuck M. Yang X. Liu X. Kondo H. Richards W.G. Bannon T.W. Noda M. Clement K. Vaisse C. Karsenty G. Nature. 2005; 434: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). RSK2 phosphorylates and therefore regulates the activity of ATF4, an important transcription factor during osteoblast differentiation (40Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In particular, it was recently shown that the transcription factors Runx2 and ATF4 co-regulate osteoblast differentiation through activation of Ocn (41Xiao G. Jiang D. Ge C. Zhao Z. Lai Y. Boules H. Phimphilai M. Yang X. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30689-30696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). MAPK is also important for phosphorylation and activation of Runx2 (42Xiao G. Jiang D. Thomas P. Benson M.D. Guan K. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4453-4459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), which could involve signaling from PP. The role of PP-mediated activation of MAPK and the connection to the Smad and other pathways and related additional effects are not yet completely understood and require further investigation. Since MAPK and Smad signaling pathways are dually activated by PP and BMP-2, it is possible that PP might contribute to the compensatory signaling networks that are triggered by the ECM and regulate bone/dentin formation. These data raise interesting questions pertaining to the involvement of PP/Smad signaling with respect to the MAPK pathway, BMPs, and other signaling factors within the ECM. Cells use multiple pathways to decipher signals from the ECM into changes in cell function. BMP and PP each activate the MAPK pathway and Smad pathway. What is the connection, if any, between these events? Furthermore, what is the biological significance of Smad pathway activation by PP in the context of tissue morphogenesis? For example, during tooth development many epithelial-to-mesenchymal interactions are carried out by BMP signaling through the Smad pathway. We could now speculate a role of the matrix in the development of the tissue and a possible role in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. This involvement of non-collagenous matrix proteins in tissue morphogenesis is worthy of further investigation. During tooth development, PP is secreted by odontoblasts and is localized along the mineralization front to regulated mineral deposition (43Gorter de Vries I. Wisse E. Histochemistry. 1989; 91: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 44MacDougall M. Zeichner-David M. Slavkin H.C. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 45Weinstock M. Leblond C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). One can envision a role for PP during the early phases of tooth development where PP signals odontoblast precursor cells in the microenvironment to differentiate into more mature odontoblasts. PP might also play a later role not only in the regulation of mineral deposition, crystal formation, and growth but also in the maintenance of the odontoblastic phenotype throughout tooth morphogenesis. PP might contribute to positive signaling related to the induction of key ECM proteins during dentin formation and mineralization. In addition, subsequent feedback inhibition of convergent signaling pathways such as the Smad and MAPK pathways can occur, both of which are dually activated by PP or other growth factors within the niche such as BMPs. In this fashion, PP might regulate cessation of signaling once optimal differentiation or mineral deposition is achieved. This could be relevant in the context of tissue homeostasis as well as morphogenesis, since the nature of dentin is generally non-resorbing. Given that native PP is highly phosphorylated (46Sfeir C.

We are actively pursuing the role of phosphorylation of PP on its signaling function. Another interesting question is how are the signaling pathways, which are activated by numerous diverse stimuli, channeled into the appropriate pathway? What is the net effect of a combination of signals? These questions undoubtedly become increasingly important when defining the necessary and sufficient signals required for tissue morphogenesis. Our ongoing work is focused on the potential cross-talk that might occur between MAPKs and Smads during PP signaling and how PP could participate in signaling of complex combinatorial cues from the microenvironment transduced to the cell during tissue development and morphogenesis.

These problems can be greatly attenuated or rescued by synthetic antioxidant treatment, such as with the catalytic antioxidant EUK189 (Hinerfeld, D., Traini, M. D., Weinberger, R. P., Cochran, B., Doctrow, S. R., Harry, J., and Melov, S. (2004) J. Neurochem. 88, 657–667). We have used heart mitochondria from sod2 null mice to better understand mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production both in the absence of SOD2 and following in vivo antioxidant treatment. Isolated heart mitochondria from 5-day-old sod2 null animals respiring on the complex II substrate succinate exhibited statistically significant higher levels of mitochondrial O2−˙ (157%, p < 0.01) but significantly less H2O2 (33%, p < 0.001) than wild type littermates. Treatment of sod2 nullizygous mice with EUK189 proportionately increased the levels of complex II and H2O2. Increased production of O2−˙ resulting from complex II normalization had no effect on steady state levels due to the rapid conversion to H2O2, a process presumably aided by the presence of the EUK189, an SOD mimetic.

The vast majority of such ATP is derived from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a series of sequential electron transfers along the respiratory chain resulting in the reduction of O2 to water concomitant with the production of ATP. During the course of normal respiration under state IV conditions, as much as 0.4–4% (13Boveris A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 14Turrens J.F.

The majority of mitochondrial superoxide is generated from two respiratory chain complexes, complex I and complex III (16Raha S. McEachern G.E. Myint A.T. Robinson B.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the former producing superoxide on the matrix side of the mitochondrial membrane and the latter liberating superoxide both to the matrix side and into the intermembrane space (17Han D.

The relative importance of the two sites in mitochondrial superoxide production is currently an area of debate (19Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol.

When electrons are passed from succinate to NAD via energy-dependent reverse electron flow, complex I produces ROS at relatively high rates (14Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem.

During forward electron flow both complexes produce ROS at very low rates unless respiratory chain inhibitors such as the complex I inhibitor rotenone or the complex III inhibitor antimycin A are present (20St.-Pierre J.

The potential consequences of this endogenously produced ROS upon mammalian physiology became clearer with the creation of superoxide dismutase null mice. Three isoforms of superoxide dismutase exist both within and outside the cell. SOD1 is primarily cytosolic (although a fraction is also found in the intermembrane space of mitochondria) (25Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 10: 10Google Scholar), SOD2 is the mitochondrial form located exclusively in the matrix, and SOD3 is extracellular. Genetic inactivation of either sod1 or sod3 results in mild phenotypes in an acute sense (26Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F.

Jackson Roberts L. Van Remmen H. Epstein C.J. Huang T.T. Oncogene. 2004; Google Scholar). In stark contrast to the sod1 or sod3 knock-outs, mice lacking SOD2 are lethally affected either during development or within a few days of birth, irrespective of genetic background (2Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat.

Important among the latter, especially with regard to energy production, are the dissimilar losses in activity suffered by the respiratory chain complexes I–IV, with complex II being severely affected and complex IV the least affected. The synthetic antioxidant EUK189 (4Melov S. Doctrow S.R. Schneider J.A. Haberson J. Patel M. Coskun P.E. Huffman K. Wallace D.C. Malfroy B. J.

Our prior studies showed that treatment of the sod2 null mouse with such synthetic antioxidants could prolong lifespan and rescue or attenuate many of the pathologies arising as a result of endogenous oxidative stress (3Hinerfeld D.

Further, treatment of sod2 null mice with the synthetic antioxidant EUK8 completely rescued the deficiencies in complexes I, III, and IV caused by endogenous oxidative stress and greatly increased the catalytic activity of complex II. This demonstrated that antioxidant treatments of mitochondrial disorders caused by oxidative stress are amenable to therapeutic interdiction. It also showed the utility of the sod2 null mouse platform for testing the efficacy of antioxidants in attenuating pathologies directly attributable to endogenously produced oxidative stress. We have used sod2 mice to evaluate a number of antioxidants in this context and have identified compounds that are effective at preventing mitochondrial-mediated ROS pathologies such as cardiomyopathy, hepatic lipid accumulation, and neurodegeneration (3Hinerfeld D.

Such antioxidants may be similarly useful in the treatment of aging and its diseases where ROS may have a significant pathological role (39Melov S. Wolf N. Strozyk D. Doctrow S.R. Bush A.I.

Accordingly, in the present work, we have examined in more detail how the synthetic antioxidant EUK189 (3Hinerfeld D. Traini M.D. Weinberger R.P. Cochran B. Doctrow S.R. Harry J. Melov S. J.

Chemicals—Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals used in this study were obtained from Sigma. Animals and EUK189 Treatment—Mouse genotyping and EUK189 treatment of sod2 null mice were carried out as previously described (37Melov S. Schneider J.A. Day B.J. Hinerfeld D. Coskun P. Mirra S.S. Crapo J.D. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were genotyped between 2–3 days of age, and sod2 null mice were injected intraperitoneally every 24 h (±3 h) with the indicated dose of EUK189 (Dalton Chemical Laboratories Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Mice received their last treatment of EUK189 24 h before tissue harvest. Wild type sod2 mice were left untreated except in one experiment to show that EUK189 treatment had negligible detrimental effects in wild type mitochondria. Mice were killed between 5–27 days of age. All animal procedures were carried out under approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee animal protocols at the Buck Institute, which is American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care accredited. Preparation of Heart Mitochondria—Individual hearts were finely chopped in H buffer (0.21 m mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), homogenized in a tight fitting glass pestle, and subjected to standard differential centrifugation to obtain a crude mitochondrial preparation. Once large non-mitochondrial debris had been removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g the mitochondrial supernatant fraction was further clarified four-five times by centrifugation at 1,000 × g. This improved the consistencies of mitochondrial preparations produced on different days (data not shown). The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and mitochondria pelleted by spinning at 8,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria were resuspended in 100–500 μl of oxygen electrode buffer (OEB) (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 5 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2) and mitochondrial protein concentration determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). For the Amplex Red and dihydroethidium assays, heart mitochondria were further diluted in OEB containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin to give a final concentration of 80 μg/ml and kept on ice until required. Mitochondrial Quality Assessment—Preparations of purified mitochondria routinely exhibited a respiratory control ratio of >4.0 and no measurable NADH oxidase activity, an indication of intactness of the mitochondria (data not shown). Amplex Red and Dihydroethidium Assays—Assays for measuring mitochondrial ROS fluorometrically were modified from previous studies in order to work on smaller amounts of material (24Chen Q. Vazquez E.J. Moghaddas S. Hoppel C.L. Lesnefsky E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36027-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Levels of ROS were corrected for background fluorescence associated with reagents and inhibitors. Amplex Red Measurement of Mitochondrial Hydrogen Peroxide Levels—Heart mitochondria (4 μg of mitochondrial protein/well) were incubated with respiratory chain substrates, 1 μm Amplex Red (Molecular Probes), 0.2 units/ml horseradish peroxidase in standard OEB (+0.1% bovine serum albumin). Reactions were set up in triplicate in 100-μl volumes in a 96-well plate format. The rate of hydrogen peroxide produced was measured fluorometrically (excitation 544, emission 590 nm) over 30 min at 37 °C in a Spectra Max Gemini fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices). H2O2 detection by Amplex red was shown to be catalase sensitive, consistent with previously published studies (data not shown and Ref. 19Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). All Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide data are expressed as the change in fluorescence excitation 544 nm and emission 590 nm/μg mitochondria/min. Dihydroethidium Measurement of Mitochondrial Superoxide Levels—Mitochondrial superoxide production was determined on the same mitochondrial preparations used in the Amplex Red assays. Superoxide assays were carried out by incubating 4 μg of heart mitochondria with mitochondrial substrates and 5 μm dihydroethidium in a 96-well plate format at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.6% Triton and 10 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and the ethidium bromide/DNA fluorescence measured by excitation at 544 nm and emission at 612 nm. Previous studies suggest that the reaction of dihydroethidium with superoxide generates a range of products (termed “Et+” products) that when combined with DNA generate products with different excitation and emission characteristics (41Benov L. Sztejnberg L. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 42Fink B. Laude K. McCann L. Doughan A. Harrison D.G. Dikalov S. Am. J.

Our studies measured fluorescence at excitation 544/emission 612 nm based on previous microscopy studies in which dihydroethidium had been used to measure superoxide production in a number of stroke models (44Maier C.M. Sun G.H. Cheng D. Yenari M.A. Chan P.H. Steinberg G.K. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Enzymology and Immunoblotting—Mitochondria used for ROS assays were frozen at –70 °C and used for assessment of complex II activity and complex II subunit levels. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay allows a rapid assessment of complex II activity on multiple heart preparations (45Huet O. Petit J.M. Ratinaud M.H. Julien R. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The presence of the specific inhibitor malonate enabled complex II activity to be distinguished from those of the other mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Frozen mitochondria (5 μg of mitochondrial protein) were incubated with 2.5 mm succinate and 1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium in OCB (+0.1% bovine serum albumin) with and without malonate (2.5 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C in 96-well plates. Plates were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and the water-insoluble formazan crystals dissolved in 100 μl of Me2SO. The resulting purple color was measured at 570 nm. Changes in complex II subunit levels following treatment of animals with EUK189 (low dose, 1 mg/kg; high dose, 30 mg/kg) treatment were determined by Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of mitochondrial protein (1 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% Nupage gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed using the ECF detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences), probing with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the bovine Ip (30 kDa) subunit of complex II. The same mitochondrial preparations were used for Western blot analysis as were used in the ROS and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assays. Mitochondria isolated from either sod2 null mouse brain (3Hinerfeld D. Traini M.D. Weinberger R.P. Cochran B. Doctrow S.R. Harry J. Melov S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or heart 4T. R. Golden and S. Melov, manuscript in preparation. exhibit lower complex II activity, stemming at least in part from decreased assembly of the complex based on abundance of the 70- and 30-kDa subunits of the enzyme. As opposed to enzyme depletion, the level of ROS is expected to be increased by the lack of SOD2. Heart mitochondria isolated from 5–6-day-old sod2 null mice showed elevated superoxide levels (157%, p < 0.01) relative to those from wild type animals when respiring on succinate (Fig. 1B). In contrast, mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production with the same substrate (Fig. 1C) was significantly decreased (37%, p < 0.001). Mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide produced from complex I substrates (pyruvate/malate) was not above background levels (data not shown). Treatment of sod2 null mice with the synthetic antioxidant EUK189 did not alter the levels of superoxide whether the mitochondria were oxidizing complex I substrates or succinate (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, EUK189 treatment altered hydrogen peroxide production from complex II substrates relative to wild type mitochondria in a dose-dependent fashion (untreated sod2 null 37%, sod2 null treated with EUK189 (LD) 55%, and sod2 null treated with EUK189 (HD) 73.3%) (Fig. 1C). EUK189 treatment of wild type control animals had no effect on heart mitochondrial superoxide or hydrogen peroxide production (data not shown). Increased H2O2 production from sod2 null heart mitochondria following EUK189 treatment correlated with increased complex II activity (Fig. 2A) and increased complex II 30-kDa subunit levels (Fig. 2, B and C). A linear relationship between the abundance of the 30-kDa subunit of complex II and the activity of succinate dehydrogenase was observed for mitochondria isolated from the hearts of all genotypes with and without EUK189 treatment (Fig. 2D). Measurements of superoxide levels in heart mitochondria isolated from wild type mice covering the initial life span between 4 and 26 days of age showed them to be both age and substrate dependent. Although similar levels of superoxide were generated from pyruvate/malate and succinate up to 10 days of age, those with succinate increased thereafter and those with pyruvate/malate decreased (Fig. 3A). The trends become more obvious if the scatter of data points due to interexperimental variation is minimized by plotting the ratio of superoxide levels generated by pyruvate/malate and succinate for each animal (Fig. 3C, r2 is 0.68, p < 0.0001). The respective hydrogen peroxide levels obtained with these substrates showed no significant differences over the same timespan (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3D, mouse heart mitochondria show a significant increase in complex II activity up to 26 days of age (r2 is 0.91, p < 0.0001), which likely accounts for much of the observed increase in ROS production when oxidizing succinate (Fig. 3A). The major objective of this study was to investigate ROS production in mitochondria isolated from mice that lack SOD2 and determine whether therapeutically beneficial antioxidant treatment modulates or attenuates ROS production directly. This question is complicated by the fact that mitochondria isolated from sod2 nullizygous mice show a range of severe mitochondrial biochemical defects (1Melov S. Coskun P. Patel M. Tuinstra R. Cottrell B. Jun A.S. Zastawny T.H. Dizdaroglu M. Goodman S.I. Huang T.T. Miziorko H. Epstein C.J. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Complex II activity (succinate dehydrogenase) has been reported to be severely impaired in brain and heart mitochondria of 5–6-day-old sod2 null mice with levels reduced to <15% that of controls (1Melov S. Coskun P. Patel M. Tuinstra R. Cottrell B. Jun A.S. Zastawny T.H. Dizdaroglu M. Goodman S.I. Huang T.T. Miziorko H. Epstein C.J. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 3Hinerfeld D. Traini M.D. Weinberger R.P. Cochran B. Doctrow S.R. Harry J. Melov S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar),4 and the activities of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and aconitase are also seriously compromised in these mitochondria. Restricted tricarboxylic acid cycle function would be expected to impair the supply of reducing equivalents to the respiratory chain and negatively influence both energy and superoxide production. Our experiments showed that heart mitochondria from sod2 null mice, where the complex II activity was depleted by at least 70% (Fig. 3), exhibited a statistically significant (50%) increase in O2−˙ levels when respiring on succinate as compared with those of wild type (Fig. 1B). This was associated with a 3-fold decrease in the levels of H2O2 (Fig. 1C), consistent with a lowered overall production of ROS compared with wild type. Clearly the content of complex II in sod2 null mitochondria was limiting for superoxide production in this assay, because both enzyme content and ROS were coordinately shifted toward wild type levels following treatment of the mice with the synthetic antioxidant EUK 189 (see below). In contrast to respiration on succinate, oxidation of complex I substrates produced a general increase in O2−˙ level as compared with wild type that failed to reach statistical significance (Fig. 1A). Of interest, therefore, is our demonstration that heart mitochondria from sod2 null mice do not suffer from an overwhelming flood of superoxide but contain steady state levels akin to those in wild type animals because there is restricted entry of reducing equivalents into the respiratory chain as a result of lowered tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. That complex II content would limit superoxide production sod2 null mitochondria is taken as evidence that energy production is similarly limited. As these mitochondria lack the matrix SOD2, a question remaining concerns the mechanism by which any superoxide released into the matrix during the oxidation of substrate might contribute to the H2O2 detected extramitochondrially. Matrix O2−˙ does not cross the inner membrane even in its lipid-permeant, protonated form (19Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), and aqueous dismutation of O2−˙ is some three to four orders of magnitude less than that catalyzed by SOD. The bulk of detectable H2O2 would thus seem to derive from superoxide entering the intermembrane space from complex III. Lack of oxidation of exogenous NADH by our mitochondrial preparations (see “Materials and Methods”) argues against the presence of everted vesicles and the possibility of radical formation by autoxidation of enzyme flavins exposed to solution. A detailed investigation of how the lack of SOD2 might influence mitochondrial bioenergetics is currently underway. Previous studies on mitochondrial function in developing tissues have shown that there are tissue- and species-specific differences in the activities of enzymes involved in supplying energy from birth to adulthood (46Drahota Z. Milerova M. Stieglerova A. Houstek J. Ostadal B. Physiol. Res. 2004; 53: 119-122PubMed Google Scholar, 47Nakai A. Taniuchi Y. Asakura H. Oya A. Yokota A. Koshino T. Araki T. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 121: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 48Kalou M. Rauchova H. Drahota Z. Physiol. Res. 2001; 50: 315-319PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown that there is a sharp transition from the essentially glycolytic state of the newborn neonate to a high reliance on oxidative phosphorylation for supplying energy demands in the first few weeks after birth (46Drahota Z. Milerova M. Stieglerova A. Houstek J. Ostadal B. Physiol. Res. 2004; 53: 119-122PubMed Google Scholar, 47Nakai A. Taniuchi Y. Asakura H. Oya A. Yokota A. Koshino T. Araki T. Brain Res. Dev.

Accompanying this switch in energy metabolism in the heart is an increase in mitochondrial volume and number (49Tiivel T. Kadaya L. Kuznetsov A. Kaambre T. Peet N. Sikk P. Braun U. Ventura-Clapier R. Saks V. Seppet E.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 208: 119-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as enzymatic activities of mitochondrial enzymes such as citrate synthase or 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Of direct relevance to our studies, Bass et al. (50Bass A. Stejskalova M. Stieglerova A. Ostadal B. Samanek M. Physiol. Res. 2001; 50: 237-245PubMed Google Scholar) found an approximate doubling of the activities of citrate synthase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase between 7 and 30 days of age in mitochondria isolated from left ventricular myocardium of developing rats. Our data in Fig. 3D show a similar trend, in that complex II activity increases sharply between 5 and 25 days of age in wild type animals consistent with the greater requirement for energy for growth and development. It seems unlikely that the sod2 null animal would be able to make this transition due to its severely depleted complex II content. Treatment with EUK189 did not statistically significantly alter O2−˙levels from those observed in control mitochondria from sod2 null animals oxidizing succinate (Fig. 1B) or complex I substrates (Fig. 1A), respectively. In contrast, antioxidant treatment clearly increased the level of H2O2 measured with succinate as substrate and in a dose-dependent fashion, reaching 3-fold at the highest concentration of EUK189 used in these experiments (Fig. 1C). The effect is consistent with the previously reported superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic behavior of EUK189 (30Doctrow S.R. Adinolfi C. Baudry M. Huffman K. Malfroy B. Bucay Marcus C. Melov S. Pong K. Yongqi R. Smart J.L. Tocco G. Cutler R. Rodriguez H Critical Reviews of Oxidative Stress and Aging: Advances in Basic Science, Diagnostics, and Intervention. World Scientific Publishing, Hackensack, NJ2002: 1324-1343Crossref Google Scholar), in that a higher dose would be predicted to convert more O2−˙ to H2O2, and eventually to water, thereby reducing the cumulative load of ROS in mitochondria lacking SOD2. This decreased burden of total mitochondrial ROS directly correlates with increased complex II activity. We previously reported in brain (1Melov S. Coskun P. Patel M. Tuinstra R. Cottrell B. Jun A.S. Zastawny T.H. Dizdaroglu M. Goodman S.I. Huang T.T. Miziorko H. Epstein C.J. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), and now confirm, that complex II activity in heart mitochondria from sod2 null mice is dramatically lowered by as much as 75% compared with that in wild type concomitantly with depletion of enzyme subunits in the membrane (1Melov S. Coskun P. Patel M. Tuinstra R. Cottrell B. Jun A.S. Zastawny T.H. Dizdaroglu M. Goodman S.I. Huang T.T. Miziorko H. Epstein C.J. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 2004; 88: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Antioxidant treatment improved both content (Fig. 2B) and activity of complex II (Fig. 2A) in a complementary and dose-dependent manner. Our prior results in brain also demonstrated that other complexes such as respiratory chain complexes I, III, and IV were also amenable to antioxidant treatment (3Hinerfeld D. Traini M.D. Weinberger R.P. Cochran B. Doctrow S.R. Harry J. Melov S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although not achieving wild type levels of protein or activity, treatment with the highest dose of EUK189 produced an approximate doubling of the levels of the enzyme. A deleterious effect of oxidative stress on complex II levels is manifest in the decreasing activities and abundance of the 30-kDa subunit of the enzyme between mitochondria obtained from wild type, nullizygous animals treated with high and low doses of EUK189, and sod2 nullizygous animals (Fig. 2D). Whether the decreased levels of the 30-kDa subunit in sod2 null animals signal oxidative damage and degradation of active complexes or an oxidant-related inhibition of transcription and/or supply of prosthetic groups (particularly heme and iron-sulfur clusters) needed for assembly of pristine subunits, or a lack of energy to conduct these processes, remains to be determined.

Heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47) is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone that plays an essential role in normal procollagen folding, although its molecular function has not yet been clarified. Recent advances in studies on the binding specificity of HSP47 have revealed that Arg residues at Yaa positions in collagenous Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats are critical for its interactions (Koide, T., Takahara, Y., Asada, S., and Nagata, K.

In the present study, we further examined the client recognition mechanism of HSP47 by taking advantage of systems employing engineered collagen model peptides. First, in vitro binding studies using conformationally constrained collagen-like peptides revealed that HSP47 only recognized correctly folded triple helices and that the interaction with the corresponding single-chain polypeptides was negligible. Second, a binding study using heterotrimeric model clients for HSP47 demonstrated a minimal requirement for the number of Arg residues in the triple helix. Finally, a cross-linking study using photoreactive collagenous peptides provided information about the spatial orientation of an HSP47 molecule in the chaperone-collagen complex. The obtained results led to the development of a new model of HSP47-collagen complexes that differs completely from the previously proposed “flying capstan model” (Dafforn, T.

Nagata K. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 85-114Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This chaperone shows no homology to either other heat-shock proteins or other chaperones but belongs to the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. HSP47 is the only heat-shock protein identified in the secretory pathway to date. Previous hsp47 gene disruption studies have revealed that HSP47 is indispensable for normal procollagen biosynthesis and therefore essential for normal embryogenesis in mice (2Nagai N. Hosokawa M.

Using self-assembling homotrimeric collagen model peptides, HSP47 was shown to interact with Xaa-Arg-Gly sequences in collagen-like triple helices based on Gly-Pro-4-hydroxy-l-proline (Gly-Pro-Hyp) repeats (6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This conclusion was independently confirmed by using genetically engineered homotrimeric procollagens introduced into semipermeabilized cells (8Tasab M. Jenkinson L. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35007-35012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, many types of collagen, such as types I, IV, and V, are comprised of different α-chains that form heterotrimeric triple helices, and HSP47 is also known to interact with these heterotrimeric collagens both in vitro (10Natsume T. Koide T. Yokota S.-i. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31224-31228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (11Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 12Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-i. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The triple-helical (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)n region of type I collagen possesses 34 sites in which all three chains contain Arg residues at the same Yaa positions. There are also nine and eight additional heterotrimeric sites that contain one and two Arg residues, respectively. However, it has not yet been elucidated whether or not such regions with asymmetric Arg residues can serve as binding sites for HSP47. From the structural point of view, HSP47 binding should not require that all three Arg residues pointing out from the triple helix, since serpins (including HSP47) are unlikely to possess a trench that can accommodate all three polypeptide chains of a triple helix. Although HSP47 has been shown to interact with triple-helical clients, it remains unclear whether it solely recognizes the triple-helical conformation or whether it also recognizes single-chain clients as indicated in earlier reports (12Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-i. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper, we address the following three questions regarding the client recognition mechanism of this procollagen-specific molecular chaperone. First, does HSP47 only recognize triple-helical clients, or does it also interact with single-stranded nascent proα-chains? Second, what is the minimal structure of collagen required for HSP47 binding? Third, what is the shape and size of the HSP47-collagen binding interface? To answer these questions, we designed and used various synthetic collagen-like peptides rather than purified native collagen, which is a huge molecule with a lower solubility and a tendency to aggregate. The information obtained led to the development of a new model of HSP47-collagen complexes that differs completely from the previously proposed “flying capstan model” (14Dafforn T.R. Della M. Miller A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49310-49319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Peptides—Peptide chains were constructed manually based on the standard N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based strategy on Rink-amide resins (Novabiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). For p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa)-containing peptides, Fmoc-Bpa-OH (Watanabe Chemical Co. Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan) was used as a precursor of Bpa residues. All Bpa-containing materials were handled in the dark. Peptide cleavage/deprotection was performed by treatment with a standard trifluoroacetic acid-scavenger mixture. For biotinylation, the synthetic peptides were treated with 4.5 equivalents of a Sulfo-NHS-SS-linker (Pierce) in 0.2 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.1) at room temperature for 2 h. Heterologous trimerization of collagenous peptides was achieved by stepwise disulfide bond-forming reactions as described in our previous paper (15Koide T. Nishikawa Y. Takahara Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, a [Cys(Acm), Cys(SH)]-chain was treated with dithiodipyridine to activate the free thiol group. The pyridylthiolated peptide was then heterodimerized, and the S-Acm moiety was converted to an S-3-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl (Npys) group by the treatment with Npys-Cl. Finally, the S-Npys dimer was mixed with a second Cys(SH) peptide to form the heterotrimer. All peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a Cosmosil 5C18 AR-II column (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and characterized by electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry. All the measured masses agreed with the theoretical values. CD Spectrometry—To characterize the conformational states of the synthetic collagen-like peptides, CD spectra of the peptides (1 mg/ml) were recorded using a Jasco J-820 spectropolarimeter as described previously (15Koide T. Nishikawa Y. Takahara Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Prior to these measurements, the peptides were kept at 4 °C at least 2 days. HSP47—Recombinant mouse (4Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and human (16Yokota S.-I. Kubota H. Matsuoka Y. Naitoh M. Hirata D. Minota S. Takahashi H. Fujii N. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) HSP47 were produced and purified essentially as described previously (17Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli (strain JM109) expressing recombinant HSP47 was harvested by centrifugation and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 30% (v/v) glycerol) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence or absence of 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The lysates were loaded onto a gelatin-Sepharose column. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4 m NaCl, the retained HSP47 was eluted with 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 5.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. The HSP47-containing fractions were neutralized to pH 7.4 with 0.5 m NaOH(aq) and applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The flow-through fractions were collected, and their protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The purified HSP47 obtained was used within 1 day. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels and transferred to either a polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with an anti-HSP47 monoclonal antibody (SPA-470; StressGen Biotechnologies, San Diego, CA). For the detection of HSP47, an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody. For the detection of biotinylated proteins, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (SA-HRP; Pierece) was used. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using a peroxidase staining kit (Nacalai Tesque) or an alkaline phosphatase-conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad) as appropriate. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was carried out using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column on an Äkta explorer 10S system (Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots (100 μl) of affinity-purified recombinant human HSP47 were loaded and separated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using 50 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA. Solid-phase Binding (Pull-down) Assay—Peptide immobilization onto CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and solid-phase binding assays were performed as reported previously (6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). E. coli lysates containing recombinant HSP47 protein (100 μl) were mixed with binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), 0.4 m NaCl, 3.7 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20) and 30 μl of the affinity beads. The total reaction volumes were 200 μl. The binding was carried out at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. After washing, the proteins retained on the beads were eluted with 2× Laemmli's SDS-sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue) and separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB). Peptide Binding Assays Based on Fluorescence Quenching—Fluorescence spectra were recorded at 22 °C as described previously (6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Macdonald J.R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25399-25403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A solution of recombinant human HSP47 (60 μg/ml) in 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl was used. The spectra were corrected for dilution. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurement—Binding of recombinant human HSP47 to collagenous peptides was measured at 25 °C using an SPR biosensor (BIACORE 3000; Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). The peptides were covalently immobilized to a CM5 biosensor chip through their α-amino groups at pH 6.5 following the manufacturer's protocol. A surface concentration of about 300 pg/mm2, calculated using 1 resonance unit = 1 pg/mm2, was obtained. Resonance was measured in 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA as a running buffer at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. After each cycle, the chip was regenerated with a 15-s pulse of 0.1 m HCl. The response at equilibrium was corrected for bulk refractive index errors using a mock-coupled flow cell blocked with ethanolamine as a reference flow cell. For competition assays, a solution of HSP47 (final concentration, 2 μm) was premixed with varying concentrations of the competing peptides. The mixtures were injected over immobilized R/R/R peptide (Fig. 2A) until binding equilibrium was achieved. Inhibition of binding was measured as a decrease in the response as a function of the peptide concentration. UV-induced Cross-linking—Recombinant mouse HSP47 (final concentration, 3.4 μm) was mixed with refolded Bpa peptides (final concentration, 17 μm) in 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.4 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. The cross-linking experiments were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates in a final volume of 50 μl. The mixtures were UV-irradiated at 365 nm at a distance of 10 cm for 30 s on ice using a UV irradiator (model L2859-01; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Following the cross-linking reaction, 10 μl of 5× Laemmli's SDS-sample buffer was added to 40 μl of the mixture and heated at 95 °C for 3 min. Oligomeric States of Purified Recombinant HSP47—Recombinant human or mouse HSP47 was readily purified from lysates of E. coli harboring the corresponding expression plasmids by gelatin (or collagen) affinity chromatography essentially as reported previously (17Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). When the protein was prepared under non-reducing conditions, a slowly migrating band of HSP47 (∼130 kDa) was observed in SDS-PAGE gels in addition to the major band corresponding to the monomeric protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 8), consistent with previous reports (9Thomson C.A. Tenni R. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1792-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Dafforn T.R. Della M. Miller A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49310-49319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the larger band was not observed when NEM, an alkylating reagent for thiol groups, was added to the lysis buffer (lanes 3 and 7) or the SDS samples were reduced by dithiothreitol (DTT) (lanes 2 and 6). In the case of chick HSP47, which does not contain any cysteine residues, the oligomeric form was never observed in similar SDS-PAGE analyses (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the larger band represents a disulfide-linked oligomer. Although the estimated size of the disulfide-linked oligomer (∼130 kDa) implies the formation of a trimer of the recombinant HSP47 (molecular mass, 45 kDa), human, and mouse HSP47 only contain one cysteine residue and therefore can only form dimers. The origin of the strange mobility in the gel currently remains unclear. The oligomeric states of recombinant HSP47 under non-denaturing conditions were also analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography. In the chromatographic profile of HSP47 purified in the absence of NEM, the oligomer corresponding to the slowly migrating band on the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 8) appeared as a shoulder peak (Fig. 1B, left panel). This population was also sensitive to subsequent DTT treatment under non-denaturing conditions (data not shown). Consistently, when the sample was prepared in the presence of NEM, most of the HSP47 population appeared in the monomeric fraction and the oligomeric population was negligible (Fig. 1B, right panel). In the following experiments, we used monomeric HSP47 prepared in the presence of NEM. HSP47 Binds to Triple-helical, Not Single-chain, Collagen—A previous study involving immunoprecipitation of HSP47 complexed with genetically engineered procollagen molecules from semipermeabilized cells demonstrated that HSP47 interacts preferentially with triple-helical procollagen molecules (7Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This conformational preference was also supported by results obtained from two-hybrid selection of HSP47 binding collagenous peptides (5Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the difference in the HSP47 binding affinities between triple-helical and random coil clients has not yet been directly compared with date. To elucidate the HSP47 binding conformation of collagen, we used trimeric collagen models and one of their single-chain components (Fig. 2A). Since (Pro-Pro-Gly)2-Pro-Arg-Gly-(Pro-Pro-Gly)2 was reported to be the shortest collagen model that binds to HSP47 in solid-phase binding assays (6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), each peptide chain was designed to contain five repeats of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplet. Only the N-terminal α-amino groups in the bis-cysteinyl chains were left free, to allow immobilization on solid supports in defined molecular orientations. The heterotrimeric peptides were synthesized by a combination of the standard solid-phase method and subsequent regioselective disulfide-bond formation (15Koide T. Nishikawa Y. Takahara Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All the trimeric collagen models were triple-helical at 4 °C as assessed by CD spectrometry, and their melting temperatures (the temperature at which half the triple helix is unfolded) were estimated to be in the range of 37.5-47.2 °C (15Koide T. Nishikawa Y. Takahara Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since N-terminally introduced cystine knots largely contribute to stabilization of the triple-helical conformation, the monomeric counterpart of R/R/R (R-monomer) does not completely fold into the triple-helical conformation even at 4 °C (15Koide T. Nishikawa Y. Takahara Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The conformational preference of HSP47-collagen interactions was analyzed by competition assays using an SPR biosensor. The SPR signal was observed when recombinant HSP47 was injected over a sensor chip containing immobilized R/R/R peptide. The binding was effectively competed by the addition of soluble R/R/R peptide in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, no obvious competition was observed when the R-monomer was used as a competitor (Fig. 2B). Since the competition assays were carried out at 25 °C, a temperature at which the R/R/R-trimer is fully triple-helical and the R-monomer is almost a random coil (15Koide T. Nishikawa Y. Takahara Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the results reveal that HSP47 mainly recognizes triple-helical collagen, while its binding to the single-chain form is negligible. This conclusion was further confirmed by direct binding assays utilizing the fluorescent quenching of intrinsic Trp residues in the chaperone (6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Macdonald J.R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25399-25403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Interaction of HSP47 with Heterotrimeric Collagen Peptides—To elucidate the minimal requirement for the number of Arg residues at Yaa positions in a collagen triple helix, the interactions of HSP47 with trimeric R/R/R, R/R/O, R/O/O, and O/O/O (Fig. 2A) were examined by solid-phase pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 3A, recombinant HSP47 was effectively purified from a lysate of E. coli transformed with an HSP47-expressing vector using R/O/O-immobilized beads (lane 5). This result indicates that only one Arg residue per triple helix is sufficient for the specific interaction. The amount of HSP47 retained on the affinity beads seemed to increase with increasing numbers of Arg residues per trimer (lanes 3-5). A similar result was obtained using HSP47 purified from chick embryos (data not shown). A quantitative analysis was carried out by competition assays on an SPR biosensor. The interaction of recombinant HSP47 with a surface containing immobilized R/R/R was competed by a trimeric peptide containing Arg residues in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the results of the solid-phase pull-down assays, the R/R/R trimer was the strongest competitor and R/O/O also significantly competed with the binding. No obvious competition was observed when the O/O/O trimer was used. The 50% inhibitory concentrations were estimated to be 1.1, 2.8, 8.6, and >100 μm for R/R/R, R/R/O, R/O/O, and O/O/O, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of just one Arg residue at a Yaa position in a short triple helix consisting of Pro-Hyp-Gly repeats has sufficient structural information for a specific interaction with HSP47. UV-induced Cross-linking of HSP47 to Bpa-containing Collagen Peptides—To obtain information regarding the binding interface in HSP47-client complexes, we performed photoaffinity cross-linking utilizing photoreactive Bpa-containing clients (Ref. 19Kauer J.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe H.R. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10695-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 4A). We synthesized self-assembling open-chain collagen peptides that contained Bpa residues for these UV-induced cross-linking experiments (Fig. 4B). Except for the POG peptide used as a negative control (4Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), all the peptides were designed to contain one Pro-Arg-Gly tripeptide unit per molecule, shown to be essential for recognition by HSP47. In peptides B-16 to B14, Bpa residues were introduced at various Xaa and Yaa positions. An N-terminally biotinylated version of B-1 (Bio-B-1) was also prepared to facilitate detection of HSP47-peptide complexes by Western blotting. CD spectrometric analyses of the peptides in aqueous solutions demonstrated that all of them spontaneously associated to form triple helices at 4 °C, the temperature at which all the experiments were performed (data not shown). In a previous study (6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we reported that an amino acid residue in the Xaa position of a Xaa-Arg-Gly sequence does not largely contribute to recognition by HSP47. Therefore, we first examined the specificity of HSP47 binding and UV-induced cross-linking using the B-1 peptide containing a Bpa-Arg-Gly sequence. As shown in Fig. 5A, recombinant HSP47 was effectively purified from a crude E. coli lysate using B-1-immobilized affinity beads (lane 3) as well as using ARG-immobilized beads (lane 4). Photo-induced cross-linking of biotinylated B-1 (Bio-B-1) to HSP47 was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE of UV-irradiated samples (Fig. 5B). Slowly migrating protein bands were only detected on a CBB-stained gel when the HSP47 solution was UV-irradiated in the presence of Bio-B-1 (Fig. 5B, upper panel, lane 4). These bands were characterized to be covalently cross-linked HSP47-peptide complexes, since they were recognized by both SA-HRP and an anti-HSP47 anti-body (Fig. 5B, middle and lower panels). The cross-linking reaction appeared to produce several products, and the differences in the migration of these bands in the gel would be caused by differences in the cross-linking sites on an HSP47 molecule. The specificity of the cross-linking was further confirmed by competition assays. As shown in Fig. 5C, production of cross-linked products was competed out in the presence of 15 equivalents or more of the ARG peptide, a specific competitor. On the other hand, even in the presence of 150 equivalents of the POG peptide, which is not recognized by HSP47, little competition in the UV-induced cross-linking was observed. These results indicate that this photoaffinity cross-linking system is effective for investigating specific interactions between HSP47 and collagen-like peptides. Mapping of the HSP47 Binding Interface in the Collagen Triple Helix—Binding and UV-induced cross-linking between recombinant HSP47 and various Bpa-containing peptides were examined to map the HSP47 binding interface in a collagen triple helix. In solid-phase pull-down assays, all the peptides, except for B-3, appeared to specifically interact with HSP47 (Fig. 6A, upper panel). Slowly migrating cross-linked products were only found in the cases of B-10,B-9,B-7,B-6,B-4,B-1,B2,B3,B5,B6, and B8 after UV irradiation (Fig. 6A, lower panel, lanes 4-15). These results indicate that Bpa residues between positions -10 and 8 are placed very close to the surface of HSP47 molecules in the complexes. The differences in mobility of the cross-linked products between the lanes on the gel would be caused by differences in the sites of the covalent cross-linking (Fig. 6A, lower panel). The relative locations of the cross-linkable amino acid residues were mapped on the crystal structure of a synthetic model peptide for type III collagen, T3-785 (20Kramer R. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In this triple-helical model, the length of the cross-linkable region (positions -10 to 8) was estimated to be 5.3 nm (Fig. 6B, middle). When the longitudinal axis of a serpin molecule was allocated parallel to the common axis of the triple helix, the length of the cross-linkable region matched very well with the length of the serpin (Fig. 6B, left). If the serpin was arranged perpendicular to the triple helix, the length of the binding interface was too short and the curvature of the protein surface would be too large to explain the results of the cross-linking experiments (Fig. 6B, right). Therefore, we strongly suggest that the longer axis of HSP47 is oriented along the helical axis of the collagen triple helix in the chaperone complex. Among the amino acid positions included in the cross-linkable region, only substitution of Hyp-3 with a Bpa residue resulted in complete loss of the HSP47 binding (Fig. 6A, upper panel, lane 9). This observation indicates that the side chain structure of the amino acid at position -3 is also directly recognized by an HSP47 molecule, in addition to the critical Arg residue at position 0. Moreover, HSP47 was shown to discriminate the direction of the triple helix, since a similar replacement of position 3, the symmetrical position of position -3 to the critical Arg residue, did not show any loss of the interaction (Fig. 6A, upper panel, lane 12). Procollagen biosynthesis includes the unique process of triple helix formation, which is not found in other globular proteins. This unique step, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, involves the successive actions of specific chaperones and modifying enzymes. To date, at least three classes of chaperones/enzymes are known to transiently interact with the triple helix-forming region comprised of Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats in procollagens (1Koide T. Nagata K. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 85-114Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4-H) interacts with these Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats before triple helix formation. P4-H not only acts as the principal post-translational modification enzyme for procollagens (21Myllyharju J. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 115-147Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but also functions as a chaperone through its interaction with single-stranded procollagens. The chaperone function of P4-H has been suggested to participate in the quality control mechanism of procollagen biosynthesis by retaining premature or misfolded procollagen molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (22Walmsley A.R. Batten M.R. Lad U. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14884-14892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Peptidyl prolyl cis-trans-isomerases also recognize single-stranded polypeptides of procollagens and catalyze the isomerization of X-Pro or X-Hyp peptide bonds to accelerate propagation of the triple helix (23Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The function of HSP47 is the least elucidated among the procollagen-interacting chaperones, although it was revealed to be indispensable by gene knock-out experiments (2Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It is particularly important to determine the stage of procollagen biosynthesis that involves the interaction with HSP47. Accumulating evidence has indicated that HSP47 recognizes triple-helical clients, and it has been suggested to be involved in the later stage of procollagen folding (4Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Tasab M. Jenkinson L. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35007-35012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Macdonald J.R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25399-25403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, previous papers have reported that HSP47 also interacts with nascent single-chain polypeptides of procollagens (12Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-i. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we directly compared the binding affinities of HSP47 to triple-helical clients and a corresponding single-chain peptide by utilizing conformationally constrained collagen models (Fig. 2). The results clearly demonstrated that HSP47 has a strong conformational preference for triple-helical clients. This finding indicates that HSP47 is unlikely to be involved in events preceding the triple helix formation. In a previous paper, Miller and co-workers (14Dafforn T.R. Della M. Miller A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49310-49319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) proposed a model of HSP47-collagen complexes, designated the flying capstan model, in which each peptide binding site pointing out from a cyclic HSP47 trimer accommodates a single-stranded collagen polypeptide. They further speculated that HSP47 would facilitate triple helix formation by inducing polyproline-II helix formation of each strand. However, none of the data obtained in the present study support this previous model. First, HSP47 is monomeric, and the oligomer is a disulfide-linked product rather than a β-sheet insertion (14Dafforn T.R. Della M. Miller A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49310-49319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Even though the trimer exists and is functional, its population is very minor (Fig. 1). Second, HSP47 is not expected to recognize single-stranded collagen peptides (Fig. 2). Third, the length of the R/R/R trimer, which binds to HSP47 (Fig. 3), is shorter than the length of the longer axis of an HSP47 molecule (Fig. 6). Therefore, it is structurally impossible to create their model. Collectively, we conclude that the flying capstan model is unlikely to be correct. Although x-ray crystallographic analysis is the most straightforward way to solve the structure of HSP47-peptide complexes, the physical characteristics of HSP47 have prevented crystallization in our trial studies. Instead, we have used biochemical analyses to collect information about HSP47-collagen interactions in the present study. Heterotrimeric collagen model peptides tethered by cystine knots have been already applied to analyses of substrate recognition by matrix metalloproteinases (25Ottl J. Gabriel D. Murphy G. Knäuper V. Tominaga Y. Nagase H. Kröger M. Tschesche H. Bode W. Moroder L. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 119-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and α1β1 integrin binding (26Saccà B. Moroder L. J. Pept. Sci. 2002; 8: 192-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Saccà B. Sinner E.-K. Kaiser J. Lübken C. Eble J.A. Moroder L. Chembiochem. 2002; 9: 904-907Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Renner C. Saccà B. Moroder L. Biopolymers,. 2004; 76: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this peptide-based system, we were able to address the question of the minimal requirement for the number of Arg residues at Yaa positions and found that only one Arg residue incorporated in a Yaa position of a Pro-Hyp-Gly repeat provided sufficient structural information for recognition by HSP47 (Fig. 3). Photoaffinity cross-linking is another powerful strategy that is informative for investigating protein-small molecule binding (29Hatanaka Y. Hashimoto M. Kanaoka Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 453-454Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or protein-protein binding (30Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) interfaces. We successfully applied this system to investigate the interface of HSP47-client complexes and determined the orientation of an HSP47 molecule bound to a collagen triple helix (Fig. 6). This analysis also revealed that HSP47 discriminates the direction of the collagen triple helix. Moreover, the results indicated that the side chain structure of the amino acid residue at position -3 is another structural determinant for specific interaction with HSP47, in addition to the critical Arg residue at position 0 (Fig. 6). This dual-site recognition mechanism of HSP47 will be further investigated in the subsequent paper. The obtained results for HSP47-client interactions have led to the development of an alternative model for the chaperone complex. When it is assumed that an HSP47 molecule recognizes an Arg residue (as evidenced by the experiment shown in Fig. 3), a homotrimeric binding site possessing three Arg residues could be surrounded by up to three molecules of HSP47. This model is structurally possible only when the longer axis of each HSP47 molecule is allocated along the common axis of the triple helix (Fig. 6B). The cooperative binding produces a Hill coefficient of about 3 (18Macdonald J.R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25399-25403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), thereby implying the feasibility of this multiple binding model. Our preliminary stoichiometric analysis by fitting the equilibrium HSP47 binding curves for the heterotrimeric peptides also supported this model. 4S. Asada, Y. Takahara, K. Kitagawa, and T. Koide, unpublished data. To create a model for the chaperone complex with higher resolution, it is important to determine the collagen binding site of HSP47 at the amino acid level. For this purpose, we are currently mapping the sites to which cross-links were introduced in the photo cross-linking experiments (Fig. 6A). We are grateful to Prof. Akira Otaka of The University of Tokushima for the electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry measurements."

https://openalex.org/W2078159093,"The human ABO(H) blood group A and B antigens are generated by the homologous glycosyltransferases A (GTA) and B (GTB), which add the monosaccharides GalNAc and Gal, respectively, to the cell-surface H antigens. In the first comprehensive structural study of the recognition by a glycosyltransferase of a panel of substrates corresponding to acceptor fragments, 14 high resolution crystal structures of GTA and GTB have been determined in the presence of oligosaccharides corresponding to different segments of the type I (α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-GlcNAcp-OR, where R is a glycoprotein or glycolipid in natural acceptors) and type II (α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→4)-β-d-GlcNAcp-OR) H antigen trisaccharides. GTA and GTB differ in only four “critical” amino acid residues (Arg/Gly-176, Gly/Ser-235, Leu/Met-266, and Gly/Ala-268). As these enzymes both utilize the H antigen acceptors, the four critical residues had been thought to be involved strictly in donor recognition; however, we now report that acceptor binding and subsequent transfer are significantly influenced by two of these residues: Gly/Ser-235 and Leu/Met-266. Furthermore, these structures show that acceptor recognition is dominated by the central Gal residue despite the fact that the l-Fuc residue is required for efficient catalysis and give direct insight into the design of model inhibitors for GTA and GTB.

Many pathogenic bacteria display a repertoire of glycoconjugates that are comprised of monosaccharides and synthesized by corresponding glycosyltransferases (GTs) 2The abbreviations used are: GTs, glycosyltransferases; GTA, human ABO blood groupα(1→3)N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; GTB, human ABO blood group α(1→3)galactosyltransferase; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; Lac, lactose; βMeLac, β-methyl lactoside; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: GTs, glycosyltransferases; GTA, human ABO blood groupα(1→3)N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; GTB, human ABO blood group α(1→3)galactosyltransferase; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; Lac, lactose; βMeLac, β-methyl lactoside; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. not found in their mammalian hosts, and a number of disease-associated GTs are coming under increasing scrutiny as targets for a new class of therapeutics to treat bacterial (1Lazar K. Walker S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and fungal (2Liu J. Balasubramanian M.K. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2001; 1: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) infections as well as disorders such as diabetes (3Somsak L. Nagya V. Hadady Z. Docsa T. Gergely P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1177-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, structure-function studies on GTs are hampered by the relative paucity of structural data for this important class of enzyme. There is little sequence homology among the hundreds of known GTs. There are currently 79 different families of GTs; but to date, only 20 contain structurally characterized examples (4Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Despite the sequence diversity, common themes have emerged from GT study. For example, all GTs can be classed as either “inverting” or “retaining” depending on whether the anomeric stereochemistry of the donor sugar is changed or conserved during addition. The human ABO(H) blood group A and B antigens are synthesized by the specific GTs A (GTA) and B (GTB), which transfer GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc and Gal from UDP-Gal, respectively, to the H antigen disaccharide α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-OR (where R is a glycoprotein or glycolipid). Individuals with the gene for GTA have blood group A; those with the gene for GTB have blood group B; those with genes for both enzymes or a cis-acting form of GTA or GTB have blood type AB; and those with a mutated inactive form of enzyme have blood group O. GTA and GTB are prototypic retaining GTs and are model probes of this class of enzyme. They are the two most homologous, naturally occurring GTs known to specifically transfer distinct naturally occurring donors and differ only in 4 of 354 amino acid residues: Arg/Gly-176, Gly/Ser-235, Leu/Met-266, and Gly/Ala-268 (5Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Given that these enzymes share the same acceptor, it had been postulated that the four “critical” amino acid differences would impact only donor recognition (5Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). However, studies using GTA/GTB chimeric enzymes showed that donor recognition is significantly influenced only by Leu/Met-266 and Gly/Ala-268 (6Seto N.O.L. Compston C.A. Evans S.V. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Palcic M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The remaining two critical residues (Arg/Gly-176 and Gly/Ser-235) were found to have little effect on donor specificity. This pattern was understood upon the determination of the structures of GTA and GTB in the presence and absence of UDP and the H antigen disaccharide α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-O(CH2)7CH3 (7Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which showed that only Leu/Met-266 and Gly/Ala-268 are positioned to affect donor recognition. Interestingly, Gly/Ser-235 was observed to affect the conformation of the aliphatic tail on the synthetic H antigen substituted at the position at which the disaccharide is normally displayed on cell-surface glycoconjugates, indicating that this residue can influence acceptor recognition despite the acceptor substrate being common to GTA and GTB. In nature, there exist at least four H antigens on glycolipids and glycoproteins that are recognized by GTA and GTB (8Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The most common are the type I H antigen (α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-GlcNAcp-OR) and the type II H antigen (α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→4)-β-d-GlcNAcp-OR) (see Fig. 1). Less common are the type III H antigen (α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→3)-α-d-GalNAcp-OR) and the type IV H antigen (α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-GalNAcp-OR) (9Hakomori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). GTA and GTB can form the terminal A and B antigens, respectively, using any of the H antigen-type acceptors and some fragments of the H antigens. Omitting the (1→4)-β-d-GlcNAc or (1→3)-β-d-GlcNAc residue from the type I or II H antigen trisaccharide (Fig. 1), respectively, creates the so-called “H antigen disaccharide,” which is an excellent acceptor for both GTA and GTB. However, removing the α-l-Fuc residue (to form N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) in the case of the type II H antigen: β-d-Galp-(1→4)-d-GlcNAcp) results in a weak acceptor for GTA, indicating that the fucose residue is essential for efficient catalysis (10Schwyzer M. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2346-2355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the fucose residue was surprising in light of the structures of GTA and GTB determined in the presence of the H antigen disaccharide (7Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), as it is the central galactose residue that forms almost all contacts with the enzyme. This pattern has also been seen in inhibitory analogs of the H antigen, where the galactose residue analog dominates binding, and modification of specific points on the galactose residue can lead to effective inhibition (11Nguyen H.P.

To understand the contribution of each residue of the acceptor to recognition and catalysis and, more specifically, to understand the role of Gly/Ser-235 in differentiating between the two major H antigens, we determined the high resolution structures of GTA and GTB in the presence of several fragments of analogs of the type I and II H antigen acceptors and examined them in conjunction with corresponding kinetic studies. These included the monosaccharide Gal, Gal with a hydrophobic aglycone (referred to as Gal-gr; β-d-Galp-O(CH2)8CO2CH3) (used in kinetic assays), the disaccharide lactose (Lac; β-d-Galp-(1→4)-d-Glcp), the disaccharide β-methyl lactoside (βMeLac; β-d-Galp-(1→4)-β-d-Glcp-OCH3), the disaccharide LacNAc (β-d-Galp-(1→4)-d-GlcNAcp), the trisaccharide type I H antigen (referred to as HI-octyl; α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-GlcNAcp-O(CH2)7CH3), and the trisaccharide type II H antigen (referred to as HII-gr; α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→4)-β-d-GlcNAcp-O-(CH2)8CO2CH3). Crystallography—All enzyme·acceptor complexes were crystallized under conditions similar to used those for the native GTA and GTB enzymes (7Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Acceptor analogs were present in molar excess ranging from 10 to 25, with care taken to ensure that the same concentration of each particular substrate was used for both GTA and GTB. The analogs Gal, Lac, LacNAc, and βMeLac were purchased from Sigma. The remaining analogs were synthesized by Prof. Ole Hindsgaul. Data were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ area detector at distances of 72 mm and exposure times between 4.0 and 5.0 min for 0.5° oscillations and processed with d* TREK (14Pflugrath J.W.

X-rays were produced by a MM-002 generator (Rigaku/MSC) coupled to Osmic Blue confocal x-ray mirrors with power levels of 30 watts (Osmic Inc.). The crystals were frozen and maintained under cryogenic conditions at a temperature of -160 °C using a Cryostream 700 crystal cooler (Oxford Cryosystems). All structures were solved using molecular replacement techniques with wild-type GTA or GTB (Protein Data Bank accession codes 1LZ0 and 1LZ7, respectively) as a starting model and were subsequently refined using the program CNS (15Brunger A.T.

The relative rates of transfer were determined using a radiochemical assay with the hydrophobic acceptors α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-O(CH2)7CH3 (referred to as HA-octyl), Gal-gr, β-d-Galp-(1→4)-β-d-Glcp-O(CH2)8CO2CH3 (referred to as Lac-gr), β-d-Galp-(1→4)-β-d-GlcNAcp-O(CH2)8CO2CH3 (referred to as LacNAc-gr), HI-octyl, and HII-gr. Assays were carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 12 μl containing 1 mm acceptor, 1 mm UDP-Gal or UDP-GalNAc donor, and enzyme in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20 mm MnCl2. For relative rate measurements, 520 ng of GTA and 440 ng of GTB were used with incubation times ranging from 30 to 120 min. Kinetics for HI-octyl and HII-gr were determined by varying the acceptor concentrations with the donor concentration fixed at 5 mm; the assays contained 52 ng of GTA or 44 ng of GTB at incubation times of 90 and 60 min, respectively. Kinetic measurements for HA-octyl were carried out with 10-fold less enzyme and half of the reaction times. The initial rate conditions were linear with no more than 10% of the substrate consumed. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis of the Michaelis-Menten equation with the GraphPad PRISM Version 3.0 program. Preparative Reactions—To ensure that products were formed with the lactoside acceptor, a small-scale reaction containing Lac-gr (5.7 mg, 11 μmol), UDP-Gal donor (12.6 mg, 19.6 μmol), GTB (1.8 units), and alkaline phosphatase (2 units) in 1 ml of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 2 mm MnCl2 was incubated at ambient temperature with gentle rotation for 6 days. The product was isolated by application of the mixture to a Sep-Pak reverse-phase cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 100 ml of water to remove the donor, enzyme, and buffer, and the product was eluted with 10 ml of high pressure liquid chromatography-grade methanol. The solvent was evaporated to yield a residue, which was redissolved in water (2 ml) and passed through a Millipore Millex filter (0.22 μm). Lyophilization furnished a product that was shown to contain α1-3-linked Gal by 1H NMR analysis. To confirm transfer to LacNAc, a mixture of LacNAc-gr (4 mg, 7.2 μmol), UDP-Gal donor (7.1 mg, 11 μmol), GTB (3.6 units), and alkaline phosphatase (2.8 units) in 0.8 ml of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 2 mm MnCl2 was incubated at ambient temperature with gentle rotation for 6 days. The product was isolated and characterized as described above and shown to contain α1-3-linked Gal by 1H NMR analysis. A mixture of LacNAc-gr (2.8 mg, 5 μmol), UDP-GalNAc donor (3.3 mg, 5 μmol), GTA (4.5 units), and alkaline phosphatase (0.6 units) in 0.5 ml of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albuminand 2 mm MnCl2 was incubated at ambient temperature with gentle rotation for 20 days. The product was isolated and characterized as described above and shown to contain α1-3-linked GalNAc by 1H NMR analysis. The details of data collection and refinement results for the enzyme complexes are provided in Table 1 for GTA and Table 2 for GTB. GTA and GTB were both crystallized in the presence of seven acceptor fragments: Gal, Gal-gr, Lac, LacNAc, βMeLac, HI-octyl, and HII-gr. The 14 possible complex structures are GTA·Gal, GTA·Gal-gr, GTA·Lac, GTA·βMeLac, GTA·LacNAc, GTA·HI-octyl, GTA·HII-gr, GTB·Gal, GTB·Gal-gr, GTB·Lac, GTB·βMeLac, GTB·LacNAc, GTB·HI-octyl, and GTB·HII-gr. Diffraction data were collected to a maximum resolution of 1.85-1.49 Å, with final Rwork ranging from 0.197 to 0.211 and Rfree ranging from 0.220 to 0.236. All structures show excellent electron density along the entire length of the polypeptide chain with the exception of the disordered loop (amino acids ∼175-195) and the 10 C-terminal amino acid residues, both of which are also disordered in the native GTA/GTB structures (7Patenaude S.I.

The electron density observed surrounding the acceptor fragments is shown in Fig. 2. Of the 14 possible complex structures, electron density corresponding to the acceptor fragments was seen in every complex except GTA·Lac and GTA·βMeLac. Like the H antigen disaccharide (7Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct.

The Gal, Lac, and LacNAc acceptor analog fragments were purchased commercially and do not possess alkyl tails; consequently, each of these substrates contains reducing sugar residues that can exist in solution in either the α-or β-anomer.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement results for crystals of GTA soaked with acceptor analogsGTA·GalGTA·Gal-grGTA·LacGTA·LacNAcGTA·βMeLacGTA·HI-octylGTA·HII-grData collectionResolution (Å)20 to 1.5920 to 1.6420 to 1.5720 to 1.6920 to 1.5920 to 1.5520 to 1.85Space group (Å)C2221C2221C2221C2221C2221C2221C2221a52.752.5752.752.4952.6252.5552.4b149.5149.57149.4149.21150.1149.81150.1c79.679.3979.679.3279.5579.9379.2Rmerge (%)aRmerge=∑|Iobs−Iave|/∑Iave.4.0 (20.0)bValues in parentheses represent the highest resolution shell.4.4 (29.6)4.9 (37.8)5.5 (37.9)4.6 (34.4)4.6 (34.2)4.5 (32.0)Completeness (%)96.3 (92.9)97.0 (94.2)98.5 (95.8)99.9 (100.0)99.1 (96.2)99.6 (99.0)99.7 (100.0)Unique reflections41,11437,60643,59535,26142,34445,98727,035RefinementRwork (%)cRwork=∑∥Fo|−|Fc∥/∑|Fo|.19.820.620.520.921.021.120.4Rfree (%)cRwork=∑∥Fo|−|Fc∥/∑|Fo|.d10% of the reflections were omitted for Rfree calculations.22.022.622.823.423.222.623.6No. water molecules23823523820022.7213155r.m.s.er.m.s., root mean square. bond (Å)0.00480.00490.00500.00490.00510.00500.0050r.m.s. angle1.30°1.42°1.31°1.31°1.34°1.36°1.32°〈B 〉 for acceptor analog (Å2)36.338.852.854.453.0PDB code1ZHJ1ZJO1ZI11ZI32A8W1ZI51ZI4a Rmerge=∑|Iobs−Iave|/∑Iave.b Values in parentheses represent the highest resolution shell.c Rwork=∑∥Fo|−|Fc∥/∑|Fo|.d 10% of the reflections were omitted for Rfree calculations.e r.m.s., root mean square.

Open table in a new tab Gal Monosaccharide—The Gal monosaccharide was observed to bind in the active sites of both GTA and GTB in the β-anomeric form, which corresponds to the anomeric conformation of the corresponding Gal residue of the H antigens. However, electron density maps and refined isotropic temperature factors indicate a significantly lower occupancy of the Gal residue in GTA, although the substrate is visible (Fig. 2a). With one exception, the contacts between the Gal residue and the enzymes were as observed previously for the H antigen disaccharide (7Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), where the O-4 hydroxyl group forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of His-233 and Glu-303; the O-6 hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Thr-245; and the monosaccharide interacts with the hydrophobic face of Trp-300 (Fig. 3). The exception to the pattern of interactions reported for the H antigen disaccharide (7Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) is a water molecule that bridges the O-3 and O-4 hydroxyl groups of Gal and the side chain of Glu-303. This bridging water molecule was observed in the GTB·Gal complex, but not in the GTA·Gal complex due to the change of the critical residue 266 from methionine to leucine (Fig. 3). Gal-gr (β-d-Galp-O(CH2)8CO2CH3)—Well defined electron density for the Gal residue with the 8-methoxycarbonyloctyl aglycone was observed in GTA·Gal-gr and GTB·Gal-gr (data not shown). The Gal contacts correspond to those reported for the native H antigen disaccharide (see Fig. 5c). The aliphatic tail (required for product purification) is curled into the active site normally occupied by the l-Fuc residue, but does not contribute any hydrogen bonds. Lac Disaccharide (β-d-Galp-(1→4)-d-Glcp)—Well defined electron density for the α-anomer of Lac was observed only in GTB·Lac (Fig. 2b). The Gal contacts for Lac correspond to those reported for the native H antigen disaccharide. The Glc residue displays only a single hydrogen bond to the enzyme, between the O-1′ hydroxyl group and the side chain of the critical residue Ser-235 (Fig. 4a). Very weak electron density was observed in the acceptor recognition site of the GTA·Lac complex (Fig. 2b). LacNAc Disaccharide (β-d-Galp-(1→4)-d-GlcNAcp)—As with the co-crystallizations with Lac, well defined electron density for LacNAc was observed only in the GTB·LacNAc complex (Fig. 2c). The contacts with the Gal residue in the GTB·LacNAc complex (Fig. 4d) were as observed in the GTB·Lac, GTB·Gal, and H antigen disaccharide complexes (7Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The GlcNAc residue in the LacNAc complex is in a somewhat different conformation compared with the corresponding residue in the Lac complex, with the result that the single hydrogen bond from the critical residue Ser-235 is with the O-3′ hydroxyl group. The electron density for the LacNAc residue in the GTA·LacNAc complex was fragmented, but more clearly visible than that for GTA·Lac (Fig. 2c). The bridging water molecule observed in all GTB complexes was again not observed in GTA·LacNAc (Fig. 4c). β-MeLac Disaccharide (β-d-Galp-(1→4)-β-d-Glcp-OCH3)—Like the co-crystallizations with Lac and LacNAc, well defined electron density for βMeLac was observed only in the GTB·βMeLac complex (data not shown). The contacts for βMeLac in the GTB·βMeLac complex (Fig. 4b) were as observed in the GTB·Lac and GTB·LacNAc complexes. HI-octyl Trisaccharide (α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-GlcNAcp-OR)—Electron density corresponding to the type I H antigen trisaccharide acceptor was observed in both GTA and GTB (Fig. 2d). The Gal contacts with the enzyme in both GTA and GTB were as described above, with both enzymes showing the water molecule bridging the O-3′ and O-4′ hydroxyl groups of Gal and the side chain of Glu-303 (Fig. 5a). Some disorder is present for both the Fuc and GlcNAc residues in both GTA·HI-octyl and GTB·HI-octyl, but this disorder is more pronounced in the GTA·HI complex. As with the H antigen disaccharide, the fucose residue displays only a single hydrogen bond to Asp-326. HII-gr Trisaccharide (α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→4)-β-d-Glc-NAcp-OR)—Electron density corresponding to the type II H antigen trisaccharide acceptor was observed in both GTA and GTB (Fig. 2e). The Gal contacts with the enzyme in both GTA and GTB were as described above, including the bridging water molecule (Fig. 5b). Unambiguous electron density is present for both the Fuc and Gal residues in GTA·HII-gr; however, the GlcNAc residue is disordered. GTB·HII-gr displays unambiguous density for all three of the carbohydrate residues and a number of water molecules that bridge the acceptor and protein. Kinetics—The relative rates of transfer for GTA and GTB with each of the acceptor fragments relative to the H antigen disaccharide are shown in Table 3. The kinetic constants determined with the respective donors (5 mm) for both GTA and GTB are shown in Table 4. The relative rates of transfer to non-fucosylated acceptors agree with those in the early report by Schwyzer and Hill (10Schwyzer M. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2346-2355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with GTA from porcine submaxillary glands; they noted low rates of transfer to galactose and other galactoside acceptors. Removal of fucose dramatically reduces the rate of transfer. To ensure that the low rates of transfer observed in the radiochemical analysis correspond to product formation, we determined that α1-3-linked products were formed by transfer to Lac-NAc-gr (both GTA and GTB) and Lac-gr (GTB).TABLE 3Relative rates of transfer at substrate concentrations of 1 mm for the acceptor and respective donors as a percent of the HA-octyl disaccharide (α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-O(CH2)7 CH3)Acceptor fragmentGTAGTBGal-gr2.00.52Lac-gr0.480.21LacNAc-gr0.300.16HA-octyl100100HI-octyl4169HII-gr7990 Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Kinetic constants determined at 5 mm nucleotide sugar donorGTAGTBKmkcatkmkcatμms−1μms−1HA-octyl87 ± 67.6 ± 0.322 ± 33.5 ± 0.05HI-octyl1300 ± 1401.3 ± 0.11600 ± 1800.5 ± 0.1HII-gr490 ± 501.8 ± 0.1184 ± 231.2 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab Two Critical Residues Dramatically Alter the Stability of the Acceptor Recognition Site—In the 12 complex structures in which substrate is observed, the overwhelming bulk of interactions is with the Gal residue; however, the most striking feature is the systematic difference with which GTA and GTB bind each of these substrates. Although the enzymes share the H antigens as a common acceptor, the structures presented in this work show that two of the four critical amino acid residue differences between GTA and GTB (originally thought to affect only donor preference) significantly influence the stability of the acceptor in its recognition site. Despite the crystals being grown under the same conditions and with the same substrate concentrations, each of the antigen fragments shows higher occupancy and order in GTB than in GTA (Fig. 2). This can be correlated with interactions involving the two critical residues Gly/Ser-235 and Leu/Met-266. The structures can be grouped according to the critical residue with which they have significant contact, where the Gal monosaccharides contact only Leu/Met-266 (Fig. 3); the Lac and Lac-NAc disaccharides interact with Leu/Met-266 and Gly/Ser-235 (Fig. 4); and HI-octyl and HII-gr interact with Leu/Met-266, Gly/Ser-235, and the residues involved in l-Fuc recognition (Fig. 5). The differential impact of residue 266 on the ability of GTA and GTB to bind the antigen fragments is evident in the complexes of Gal, Lac, and LacNAc (Figs. 3 and 4), where the bulkier side chain of Met-266 in GTB positions a water molecule to bridge between Gal and the side chain of Glu-303. This bridging water molecule is shifted in GTA, where the smaller side chain of Leu-266 allows it to be displaced from Glu-303 to form interactions with two other water molecules (Figs. 3 and 4c). Similarly, the Lac and LacNAc structures are influenced by Gly/Ser-235, which in GTB is able to form a hydrogen bond with the Glc and GlcNAc residues, respectively, but can make no such bond in GTA. Together, these two interactions result in an almost complete lack of electron density for Lac and βMeLac in GTA. The question of the position of the bridging water molecule in GTA versus GTB does not arise when examining the structure of antigen fragments containing the l-Fuc residue (Fig. 5), as this water molecule is displaced by the fucose residue into its bridging position in both enzymes. This is also seen in the Gal-gr structures, where the aliphatic tail is curled into the position normally occupied by the fucose residue (Fig. 5a). GTA and GTB Show a Lack of Complementarity to the Third Acceptor Residue—The Lac and LacNAc substrates used in the crystallization experiments contain a reducing Glc and GlcNAc residue, respectively, that can mutarotate between the α- and β-anomers. The electron density of these bound substrates shows clearly that the α-anomer is selected by GTB in both Glc (in Lac) and GlcNAc (in LacNAc), even though the GlcNAc residue of the natural acceptors is substituted in the β-anomeric form. This selection of the sterically disfavored α-anomer of Lac in GTB is due to a direct hydrogen bond between the anomeric hydroxyl and O-γ of Ser-235. Surprisingly, GTB also binds the α-anomer of LacNAc without forming the corresponding hydrogen bond with the anomeric hydroxyl group. Crystallization with βMeLac, which corresponds to the natural antigens with the glycosidic linkage in the β-anomeric conformation, revealed no interaction between the Glc residue and Ser-235 in GTB. Like Lac, βMeLac was not observed bound to GTA. In fact, the Glc/GlcNAc residues of the Lac, LacNAc, and βMeLac substrates bound to GTB display distinct conformations. The difference with which GTA and GTB interact with the Glc/GlcNAc residue demonstrates the lack of specificity of the enzymes toward this part of the antigen. This forgiving fit between the enzyme and the Glc/GlcNAc residue in Lac/LacNAc/βMeLac is necessary given the range of natural H antigen acceptor structures that are recognized by GTA and GTB. This is seen particularly in the structures of the two major H antigens in complex with GTA and GTB (Fig. 5, a and b). The different glycosidic linkages with the GlcNAc residue (β1-3 in the type I H antigen and β1-4 in the type II H antigen) (Fig. 1) (19Clausen H. Hakomori S. Vox Sang. 1989; 56: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) result in significantly different conformations for this residue, requiring different sets of interactions with Gly/Ser-235. As with the other complexes, there is incomplete electron density corresponding to the HI-octyl and HII-gr antigens in GTA, whereas the corresponding electron density in GTB is unambiguous. This can again be traced to the critical residue Gly/Ser-235. For GTB·HI-octyl, Ser-235 hydrogen bonds to the O-6 hydroxyl group of the GlcNAc residue. For GTB·HII-gr, the side chain of Ser-235 stabilizes a network of water molecules that bridge to the HII-gr antigen GlcNAc residue. There is no hydrogen bond or water network present about Gly-235 in the GTA complexes, resulting in poorly defined electron density for the entire HI-octyl and HII-gr antigens in GTA, particularly the GlcNAc residue. GTA and GTB Display Different Transfer Kinetics toward the Same Acceptor Fragments—Given the expected low transfer rates for the antigen fragments lacking the l-Fuc residue, the determination of complete kinetic parameters for these substrates was not possible. Only the relative rates of transfer for the synthetic acceptor analogs are presented in Table 3. The rates are normalized to those observed for GTA and GTB to the H antigen disaccharide acceptor HA-octyl and their respective donors. Overall, the results agree with the general conclusion of Schwyzer and Hill (10Schwyzer M. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2346-2355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the l-Fuc residue is required for efficient catalysis. However, significant detail has emerged regarding the ability of the enzymes to discriminate between the type I and II H antigen trisaccharides. Both antigen trisaccharides displayed decreased activity compared with the disaccharide, but the greatest decrease was for HI-octyl, which showed relative rates of 41 and 69% for GTA and GTB, respectively. HII-gr displayed transfer rates of 79 and 90%. The antigens lacking the l-Fuc residue (Lac-gr, LacNAc-gr, and Gal-gr) all showed markedly reduced rates of transfer compared with the H antigen disaccharide. The highest observed rate of transfer in this group (of 2%) was to Gal-gr in GTA, which was unexpected, as the Gal residue is among the least specific acceptor analogs possible. To help explain this observation, we determined the structures of GTA and GTB in the presence of Gal-gr. Although the Gal residue occupies the same position in the active site (Fig. 5c), the aliphatic tail curls into the space normally occupied by l-Fuc, especially in GTA. This occupation of the catalytically required l-Fuc site for Gal-gr bound to GTA may explain the higher observed rate of transfer. The kinetic constants determined for transfer of the respective donors to the H antigen disaccharide and trisaccharides (which contain the l-Fuc residue) are presented in Table 4. The Km for the H antigen acceptor is somewhat lower for GTB than for GTA (22 versus 87 μm), which might be attributed to the Leu/Met-266 interaction (7Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar); however, the Km for type I and II H antigen acceptors dramatically increased for both enzymes. HI-octyl was the most affected, with Km values of 1300 and 1600 μm in GTA and GTB, respectively. Detailed two-substrate kinetics with HI-octyl and HII-gr were not possible because insufficient material was available for such studies given the high Km values observed. The discrepancies between the relative rates of transfer and the kinetic data are consistent with higher HI-octyl and HII-gr α-values for GTA compared with GTB, where α-values reflect the effect that the binding of one substrate has on the other (6Seto N.O.L. Compston C.A. Evans S.V. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Palcic M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Marcus S.L. Polakowski R. Seto N.O.L. Leinala E.

Caution must always be exercised in drawing any direct correlations between a resting crystal structure and kinetic data; however, it must be noted that the elevated Km values for HI-octyl relative to HII-gr are consistent with the decreased contacts due to the higher observed disorder of fucose with GTA and GTB (Fig. 2d). Similarly, the observed decrease in the type I over type II H antigen relative activity for both GTA and GTB is consistent with the observed electron density because the Fuc residue has been shown to be required for efficient catalysis (10Schwyzer M. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2346-2355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the systematically lower occupancies of the H antigen fragments and analogs bound to GTA also suggest that the A antigen products might be less tightly bound to the enzyme than the corresponding B antigen products, which explains the generally higher turnover rates observed for GTA versus GTB. The differential ability of GTA and GTB to utilize the type I and II H antigen acceptors raises the possibility that these preferences may also be reflected in vivo; however, there are no comprehensive studies to date on the relative distribution of type I and II H antigens between the ABO(H) A and B blood groups. Dominance of the Gal Residue and Generation of Prototypic Inhibitors—The central Gal residue in each of the observed H antigen fragments in complex with GTA or GTB forms the majority of interactions observed between the enzyme and acceptor substrate, which is the same hydrogen bonding pattern as the original H antigen disaccharide structure (7Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This is surprising, as the l-Fuc residue has been known for some time to be essential for efficient catalysis (10Schwyzer M. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2346-2355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it provides key insight into experiments to generate prototypic inhibitors of these enzymes. Initial designs of inhibitors of GTA and GTB were made in the absence of any structural information concerning GTs and consisted of chemical modification of hydroxyl groups on the central galactose residue of HA-octyl (12Lowary T.L. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Lowary T.L. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 251: 33-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These studies have provided some of the few GT·inhibitor complexes available (11Nguyen H.P. Seto N.O.L. Cai Y. Leinala E. Borisova N. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49191-49195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study, both enzymes have been shown to form an overwhelming number of interactions with the Gal residue such that its location in the active site is reproduced regardless of the other substituted saccharides. Similarly, both enzymes have been shown to only loosely recognize the GalNAc residues of the antigen trisaccharides, and so future prototypic inhibitor studies will be focused on modifying the essential fucose residue. Conclusions—The critical residues Leu/Met-266 and Gly/Ser-235 in GTA and GTB were previously believed to be involved strictly in donor recognition, but we have demonstrated that they have a significant differential impact on the binding of acceptor substrates. Although Leu-266 in GTA and Met-266 in GTB affect only the central galactose residue common to all acceptor fragments used, Gly/Ser-235 clearly causes the enzymes to discriminate among the glycoconjugate structures that display the common H antigen disaccharide acceptor, leading to the prediction that this discrimination will be reflected in vivo. we thank Ole Hindsgaul for the synthetic Gal-gr, HI-octyl, and HII-gr acceptor analogs and Ash Richardson for software development."

Chronic anti-insulin responses are consistent with GH-induced insulin resistance (1.Davidson M.B. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 2.Clemmons D.R. Pituitary. 2002; 5: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas acute responses can be “insulin-like” (1.Davidson M.B. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Because changes in gene expression underlie many actions of GH, one can gain insight into the distinctive timing of metabolic responses to GH by identifying genes regulated by GH at different times. Genes regulated by GH in cultured 3T3-F442A adipocytes were analyzed, because these cells exhibit metabolic responses typical of in vivo responses to GH, including insulin resistance (1.Davidson M.B. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 3.Foster C.M. Hale P.M. Jing H.-W. Schwartz J. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanisms controlling GH-regulated gene expression have been studied in several genes, including Fos (c-fos), which encodes a transcription factor implicated in growth regulation (4.Piwien-Pilipuk G. Huo J.S. Schwartz J. J. Pediat. Endo. Metab. 2002; 15: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); Spi2.1, which encodes serine protease inhibitor 2.1 (5.Le Cam A. Pantescu V. Paquereau L. Legraverend C. Fauconnier G. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21532-21539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and Igf1, which encodes insulin-like growth factor 1, which mediates many of the growth-promoting effects of GH (6.Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 7.Wang Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10955-10963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors have been identified that mediate GH-regulated gene expression, including signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, 3, 5a, and 5b, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), and Elk-1 (4.Piwien-Pilipuk G. Huo J.S. Schwartz J. J. Pediat. Endo. Metab. 2002; 15: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to analysis of individual target genes for information on transcription, this study took a global approach to identify GH-regulated transcriptional mechanisms.Microarrays provide a tool by which changes in expression of thousands of genes can be measured simultaneously. Here, microarray analysis identified 561 probe sets representing adipocyte genes regulated by GH, including many not previously identified as being GH-responsive. Examining temporal patterns of gene expression provided insight into mechanisms potentially regulating metabolic responses of adipocytes to GH, and involvement of GH in other physiological events.Profiles of GH-regulated genes in adipocytes were used to examine whether GH-regulated genes with similar expression patterns share similar mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and corresponding functional regulatory sites in their promoters. Computational methods were applied to sequences of GH-regulated genes to identify potential binding sites for transcription factors in conserved sequences of the promoters of genes sharing similar temporal patterns of gene expression in response to GH (8.Wasserman W.W. Sandelin A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Hierarchical clustering of microarray data from 3T3-F442A adipocytes treated with GH for different times identified clusters of genes sharing similar temporal patterns of response to GH. One cluster contains highly GH-responsive genes encoding activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 45 gamma (GADD45γ). Gibbs motif sampling (9.Thompson W. Rouchka E.C. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3580-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) was used to search for conservation in the promoters of Atf3 and Gadd45γ among human, mouse, and rat sequences, leading to the prediction of a novel binding site for C/EBPβ in the Atf3 promoter. Analysis of binding to the predicted ATF3 C/EBP site and its ability to mediate transcriptional activation support a role for C/EBPβ in GH-stimulated Atf3 promoter activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—3T3-F442A cells were provided by Dr. H. Green (Harvard University) and Dr. M. Sonenberg (Sloan-Kettering). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing rat GH receptor (GHR) containing the N-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain (GHR1–454, referred to as CHO-GHR cells) (10.Moller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by Drs. Gunnar Norstedt (Karolinska Inst.) and Nils Billestrup (Steno Diabetes Center). 293T cells were provided by Dr. M. Lazar (University of Pennsylvania). Recombinant human GH was provided as a gift from Eli Lilly, Inc. Culture medium, calf serum, fetal calf serum, insulin, l-glutamine, and antibiotic-antimycotic were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum for use in differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells into adipocytes was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals. Bovine serum albumin (bovine serum albumin, CRG7) was purchased from Intergen. Dexamethasone and isobutylmethylxanthine were purchased from Sigma. The Acetyl histone H4 Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay kit was purchased from Upstate. Formaldehyde was purchased from Sigma. Immobilized Protein A was purchased from Repligen, sonicated salmon sperm DNA from Stratagene, and the PCR Purification Kit from Qiagen. Luciferin was purchased from Promega, and β-galactosidase chemiluminescence reagents from Tropix. [α-32P]dATP was purchased from ICN.Cell Culture and Hormone Treatment—3T3-F442A preadipocytes, CHO-GHR cells, and 293T cells were grown, and 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were differentiated into adipocytes, as described previously (11.Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31597-31604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For experiments involving treatment with GH, cells were deprived of serum overnight in the appropriate medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin instead of serum. Cells were then incubated with or without GH at 500 ng/ml (22 nm) for the indicated times. To control for potential effects of serum starvation as well as account for the survival effects of GH, RNA was harvested from corresponding sets of untreated and GH-treated adipocytes at each time point.Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from control and GH-treated adipocytes using RNA Stat60 (Tel-Test B, Inc.) and RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. For microarray analysis, preparation of cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the mouse genome U74Av2 oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol by the Cell and Molecular Biology Core of the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center. The arrays were scanned at 3 μm with a GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). Affymetrix® MicroArray Suite Version 5.0 (MASv5.0) software was used to analyze the .cel files. RNA was prepared and analyzed separately in three independent experiments.Probe sets considered differentially expressed in response to GH were identified based on p values obtained through application of the Wilcoxon's signed rank test as implemented in MASv5.0. Expressed probe sets were considered to be changed by GH if the probe set, for at least one time point, was both significantly expressed (present) in the adipocytes (p < 0.025) and also showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) changes in response to GH in the same direction in all three experiments. Thresholds for expression and for changes in response to GH were based on p values observed for 7 genes (Atf3, Bcl6, Cish, Ccl6 (C-10), Fos, Gadd45γ, and Igf1 (data not shown)) measured on microarray that were confirmed by QT-PCR to be GH-responsive. Because in many cases multiple probe sets identify the same gene, the number of unique transcripts identified is smaller than the number of probe sets identified. Clusters of probe sets sharing similar patterns of expression over time in response to GH were identified by average linkage hierarchical clustering using the Cluster and Treeview Software packages (12.Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13138) Google Scholar, 13.de Hoon M.J. Imoto S. Nolan J. Miyano S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2302) Google Scholar).Semi-quantitative Real-time PCR—Expression of Atf3 and Gadd45γ mRNA was confirmed by QT-PCR using SYBR green I (Applied Biosystems) and the iCycler system with iCycler iQ Real-time Detection System software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Sequences of probes and primers were as follows: for murine Atf3, 5′-CGAAGACTGGAGCAAAATGATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGGTTAGCAAAATCCTCAAATAC-3′ (reverse) (14.Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); for murine Gadd45γ, 5′-TGCTGGCTGCCGATGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACGCCTGAATCAACGTGAAAT-3′ (reverse) (designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems)), for murine Gapdh, 5′-ATGTTCCAGTATGACTCCACTCACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAGACACCAGTAGACTCCACGACA-3′ (reverse) (15.LeCouter J. Lin R. Frantz G. Zhang Z. Hillan K. Ferrara N. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2606-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All readings were normalized to Gapdh, which is not responsive to GH under the conditions used. Relative gene expression is expressed as GH-treated/control. Statistical analysis of combined experiments by t test compared increments above control due to GH at each time point.Functional Classification of GH-responsive Genes—To classify the functions of genes differentially expressed by GH, genes were sorted based on categories defined by the Biological Process Ontology of the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy (16.Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. Harris M.A. Hill D.P. Issel-Tarver L. Kasarskis A. Lewis S. Matese J.C. Richardson J.E. Ringwald M. Rubin G.M. Sherlock G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26341) Google Scholar), using two tools, the Affymetrix NetAffx GO Mining Tool (Affymetrix) (17.Cheng J. Sun S. Tracy A. Hubbell E. Morris J. Valmeekam V. Kimbrough A. Cline M.S. Liu G. Shigeta R. Kulp D. Siani-Rose M.A. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1462-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the GenMAPP2 software package (Gladstone Inst., University of California at San Francisco) (18.Doniger S.W. Salomonis N. Dahlquist K.D. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Affymetrix NetAffx GO Mining Tool, containing the December 2004 Affymetrix GeneChip annotations, determines whether a given biological function is statistically overrepresented by calculating χ2 score-derived p values. The GenMAPP2 analysis uses a hypergeometric distribution to calculate standardized difference scores (Z-scores) as a measure of the statistical significance, and non-parametric methods to calculate the permute p value. Of categories identified by both tools as significantly overrepresented (p < 0.01), those containing at least 2% of the total number of GH-regulated probe sets are discussed.Identification of Potential Regulatory Elements in Atf3 and Gadd45γ Promoters—To identify potential regulatory elements in the Atf3 and Gadd45γ promoters, conserved sequences were identified from orthologous human, mouse, and rat Atf3 and Gadd45γ promoters. Sequences were obtained using the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (19.Karolchik D. Baertsch R. Diekhans M. Furey T.S. Hinrichs A. Lu Y.T. Roskin K.M. Schwartz M. Sugnet C.W. Thomas D.J. Weber R.J. Haussler D. Kent W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar) spanning 2500 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream of the transcription start site documented in Genome Browser. The Gibbs Motif Sampler was used to search for regions of conservation using subsequence lengths (8–25 bp), with 106 iterations for each of 10 random number seeds (9.Thompson W. Rouchka E.C. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3580-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).Plasmids and Antibodies—A plasmid containing the human Atf3 promoter (–2050 to +34) upstream of the luciferase gene (referred to as WT ATF3-Luc) was constructed in the vector pXP2 (from A. Seasholtz, University of Michigan) (20.Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). The Atf3 promoter sequence from the –2050 to +34 region of plasmid pLuc-1850 Atf3-luciferase (21.Cai Y. Zhang C. Nawa T. Aso T. Tanaka M. Oshiro S. Ichijo H. Kitajima S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (from S. Kitajima, Tokyo Medical and Dental University) was cut out using Hin-dIII and ligated into pXP2. ATF3-Luc with a mutation in the predicted C/EBP site (wt: TTGCATCACCA, mut: TTGGTGCACCA) was constructed from WT-ATF3-Luc using the QuikChange II XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and is referred to as mC/EBP ATF3-Luc. The mutation was based on an inactivating mutation in the C/EBP site in the gene for interleukin-6 (22.Eickelberg O. Pansky A. Mussmann R. Bihl M. Tamm M. Hildebrand P. Perruchoud A.P. Roth M. J.

The plasmid for full-length rat C/EBPβ driven by the CMV promoter (referred to as CMV-C/EBPβ) was a gift from U. Schibler (University of Geneva) and L. Sealy (Vanderbilt University). The vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, from K. Guan, University of Michigan), in which the CMV-C/EBPβ vector was constructed, was used to normalize total amounts of transfected DNA. The plasmid for full-length rat GHR was from N. Billestrup (Steno Diabetes Center). Antibody against a peptide in the C terminus of C/EBPβ (C-19), antibody against the N terminus of RNA polymerase II (pol II) (N-20), and normal rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-acetyl-histone-H4 was purchased from Upstate.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—For preparing extracts enriched in C/EBPβ, 293T cells in 100-mm plates were transfected as described previously (23.Piwien-Pilipuk G. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44557-44565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with plasmids encoding C/EBPβ (1 μg), and cell extracts were prepared as previously described (24.Piwien-Pilipuk G. Van Mater D. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from 3T3-F442A adipocytes at designated times after GH treatment and EMSA was performed as described previously (25.Liao J. Hodge C.L. Meyer D.J. Ho P.S. Rosenspire K.C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25951-25958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes contained the following sequences: predicted Atf3 C/EBP site: 5′-CGAACTTGCATCACCAGTGCCC-3′; Gadd45γ C/EBP site: 5′-CGCAGCCTCGCGCCAGCTGGCGGCGCCGCAC-3′; Fos C/EBP site: 5′-GGATGTCCATATTAGGACATC-3′; mutation in predicted Atf3 C/EBP site (changes from wild-type are underlined): 5′-CGAACTTGGTGCACCAGTGCCC-3′.50× or 100× unlabeled probe was added as indicated. Where indicated, extracts were incubated with anti-C/EBPβ (0.3 μg) for 20 min at room temperature prior to binding reactions. Complexes were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE (7%) followed by autoradiography, as described (24.Piwien-Pilipuk G. Van Mater D. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP was performed as described previously (26.Cui T.X. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Huo J.S. Kaplani J. Kwok R. Schwartz J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, samples containing 100 μgof nuclear protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of the following antibodies individually: anti-C/EBPβ, anti-acetylated histone H4, or anti-pol II. Normal rabbit IgG and samples with no antibody served as negative controls. A single 259-bp fragment of the mouse Atf3 promoter or a 330-bp fragment of the mouse Fos promoter was amplified with 35 or 31 cycles of PCR, respectively (94 °C 20 s, 60 °C 20 s, and 72 °C 30 s) using ChIP primers (Atf3 forward: 5′-GAACACGCAGCGGCGAATAC-3′; Atf3 reverse: 5′-CAATCCCAGGCTGACGTAATG-3′; Fos forward: 5′-GGCTGCAGCCGGCGAGCTG-3′; Fos reverse: 5′-AGAAGCGCTGTGAATGGATG-3′ (26.Cui T.X. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Huo J.S. Kaplani J. Kwok R. Schwartz J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). In each experiment, all of the immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed with the same PCR conditions, for insight into relative amounts of each protein associated with the promoter.Transcriptional Activation—CHO-GHR cells (1 × 105 cells/35 mm well) were pre-incubated for 4 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% calf serum, and then transiently transfected as described previously (23.Piwien-Pilipuk G. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44557-44565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with WT or mC/EBP ATF3-Luc plasmids (500 ng/well), and plasmids for C/EBPβ (10 ng/well) or full-length rat GHR (500 ng/well) as indicated. For C/EBPβ co-transfection experiments, cells were transfected for 18h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% calf serum, followed by 18h in Ham's F-12 medium with 8% fetal calf serum. For GH treatment experiments, cells were transfected for 18 h, followed by 4 h in Ham's F-12 medium with 8% fetal calf serum, 18 h in Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin instead of serum, to which GH was added for 8 more hours. Transfected cells were lysed for measurement of luciferase activity using an Opticomp Luminometer as described previously (11.Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A.

Results show the means ± S.E. for relative luciferase units of at least four experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was assessed using a Student's t test.RESULTSGH-induced Genes in Adipocytes Are Expressed in Time-dependent Patterns—For insight into mechanisms for time-dependent responses to GH, genes regulated by GH at key time points were analyzed by microarray. To identify GH-regulated genes potentially involved in insulin resistance, cells were treated with GH for 48 h when 3T3-F442A adipocytes show impaired responses to insulin. For insight into earlier triggering events, cells were treated with GH for 30 min or 4 h. Affymetrix U74Av2 GeneChips were used to examine changes in gene transcript levels in RNA from 3T3-F442A adipocytes. Of the 12,488 probe sets represented on the chip, 561 probe sets identified transcripts which were differentially expressed in response to GH at one or more time points. 5The unprocessed microarray data are accessible through Gene Expression Omnibus Series accession number GSE2120 in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The complete list of GH-regulated probe sets (supplemental Data Set 1) is available at www.umich.edu/~jschwrtz/.While many of the genes corresponding to the 561 probe sets identified by this microarray analysis have not previously been identified as responsive to GH in adipocytes, documented GH-responsive genes were also identified. For example, GH induced the expression of the gene for insulin-like growth factor-I at 48 h, as seen in liver and adipose tissue from rodents (27.Vikman K. Isgaard J. Eden S. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28.Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the genes for GHR (29.Vikman K. Carlsson B. Billig H. Eden S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the acid labile subunit, which complexes with circulating insulin-like growth factor-I (30.Ooi G.T. Cohen F.J. Tseng L.Y. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), also increased after 48 h of GH. Expression of early response genes, including Fos, Jun, and Egr1, increased rapidly and transiently within 30 min of GH, as reported previously (31.Gurland G. Ashcom G. Cochran B.H. Schwartz J. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32.Gong T.-W.L. Meyer D.J. Liao J. Hodge C.L. Campbell G.S. Wang X. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J.

GH also increased expression of genes encoding negative regulators of GH signaling, including the genes for SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (36.Fasshauer M.

Similarly, adipocyte gene expression in response to GH changes in distinct patterns over time. When GH-responsive genes were sorted using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering strategy, which makes no prior assumptions regarding number or types of clusters (12.Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13138) Google Scholar), temporal patterns of changes in gene expression were evident. Three “waves” of expression (Fig. 1) corresponding to timing of GH treatment were identified in seven clusters. The early wave includes genes stimulated by GH only at 30 min (Cluster A); no genes were decreased with 30 min GH. An intermediate wave is comprised of genes which are transiently regulated by GH at 4 h, either positively (Cluster B) or negatively (Cluster E). Prolonged changes in expression in response to GH were evident at 48 h. In some cases the GH-induced changes seen at 48 h begin at 30 min or 4 h (Clusters C and F). The majority of prolonged GH-induced changes are observed only at 48 h (Clusters D and G).Early GH-regulated Genes Encode Transcription Factors—A systematic, unbiased survey of biological functions regulated by GH in adipocytes was undertaken to determine to what extent genes for established responses to GH in adipocytes were regulated and to identify novel functions regulated by GH. The Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy provides a standard classification system by which genes can be sorted into groups with associated biological functions (16.Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. Harris M.A. Hill D.P. Issel-Tarver L. Kasarskis A. Lewis S. Matese J.C. Richardson J.E. Ringwald M. Rubin G.M.

The structure of the acetyl-CoA-binary complex had shown an active site groove that was several times larger than its substrate. The structure of the ternary complex reveals that mycothiol synthase undergoes a large conformational change in which the two acetyltransferase domains are brought together through shared interactions with the functional groups of desacetylmycothiol, thereby decreasing the size of this large central groove.

Members of the bacterial prokaryotic group termed actinomycetes lack the low molecular weight thiol, glutathione, typically found in many bacteria and in eukaryotes and instead produce mycothiol (acetyl-l-cysteine-1-d-myo-inosityl-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranoside) (1Newton G.L.

Mycothiol is less prone to metal ion-catalyzed autoxidation than is glutathione and may serve as a stable intracellular store of cysteine (1Newton G.L. Bewley C.A. Dwyer T.J. Horn R. Aharonowitz Y.

Mycobacteria produce an especially large amount of mycothiol, with the intercellular concentration in Mycobacterium tuberculosis reaching millimolar concentrations (7Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. Delcardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of mycothiol to mycobacterial organisms and the absence of mycothiol in eukaryotes makes the mycothiol biosynthesis pathway an attractive drug target (8Young D.B. Duncan K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 641-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mycothiol biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis is a multistep process involving four enzymatic reactions catalyzed by MshA, MshB, MshC, and MshD (Scheme 1). Mycothiol synthase (MshD), 2The abbreviations used are: MshD, mycothiol synthase; DAM, desacetylmycothiol; CoA, coenzyme A; AcCoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; GNAT, GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase; r.m.s.d., root mean squared deviation; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. 2The abbreviations used are: MshD, mycothiol synthase; DAM, desacetylmycothiol; CoA, coenzyme A; AcCoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; GNAT, GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase; r.m.s.d., root mean squared deviation; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. the last enzyme in mycothiol biosynthesis, catalyzes the acetylation of the cysteinyl amine of 1-d-myo-inosityl-2-l-cysteinyl-amido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside (desacetylmycothiol (DAM)) (9Koledin T. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The close proximity of the relatively reactive primary amine to the active thiol would potentially yield side reactions during mycothiol reduction and conjugation reactions, thus preventing mycothiol regeneration by mycothione reductase or mycothiol S-conjugate amidase. The protection of the primary amine by acetylation is therefore presumed to be an important step in the formation of a useful detoxification agent. The previously reported structure of the MshD-AcCoA binary complex demonstrated that MshD belongs to the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases (GNATS) (10Vetting M.W. Roderick S.L. Yu M. Blanchard J.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In general, GNATS catalyze the transfer of an activated acetyl group from AcCoA to the primary amine of the target, be it a protein residue (i.e. αN termini or lysine) or small molecule (i.e. spermine, serotonin, aminoglycoside, glucosamine 6-phosphate, etc.) (11Vetting M.W. de Carvalho L.P.S. Yu M. Hegde S.S. Magnet S. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The GNAT family also includes outliers such as the FEM family of N-acetyltransferases and N-myristoyltransferases, which utilize alternate activated substrates. Despite low sequence homology, GNATS with diverse substrates have similar overall tertiary structure. The structural similarity among GNATS is determined by their need to bind the common substrate, AcCoA, whereas the total lack of sequence homology is a consequence of the manner in which AcCoA is coordinated, as most of the interactions are through backbone atoms. Indeed, the main feature of the GNAT fold is the generation of the AcCoA binding site. One element of this site is the incomplete adjoining of two β-sheets, thereby forming a single β-sheet with a V-like appearance. The exposed β-sheet backbone amides and carbonyls are used to coordinate the β-alanyl pantetheine backbone of AcCoA. A second common element is the “P-loop,” a loop connecting two conserved pieces of secondary structure that typically points several consecutive amide backbone atoms in a similar direction to coordinate the oxygen atoms of pyrophosphate. The adenine moiety of CoA is typically solvent-exposed and does not contribute significantly to the interaction with the GNATS. Variable side chains in a 10-15 Å sphere around the activated acyl group are then used to interact with the target substrate and provide substrate specificity. Many of the GNATS from prokaryotes are dimeric in solution, and often, the active site is located at the dimer interface such that groups from both monomers of the dimer contribute to the active site architecture (11Vetting M.W. de Carvalho L.P.S. Yu M. Hegde S.S. Magnet S. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 12Burk D.L. Ghuman N. Wybenga-Groot L.E. Berghuis A.M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 426-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MshD, however, is a monomer in solution, but interestingly, it contains two GNAT domains (10Vetting M.W. Roderick S.L. Yu M. Blanchard J.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The N-terminal GNAT domain (1-140) and the C-terminal GNAT domain (151-315) are joined by a random coil linker (141-150) with the relative orientation of the two GNAT domains similar to many other dimeric GNAT proteins. The domains share a similar topology, exhibiting an r.m.s.d. of 1.7 Å over 88 structurally similar residues and are believed to have arisen from a gene duplication and fusion event. Although MshD is composed of two GNAT domains, and each is competent to bind a molecule of AcCoA, the structure of MshD in complex with AcCoA and CoA suggested that only the C-terminal GNAT domain was active (10Vetting M.W. Roderick S.L. Yu M. Blanchard J.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Modeling of DAM in the active site groove between the two GNAT domains revealed that the groove was much larger than needed for binding, indicating that there may be some domain movement upon binding substrate (10Vetting M.W. Roderick S.L. Yu M. Blanchard J.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the malleability of the GNAT active site residues, possible domain movements upon binding substrates, and unknown nature of the two MshD active sites make accurate modeling of DAM in the MshD active site very difficult. The design of inhibitors requires intimate details of the interactions of substrates with their active sites; therefore, a high resolution MshD ternary complex is highly desirable. Here we present the 1.8 Å resolution structure of MshD in complex with the disulfide of CoA and DAM, the detailed interactions of DAM and MshD residues, and the structural rearrangements upon complex formation and present further evidence that despite having two GNAT domains, only the C-terminal domain is catalytically active. This is the first structural report of a mycothiol biosynthesis enzyme in complex with its full ligand set. Purification and Measurement of Enzyme Activity—Recombinant MshD was expressed and purified as reported previously (10Vetting M.W. Roderick S.L. Yu M. Blanchard J.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The synthesis of DAM was carried out as described for similar compounds (13Knapp S. Gonzalez S. Myers D.S. Eckman L.L. Bewley C.A. Org. Lett. 2002; 4: 4337-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). DAM was purified and characterized as the molecular disulfide (see Supplemental Materials). Reaction rates were determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 232 nm due to hydrolysis of the thioester bond of acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA (ϵ = 4500 m-1) in a UVIKON XL spectrophotometer equipped with thermospacers and connected to a constant temperature, circulating water bath. Assays were performed in 100 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0, and 100 μm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride at a temperature of 25 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. For every enzymatic reaction, a corresponding non-enzymatic control reaction was carried out. The non-enzymatic rate was then subtracted from the enzymatic rate before fitting to Equation 1 using ν=VAB/(KiaKB+KAB+KBA+AB)(Eq. 1) where v is the measured velocity, V is the maximal velocity, A and B are the concentrations of substrates A and B, respectively, and KA and KB are the Michaelis-Menten constants for substrates A and B, respectively. Enzyme activity was measured over the pH range of 6.0-9.0 using phosphate (6.0-8.0) and Tris (8.0-9.0). The kinetic parameters V and KA were determined by fitting to Equation 2, ν=VA/(KA+A)(Eq. 2) where v is the measured velocity, V is the maximal velocity, and A is the concentration of substrate A. The V and KA were determined using six concentrations of A with saturating concentration (∼6× Km) of B. The pH dependence of V and V/K were then fitted to Equation 3, log V orV/K=log[C/(1+H+/Ka+Kb/H+)](Eq. 3) where C is the pH-independent plateau value, Ka is the ionization constant for the acidic group, Kb is the ionization constant for the basic group, and H+is the hydrogen ion concentration. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Prior to crystallization setups, MshD (15 mg/ml, 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0) was incubated with 7.7 mm DAM, 5.3 mm CoA, and 40 mm dithiothreitol for a period greater than 4 h at 4°C. Crystallization was by vapor diffusion under oil in which 2 μl of the MshD-ternary complex was combined with 2 μl of crystallization solution (1 m Na3 citrate, pH 8.5, 100 mm Bicine, pH 8.8) under 100 μl of Fisher silicon oil. Crystallization trays were stored uncovered at 18 °C. Cube-shaped crystals belonging to the space group P21 with approximate unit cell dimensions of a = 37.8, b = 59.6, c = 61.7 Å, and β = 91.6° were of diffraction quality in 2-4 days. This crystal form was not stable to cryoprotection and vitrification, so data were collected at room temperature. An MshD-ternary complex crystal was scooped directly from a crystallization drop and enclosed in a capillary using the method of Sweeny and D'Arcy (14Sweeney A.M. D'Arcy A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2002; 36: 165-166Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). During the experiment, the crystal was in vapor equilibrium with 20 μl of mother liquor (1 m Na3 citrate, 100 mm Bicine, pH 8.8) positioned at the flame-sealed end of the capillary. Data were collected on an MSC R-Axis IV2+ image plate detector using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU-H3R x-ray generator and processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38453) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The program AMORE (16Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) was used for molecular replacement (see “Results and Discussion”). Interactive model building utilized the molecular graphics program O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The final model has an R-factor and R-free of 16.1 and 20.3, respectively, with good stereochemistry and geometry (Table 1). Electron densities corresponding to residues 1-4, 56-58, 266-268, and 312-315 were not observed in the 2Fo - Fc maps and therefore were not modeled.

AcCoA was omitted from the refinement and map calculation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetics—Initial velocity experiments were performed by varying the concentrations of AcCoA and DAM and yielded a series of intersecting lines. This is diagnostic of a ternary complex mechanism in which both substrates must be present on the enzyme before catalysis can occur. This kinetic mechanism is universally observed for members of the GNAT superfamily of N-acetyltransferases (11Vetting M.W. de Carvalho L.P.S. Yu M. Hegde S.S. Magnet S. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1A, the data points are well fitted by Equation 1. The lower value of Ki,AcCoA, when compared with the KAcCoA, causes the lines to appear almost parallel. To confirm the intersecting nature of the initial velocity plot, propionyl-CoA was used as an alternative substrate. As observed in Fig. 1B, the nature of the intersecting initial velocity pattern was apparent when using propionyl-CoA. This argues for a chemical mechanism in which direct acetyl transfer from AcCoA to DAM occurs, as opposed to intermediate transfer from AcCoA to the enzyme followed by subsequent acetyl transfer to DAM. To assess potential catalytic groups involved in catalysis, we determined the pH dependence of the maximum velocity and V/K value for DAM. As shown in Fig. 2, the pH dependence of both V and V/KDAM are bell-shaped, and the experimental data are well fitted by Equation 3. Both V and V/KDAM depend on the ionization behavior of two groups: one group that must be deprotonated for activity and that likely serves as a catalytic base with pK value of 6.6-7.0 and a second group that must be protonated for activity and likely serves as a catalytic acid with pK value of 8.7-9.2. We ascribe the groups observed in both the V and the V/KDAM pH profiles to the same enzyme groups and will discuss their likely identity in the following sections. Domain Conformational Change—Crystallization of MshD in complex with CoA and DAM led to a P21 crystal form that was not observed for the binary CoA/AcCoA complexes. Phasing by molecular replacement should have been straightforward since solvent content analysis indicated that there was only a monomer per asymmetric unit; however, molecular replacement using the binary MshD-AcCoA complex as the search model was unsuccessful. Interestingly, using a search model consisting of only a portion of the N-terminal domain (residues 6-120) resulted in two significant rotation/translation solutions. These could be used to reconstruct a starting model containing both GNAT domains that, when subjected to simulated annealing refinement, resulted in an initial R-factor and R-free of 33.7 and 37.1%. Previously, it was observed that the central canyon running between the two domains was significantly larger than that required for binding of the second substrate, and it was proposed that there may be domain movement upon formation of the ternary complex (10Vetting M.W. Roderick S.L. Yu M. Blanchard J.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, failure of molecular replacement using the entire MshD monomer was due to changes in the relative orientation of the two domains. As can be seen in Fig. 3 (A and B), the N-terminal GNAT domain, as a unit, rotates significantly toward the C-terminal domain such that the central groove becomes much narrower. For example, relative to superimposed C-terminal domains, the N-terminal domain α-helices (α1-α4, Cα carbons) of the binary complex versus the ternary complex exhibit r.m.s.d. values of 5.5-8.3 Å2. The pivot point and genesis of this flexibility are the extended central β-strands, β6 and β6′, which in the binary complex are the only direct interactions between the two GNAT domains. In essence, the central extended β-strands are used as a fulcrum to change the relative position of the N-terminal domain relative to the C-terminal domain. This movement results in several new interactions between the two GNAT domains. The α2′/β4′ loop rests against the β3/β4 loop, which was disordered in the binary complex but is ordered in the ternary complex. The side chain of Arg-71 (β3/β4 loop) forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl of Gly-181 (α2′/β4′ loop) and a single hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of Pro-178 (α2′/β4′ loop). New salt bridges are formed between Arg-131 (β6) and Glu-179 (α2′/β4′ loop) and Arg-40 (α2) with Glu-194 (α2′/β4 loop), whereas Glu-190 (α2′) is electrostatically complemented by the side chain of Arg-46 (α2/β4 loop). In addition, there are numerous interactions between the two domains that are mediated by the bound substrate (see below). These movements and new interactions do not significantly alter the core structures of the individual domains. The r.m.s.d. for the N-terminal GNAT domain is 0.33 Å over 117 common atoms, whereas for the C-terminal GNAT domain, the r.m.s.d. is 0.37 Å over 119 common residues. Although localized changes have previously been observed upon substrate binding in various GNAT proteins, especially in the α1/α2 loop, this is the first instance of a large global conformational change. DAM Interactions—Unambiguous electron density was observed for DAM within the active site groove and adjacent to the CoA molecule of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 4A). The average thermal factor for DAM was 14.2, similar to protein atoms in its vicinity, suggesting a well ordered and full occupancy small molecule. Electron density for the cysteine sulfhydryl of DAM suggested that it was in two conformations, both being in a disulfide linkage with the sulfhydryl of CoA. It may be possible that the conformational change is an artifact of the binding of CoA-DAM as a disulfide. However, it is highly unlikely that any CoA-DAM disulfide was generated in solution prior to crystal formation since the crystallization conditions contained 40 mm dithiothreitol to generate and maintain monomeric DAM. The finding of a CoA-DAM disulfide in the active site of the ternary complex is most likely a function of the close proximity of the thiols of CoA and DAM within the active site, the growth and incubation of crystals at room temperature prior to data collection, and the accessibility of the thiols to oxidation but not reduction once the substrates are enclosed within the active site. Therefore, the disulfide is not thought to have driven the conformational change nor altered the interactions of DAM or CoA with the active site. The sulfhydryl of DAM could be modeled through a simple rotation into a small adjacent pocket created by the side chains of Gln-180, His-177, and Phe-174. The active site groove has an overall negative character and is highly polar in nature, consistent with the binding of a highly polar substrate with a primary amine functional group. Prior to binding DAM, the active site groove was solvated by ∼40 waters and was significantly larger than required for binding substrate. After binding DAM, the N-terminal domain rotates toward the C-terminal domain, collapses over the substrates, and forms new domain-domain interactions. The large interdomain groove becomes a narrow tunnel with entrances large enough for solvent molecules but not for exit of the substrate. The tunnel retains ∼30 waters, which further mediate interactions between the two domains. The substrate makes 5 direct and 11 water-mediated hydrogen bonds with side chains and backbone atoms of MshD within the tunnel (Fig. 4, B and C). A large number of these interactions are with the C-terminal domain, but there are two direct (Glu-36N, Lys-34NZ) and two water-mediated (Glu-79OE2, Asn-37N) hydrogen bonds with residues from the N-terminal domain, promoting the collapse of the large groove around the substrates, thereby shielding the reaction coordinate from bulk solvent. In addition, there are van der Waals interactions between the rings of substrate and Leu-133, Tyr-236, and Trp-110 at the bottom of the tunnel and Tyr-282 and Glu-36 at the top of the tunnel. The numerous interactions of DAM with MshD position the cysteinyl group of DAM in close proximity to CoA. Utilizing the MshD-AcCoA binary complex structure to model the acetyl group in an MshD-DAM-AcCoA pre-reaction model complex demonstrates that the primary amine of DAM is correctly positioned for in-line attack on the si-face of the acetyl group of AcCoA (distance = 2.5 Å) (Fig. 4, C and D). Glu-234, through an intervening water molecule, could act as a general base, accepting protons from the amine of DAM. This is presumably the group whose ionization behavior is observed on the acidic limb of the V pH profile. The backbone amide of Leu-238, which is hydrogen-bonded to and helps position the acetyl group of AcCoA, would stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate. Tyr-294 is suitably positioned to act as a general acid to protonate the sulfhydryl of CoA after breakdown of this intermediate. This is presumably the group whose ionization behavior is observed on the basic limb of the V pH profile. The use of an Asp or Glu through intervening water molecules as the active site base, Tyr as the active site acid, and utilization of a backbone amide for stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate is a common theme in many GNAT enzymes (11Vetting M.W. de Carvalho L.P.S. Yu M. Hegde S.S. Magnet S. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and these groups (Glu-234, Tyr-294, and Leu-238) appear to be the active site residues that MshD uses to promote the acetylation of DAM. N-terminal GNAT Domain—Previously, it was suggested from the binary AcCoA and CoA complexes that only the C-terminal domain had acetyltransferase activity (10Vetting M.W. Roderick S.L. Yu M. Blanchard J.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This was based on three observations. (i) Although both domains bound an AcCoA molecule, only the acetyl group of the C-terminally bound AcCoA was solvent-exposed, whereas the acetyl group of the N-terminally bound AcCoA was buried; (ii) incubation of the binary AcCoA-MshD complex with excess CoA was unable to replace the AcCoA bound in the N-terminal domain, suggesting that the N-terminally bound AcCoA molecule does not exchange freely with solvent; (iii) some of the hallmarks of the GNAT fold are missing in the N-terminal domain, including a β-bulge in β4 and recognizable acid and base groups that could participate in chemistry. However, these observations do not conclusively demonstrate non-reactivity of the N-terminally bound AcCoA. For example, the recently determined structure of the ribosomal Nα-acetyltransferase, RimL, demonstrated that a β-bulge in β4 was not required for acetyltransferase activity (20Vetting M.W. de Carvalho L.P. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22108-22114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the local structure of the active site may significantly change during substrate binding and reaction chemistry, allowing either catalysis at the N-terminal domain or release of the AcCoA. Fig. 5, shows a simulated annealing Omit map for the N-terminally bound cofactor in the ternary complex. Despite incubation with excess CoA and DAM prior to crystallization, there is clear density for the acetyl group. The acetyl group has an average B-factor of 28.4 Å3, which is only slightly higher than the remainder of the cofactor (19.1 Å3 average) or surrounding protein residues (15-20 Å3) and is similar to the results of the MshD-AcCoA binary complex. This further demonstrates that the N-terminal GNAT domain is vestigial in nature and does not exchange its cofactor with solvent. The N-terminally bound cofactor therefore must be recruited during folding and is presumably used as a structural element for protein stability. This is a unique feature of MshD that is not mirrored by other monomeric two-domain GNAT proteins. To our knowledge, the retention of a large cofactor purely for structural stability has not been previously observed. The essential role of mycothiol in the detoxification of electrophiles, oxidative stress management, and formaldehyde oxidation suggests that compounds that inhibit the biosynthesis of mycothiol would be deleterious to M. tuberculosis. The four-step biosynthetic pathway offers a number of opportunities for the design of such compounds, especially as the mechanisms of each enzyme are clarified and the structures of these enzymes are determined. The final step in the pathway, catalyzed by mycothiol synthase, may be particularly suitable for this purpose since the results presented here have clarified the kinetic mechanism, groups involved in substrate binding and catalysis, and conformational changes that allow for substrate binding and catalysis.

Atypically for ferredoxin-dependent enzymes, phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase mediates direct electron transfers from reduced ferredoxin to its tetrapyrrole substrate without metal ion or organic cofactors. We previously showed that bound bilin radical intermediates could be detected by low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance and absorption spectroscopies (Tu, S., Gunn, A., Toney, M. D., Britt, R. D., and Lagarias, J. C. (2004) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126, 8682–8693). On the basis of these studies, a mechanism involving sequential electron-coupled proton transfers to protonated bilin substrates buried within the phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase protein scaffold was proposed.

Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 785-802Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The diverse bilin products synthesized by FDBRs contribute to the broad range of light absorption of phycobiliprotein antennae throughout the visible and near-infrared spectrum (3Glazer A.N. Cohen Z Chemicals from Microalgae. Taylor and Francis, London1999: 261-280Google Scholar). Widely distributed in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, FDBRs catalyze the reduction of heme- and chlorophyll-derived oxidation products by targeting different double bonds within their bilin substrates (2Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4Frankenberg N.F. Lagarias J.C. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R The Porphyrin Handbook. Chlorophylls and Bilins: Biosynthesis Structure and Degradation.13. Academic Press, New York2003: 211-235Google Scholar). Phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA, EC 1.3.7.5) is an atypical FDBR, catalyzing reduction of both vinyl groups of biliverdin IXα (BV) to produce 3Z/3E phycocyanobilin (3Z/3E-PCB) (2Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). More recent studies indicate that the first stable intermediate is 181,182-dihydrobiliverdin (181,182-DHBV), demonstrating that reduction of the D-ring exovinyl group precedes reduction of the A-ring endovinyl group (Fig. 1) (5Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on the lack of a metal/organic cofactor and on low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we proposed a radical mechanism for PcyA (6Tu S. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1, the interconversion of BV to PCB formally involves a series of ferredoxin-mediated one-electron transfers to the PcyA-bound bilin substrate that require the participation of up to five proton-donating residues within the enzyme. Our investigations also provided spectroscopic evidence for two vinyl radical intermediates, each of which exists as a mixture of protonated neutral and deprotonated anionic species (6Tu S. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Substrate protonation by enzymes requires ionizable residues and/or tightly bound water/cofactors within their active sites. Multiple sequence alignment reveals numerous conserved residues in the extended FDBR family. As shown in Fig. 2, such residues cluster within two highly conserved regions of these enzymes (Fig. 2, Box 1 and 2). Ionizable residues conserved in all FDBRs include aspartate 116 (Asp116), aspartate 217 (Asp217), and tyrosine 209 (Tyr209) 3Residue numbering corresponds to the Nostoc sp. PCC7120 PcyA protein. ; these residues are expected to perform structural, substrate-binding, and/or catalytic roles common to the entire FDBR family. Because FDBRs vary in their substrate reduction regiospecificities, we hypothesized that either of these conserved acidic residues might function to protonate the bilin substrate on the pyrroleninic nitrogen of ring B/C (Fig. 1). Other residues conserved exclusively in the PcyA subfamily include histidine 71 (His71), histidine 85 (His85), cysteine 86 (Cys86), cysteine 210 (Cys210), and lysine 218 (Lys218). Such residues therefore are good candidates for a PcyA-specific function such as exovinyl reduction. Using a combination of chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis, the present work was undertaken to probe the involvement of these conserved residues in PcyA-mediated BV reduction.

Sep-Pak Light cartridges were obtained from Waters (cat. no. WAT023501). BCA protein assay reagents were purchased from Pierce (cat. no. 23228). Biliverdin IXα (BV) was prepared as described previously (7Elich T.D. McDonagh A.F. Palma L.A. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—Expression and purification of wild type recombinant Nostoc sp. PCC7120 PcyA were performed as described previously (5Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All site-directed mutants were generated in pGEX-pcyA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Glutathione S-transferase-tagged PcyA mutant proteins were expressed and purified using a method similar to wild type with the following modification. For mutant protein expression, Escherichia coli strain DH5α containing mutant plasmid constructs were grown at 37 °C in 500-ml batches of Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to an A600 of 0.6–1.0. Cultures were induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl thio-β-galactoside and incubated for an additional 4 h at 20°C, and bacteria were harvested subsequently by centrifugation. Recombinant Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 ferredoxin (Fd) was purified as described previously (8Schluchter W.M. The Characterization of Photosystem I and Ferredoxin-NADP+ Oxidoreductase in the Cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA1994Google Scholar). Purified Fd was dialyzed against TKK buffer (25 mm TES-KOH, pH 8.5, and 100 mm KCl). Both PcyA and Fd preparations were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C prior to use. Chemical Modification of PcyA—For cysteine- and lysine-selective modification, 20 μm PcyA was incubated with various concentrations of DTNB in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or TNBS in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 8.0, at 22 °C for 10 min (9Lundblad R.L. Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2005Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were quenched with excess glutathione for DTNB and Tris-HCl for TNBS. For substrate protection, equimolar BV was mixed with PcyA for 10 min prior to incubation with the chemical reagent. For histidine-selective modification, 20 μm PcyA in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, was incubated with various concentrations of freshly prepared ethanolic solutions of DEPC at 22 °C. Final concentrations of ethanol never exceeded 1% of the sample volume; control experiments with this amount of ethanol showed no affect on activity. At various times, samples were aliquoted and quenched with 10 mm histidine, and residual PcyA activity was determined. For substrate protection, an equal molar ratio of BV to PcyA was mixed for 10 min prior to DEPC inactivation. Reactivation of DEPC-inactivated enzyme with hydroxylamine was assessed by first incubating 20 μm PcyA in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, with 0.4 mm DEPC for 10 min at 22 °C until enzyme activity decreased to 15% of its original activity. The reaction was quenched with 10 mm histidine. Hydroxylamine was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 m using stock solution of hydroxylamine that was adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH. Aliquots were removed after incubation for 6 h, and residual enzyme activity was measured. Control reactions using unmodified enzyme were similarly performed, indicating that hydroxylamine treatment did not affect enzyme activity. PcyA Enzyme Assay—PcyA steady state assays were performed similarly to those described previously with minor modifications (5Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Standard assay conditions consisted of 25 mm TES-KOH, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.025 unit/ml FNR, 5 μm Fd, 100 μm bovine serum albumin, 10 μm BV, 0.1 μm purified wild type or mutant PcyA, 25 units/ml glucose oxidase, 100 mm glucose, and 25 units/ml catalase. Excess NADPH (i.e. 30 μm) was added to initiate catalysis. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min (previously determined to be within the linear range for PcyA activity (6Tu S. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)). Crude bilins were extracted with a Sep-Pak C18 light cartridge and subsequently evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac concentrator. HPLC analysis and anaerobic single-turnover PcyA assays were performed as described previously (6Tu S. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Measurements—Absorption and EPR spectroscopic measurements were performed as described previously (6Tu S. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For EPR measurements, the anaerobic assay was used with the exception that concentrations of PcyA, BV, and FNR were all increased 4-fold (to 40 μm, 40 μm, and 12 nm, respectively), and 15% spectroanalytical grade glycerol was included in the reaction mixtures. At various time points after the addition of NADPH, absorption spectra were recorded, and 200-μl aliquots were withdrawn from reaction mixtures, transferred to 4-mm quartz EPR tubes, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Continuous wave EPR studies of PcyA were performed using a Bruker ECS106 spectrometer. EPR spectra at 15 K were acquired using the X-band microwave frequency of 9.69 GHz with modulation amplitude of 4 G. The temperature of the sample was maintained using an Oxford ESR900 liquid helium cryostat and an Oxford ITC 503 temperature controller. Sequence Alignment of PcyA Family Members Suggests Candidate Proton Donors—Previous functional genomic analysis has identified more than 30 FDBRs in different organisms (2Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment implicates the structural and functional significance of two highly conserved regions of the FDBR family (Fig. 2, Boxes 1 and 2). Of note are several conserved ionizable residues that are present in these regions. Among the conserved residues, histidine and cysteine residues initially were considered good candidates for D1 and D2 proton donors (Fig. 1) because of their exclusive occurrences in the PcyA family (Fig. 2), the near neutral range of their pKas, and the possibility that they would be protonated upon initial BV substrate binding. For this reason, histidine- and cysteine-selective chemical modification experiments were undertaken. Chemical Modification Experiments Implicate a Catalytic Role for Histidine Residues—The histidine-selective modification reagent DEPC was chosen for the initial investigation. PcyA and preformed PcyA·BV complexes were treated with increasing concentrations of DEPC, and residual activity was determined. DEPC treatment reduced PcyA activity to less than 20% of mock-treated enzyme within 10 min at a modifier-to-enzyme molar ratio of 20 to 1, implicating the participation of a histidine residue(s) in the catalytic cycle (Fig. 3A). The observation that DEPC-inactivation could be prevented by the presence of BV substrate (Fig. 3A) demonstrated that one or more sensitive histidine residues of PcyA are protected upon substrate binding, consistent with a direct role for histidine(s) in the PcyA catalytic mechanism. Although DEPC selectively modifies the imidazole side chain of histidine, it can also react with other nucleophilic groups including the amino terminus as well as the side chains of cysteine, tyrosine, lysine and arginine residues (9Lundblad R.L. Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2005Google Scholar). The possibility that DEPC inactivates PcyA through arginine and cysteine modification was ruled out because both phenylglyoxal and DTNB, modifying reagents selective to these amino acid residues, had no effect on PcyA activity (data not shown). The reaction of DEPC with tyrosine is typically accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 275 to 280 nm due to the O-carboxyethylation (9Lundblad R.L. Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2005Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, DEPC modification of PcyA only revealed an absorbance increase at 240 nm due to carboxyethylation of the histidine imidazole side chain. This result suggests the DEPC inactivation is not due to the modification of tyrosine residues. Treatment of DEPC-inactivated PcyA with hydroxylamine resulted in only partial recovery of PcyA activity (i.e. from 16% (+DEPC) residual activity to 59% (+DEPC, +hydroxylamine); data not shown). This result suggested that DEPC may have modified structurally and/or functionally important lysine residues, because hydroxylamine cannot cleave carboxyethyl adducts from lysine. Indeed, the strong inactivation of PcyA activity by TNBS (Fig. 3) suggests that the modifiable lysine residue(s) are easily accessible to chemical modification. In contrast to the results for DEPC, TNBS inactivation was not prevented by the presence of BV substrate, suggesting that the lysine residues critical for PcyA function are located on the protein surface (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results indicate the importance of both histidine and lysine residues in catalysis. To probe the role of histidine more fully, time courses of PcyA inactivation with increasing concentrations of DEPC were examined (Fig. 4). Because DEPC undergoes hydrolysis in aqueous solution, the inactivation process was corrected for the decomposition of DEPC as described by the equation ln(A/A0) = –(k/k′)I0(1 – e–k′t), where A/A0 is the residual activity at time t, k is the second-order rate constant for the inactivation of PcyA by DEPC, k′ is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the spontaneous hydrolysis of DEPC, and I0 is the initial concentration of DEPC (10Gomi T. Fujioka M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Plots of the natural log of residual activity against effective time, (1 – e–k′t), at various DEPC concentrations yielded linear decay, indicating the inactivation process obeys pseudo-first-order kinetics (Fig. 4A). The values for pseudo-first-order rate constants kobs were obtained from the slopes of the linear plots in Fig. 4A. A second-order rate constant (kinact) of 703 m–1 min–1 was obtained from the slopes of the plots of kobs versus DEPC concentration (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that DEPC inactivation of PcyA is a simple bimolecular process, with modification of a single (histidine) residue per enzyme molecule sufficient to cause loss of activity. Site-directed Mutagenesis Identifies Catalytic Roles for His85, Asp102, and Asp116—The results from chemical modification experiments implicated a potential catalytic role for one or more histidine residues. To identify specific histidine residue(s) of catalytic importance, all nine histidine residues on PcyA were individually mutagenesized to glutamine. The choice of histidine-to-glutamine substitutions was based on the fact that glutamine retains the hydrogen-bonding ability of histidine but is unable to function as a proton donor. All nine histidine mutants could be purified to homogeneity with similar protein yields to wild type PcyA and retained the ability to bind BV, indicating that none of the histidine residues were essential for protein folding. Steady state PcyA assay measurements revealed wild type activity for all histidine-to-glutamine mutants except for H71Q and H85Q, which retained 65 and 5% activity, respectively, relative to wild type PcyA (Table 1). These “relative activity” measurements were all performed under identical conditions using saturating reductant and a BV substrate concentration in great excess of the apparent Km, estimated to be in the nanomolar range for the wild-type enzyme, so that the rate of product formation was linear throughout the assay period. Although these assays do not yield quantitative kinetic constants, they were performed to identify potential mutations for more detailed pre-steady state spectroscopic measurements.TABLE 1Relative activities of PcyA wild type and site-directed mutantsMutant groupsProteinsActivity% of wild typeWild typePcyA100His mutantsPcyA(H85A)<1PcyA(H85N)<1PcyA(H85Q)5PcyA(H85D)<1PcyA(H85E)5PcyA(H71A)<1PcyA(H71N)46PcyA(H71Q)65PcyA(H71D)28PcyA(H71E)50Asp mutantsPcyA(D102N)11PcyA(D116N)11PcyA(D217N)87Cys mutantsPcyA(C86A)90PcyA(C210A)90Lys mutantPcyA(K218E)20 Open table in a new tab To address the catalytic importance of His71 and His85, residues conserved in all know PcyA representatives (Fig. 2), additional amino acid substitution mutants were constructed for both residues. Substitution of both residues with alanine effectively abolished all PcyA enzymatic activity, indicating their structural or functional significance. However, more conservative His71 mutations, including H71N, H71D, H71Q, and H71E, retained partial activity (Table 1). By contrast, similar mutations of His85 afforded nearly complete loss of activity (Table 1). Taken together, these results support a catalytic role for His85 but not for His71. With regard to the possible catalytic role for lysine implied by the TNBS experiments, only a single lysine residue is conserved in all members of the PcyA subfamily (Fig. 2). Replacement of this conserved lysine (Lys218) with glutamic acid failed to abolish the activity of the enzyme, although the 28EK1 mutant retained only 20% of wild type activity (Table 1). In view of this observation, the results from TNBS modification experiments can better be rationalized by the participation of TNBS-modifiable lysine residue(s) in the electrostatic interaction between PcyA and reduced Fd, an interaction critical for the activity of other Fd-dependent enzymes (11Akashi T.

We believe that it is less likely that Lys218 plays a direct proton-donating role for PcyA-mediated bilin reduction. In addition to lysine and histidine mutants of PcyA, we also mutagenesized several conserved aspartate (Asp102, Asp116, and Asp217) and cysteine (Cys86 and Cys210) residues (Table 1). D217N, C86A, and C210A mutants all retained roughly 90% catalytic activity, casting strong doubt that these residues participate in the proton-coupled electron transfer process. Because Asp217 is universally conserved in the FDBR family, the retention of activity of the D217N mutant was unexpected. By contrast with the Asp217 and the two cysteine mutants, D102N and D116N mutants were both poorly active, retaining only 11% of wild type activity. These results suggest that Asp102 and Asp116 are potentially proton donors during the PcyA catalytic cycle. Absorption and EPR Measurements Support the Presence of a Catalytic His85-Asp102 Pair for Exovinyl Reduction—To further characterize the functions of His85 and Asp102, we compared the spectral properties of the binary BV complexes with wild type and mutant PcyA proteins. Previous studies in our laboratory established that PcyA-bound bilin substrates possess cyclic, porphyrin-like conformations (5Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Tu S. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In those studies, we showed that BV binding to apoPcyA is accompanied by an absorbance increase at 650 nm that mirrors the more constrained geometry of the bound bilin. In addition to this absorbance enhancement, we also observed the appearance of a near infrared (NIR) absorbing species that was attributed to the protonated PcyA-bound form of BV (6Tu S. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was reasoned that the formation of the protonated bilin would favor electron transfer, conceivably by raising its midpoint potential for reduction. In this regard, no NIR absorbing species was observed for bilin analogs that were poor substrates for PcyA (5Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Tu S. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem.

Spectroscopic comparison of the four His85 mutants revealed that only H85Q retained the ability to bind BV based upon the characteristic absorption increase at 650 nm (Fig. 5, top panel), whereas the H85N, H85D, and H85E mutants did not (data not shown). These results suggest that the size and/or structure of this residue is critical for bilin binding. Interestingly, the absorption spectrum of the BV complex of H85Q lacked the NIR absorbing species present in the wild type PcyA·BV complex (Fig. 5, top panel). To examine the possibility that the H85Q mutant could still support initial electron transfer, we compared the ability of wild type and mutant enzymes to support production of a PcyA-bound bilin radical intermediate. Addition of 1 electron equivalent of NADPH to BV complexes of both proteins led to absorbance increases at 470 and 770 nm, although the extent of the increase was smaller for the H85Q mutant (Fig. 5, middle two panels). The absorbance increase for the H85Q mutant eventually reached a maximum that was not followed by the subsequent decay seen for the wild type enzyme. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the H85Q mutant can support formation of a exovinyl bilin radical intermediate that is stable to disproportionation to BV and 181,182-DHBV as is also seen for wild type PcyA (Fig. 1). A similar line of investigation was performed with the D102N mutant. The D102N mutant also yielded a BV complex that lacked the NIR absorbing species and could be converted to a stable exovinyl bilin radical with spectral properties nearly indistinguishable from those of the H85Q mutant (Fig. 5, bottom panel). Taken together, these experiments indicate that His85 and Asp102 are both essential for exovinyl reduction of BV. The reduced amount of radical formation observed for the H85Q and D102N mutants suggested that the midpoint potential for BV reduction was lowered in the two mutants. Because the midpoint potential of Fd is more negative than that of NADPH, we reasoned that increasing the NADPH concentration by a factor of 10 would enhance the yield of the primary PcyA·BV radical. Indeed, we observed increases in both rate and yield of radical formation for the two mutants when 10-fold excess NADPH was added (Fig. 6A). Moreover, neither mutant yielded significant quantities of 181,182-DHBV or PCB under these conditions, whereas wild type PcyA was able to fully convert the BV substrate to PCB (data not shown). These analyses indicate that H85Q and D102N mutants both support initial electron transfer but do not permit the second electron transfer to produce the fully reduced 181,182-DHBV intermediate depicted in Fig. 1. It is interesting that the spectroscopic properties of the H85Q and D102N bilin radicals are different, with the latter possessing more enhanced NIR absorption (Fig. 6A). This result suggests that the chemical structure and/or environment of the two bilin radicals are distinct. To ascertain that the absorption changes observed during H85Q and D102N reactions correspond to radical intermediates, we performed EPR measurements on freeze-quenched samples. Aliquots were removed at different time points after the addition of NADPH, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy at 15 K. Both mutants yielded an isotropic EPR sig"

This initiative seeks to provide a complete list of the mutations that give rise to cancer. NIH is preparing to announce plans for the pilot phase of their proposed Human Cancer Genome Project. This initiative seeks to provide a complete list of the mutations that give rise to cancer. Two institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have linked arms to go after cancer in a big way. Inspired by the successes of drugs like Gleevec, Herceptin, and Iressa—therapies targeted to specific changes in the DNA of tumors—the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) are considering an ambitious project to systematically find all genetic alterations in the major types of cancer. The idea itself is not new as a handful of research groups are already conducting similar activities, but the NIH project would bring the scale and speed of discovery to a new level. The initiative—dubbed the Human Cancer Genome Project (HCGP)—is expected to begin in 2006 with a 3 year pilot project, plans for which will be announced in the next few weeks. Although NCI and NHGRI are providing few details prior to the announcement, the two institutes are expected to solicit applications from different research groups to carry out a variety of projects—from collecting tumor samples and sequencing DNA to developing new technologies for analyzing the genome. Together these projects will help to unearth new cancer genes and possible drug targets in a discrete set of tumor types. In July 2005, a workshop entitled “Toward a Comprehensive Genomic Analysis of Cancer” was convened by NCI and NHGRI to seek input on the HCGP from the scientific community. Participants agreed that a pilot phase was needed “to attack this enormous problem with multiple projects that use a range of genomic technologies coordinated around the same samples,” according to a recently released report from the workshop (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Info/TCGA_executive_summary.pdf). As NCI and NHGRI officials continue to hammer out the precise plan for this pilot phase, genome aficionados say that results from their own studies bode well for the proposed HCGP. “In a way, we and other people have already done small pilot projects to show [this approach] is worthwhile,” says Victor Velculescu, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins University Kimmel Cancer Center. For decades, the traditional approach to identify cancer genes was to hand-pick likely candidates and then search for mutations within them. But since the completion of the draft human genome sequence in 2000, scientists have had the tools to go after cancer mutations in a more global and systematic way. “The approach of mapping cancer genes has almost been saturated. All low hanging fruits have already been taken,” says Richard Wooster. Along with Michael Stratten and Andrew Futreal, Wooster leads the Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in the UK, a project that started in April 2000 and is similar in scope to that planned by the NIH. “We have a good dialogue with the NCI/NHGRI and see this very much as a collaborative effort,” says Wooster. “There is a strong history of the NIH working with Sanger. The Sanger sequenced one third of the human genome with the NIH in the public effort.” Scientists of the post-genome era can examine the sequences of thousands of genes in cancer cells. But because of the expense and technical limitations of current sequencing technologies, groups like the Sanger’s have, for now, been focusing on specific sets of genes rather than attempting to go after all of them at once. “We have initially focused on the more likely candidates and then will move to less likely ones and eventually to those genes for which there is no known function,” says Wooster. The Sanger group first opted to home in on genes that act in certain pathways, such as the one involving the infamous ras oncogene, which is mutated in many cancers. The strategy paid off and in 2002 the group discovered a gene, called BRAF, that is mutated in 66% of malignant melanomas and at a lower frequency in a wide range of other human cancers. The Sanger is now collaborating with the UK’s Institute for Cancer Research, a private research institute based in London, to develop compounds to target this mutation. A similar approach was independently adopted by Johns Hopkins University scientists, who had been working for many years on the genetics of colon cancer. “We were the first to start looking at gene families in a systematic way, starting with the tyrosine kinases in colon cancer,” says Velculescu. “And we made an effort to be comprehensive in our search.” In 2004, they discovered PIK3CA, a gene that is mutated in about 30% of all human cancers that had somehow slipped through the fingers of cancer researchers until then. The kinase family of proteins has been a favorite among cancer gene hunters because these enzymes mediate the signals that tell a cell to grow or stop growing, processes that go awry in cancer cells. In addition, one of the most successful modern cancer drugs, Gleevec (imatinib mesylate), targets a kinase. “If we can find more kinase mutations, drug companies will already know how to make drugs against them,” says Matthew Meyerson of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. But researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have cast a wider net to fish out cancer mutations. They first selected several interesting pathways and gene families and then identified genes within them that are specifically expressed in their cancer of interest, a type of leukemia called AML. “For example, out of the long list of receptor tyrosine kinases only a small fraction is expressed in AML cells, so we reasoned it would be most productive to only sequence those genes,” says Timothy J. Ley, who collaborates with Rick Wilson, the director of the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University. To add to the list of possible candidates to sequence, the researchers also used a technique to find small deletions and amplifications throughout cancer genomes, which may flag the positions of possible cancer genes. As the speed with which DNA can be sequenced increases and costs decrease, it may be possible in a few years to sequence every gene in every cancer. “It makes absolute sense [to do that eventually],” says Meyerson. “We don’t know enough about the process to say which genes could be involved. It could be that non-coding genes or even non-transcribed genes play a role [in cancer].” But for now most researchers say a more selective approach is their best bet. “We don’t need every gene sequence. Of course there will be endless arguments about which genes to focus on,” says NCI researcher Louis Staudt, who studies lymphoma. DNA sequencing, although a major component, is only one part of the process of finding cancer mutations. “There are many ways to create a tumor,” says Meyerson. “So you need more than one approach to look for alterations in the DNA.” Indeed cancers can arise from small mutations in the DNA sequences, changes in the number of copies of specific genes, rearrangements affecting entire chromosomes, and even from tumor viruses that land inside or next to human genes. “The only way to move forward is to do whole genome expression studies and copy number and gene loss assays—which are fairly easy to do—as well as obtaining the sequence information on a subset of human genes,” says Staudt. “These approaches need to proceed in parallel. And then perhaps you also need to look at epigenetic changes.” (Epigenetic changes—heritable changes in genome function that do not alter the DNA sequence—are also thought to be players in cancer.) Meyerson’s group, in collaboration with that of William Sellers (who has just left his post at the Dana-Farber to become head of oncology research for the pharmaceutical giant Novartis), has been using a combination of sequencing and “SNP arrays” to find cancer genes. SNP array technology enables researchers to look for changes in the number of copies of specific genes across the entire genome. This approach identified a gene that is amplified in melanoma, especially in metastatic disease, showing that genomics can be useful not only to develop therapies but also for determining disease prognosis. In addition to taking advantage of different approaches scientists need to “validate potential drug targets as part of [their] screening program,” says Robert L. Strausberg, vice president for human genomic medicine at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland. His group collaborates with Greg Riggins at Johns Hopkins University and Lloyd Old and Andy Simpson at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in New York City to do just that. Strausberg’s team looks for genomic changes in tumors, whereas the Hopkins and Ludwig teams evaluate potential targets and test possible therapies by way of small molecules and antibodies. “Both Hopkins and the Ludwig can do early clinical trials,” explains Strausberg, who believes that a greater involvement of academic scientists in the early stages of the drug development process would produce a higher number of hits. “It is important to provide resources to both academic and industrial scientists to help build truly integrated partnerships, quite distinct from the traditional view of translational research,” he adds. The translation of cancer mutations into cancer therapies is the driving goal of HCGP and similar projects. But some feel the challenge is insurmountable. “If you have a type of tumor that has a stable genome, such as some leukemias, it is possible to cure it by targeting one mutation,” says Garth R. Anderson of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York. “But in most adult solid tumors the genome is shot to hell by the time the tumor is found. Even if you find genes like BRAF, the mutation will not be in every cell [in the tumor].” The large variation in molecular changes from one tumor to another, and even within the same tumor from one cell to another, has long been an obstacle for the development of effective therapies. A recent study by the Sanger group provided the first clear demonstration of the vast array of mutations present in cancer cells. The study, which generated over 40 million bases of DNA sequence, identified close to 200 mutations in protein kinase genes in lung tumors, indicating that many mutated protein kinases may be contributing to lung cancer development but that mutations in any one gene are infrequent. “For some tumors we will find high frequency mutations that will make good drug targets, but many will be a mixture of different low frequency mutations,” says Wooster. He adds, however, that this information is still useful “because it informs the drug companies as to what the cancer cell world looks like and how to develop better therapies.” To many cancer specialists, this kind of molecular characterization of tumors is what is needed to move the field forward. “We have already gotten so much mileage out of single molecular abnormalities. This gives us great encouragement to continue with the approach,” says Larry Norton, a breast-oncologist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and chair of the medical board of The Breast Cancer Research Foundation. “Speaking on behalf of the therapeutic community, I am very supportive of the [HCGP] initiative. Even if you cannot find therapies it will help us determine prognosis and how to better treat patients,” he adds. The identification of genes that are mutated in cancer is likely to have ripple-down effects in all areas of cancer research. “We cannot predict at this stage all that will come from [the HCGP], but we are excited about it because it might help us with our own work,” says Judah Folkman, a researcher at Childrens’ Hospital Boston, renowned for developing drugs to cut off the blood and nutrient supply to tumors. At the moment, no one knows what switches on the abnormal sprouting of blood vessels that feeds tumor growth. “We hope that the cancer genome project will help us find the genes responsible for controlling the switch,” says Folkman. Despite the encouragement expressed by many cancer researchers, most agree that gathering and interpreting massive amounts of sequence data and integrating it with other kinds of genomics information will not be easy. By one estimate, the amount of sequencing alone required for the HCGP will be equivalent to doing about 150 Human Genome Projects. Beyond the challenge of obtaining accurate DNA sequence on such a large scale, researchers will have to sift through the hundreds of changes identified in any one set of genes and determine which are specific to cancer and which are normal changes that occur in the DNA of any individual (in other words, polymorphisms). Ley, Wilson, and colleagues addressed this problem by comparing each cancer sequence to that of DNA taken from skin cells of the same patient—polymorphisms should be present in both samples whereas cancer-specific changes should be present only in the cancer DNA. “Until massive numbers of genomes are sequenced so that we have a database of all polymorphisms, including rare ones, you have to compare tumor versus germline in the same patient,” says Ley. “You need to anticipate this problem and design your experiments to overcome it, even if it will require more effort.” Another potential stumbling block is obtaining cancer DNA that is sufficiently pure (in other words, free of DNA from normal cells) and in large enough quantities. Scientists who are doing this work say they have spent up to several years finessing techniques to produce tumor databases with the required quality and quantity of genomic DNA. These kinds of issues will be crucial, scientists say, to the success of the HCGP pilot project, expected to start in 2006. If all goes well, full-scale implementation of the HCGP, which would include as many as 50 tumor types, should begin in 2009 and last until 2014. This timeline (along with preliminary details about the project) was determined by a working group of NCI’s Cancer Genome Anatomy Project, co-chaired by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center president Leland Hartwell and Broad Institute director Eric Lander, which presented its recommendations in February 2005. (Their proposal is available at http://www.genome.gov/Pages/About/NACHGR/May2005NACHGRAgenda/ReportoftheWorkingGrouponBiomedicalTechnology.pdf) NCI and NHGRI have each committed $50 million to the 3 year pilot project, pending approval from their respective scientific advisory boards and council. But the full price tag of the project, or where the rest of the money will come from, has not yet been revealed. The original proposal for the full-scale HCGP estimated that today the project would cost $12.5 billion, but by the time it actually takes off, assuming that sequencing technologies continue to become cheaper, the price tag would be about $1.3 billion. The potential expense has many scientists worried that the project will take funds away from individual grants at a time of tight funding, but supporters say that is not the intent. “In terms of vision, the scientists who support this project are seeing it as an additional resource rather than taking away money from available funds,” says Meyerson. Earlier this year, NCI director Andrew C. von Eschenbach (who in September took on the additional duties of acting commissioner for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) set the goal of eliminating suffering and death due to cancer by 2015. Whether projects like the HCGP and other NCI initiatives will bring us closer to that goal remains to be seen. But for now, scientists are cautiously optimistic about what the HCGP gene hunt will produce."
https://openalex.org/W2010688404,"Heparan sulfate (HS) interacts with a variety of proteins and thus mediates numerous complex biological processes. These interactions critically depend on the patterns of O-sulfate groups within the HS chains that determine binding sites for proteins. In particular the distribution of 6-O-sulfated glucosamine residues influences binding and activity of HS-dependent signaling molecules. The protein binding domains of HS show large structural variability, potentially because of differential expression patterns of HS biosynthetic enzymes along with differences in substrate specificity. To investigate whether different isoforms of HS glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfotransferase (6-OST) give rise to differently sulfated domains, we have introduced mouse 6-OST1, 6-OST2, and 6-OST3 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and compared the effects of overexpression on HS structure. High expression of any one of the 6-OST enzymes resulted in appreciably increased 6-O-sulfation of N-sulfated as well as N-acetylated glucosamine units. The increased 6-O-sulfation was accompanied by a decrease in nonsulfated as well as in iduronic acid 2-O-sulfated disaccharide structures. Furthermore, overexpression led to an altered HS domain structure, the most striking effect was the formation of extended 6-O-sulfated predominantly N-acetylated HS domains. Although the effect was most noticeable in 6-OST3-expressing cells, these results were largely independent of the particular 6-OST isoform expressed and mainly influenced by the level of overexpression."
