The readily identified members of the 11 pairs of chromosomes, including the sex chromosomes (X(1) and X(2)), have aided in localizing minute structural alterations within recloned diploid and aneuploid sublines."

https://openalex.org/W1989732073,"In addition to the electronic factors, there is a steric factor responsible for the carcinogenicity of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. A carcinogenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon must bear steric resemblance to steroids. One possible implication to this requirement for carcinogenicity is that these hydrocarbons may act on the same sites as steroid hormones."

The cells readily attached to glass and were capable of at least limfted, and in some cases extended, division in media consisting of commercially available components."
https://openalex.org/W2076762078,"IN recent years tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene) has rapidly gained in importance as an industrial solvent. Its toxic effects have not been investigated very much, however, and its metabolism is almost unknown. The present work was carried out in order to facilitate the estimation of health hazards caused by exposure to this solvent."

This latter aspect has been investigated in fœtal sheep over the age-range 80–145 days (full term)."

https://openalex.org/W2070426323,"DURING the examination of plants for phenolic constituents, the orchid Dendrobium thyrsiflorum was found to contain three highly fluorescent constituents (E. C. Bate-Smith, personal communication). The substances were extracted from a leaf hydrolysate with amyl alcohol and chromatographed on Whatman No. 1 paper using several different solvent systems. All the substances concerned fluoresce strongly a light blue-violet colour which is changed to green when the paper is sprayed with 2 N sodium hydroxide. The R F values in toluene/acetic acid/water (supernatant phase from 4 : 1 : 5 vol.) were 0.15, 0.77 and 0.85 and in 6 per cent acetic acid 0.43, 0.54 and 0.61. In Forestal solvent (hydrochloric acid/acetic acid/water) and butanol/acetic acid/water the R F values were all too high to give good separation."

https://openalex.org/W1510249536,"KOJIBIOSE (2-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glycopyranose) was first detected in saké and its moromi1, and it was isolated from hydrol2, koji extract3 and honey4 as its crystalline α- and (β-octaacetates. Chemical synthesis5,6 of this sugar was also achieved. But the crystallization of free sugar was hitherto unsuccessful, so its properties such as melting point, specific rotation or its form of crystal were still unknown. We have now succeeded in crystallizing kojibiose and examining its properties."

https://openalex.org/W1627567943,"The Payne inversion is scattered throughout many natural and laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The results of this study show that the majority of flies in the tumorous-head strain are heterozygous for a chromosome containing this inversion and the recessive mutant, scarlet eyes. This chromosome is maintained, in the laboratory stock at a high frequency through a heterotic mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1998654659,"EVIDENCE has been obtained that rat liver microsomes are the site where the formation of protein-bound aminoazo dyes occurs1‐3. On the other hand, one of the most important parts played by the microsome is known to be protein synthesis. Littlefield et al.
4 further fractionated the microsome by means of sodium deoxycholate and pointed out that the protein in the deoxycholate-insoluble fraction, ribonucleoprotein particles, showed a particularly high turn-over rate, suggesting that protein is in fact-synthesized in this fraction. This suggestion was supported by other authors5–7."
https://openalex.org/W1972316557,"As has been shown by Kahlson et al., in rats fed on a histamine-free diet, the urinary excretion of histamine begins at about the fifteenth day of pregnancy and increases rapidly. The peak value occurs 1 or 2 days before birth, then falls steeply to the pre-pregnant level. The increase in histamine excretion depends on the number of young in the litter; the larger the number, the greater the increase in histamine excretion1."
