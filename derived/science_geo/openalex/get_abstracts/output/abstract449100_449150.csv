https://openalex.org/W2060133690,"The release of humoral factors between cancer cells and the microenvironmental cells is critical for metastasis; however, the roles of secreted miRNAs in non-cell autonomous cancer progression against microenvironmental cells remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the neutral sphyngomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) regulates exosomal microRNA (miRNA) secretion and promotes angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment as well as metastasis. We demonstrate a requirement for nSMase2-mediated cancer cell exosomal miRNAs in the regulation of metastasis through the induction of angiogenesis in inoculated tumors. In addition, miR-210, released by metastatic cancer cells, was shown to transport to endothelial cells and suppress the expression of specific target genes, which resulted in enhanced angiogenesis. These findings suggest that the horizontal transfer of exosomal miRNAs from cancer cells can dictate the microenviromental niche for the benefit of the cancer cell, like ""on demand system"" for cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2072307422,"Gamma components of the local field potential (LFP) are elevated during cognitive and perceptual processes. It has been suggested that gamma power indicates the strength of neuronal population synchrony, which influences the relaying of signals between cortical areas. However, the relationship between coordinated spiking activity and gamma remains unclear, and the influence on corticocortical signaling largely untested. We investigated these issues by recording from neuronal populations in areas V1 and V2 of anesthetized macaque monkeys. We found that visual stimuli that induce a strong, coherent gamma rhythm result in enhanced pairwise and higher-order V1 synchrony. This is associated with stronger coupling of V1-V2 spiking activity, in a retinotopically specific manner. Coupling is more strongly related to the gamma modulation of V1 firing than to the downstream V2 rhythm. Our results thus show that elevated gamma power is associated with stronger coordination of spiking activity both within and between cortical areas."

We surveyed knowledge, attitudes and practices of AB prescribing among medical students and doctors in Kisangani, DR Congo. Methods Self-administered questionnaires. Results A total of 184 questionnaires were completed (response rate 94.4%). Knowledge about AB was low (mean score 4.9/8 points), as was the estimation of local resistance rates of S. Typhi and Klebsiella spp.(correct by 42.5% and 6.9% of respondents respectively). ABR was recognized as a problem though less in their own practice (67.4%) than nation- or worldwide (92.9% and 85.5%, p<.0001). Confidence in AB prescribing was high (88.6%) and students consulted more frequently colleagues than medical doctors when prescribing (25.4% versus 11.6%, p = 0.19). Sources of AB prescribing included pharmaceutical companies (73.9%), antibiotic guidelines (66.3%), university courses (63.6%), internet-sites (45.7%) and WHO guidelines (26.6%). Only 30.4% and 16.3% respondents perceived AB procured through the central procurement and local pharmacies as of good quality. Local AB guidelines and courses about AB prescribing are welcomed (73.4% and 98.8% respectively). Conclusions This data shows the need for interventions that support rational AB prescribing."
https://openalex.org/W2159149021,"Gaze fixation is an active process, with the incessant occurrence of tiny eye movements, including microsaccades. While the retinal consequences of microsaccades may be presumed minimal because of their minute size, a significant perceptual consequence of these movements can also stem from active extraretinal mechanisms associated with corollaries of their motor generation. Here I show that prior to microsaccade onset, spatial perception is altered in a very specific manner: foveal stimuli are erroneously perceived as more eccentric, whereas peripheral stimuli are rendered more foveal. The mechanism for this perceptual ""compression of space"" is consistent with a spatially specific gain modulation of visual representations caused by the upcoming eye movements, as is hypothesized to happen for much larger saccades. I then demonstrate that this perimicrosaccadic perceptual alteration has at least one important functional consequence: it mediates visual-performance alterations similar to ones classically attributed to the cognitive process of covert visual attention."
https://openalex.org/W2100454257,"Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped RNA virus that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. Infection requires internalization from the cell surface and trafficking to a late endocytic compartment, where viral fusion occurs, providing a conduit for the viral genome to enter the cytoplasm and initiate replication. In a concurrent study, we identified clomiphene as a potent inhibitor of EBOV entry. Here, we screened eleven inhibitors that target the same biosynthetic pathway as clomiphene. From this screen we identified six compounds, including U18666A, that block EBOV infection (IC(50) 1.6 to 8.0 µM) at a late stage of entry. Intriguingly, all six are cationic amphiphiles that share additional chemical features. U18666A induces phenotypes, including cholesterol accumulation in endosomes, associated with defects in Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1), a late endosomal and lysosomal protein required for EBOV entry. We tested and found that all six EBOV entry inhibitors from our screen induced cholesterol accumulation. We further showed that higher concentrations of cationic amphiphiles are required to inhibit EBOV entry into cells that overexpress NPC1 than parental cells, supporting the contention that they inhibit EBOV entry in an NPC1-dependent manner. A previously reported inhibitor, compound 3.47, inhibits EBOV entry by blocking binding of the EBOV glycoprotein to NPC1. None of the cationic amphiphiles tested had this effect. Hence, multiple cationic amphiphiles (including several FDA approved agents) inhibit EBOV entry in an NPC1-dependent fashion, but by a mechanism distinct from that of compound 3.47. Our findings suggest that there are minimally two ways of perturbing NPC1-dependent pathways that can block EBOV entry, increasing the attractiveness of NPC1 as an anti-filoviral therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2026706600,"Genetic recombination is a well-known phenomenon for enteroviruses. To investigate the genetic characterization and the potential recombination of enterovirus 71 (EV71) circulating in China, we determined the 16 complete genome sequences of EV71 isolated from Hand Foot Mouth Disease (HFMD) patients during the large scale outbreak and non-outbreak years since 1998 in China. The full length genome sequences of 16 Chinese EV71 in present study were aligned with 186 genome sequences of EV71 available from GenBank, including 104 China mainland and 82 international sequences, covering the time period of 1970–2011. The oldest strains of each subgenotype of EV71 and prototype strains of HEV-A were included to do the phylogenetic and Simplot analysis. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all Chinese strains were clustered into C4 subgenotype of EV71, except for HuB/CHN/2009 clustered into A and Xiamen/CHN/2009 clustered into B5 subgenotype. Most of C4 EV71 were clustered into 2 predominant evolutionary branches: C4b and C4a evolutionary brunches. Our comprehensive recombination analysis showed the evidence of genome recombination of subgenotype C4 (including C4a and C4b) sequences between structural genes from genotype C EV71 and non-structural genes from the prototype strains of CAV16, 14 and 4, but the evidence of intratypic recombination between C4 strains and B subgenotype was not enough strong. This intertypic recombination C4 viruses were first seen in 1998 and became the predominant endemic viruses circulating in China mainland for at least 14 years. A shift between C4a and C4b evolutionary brunches of C4 recombination viruses were observed, and C4a viruses have been associated with large scale nationwide HFMD outbreak with higher morbidity and mortality since 2007."
https://openalex.org/W2062628202,"The lining of the adult heart contains epicardial mesothelial cells (EMCs) that have the potential to undergo fibrogenic Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) during cardiac injury. EMT of EMCs has therefore been suggested to contribute to the heterogeneous fibroblast pool that mediates cardiac fibrosis. However, the molecular basis of this process is poorly understood. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to regulate a number of sub-cellular events in cardiac disease. Hence, we hypothesized that miRNAs regulate fibrogenic EMT in the adult heart. Indeed pro-fibrogenic stimuli, especially TGF-β, promoted EMT progression in EMC cultures, which resulted in differential expression of numerous miRNAs, especially the pleiotropic miR-21. Accordingly, ectopic expression of miR-21 substantially promoted the fibroblast-like phenotype arising from fibrogenic EMT, whereas an antagonist that targeted miR-21 blocked this effect, as assessed on the E-cadherin/α-smooth muscle actin balance, cell viability, matrix activity, and cell motility, thus making miR-21 a relevant target of EMC-derived fibrosis. Several mRNA targets of miR-21 was differentially regulated during fibrogenic EMT of EMCs and miR-21-dependent targeting of Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4) and Sprouty Homolog 1 (SPRY1) significantly contributed to the development of a fibroblastoid phenotype. However, PDCD4- and SPRY1-targeting was not entirely ascribable to all phenotypic effects from miR-21, underscoring the pleiotropic biological role of miR-21 and the increasing number of recognized miR-21 targets."
https://openalex.org/W2170200413,"Zinc is an essential nutrient because of its role in catalysis and in protein stabilization, but excess zinc is deleterious. We distinguished four nutritional zinc states in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: toxic, replete, deficient, and limited. Growth is inhibited in zinc-limited and zinc-toxic cells relative to zinc-replete cells, whereas zinc deficiency is visually asymptomatic but distinguished by the accumulation of transcripts encoding ZIP family transporters. To identify targets of zinc deficiency and mechanisms of zinc acclimation, we used RNA-seq to probe zinc nutrition-responsive changes in gene expression. We identified genes encoding zinc-handling components, including ZIP family transporters and candidate chaperones. Additionally, we noted an impact on two other regulatory pathways, the carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) and the nutritional copper regulon. Targets of transcription factor Ccm1 and various CAH genes are up-regulated in zinc deficiency, probably due to reduced carbonic anhydrase activity, validated by quantitative proteomics and immunoblot analysis of Cah1, Cah3, and Cah4. Chlamydomonas is therefore not able to grow photoautotrophically in zinc-limiting conditions, but supplementation with 1% CO2 restores growth to wild-type rates, suggesting that the inability to maintain CCM is a major consequence of zinc limitation. The Crr1 regulon responds to copper limitation and is turned on in zinc deficiency, and Crr1 is required for growth in zinc-limiting conditions. Zinc-deficient cells are functionally copper-deficient, although they hyperaccumulate copper up to 50-fold over normal levels. We suggest that zinc-deficient cells sequester copper in a biounavailable form, perhaps to prevent mismetallation of critical zinc sites.

Zinc is an essential nutrient required in abundance by organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Over 300 known enzymes utilize zinc as a cofactor, and whole genome surveys estimate that 4–10% of all sequenced proteins from prokaryotes and eukaryotes contain zinc-binding domains (1Andreini C. Banci L. Bertini I. Rosato A. Zinc through the three domains of life.J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 3173-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Excess zinc is believed to be toxic because it can compete for metal binding sites in other proteins and can indirectly generate damaging reactive oxygen species. Thus, intracellular zinc content must be regulated to ensure that zinc-containing proteins can function while excess zinc is avoided. The first level of control is at the step of assimilation, where intracellular zinc status controls the expression and presentation of low and high affinity transporters at the plasma membrane (2Ehrensberger K.M.

Another level of control is by compartmentalization, where transporters can sequester zinc in the vacuole (in fungi), lysosome-related compartments (in Caenorhabditis elegans), or in zincosomes (in mammalian cells) in a situation of excess (8Simm C.

Emerging mechanisms for heavy metal transport in plants.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 104-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The expression of each type of transporter is therefore critical for homeostasis, and there are multiple levels of control from transcription to trafficking to protein degradation (2Ehrensberger K.M.

Transporters in two families are important for zinc metabolism, the ZIP (Zrt-, Irt-like protein) family, whose members function primarily to move either zinc or iron into the cytoplasm, and the CDF (cation diffusion facilitator) family, whose members function primarily to move zinc out of the cytoplasm (13Davis D.E. Roh H.C. Deshmukh K. Bruinsma J.J. Schneider D.L. Guthrie J. Robertson J.D. Kornfeld K.

Merchant S.S. The ins and outs of algal metal transport.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 1531-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In plants, members of the CDF family are also called MTPs (metal tolerance proteins) because their function in moving metals out of the cytoplasm is important for handling toxicity (15Kim D. Gustin J.L. Lahner B. Persans M.W. Baek D. Yun D.J. Salt D.E.

The pattern of expression of individual members of these families in response to the concentration and type of metal nutrient provides a clue to their physiological functions. Photosynthetic microorganisms rely on the carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) 4The abbreviations used are: CCMcarbon-concentrating mechanismCAcarbonic anhydraseCytcytochromeTAPTris acetate-phosphateTPTris phosphateBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolPSI and PSIIphotosystem I and II, respectivelyICPinductively coupled plasmaRPKMreads per kilobase of mappable transcript length per million mapped reads. to concentrate CO2 at the active site of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the CO2 fixation pathway (reviewed in Refs. 17Badger M.R.

Carbonic anhydrases are integral components in this pathway and contribute to the high productivity of some of these organisms. These enzymes generally rely on a zinc cofactor (to activate water) to catalyze the interconversion of bicarbonate and CO2. In a zinc-deficient marine environment, cobalt can replace zinc, or an alternate enzyme that uses a cadmium cofactor can substitute (21Lane T.W. Morel F.M.

The occurrence of these zinc-sparing mechanisms is indicative of the contribution of carbonic anhydrases to the cellular zinc quota, meaning the optimally desired zinc content of the cell in a zinc-replete medium (24Merchant S.S.

We have developed Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a reference organism for understanding pathways of trace metal metabolism and homeostasis in algae and in the plant lineage, especially with respect to the impact of deficiency on bioenergetic pathways in the mitochondria and chloroplast (14Blaby-Haas C.E.

Chlamydomonas species have been found in various environmental niches distinguished by metal content, pH, and oxygen availability, suggesting that this genus has developed adaptive systems to deal with changing environmental conditions (26Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). In the laboratory, dilute Chlamydomonas cultures can reach stationary phase in 2–3 days in a simple salt-containing medium in which the trace elements are buffered by chelation with EDTA (27Kropat J.

A revised mineral nutrient supplement increases biomass and growth rate in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant J. 2011; 66: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The absence of serum or amino acid supplementation simplifies the provision of trace metal nutrients and the establishment of deficiency. We have been able to exploit this in previous work with Chlamydomonas cells experiencing iron, copper, or manganese deficiency, in which we noted that the assimilatory transporters are responsive to metal nutrition at the transcriptional level, including two genes encoding ZIP family members, which were named IRT1 and IRT2 because they responded to iron deficiency (28Page M.D. Kropat J.

Nevertheless, there are as many as a dozen members of the ZIP family in Chlamydomonas, and some of them are likely to be involved in zinc assimilation. The interaction of zinc and copper homeostasis pathways is also likely in Chlamydomonas. Cu(I) is taken up by the CTR (copper transporter) family of transporters, whose members are components of the nutritional copper regulon in Chlamydomonas. A zinc-containing SBP (squamosa-promoter binding protein) domain transcription factor named Crr1 (copper response regulator) controls the expression of the CTR genes (28Page M.D. Kropat J. Hamel P.P.

The best characterized of these target genes is CYC6, encoding cytochrome (Cyt) c6, which is a heme-containing replacement of the usual copper-containing protein, plastocyanin, in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain. Therefore, although copper-deficient Chlamydomonas cells do not accumulate plastocyanin, they remain photosynthetically competent (38Merchant S. Bogorad L.

Decreased plastocyanin abundance and transcriptional activation of CYC6 are classic markers for the copper deficiency state. In this work, we use growth and the expression of a subset of genes for ZIP family transporters as sentinels of zinc status to establish zinc deficiency and zinc limitation in Chlamydomonas, which are achieved by serial transfer of replete cells to medium lacking supplemental zinc. Transcriptome and proteome surveys identify the carbonic anhydrases and hence the carbon concentrating mechanism as a pathway impacted by poor zinc nutrition. We note also an impact on copper homeostasis, and we suggest the existence of mechanisms that control the ratio of intracellular metal ions.

For metal-free studies, all glassware was triple washed in 6 n hydrochloric acid followed by at least six rinses in Milli-Q-purified (Millipore) water. All media were made using Milli-Q water (39Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Copper-responsive gene expression during adaptation to copper deficiency.Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For experiments other than the proteomic studies, cells were grown in nutrient-replete medium, followed by one transfer into zinc medium with no supplemental zinc, before inoculation into the experimental conditions. For the proteomic studies, cells were grown in replete medium and directly inoculated into the experimental conditions. For experiments involving CO2 supplementation, cultures were bubbled with filtered air (control) or a mixture of 1% CO2 with air. Cell density was measured by counting with a hemocytometer. For CC-4532, room temperature fluorescence rise and decay kinetics were analyzed using a FluorCam 700MF (Photon Systems Instruments). Approximately 50 μl of concentrated mid-log phase liquid culture was spotted onto the lid of a plastic Petri dish and dark-adapted for 10 min prior to a flash of saturating light and measurement of the Kautsky effect in continuous red light at 150 μmol m−2 s−1 PFD (photon flux density) with 100% actinic light and 60% activity. For measurements of crr1 and CRR1 cells in zinc-replete and zinc-limited conditions, room temperature kinetics were measured using a laboratory-built instrument as described by Joliot and Joliot (40Joliot P. Joliot A. Cyclic electron transfer in plant leaf.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10209-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cell size was determined with a Beckman Coulter laser diffraction particle size analyzer LS13 320. Approximately 100 ml of cultures in exponential phase were poured into the micro-liquid module with a magnetic stir bar included to keep the cells in suspension. If necessary, cultures were concentrated or diluted until the sample obscuration was between 8 and 12%. Total Chlamydomonas RNA was prepared as described by Quinn and Merchant (39Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Copper-responsive gene expression during adaptation to copper deficiency.Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and by hybridization to CBLP (also called RACK1) as described previously (39Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Copper-responsive gene expression during adaptation to copper deficiency.Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A 915-bp EcoRI fragment from the cDNA cloned in pcf8-13 was used as the probe (41Schloss J.A. A Chlamydomonas gene encodes a G protein β subunit-like polypeptide.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 221: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was removed from the total RNA preparation by treatment with Turbo DNase (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications. 3 units of enzyme was used per 10 μg of nucleic acid, and incubation at 37 °C was increased to 90 min. Complementary DNA, primed with oligo(dT), was generated with reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification was carried out with reagents from the iQ SYBR Green Supermix qPCR kit (Bio-Rad). Each reaction contained the vendor's master mix, a 0.3 μm concentration of each primer, and cDNA corresponding to 20 ng of input RNA in the reverse transcriptase reaction. The reaction conditions for the Opticon 2 from MJ Research were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, up to 40 cycles. The fluorescence was measured at each cycle at 72 and 83 °C. The 2−ΔΔCT method was used to analyze the database on the fluorescence at 83 °C (42Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2−ΔΔCT method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124148) Google Scholar). Melting curves were performed after the PCR to assess the presence of a unique final product. RNAs were sequenced by Illumina on a GAIIx system for estimating transcript abundance. The reads were aligned using Bowtie (43Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15048) Google Scholar) in single-end mode and with a maximum tolerance of three mismatches to the Au10.2 transcript sequences (see the Phytozome Web site), corresponding to the version 4.0 assembly of the Chlamydomonas genome. Expression estimates were obtained for each individual run in units of reads per kilobase of mappable transcript length per million mapped reads (RPKM; see Ref. 44Mortazavi A. Williams B.A. McCue K.

The transcript coverage across the genome was visualized on a local installation of the UCSC browser. Differential expression analysis was performed in R with the DESeq package (45Anders S. Huber W. Differential expression analysis for sequence count data.Genome Biol. 2010; 11: R106Crossref PubMed Scopus (10356) Google Scholar), and p values were adjusted to control for false discovery rate with the Benjamini-Hochberg method (46Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the false discovery rate. A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Sequence files are publicly available in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession numbers GSE25622 and GSE41096). Chlamydomonas cultures were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min) and washed twice with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The total protein fraction was further subfractionated into soluble and membrane components as described by Howe and Merchant (47Howe G. Merchant S. The biosynthesis of membrane and soluble plastidic c-type cytochromes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is dependent on multiple common gene products.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of soluble fractions was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were diluted to 4 μg/μl. Membrane fractions were normalized by resuspending them to a volume that was equivalent to the final soluble fraction volume. Protein samples were denatured by the addition of 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 10 min before separation on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferring in a semidry blotter onto nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.0004% SDS (w/v), and 20% (v/v) methanol). The membrane was blocked overnight with 1% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) plus Tween 20 (0.05% (w/v)) before incubation in primary antiserum for 4–12 h. Gel concentrations (acrylamide monomer) and dilutions for each primary antibody were as follows: plastocyanin, 16%, 1:1000 dilution; Cyt c6, 16%, 1:1000 dilution; Cah1, 12%, 1:2000 dilution; Cah3, 12%, 1:2000; Cah4, 12%, 1:15,000 dilution; ferredoxin 15%, 1:10,000 dilution; and chloroplast ATP synthase, 10%, 1:20,000 dilution. Secondary goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Soluble protein was extracted from CC-4532 cells growing in 2.5 μm zinc and the first round of 0 supplemental zinc. For each condition, label-free, data-independent quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS or “LC-MSE”) was performed as previously described with slight modifications (35Castruita M.

Increased cerebral neovascularization differed regionally and was associated with poor vessel wall maturity. Building upon these findings, the goals of this study were to determine whether a) glycemic control prevents this erratic cerebral neovascularization in the GK model, and b) this pathological neovascularization pattern occurs in Lepr(db/db) model, which is the most commonly used model of T2D for studies involving cerebral complications of diabetes. Vascular volume, surface area and structural parameters including microvessel/macrovessel ratio, non-FITC (fluorescein) perfusing vessel abundance, vessel tortuosity, and branch density were measured by 3D reconstruction of FITC stained vasculature in GK rats or Lepr(db/db) mice. GK rats exhibited an increase in all of these parameters, which were prevented by glycemic control with metformin. In Lepr(db/db) mice, microvascular density was increased but there was no change in nonFITC-perfusing vessels. Increased PA branch density was associated with reduced branch diameter. These results suggest that T2D leads to cerebral neovascularization and remodeling but some structural characteristics of newly formed vessels differ between these models of T2D. The prevention of dysfunctional cerebral neovascularization by early glucose control suggests that hyperglycemia is a mediator of this response."
https://openalex.org/W2066949228,"To explore the key regulatory genes associated with lung cancer in order to reduce its occurrence and progress through silencing these key genes.To identify the key regulatory genes involved in lung cancer, we performed a combination of gene array and bioinformatics analyses to compare gene transcription profiles in 3 monoclonal cell strains with high, medium or low metastatic abilities, which were separated from the SPC-A-1sci and SPC-A-1 cell lines by limiting dilution monoclone assay. We then analyzed those genes' biological activities by knocking down their expression in SPC-A-1sci cells using siRNA and lenti-viral shRNA vectors, followed by determinations of the invasion and migration capabilities of the resulting cell lines in vitro as well as their potential for inducing occurrence and metastasis of lung cancer in vivo. To examine the clinical relevance of these findings, we analyzed the expression levels of the identified genes in human lung cancer tissues (n = 135) and matched adjacent normal tissues by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.Three monoclonal cell strains characterized with high, medium or low metastatic abilities were successfully selected. Gene array and bioinformatics analyses implied that osteopontin, LAMB3 and ITGB1 were key genes involved in lung cancer. Knockdown of these genes suppressed human lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Clinical sample analyses indicated that osteopontin, LAMB3 and ITGB1 protein expression levels were higher in lung cancer patients, compared to non-cancerous adjacent tissues, and correlated with lymphatic metastasis.We confirmed that osteopontin, LAMB3 and ITGB1 played important roles in the occurrence and metastasis of lung cancer, thus provided important clues to understanding the molecular mechanism of metastasis and contributing to the therapeutic treatment of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2064304241,"Background The persistent colonization of paranasal sinus mucosa by microbial biofilms is a major factor in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Control of microorganisms within biofilms is hampered by the presence of viscous extracellular polymers of host or microbial origin, including nucleic acids. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of extracellular DNA in biofilm formation by bacteria associated with CRS. Methods/Principal Findings Obstructive mucin was collected from patients during functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Examination of the mucous by transmission electron microscopy revealed an acellular matrix punctuated occasionally with host cells in varying states of degradation. Bacteria were observed in biofilms on mucosal biopsies, and between two and six different species were isolated from each of 20 different patient samples. In total, 16 different bacterial genera were isolated, of which the most commonly identified organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and α-haemolytic streptococci. Twenty-four fresh clinical isolates were selected for investigation of biofilm formation in vitro using a microplate model system. Biofilms formed by 14 strains, including all 9 extracellular nuclease-producing bacteria, were significantly disrupted by treatment with a novel bacterial deoxyribonuclease, NucB, isolated from a marine strain of Bacillus licheniformis. Extracellular biofilm matrix was observed in untreated samples but not in those treated with NucB and extracellular DNA was purified from in vitro biofilms. Conclusion/Significance Our data demonstrate that bacteria associated with CRS form robust biofilms which can be reduced by treatment with matrix-degrading enzymes such as NucB. The dispersal of bacterial biofilms with NucB may offer an additional therapeutic target for CRS sufferers."
https://openalex.org/W2020915224,"The discovery of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells provides not only new approaches for cell replacement therapy, but also new ways for drug screening. However, the undefined mechanism and relatively low efficiency of reprogramming have limited the application of iPS cells. In an attempt to further optimize the reprogramming condition, we unexpectedly observed that removing c-Myc from the Oct-4, Sox-2, Klf-4, and c-Myc (OSKM) combination greatly enhanced the generation of iPS cells. The iPS cells generated without c-Myc attained salient pluripotent characteristics and were capable of producing full-term mice through tetraploid complementation. We observed that forced expression of c-Myc induced the expression of many genes involved in cell cycle control and a hyperproliferation state of the mouse embryonic fibroblasts during the early stage of reprogramming. This enhanced proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts correlated negatively to the overall reprogramming efficiency. By applying small molecule inhibitors of cell proliferation at the early stage of reprogramming, we were able to improve the efficiency of iPS cell generation mediated by OSKM. Our data demonstrated that the proliferation rate of the somatic cell plays critical roles in reprogramming. Slowing down the proliferation of the original cells might be beneficial to the induction of iPS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040395198,"LGR5 is a Wnt pathway associated G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that serves as a molecular determinant of stem cells in numerous tissues including the intestine, stomach, hair follicle, eye, and mammary gland. Despite its importance as a marker for this critical niche, little is known about LGR5 signaling nor the biochemical mechanisms and receptor determinants that regulate LGR5 membrane expression and intracellular trafficking. Most importantly, in cells LGR5 is predominantly intracellular, yet the mechanisms underlying this behavior have not been determined. In this work we elucidate a precise trafficking program for LGR5 and identify the motif at its C terminus that is responsible for the observed constitutive internalization. We show that this process is dependent upon dynamin GTPase activity and find that wild-type full-length LGR5 rapidly internalizes into EEA1- and Rab5-positive endosomes. However, LGR5 fails to rapidly recycle to the plasmid membrane through Rab4-positive vesicles, as is common for other GPCRs. Rather, internalized LGR5 transits through Rab7- and Rab9-positive vesicles, co-localizes in vesicles with Vps26, a retromer complex component that regulates retrograde trafficking to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and reaches a steady-state distribution in the TGN within 2 h. Using mutagenesis, particularly of putative phosphorylation sites, we show that the amino acid pair, serine 861 and 864, is the principal C-tail determinant that mediates LGR5 constitutive internalization. The constitutive internalization of LGR5 to the TGN suggests the existence of novel biochemical roles for its Wnt pathway related, but ill defined signaling program.

https://openalex.org/W2062728762,"Channelrhodopsins are microbial type rhodopsins that operate as light-gated ion channels. Largely prolonged lifetimes of the conducting state of channelrhodopsin-2 may be achieved by mutations of crucial single amino acids, i.e. cysteine 128. Such mutants are of great scientific interest in the field of neurophysiology because they allow neurons to be switched on and off on demand (step function rhodopsins). Due to their slow photocycle, structural alterations of these proteins can be studied by vibrational spectroscopy in more detail than possible with wild type. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence that the photocycle of the C128T mutant involves three different dark-adapted states that are populated according to the wavelength and duration of the preceding illumination. Our results suggest an important role of multiphoton reactions and the previously described side reaction for dark state regeneration. Structural changes that cause formation and depletion of the assumed ion conducting state P520 are only small and follow larger changes that occur early and late in the photocycle, respectively. They require only minor structural rearrangements of amino acids near the retinal binding pocket and are triggered by all-trans/13-cis retinal isomerization, although additional isomerizations are also involved in the photocycle. We will discuss an extended photocycle model of this mutant on the basis of spectroscopic and electrophysiological data."

This study aimed to determine whether bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) or plasma MMP measurements correlated with disease severity or functional decline in emphysema.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and luminex assays measured MMP-1, -9, -12 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 in the BALF and plasma of non-smokers, smokers with normal lung function and moderate-to-severe emphysema subjects. In the cohort of 101 emphysema subjects correlative analyses were done to determine if MMP or TIMP-1 levels were associated with key disease parameters or change in lung function over an 18-month time period.Compared to non-smoking controls, MMP and TIMP-1 BALF levels were significantly elevated in the emphysema cohort. Though MMP-1 was elevated in both the normal smoker and emphysema groups, collagenase activity was only increased in the emphysema subjects. In contrast to BALF, plasma MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were actually decreased in the emphysema cohort compared to the control groups. Both in the BALF and plasma, MMP and TIMP-1 measurements in the emphysema subjects did not correlate with important disease parameters and were not predictive of subsequent functional decline.MMPs are altered in the BALF and plasma of emphysema; however, the changes in MMPs correlate poorly with parameters of disease intensity or progression. Though MMPs are pivotal in the pathogenesis of COPD, these findings suggest that measuring MMPs will have limited utility as a prognostic marker in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2011863851,"Recent evidence has shown top-down modulation of the brainstem frequency following response (FFR), generally in the form of signal enhancement from concurrent stimuli or from switching between attention-demanding task stimuli. However, it is also possible that the opposite may be true--the addition of a task, instead of a resting, passive state may suppress the FFR. Here we examined the influence of a subsequent task, and the relevance of the task modality, on signal clarity within the FFR. Participants performed visual and auditory discrimination tasks in the presence of an irrelevant background sound, as well as a baseline consisting of the same background stimuli in the absence of a task. FFR pitch strength and amplitude of the primary frequency response were assessed within non-task stimulus periods in order to examine influences due solely to general cognitive state, independent of stimulus-driven effects. Results show decreased signal clarity with the addition of a task, especially within the auditory modality. We additionally found consistent relationships between the extent of this suppressive effect and perceptual measures such as response time and proclivity towards one sensory modality. Together these results suggest that the current focus of attention can have a global, top-down effect on the quality of encoding early in the auditory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1984664294,"Background Apoptosis plays an important role in the development of heart failure. The aim of the prospectively designed study was to assess whether the concentration of apoptotic markers apoptosis-stimulating fragment (Fas, CD95/APO-1) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) can predict prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Methods The concentrations of soluble Fas and TRAIL were determined in 295 patients with acute coronary syndromes. The status of all patients was evaluated at 6 months. The primary goal was a composite end-point of death and hospitalization for heart failure. The secondary end-points were re-MI, death alone and stroke alone. Results During the median follow-up of 6 months, 26 patients experienced the composite end-point. Using multivariate logistic regression, the concentration of TRAIL was the strongest significant and independent predictor of composite end-point (OR 0.11 (95% CI 0.03–0.45), p = 0.002). Low concentration was associated with poor prognosis of patients. Other significant predictors of composite end-point were serum creatinine (OR 7.7 (95% CI 1.1–54.5, p = 0.041) and complete revascularization (OR 0.19 (95% CI 0.05–0.78, p = 0.02). Independent significant predictors of death in the multivariate analysis were the concentration of TRAIL (OR 0.053 (95% CI 0.004–0.744), p = 0.029), older age (OR 1.20 (95% CI 1.02–1.41, p = 0.026) and serum creatinine (OR 15.1 (95% CI 1.56–145.2), p = 0.0193). Re-MI or stroke could not be predicted by any combination of obtained parameters. Conclusions Low concentrations of soluble TRAIL represent a strong predictor of a poor prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The predictive value of TRAIL concentration is independent of age, ejection fraction, index peak troponin level, concentration of BNP or serum creatinine."

The crystal structure for the Hect domain of E6AP reveals two lobes arranged in an L shape with an amino-terminal lobe that can be subdivided into large and small subdomains, the latter of which binds E2 in a defined pocket, connected by a hinge peptide to a carboxyl-terminal lobe harboring the active site Cys820 to which the E2-bound ubiquitin thioester is transferred (26Huang L.

Insights into ubiquitination by the E2-E3 enzyme cascade.Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The conventional mechanism of Hect ligase conjugation posits binding of E2∼ubiquitin thioester to the small amino-terminal subdomain, based on the crystal structure, then transfer of its activated polypeptide to the active site Hect domain cysteine to form an E3∼ubiquitin thioester, which serves as the immediate donor for target protein conjugation and subsequent sequential polyubiquitin chain elongation (26Huang L.

However, the structure of UbcH7 bound to the small amino-terminal subdomain of E6AP poses problems in accounting for the mechanism of Cys820 thioester formation from the bound E2-ubiquitin thioester, as the latter is separated from Cys820 by 41 Å, whereas thioester transfer requires the donor and acceptor sulfurs within the two sites to be within atomic distance for nucleophilic attack (26Huang L.

Finally, early single-turnover studies of Hect domain function suggest that ligases may employ different mechanisms for polyubiquitin chain synthesis in which initial transfer of activated ubiquitin from the E2∼ubiquitin thioester to the active site Hect domain cysteine is followed by conjugation to the target protein and sequential elongation of the polyubiquitin chain in the case of KIAA10 or assembly of the polyubiquitin chain as an E6AP Cys820-linked thioester before its en bloc transfer to the target protein lysine (33Wang M. Cheng D. Peng J. Pickart C.M. Molecular determinants of polyubiquitin linkage selection by an HECT ubiquitin ligase.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1710-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study we have exploited the intrinsic ability of E6AP to form free polyubiquitin chains in the absence of substrate (34Wang M. Pickart C.M. Different HECT domain ubiquitin ligases employ distinct mechanisms of polyubiquitin chain synthesis.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) as a reporter function to study the core catalytic behavior of the enzyme (35Ronchi V.P. Haas A.L. Measuring rates of ubiquitin chain formation as a functional readout of ligase activity.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 832: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of free chain formation in biochemically defined functional assays has unambiguously defined the E2 specificity of the ligase. Unexpectedly, these results reveal for the first time that the E6AP Hect domain harbors a second cryptic E2∼ubiquitin thioester binding site that is directly required for formation of the Hect domain Cys820∼ubiquitin thioester intermediate, potentially resolving the long-standing question of active site geometry and E2-E3 transthiolation mechanism (26Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Structure of an E6AP-UbcH7 complex. Insights into ubiquitination by the E2-E3 enzyme cascade.Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Other observations suggest that the ubiquitin moiety of the E2∼ubiquitin thioester contributes significantly to overall binding affinity of the charged intermediate compared with uncharged E2 at the non-canonical binding site. These studies provide the first quantitative functional insights into the mechanistic details of the E6AP catalytic cycle and of interactions between the ligase and its E2-ubiquitin thioester substrate. Structural conservation among the Hect ligases in their catalytic domains suggest these mechanistic characteristics are shared by other members of the ligase superfamily.

An analogous strategy was used to produce Ubc5AC85A from pGEX4T1-HsUbc5A. Coding regions for all clones were sequenced to preclude cloning artifacts and, where relevant, to ensure the correct point mutation.

Active E2 concentrations were quantitated by the Uba1-dependent stoichiometric formation of 125I-ubiquitin thioester or, in the case of UbcH7C86S, the corresponding 125I-ubiquitin oxyester and compared with total E2 protein determined spectrophotometrically using their calculated 280-nm extinction coefficients (42Siepmann T.J.

Active E2 protein relative to total protein varied in a consistent paralog-specific manner from ∼90% (Ubc2b) to ∼20% (wild type and C86S mutant of UbcH7). Because UbcH7C86A, UbcH8C86A, and Ubc5AC85A proteins are inactive and cannot be quantitated by 125I-ubiquitin thioester formation, the concentration of “active” protein was calculated from the corresponding active fraction of total protein found for wild type E2 under the assumption that the mutation does not alter wild type protein stability. The E2 proteins were stored at −80 °C in small aliquots and were stable for greater than 6 months, although they were subject to differential rates of activity loss with successive freeze-thaw cycles (35Ronchi V.P.

To coincide with residues in the crystal structure, we refer to residue numbers in isoform 3 by their paralogous positions in isoform 1.

https://openalex.org/W2028185623,"Competition has long been assumed to be a major driver in regulating ecological communities. Intra-specific competition is considered to be maximal as members of the same species use the same ecological niches in a similar way. Many species of animals exhibit great physiological, behavioral, and morphological differences between sexes (sexual dimorphism). Here we report an extreme geographical segregation between the sexes in the greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum). To gain insight into the driving mechanisms of sexual segregation outside the mating season, we collected and integrated environmental, behavioral, physiological, and spatial information. We found that both sexes choose roosts with similar characteristics and the same food type, but use different habitats for different durations. Males forage around cliffs at higher and cooler elevations while females forage in lowlands around a river delta. We suggest that it is their different physiological and social needs, and not competition, that drives sexual segregation in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2064236642,"Identification and characterization of crucial gene target(s) that will allow focused therapeutics development remains a challenge. We have interrogated the putative therapeutic targets associated with the transcription factor Grainy head-like 2 (GRHL2), a critical epithelial regulatory factor. We demonstrate the possibility to define the molecular functions of critical genes in terms of their personalized expression profiles, allowing appropriate functional conclusions to be derived. A novel methodology, relative expression analysis with gene-set pairs (RXA-GSP), is designed to explore the potential clinical utility of cancer-biology discovery. Observing that Grhl2-overexpression leads to increased metastatic potential in vitro, we established a model assuming Grhl2-induced or -inhibited genes confer poor or favorable prognosis respectively for cancer metastasis. Training on public gene expression profiles of 995 breast cancer patients, this method prioritized one gene-set pair (GRHL2, CDH2, FN1, CITED2, MKI67 versus CTNNB1 and CTNNA3) from all 2717 possible gene-set pairs (GSPs). The identified GSP significantly dichotomized 295 independent patients for metastasis-free survival (log-rank tested p = 0.002; severe empirical p = 0.035). It also showed evidence of clinical prognostication in another independent 388 patients collected from three studies (log-rank tested p = 3.3e–6). This GSP is independent of most traditional prognostic indicators, and is only significantly associated with the histological grade of breast cancer (p = 0.0017), a GRHL2-associated clinical character (p = 6.8e–6, Spearman correlation), suggesting that this GSP is reflective of GRHL2-mediated events. Furthermore, a literature review indicates the therapeutic potential of the identified genes. This research demonstrates a novel strategy to integrate both biological experiments and clinical gene expression profiles for extracting and elucidating the genomic impact of a novel factor, GRHL2, and its associated gene-sets on the breast cancer prognosis. Importantly, the RXA-GSP method helps to individualize breast cancer treatment. It also has the potential to contribute considerably to basic biological investigation, clinical tools, and potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1969137066,"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the primary circadian pacemaker in mammals that can synchronize or entrain to environmental cues. Although light exerts powerful influences on SCN output, other non-photic stimuli can modulate the SCN as well. We recently demonstrated that daily performance of a cognitive task requiring sustained periods of attentional effort that relies upon basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic activity dramatically alters circadian rhythms in rats. In particular, normally nocturnal rats adopt a robust diurnal activity pattern that persists for several days in the absence of cognitive training. Although anatomical and pharmacological data from non-performing animals support a relationship between cholinergic signaling and circadian rhythms, little is known about how endogenous cholinergic signaling influences SCN function in behaving animals. Here we report that BF cholinergic projections to the SCN provide the principal signal allowing for the expression of cognitive entrainment in light-phase trained animals. We also reveal that oscillator(s) outside of the SCN drive cognitive entrainment as daily timed cognitive training robustly entrains SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals. Ablation of the SCN, however, resulted in significant impairments in task acquisition, indicating that SCN-mediated timekeeping benefits new learning and cognitive performance. Taken together, we conclude that cognition entrains non-photic oscillators, and cholinergic signaling to the SCN serves as a temporal timestamp attenuating SCN photic-driven rhythms, thereby permitting cognitive demands to modulate behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2008853726,"Protozoan grazing is a major mortality factor faced by bacteria in the environment. Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the disease cholera, is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems, and its survival depends on its ability to respond to stresses, such as predation by heterotrophic protists. Previous results show that grazing pressure induces biofilm formation and enhances a smooth to rugose morphotypic shift, due to increased expression of Vibrio polysaccharide (VPS). In addition to negatively controlling vps genes, the global quorum sensing (QS) regulator, HapR, plays a role in grazing resistance as the ΔhapR strain is efficiently consumed while the wild type (WT) is not. Here, the relative and combined contributions of VPS and QS to grazing resistance were investigated by exposing VPS and HapR mutants and double mutants in VPS and HapR encoding genes at different phases of biofilm development to amoeboid and flagellate grazers. Data show that the WT biofilms were grazing resistant, the VPS mutants were less resistant than the WT strain, but more resistant than the QS mutant strain, and that QS contributes to grazing resistance mainly in mature biofilms. In addition, grazing effects on biofilms of mixed WT and QS mutant strains were investigated. The competitive fitness of each strain in mixed biofilms was determined by CFU and microscopy. Data show that protozoa selectively grazed the QS mutant in mixed biofilms, resulting in changes in the composition of the mixed community. A small proportion of QS mutant cells which comprised 4% of the mixed biofilm biovolume were embedded in grazing resistant WT microcolonies and shielded from predation, indicating the existence of associational protection in mixed biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W2009348612,"Anthropogenic habitat modification often has a profound negative impact on the flora and fauna of an ecosystem. In parts of the Middle East, ephemeral rivers (wadis) are characterised by stands of acacia trees. Green, flourishing assemblages of these trees are in decline in several countries, most likely due to human-induced water stress and habitat changes. We examined the importance of healthy acacia stands for bats and their arthropod prey in comparison to other natural and artificial habitats available in the Arava desert of Israel. We assessed bat activity and species richness through acoustic monitoring for entire nights and concurrently collected arthropods using light and pit traps. Dense green stands of acacia trees were the most important natural desert habitat for insectivorous bats. Irrigated gardens and parks in villages and fields of date palms had high arthropod levels but only village sites rivalled acacia trees in bat activity level. We confirmed up to 13 bat species around a single patch of acacia trees; one of the richest sites in any natural desert habitat in Israel. Some bat species utilised artificial sites; others were found almost exclusively in natural habitats. Two rare species (Barbastella leucomelas and Nycteris thebaica) were identified solely around acacia trees. We provide strong evidence that acacia trees are of unique importance to the community of insectivorous desert-dwelling bats, and that the health of the trees is crucial to their value as a foraging resource. Consequently, conservation efforts for acacia habitats, and in particular for the green more densely packed stands of trees, need to increase to protect this vital habitat for an entire community of protected bats."
https://openalex.org/W1976722519,"Human fMRI studies revealed involvement of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) during memory retrieval. However, corresponding memory-related regions in macaque PPC have not been established. In this monkey fMRI study, comparisons of cortical activity during correct recognition of previously seen items and rejection of unseen items revealed two major PPC activation sites that were differentially characterized by a serial probe recognition paradigm: area PG/PGOp in inferior parietal lobule, along with the hippocampus, was more active for initial item retrieval, while area PEa/DIP in intraparietal sulcus was for the last item. Effective connectivity analyses revealed that connectivity from hippocampus to PG/PGOp, but not to PEa/DIP, increased during initial item retrieval. The two parietal areas with differential serial probe recognition profiles were embedded in two different subnetworks of the brain-wide retrieval-related regions. These functional dissociations in the macaque PPC imply the functional correspondence of retrieval-related PPC networks in macaques and humans."

Unfortunately, non-invasive techniques to evaluate the inflammatory host response to treatment are rare. Here, we evaluate (19)F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which enables the non-invasive visualization of inflammatory processes in pathological conditions by the use of perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions (PFC) for monitoring of oncolytic virotherapy.The Vaccinia virus strain GLV-1h68 was used as an oncolytic agent for the treatment of different tumor models. Systemic application of PFC emulsions followed by (1)H/(19)F MRI of mock-infected and GLV-1h68-infected tumor-bearing mice revealed a significant accumulation of the (19)F signal in the tumor rim of virus-treated mice. Histological examination of tumors confirmed a similar spatial distribution of the (19)F signal hot spots and CD68(+)-macrophages. Thereby, the CD68(+)-macrophages encapsulate the GFP-positive viral infection foci. In multiple tumor models, we specifically visualized early inflammatory cell recruitment in Vaccinia virus colonized tumors. Furthermore, we documented that the (19)F signal correlated with the extent of viral spreading within tumors.These results suggest (19)F MRI as a non-invasive methodology to document the tumor-associated host immune response as well as the extent of intratumoral viral replication. Thus, (19)F MRI represents a new platform to non-invasively investigate the role of the host immune response for therapeutic outcome of oncolytic virotherapy and individual patient response."
https://openalex.org/W1978658719,"The grain filling rate (GFR) is an important dynamic trait that determines the final grain yield and is controlled by a network of genes and environment factors. To determine the genetic basis of the GFR, a conditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis method was conducted using time-related phenotypic values of the GFR collected from a set of 243 immortalized F(2) (IF(2)) population, which were evaluated at two locations over 2 years. The GFR gradually rose in the 0-15 days after pollination (DAP) and 16-22 DAP, reaching a maximum at 23-29 DAP, and then gradually decreasing. The variation of kernel weight (KW) was mainly decided by the GFR, and not by the grain filling duration (GFD). Thirty-three different unconditional QTLs were identified for the GFR at the six sampling stages over 2 years. Among them, QTLs qGFR7b, qGFR9 and qGFR6d were identified at the same stages at two locations over 2 years. In addition, 14 conditional QTLs for GFR were detected at five stages. The conditional QTL qGFR7c was identified at stage V|IV (37-43 DAP) at two locations over 2 years, and qGFR7b was detected at the sixth stage (44-50 DAP) in all four environments, except at Anyang location in 2009. QTLs qQTL7b and qQTL6f were identified by unconditional and conditional QTL mapping at the same stages, and might represent major QTLs for regulating the GFR in maize in the IF(2) population. Moreover, most of the QTLs identified were co-located with QTLs from previous studies that were associated with GFR, enzyme activities of starch synthesis, soluble carbohydrates, and grain filling related genes. These results indicated that the GFR is regulated by many genes, which are specifically expressed at different grain filling stages, and the specific expression of the genes between 16-35 DAP might be very important for deciding the final kernel weight."
https://openalex.org/W1992312606,"Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Contrast-enhanced T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to characterize location and extent of BBB disruptions in focal MS lesions. We employed quantitative T1 measurements before and after the intravenous injection of a paramagnetic contrast agent to assess BBB permeability in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS). Methodology/Principal Findings Fifty-nine patients (38 females) with RR-MS undergoing immunomodulatory treatment and nine healthy controls (4 females) underwent quantitative T1 measurements at 3 tesla before and after injection of a paramagnetic contrast agent (0.2 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA). Mean T1 values were calculated for NAWM in patients and total cerebral white matter in healthy subjects for the T1 measurements before and after injection of Gd-DTPA. The pre-injection baseline T1 of NAWM (945±55 [SD] ms) was prolonged in RR-MS relative to healthy controls (903±23 ms, p = 0.028). Gd-DTPA injection shortened T1 to a similar extent in both groups. Mean T1 of NAWM was 866±47 ms in the NAWM of RR-MS patients and 824±13 ms in the white matter of healthy controls. The regional variability of T1 values expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV) was comparable between the two groups at baseline, but not after injection of the contrast agent. After intravenous Gd-DTPA injection, T1 values in NAWM were more variable in RR-MS patients (CV = 0.198±0.046) compared to cerebral white matter of healthy controls (CV = 0.166±0.018, p = 0.046). Conclusions/Significance We found no evidence of a global BBB disruption within the NAWM of RR-MS patients undergoing immunomodulatory treatment. However, the increased variation of T1 values in NAWM after intravenous Gd-DTPA injection points to an increased regional inhomogeneity of BBB function in NAWM in relapsing-remitting MS."
https://openalex.org/W2031604270,"We have previously shown that the defective ability of alveolar macrophages (AM) to phagocytose apoptotic cells ('efferocytosis') in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema (COPD) could be therapeutically improved using the C-type lectin, mannose binding lectin (MBL), although the exact mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown. An S-type lectin, galectin-3, is also known to regulate macrophage phenotype and function, via interaction with its receptor CD98. We hypothesized that defective expression of galectin/CD98 would be associated with defective efferocytosis in COPD and that mechanisms would include effects on cytoskeletal remodeling and macrophage phenotype and glutathione (GSH) availability. Galectin-3 was measured by ELISA in BAL from controls, smokers and current/ex-smokers with COPD. CD98 was measured on AM using flow cytometry. We assessed the effects of galectin-3 on efferocytosis, CD98, GSH, actin polymerisation, rac activation, and the involvement of PI3K (using β-actin probing and wortmannin inhibition) in vitro using human AM and/or MH-S macrophage cell line. Significant decreases in BAL galectin-3 and AM CD98 were observed in BAL from both current- and ex-smoker COPD subjects vs controls. Galectin 3 increased efferocytosis via an increase in active GTP bound Rac1. This was confirmed with β-actin probing and the role of PI3K was confirmed using wortmannin inhibition. The increased efferocytosis was associated with increases in available glutathione and expression of CD98. We provide evidence for a role of airway lectins in the failed efferocytosis in COPD, supporting their further investigation as potential macrophage-targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2162840804,"Dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism-related metabolic processes is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is well established that genetic and gender-specific variations in one-carbon metabolism contribute to the vulnerability to NAFLD in humans. To examine the role of one-carbon metabolism dysregulation in the pathogenesis and individual susceptibility to NAFLD, we used a “population-based” mouse model where male mice from 7 inbred were fed a choline- and folate-deficient (CFD) diet for 12 wk. Strain-dependent down-regulation of several key one-carbon metabolism genes, including methionine adenosyltransferase 1α (Mat1a), cystathionine-β-synthase (Cbs), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr), adenosyl-homocysteinase (Ahcy), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (Mthfd1), was observed. These changes were strongly associated with interstrain variability in liver injury (steatosis, necrosis, inflammation, and activation of fibrogenesis) and hyperhomocysteinemia. Mechanistically, the decreased expression of Mat1a, Ahcy, and Mthfd1 was linked to a reduced level and promoter binding of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (CEBPβ), which directly regulates their transcription. The strain specificity of diet-induced dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism suggests that interstrain variation in the regulation of one-carbon metabolism may contribute to the differential vulnerability to NFLD and that correcting the imbalance may be considered as preventive and treatment strategies for NAFLD.—Pogribny, I.

Crucial virulence determinants of pathogenic Nm strains are the polysaccharide capsules that support invasion by hindering complement attack. In NmW-135 and NmY the capsules are built from the repeating units (→ 6)-α-D-Gal-(1 → 4)-α-Neu5Ac-(2 →)n and (→ 6)-α-D-Glc-(1 → 4)-α-Neu5Ac-(2 →)n, respectively. These unusual heteropolymers represent unique examples of a conjugation between sialic acid and hexosyl-sugars in a polymer chain. Moreover, despite the various catalytic strategies needed for sialic acid and hexose transfer, single enzymes (SiaDW-135/Y) have been identified to form these heteropolymers. Here we used SiaDW-135 as a model system to delineate structure-function relationships. In size exclusion chromatography active SiaDW-135 migrated as a monomer. Fold recognition programs suggested two separate glycosyltransferase domains, both containing a GT-B-fold. Based on conserved motifs predicted folds could be classified as a hexosyl- and sialyltransferase. To analyze enzyme properties and interplay of the two identified glycosyltransferase domains, saturation transfer difference NMR and mutational studies were carried out. Simultaneous and independent binding of UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia was seen in the absence of an acceptor as well as when the catalytic cycle was allowed to proceed. Enzyme variants with only one functionality were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and shown to complement each other in trans when combined in an in vitro test system. Together the data strongly suggests that SiaDW-135 has evolved by fusion of two independent ancestral genes encoding sialyl- and galactosyltransferase activity."

In Italy, particularly Southern Italy, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents the main cause of HCC. Using high-density oligoarrays, we identified consistent differences in gene-expression between HCC and normal liver tissue. Expression patterns in HCC were also readily distinguishable from those associated with liver metastases. To characterize molecular events relevant to hepatocarcinogenesis and identify biomarkers for early HCC detection, gene expression profiling of 71 liver biopsies from HCV-related primary HCC and corresponding HCV-positive non-HCC hepatic tissue, as well as gastrointestinal liver metastases paired with the apparently normal peri-tumoral liver tissue, were compared to 6 liver biopsies from healthy individuals. Characteristic gene signatures were identified when normal tissue was compared with HCV-related primary HCC, corresponding HCV-positive non-HCC as well as gastrointestinal liver metastases. Pathway analysis classified the cellular and biological functions of the genes differentially expressed as related to regulation of gene expression and post-translational modification in HCV-related primary HCC; cellular Growth and Proliferation, and Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction in HCV-related non HCC samples; Cellular Growth and Proliferation and Cell Cycle in metastasis. Also characteristic gene signatures were identified of HCV-HCC progression for early HCC diagnosis.A diagnostic molecular signature complementing conventional pathologic assessment was identified."
https://openalex.org/W2019651806,"Recent advances in the ability to efficiently characterize tumor genomes is enabling targeted drug development, which requires rigorous biomarker-based patient selection to increase effectiveness. Consequently, representative DNA biomarkers become equally important in pre-clinical studies. However, it is still unclear how well these markers are maintained between the primary tumor and the patient-derived tumor models. Here, we report the comprehensive identification of somatic coding mutations and copy number aberrations in four glioblastoma (GBM) primary tumors and their matched pre-clinical models: serum-free neurospheres, adherent cell cultures, and mouse xenografts. We developed innovative methods to improve the data quality and allow a strict comparison of matched tumor samples. Our analysis identifies known GBM mutations altering PTEN and TP53 genes, and new actionable mutations such as the loss of PIK3R1, and reveals clear patient-to-patient differences. In contrast, for each patient, we do not observe any significant remodeling of the mutational profile between primary to model tumors and the few discrepancies can be attributed to stochastic errors or differences in sample purity. Similarly, we observe ∼96% primary-to-model concordance in copy number calls in the high-cellularity samples. In contrast to previous reports based on gene expression profiles, we do not observe significant differences at the DNA level between in vitro compared to in vivo models. This study suggests, at a remarkable resolution, the genome-wide conservation of a patient's tumor genetics in various pre-clinical models, and therefore supports their use for the development and testing of personalized targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2061506958,"GPCR desensitization and down-regulation are considered key molecular events underlying the development of tolerance in vivo. Among the many regulatory proteins that are involved in these complex processes, GASP-1 have been shown to participate to the sorting of several receptors toward the degradation pathway. This protein belongs to the recently identified GPCR-associated sorting proteins (GASPs) family that comprises ten members for which structural and functional details are poorly documented. We present here a detailed structure-function relationship analysis of the molecular interaction between GASPs and a panel of GPCRs. In a first step, GST-pull down experiments revealed that all the tested GASPs display significant interactions with a wide range of GPCRs. Importantly, the different GASP members exhibiting the strongest interaction properties were also characterized by the presence of a small, highly conserved and repeated ""GASP motif"" of 15 amino acids. We further showed using GST-pull down, surface plasmon resonance and co-immunoprecipitation experiments that the central domain of GASP-1, which contains 22 GASP motifs, is essential for the interaction with GPCRs. We then used site directed mutagenesis and competition experiments with synthetic peptides to demonstrate that the GASP motif, and particularly its highly conserved core sequence SWFW, is critically involved in the interaction with GPCRs. Overall, our data show that several members of the GASP family interact with GPCRs and highlight the presence within GASPs of a novel protein-protein interaction motif that might represent a new target to investigate the involvement of GASPs in the modulation of the activity of GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2080852467,"Background To evaluate the contribution of chemotherapy for patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated by intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to identify the optimal combination treatment strategy. Patients and Methods Between 2006 and 2010, 276 patients with stage II-IVb NPC were treated by IMRT alone or IMRT plus chemotherapy. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy included neoadjuvant or concurrent, or neoadjuvant plus concurrent protocols. The IMRT alone and chemoradiotherapy groups were well-matched for prognostic factors, except N stage, with more advanced NPC in the chemoradiotherapy arm. Results With a mean follow-up of 33.8 months, the 3-year actuarial rates of overall survival (OS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 90.3%, 84.2%, 80.3%, and 69.2% for all of the patients, respectively. Compared with the IMRT alone arm, patients treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy had a significantly better DFS (HR = 2.64; 95% CI, 1.12−6.22; P = 0.03), patients with neoadjuvant-concurrent chemoradiotherapy had a significant improvement in RFS and DFS (HR = 4.03; 95% CI, 1.35−12.05; P = 0.01 and HR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.09−5.44; P = 0.03), neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy provided no significant benefit in OS, MFS, RFS, and DFS. Stage group and alcohol consumption were prognostic factors for OS and N stage was a significant predictor for DFS. Conclusions Addition of concurrent or neoadjuvant-concurrent chemotherapy to IMRT is available to prolong RFS or DFS for locoregionally advanced NPC. Such work could be helpful to guide effective individualized therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1965935133,"Pramanicin (PMC) is an antifungal agent that was previously demonstrated to exhibit antiangiogenic and anticancer properties in a few in vitro studies. We initially screened a number of PMC analogs for their cytotoxic effects on HCT116 human colon cancer cells. PMC-A, the analog with the most potent antiproliferative effect was chosen to further interrogate the underlying mechanism of action. PMC-A led to apoptosis through activation of caspase-9 and -3. The apoptotic nature of cell death was confirmed by abrogation of cell death with pretreatment with specific caspase inhibitors. Stress-related MAPKs JNK and p38 were both activated concomittantly with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of p38 proved to attenuate the cell death induction while pretreatment with JNK inhibitor did not exhibit a protective effect. Resistance of Bax -/- cells and the protective nature of caspase-9 inhibition indicate that mitochondria play a central role in PMC-A induced apoptosis. Early post-exposure elevation of cellular Bim and Bax was followed by a marginal Bcl-2 depletion and Bid cleavage. Further analysis revealed that Bcl-2 downregulation occurs at the mRNA level and is critical to mediate PMC-A induced apoptosis, as ectopic Bcl-2 expression substantially spared the cells from death. Conversely, forced expression of Bim proved to significantly increase cell death. In addition, analyses of p53-/- cells demonstrated that Bcl-2/Bim/Bax modulation and MAPK activations take place independently of p53 expression. Taken together, p53-independent transcriptional Bcl-2 downregulation and p38 signaling appear to be the key modulatory events in PMC-A induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2007782515,"The precise mechanism of TGFβ1 signaling in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has remained unclear. In particular, a potential regulatory mechanism by which PKCδ affects profibrogenic gene expression had never been explored. In this study, therefore, the role of PKCδ in TGFβ1 mediated α-SMA expression was investigated using NASH model mice. In preparation of the NASH model, male C57BL6/J mice were fed a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 3 weeks, after which time they were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, Tlr4Lps-d (CH3/HeJ) mice were used to demonstrate the TGFβ1 signaling’s dependency on TLR4 induction. Liver histology and hepatic hepatitis markers were investigated, and hepatic gene expression levels were determined by real-time PCR. Acute liver injury by LPS injection specifically elevated not only α-SMA expression but also phospho-PKCδ in this model. In contrast, Tlr4Lps-d (CH3/HeJ) and blockade of TGFβ1 receptor by SB431542 resulted in a significant reduction of PKCδ activation and α-SMA expression. Moreover, the TGFβ1-induced α-SMA production was significantly reduced by a specific PKCδ inhibitor. These findings suggested that PKCδ plays a critical role in TGFβ1-induced α-SMA production in a NASH model. Thus, this was the first demonstration of the involvement of PKCδ in the regulation of α-SMA expression in NASH liver tissues, and the impaired induction of PKCδ phosphorylation by LPS in a steatohepatitis condition. Interestingly, treatment by PKCδ inhibitor caused dramatic reduction of myofibroblast activation, indicating that PKCδ represents a promising target for treating NASH."

Whether p38MAPK plays a pathogenic role in crescentic GN (GN) and which of its four isoforms is preferentially involved in kidney inflammation is not definitely known. We thus examined expression and activation of p38MAPK isoforms during anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis. Therefore, p38α conditional knockout mice (MxCre-p38αΔ/Δ) were used to examine the role of p38α in anti-GBM induced nephritis. Both wild type and MxCre-p38αΔ/Δ mice developed acute renal failure over time. Histological examinations revealed a reduced monocyte influx and less tubular damage in MxCre-p38αΔ/Δ mice, whereas glomerular crescent formation and renal fibrosis was similar. Likewise, the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1 and IL-10 were similar, but IL-8 was even up-regulated in MxCre-p38αΔ/Δ mice. In contrast, we could detect strong down-regulation of chemotactic cytokines such as CCL-2, -5 and -7, in the kidneys of MxCre-p38αΔ/Δ mice. In conclusion, p38α is the primary p38MAPK isoform expressed in anti-GBM nephritis and selectively affects inflammatory cell influx and tubular damage. Full protection from nephritis is however not achieved as renal failure and structural damage still occurs."

We used animal models of schizophrenia-like symptoms to examine the effects on schedule-induced polydipsia: post-weaning social isolation rearing, subchronic MK-801 treatment (an NMDA-receptor antagonist) or the two combined. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats reared in groups or in isolation beginning at postnatal day 21 were further divided to receive subchronic MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg twice daily) or saline for 7 days beginning on postnatal day 62. Following a 4-day withdrawal period, all groups were trained on a schedule-induced polydipsia paradigm. Under food-restriction, animals reared in isolation and receiving food pellets at 1-min intervals developed significantly more drinking behavior than those reared with others. The addition of subchronic MK-801 treatment did not significantly augment the amount of water consumed. These findings suggest a predisposition to polydipsia is a schizophrenia-like behavioral effect of post-weaning social isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2116912890,"A critical step in the induction of adaptive mucosal immunity is antigen transcytosis, in which luminal antigens are transported to organized lymphoid tissues across the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) of Peyer's patches. However, virtually nothing is known about intracellular signaling proteins and transcription factors that regulate apical-to-basolateral transcytosis. The FAE can transcytose a variety of luminal contents, including inert particles, in the absence of specific opsonins. Furthermore, it expresses receptors for secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), the main antibody in mucosal secretions, and uses them to efficiently transcytose SIgA-opsonized particles present in the lumen. Using a human FAE model, we show that the tyrosine kinase HCK regulates apical-to-basolateral transcytosis of non-opsonized and SIgA-opsonized particles. We also show that, in cultured intestinal epithelial cells, ectopic expression of the transcription factor SPIB or EHF is sufficient to activate HCK-dependent apical-to-basolateral transcytosis of these particles. Our results provide the first molecular insights into the intracellular regulation of antigen sampling at mucosal surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1973068311,"Traditional approaches to measuring the level of malaria infection involve counting the proportion of parasite-infected red blood cells (iRBC) in circulating blood, known as parasitaemia. However, iRBC can also accumulate within the microvasculature of tissues and organs, a process called sequestration. Thus measurements of parasitemia do not necessarily reflect the total parasite burden (TPB). Recent experimental advances have allowed TPB measurements to be made in humans and experimental models. TPB is particularly important because it is the best current predictor of malaria disease severity and death in humans. Understanding the relationship between freely circulating iRBC versus tissue-sequestered iRBC is an important question in infection dynamics. The recent ability to experimentally measure the dynamics of iRBC in blood and tissue during murine malaria provides an exciting potential window into sequestration, but new modeling approaches are clearly required to understand these interactions. We present a model of malaria dynamics during early infection that incorporates iRBC that both circulate in the blood and sequester in tissue microvasculature. We explore the effect that perturbations to the system have on the ratio of the number of iRBC between these compartments, and consider which changes are most consistent with experimental data from mice. Using this model we predict an increase in the clearance rate of sequestered iRBCs around the time when mild symptoms become apparent, but a more pronounced increase in the rate of sequestration of iRBCs associated with the onset of severe malaria symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2026699721,"The analysis of polygenic, phenotypic characteristics such as quantitative traits or inheritable diseases remains an important challenge. It requires reliable scoring of many genetic markers covering the entire genome. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies provides a new way to evaluate large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as genetic markers. Combining the technologies with pooling of segregants, as performed in bulked segregant analysis (BSA), should, in principle, allow the simultaneous mapping of multiple genetic loci present throughout the genome. The gene mapping process, applied here, consists of three steps: First, a controlled crossing of parents with and without a trait. Second, selection based on phenotypic screening of the offspring, followed by the mapping of short offspring sequences against the parental reference. The final step aims at detecting genetic markers such as SNPs, insertions and deletions with next generation sequencing (NGS). Markers in close proximity of genomic loci that are associated to the trait have a higher probability to be inherited together. Hence, these markers are very useful for discovering the loci and the genetic mechanism underlying the characteristic of interest. Within this context, NGS produces binomial counts along the genome, i.e., the number of sequenced reads that matches with the SNP of the parental reference strain, which is a proxy for the number of individuals in the offspring that share the SNP with the parent. Genomic loci associated with the trait can thus be discovered by analyzing trends in the counts along the genome. We exploit the link between smoothing splines and generalized mixed models for estimating the underlying structure present in the SNP scatterplots."
https://openalex.org/W2040306154,"The objective of this study was to determine the risk for the development of high depressive symptoms in study participants with diagnosed and previously undetected diabetes mellitus compared to those without diabetes in a prospective population-based cohort study in Germany.We estimated the 5-year cumulative incidence of high depressive symptoms in participants without high depressive symptoms at baseline (n = 3,633, 51.4% men, mean age (SD) 59.1 (7.6) years, 7.0% diagnosed diabetes, 5.3% previously undetected diabetes) from the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall study. Diabetes was assessed by self-report, medication, and blood glucose. High depressive symptoms were assessed using CES-D. We calculated odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence interval, using multiple logistic regression analyses.Cumulative 5-year incidences (95% CI) of high depressive symptoms in participants with diagnosed, undetected, and without diabetes were 7.1 (4.2-10.9), 4.1 (1.8-8.0), and 6.5 (5.6-7.4), respectively. The age-sex-adjusted OR for developing high depressive symptoms was 1.22 (0.74-2.03) in participants with diagnosed compared to those without diabetes, and 1.00 (0.59-1.68) after adjustment for BMI, physical activity, education, stroke, and myocardial infarction. The age-sex adjusted OR for developing high depressive symptoms in participants with previously undetected diabetes compared to those without diabetes was 0.72; 0.35-1.48; and fully adjusted 0.62; 0.30-1.30.We found no significant associations, maybe due to low power. However, our results are in line with a recent meta-analysis suggesting that risk of developing high depressive symptoms in patients with diagnosed diabetes may be moderately higher than in those without diabetes, and that comorbidity may explain in part this association. In participants with previously undetected diabetes, this first longitudinal study indicates that the risk is not increased or may even be decreased. These results support the hypothesis that high depressive symptoms develop due to diabetes-related burden and comorbidity and not due to hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2091170675,"Molecular Beacon (MB) probes have been extensively used for nucleic acid analysis because of their ability to produce fluorescent signal in solution instantly after hybridization. The indirect binding of MB probe to a target analyte offers several advantages, including: improved genotyping accuracy and the possibility to analyse folded nucleic acids. Here we report on a new design for MB-based sensor, called 'Operating Cooperatively' (OC), which takes advantage of indirect binding of MB probe to a target analyte. The sensor consists of two unmodified DNA strands, which hybridize to a universal MB probe and a nucleic acid analyte to form a fluorescent complex. OC sensors were designed to analyze two human SNPs and E. coli 16S rRNA. High specificity of the approach was demonstrated by the detection of true analyte in over 100 times excess amount of single base substituted analytes. Taking into account the flexibility in the design and the simplicity in optimization, we conclude that OC sensors may become versatile and efficient tools for instant DNA and RNA analysis in homogeneous solution."
https://openalex.org/W1999444184,"Salmonella are important human and animal pathogens. Though highly related, the Salmonella lineages may be strictly adapted to different hosts or cause different diseases, from mild local illness like gastroenteritis to fatal systemic infections like typhoid. Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of Salmonella is essential for timely and correct diagnosis of Salmonella infections. The current identification methods such as 16S rRNA sequencing and multilocus sequence typing are expensive and time consuming. Additionally, these methods often do not have sufficient distinguishing resolution among the Salmonella lineages.We compared 27 completely sequenced Salmonella genomes to identify possible genomic features that could be used for differentiation of individual lineages. We concatenated 2372 core genes in each of the 27 genomes and constructed a neighbor-joining tree. On the tree, strains of each serotype were clustered tightly together and different serotypes were unambiguously separated with clear genetic distances, demonstrating systematic genomic divergence among the Salmonella lineages. We made detailed comparisons among the 27 genomes and identified distinct sets of genomic differences, including nucleotide variations and genomic islands (GIs), among the Salmonella lineages. Two core genes STM4261 and entF together could unambiguously distinguish all Salmonella lineages compared in this study. Additionally, strains of a lineage have a common set of GIs and closely related lineages have similar sets of GIs.Salmonella lineages have accumulated distinct sets of mutations and laterally acquired DNA (e.g., GIs) in evolution. Two genes entF and STM4261 have diverged sufficiently among the Salmonella lineages to be used for their differentiation. Further investigation of the distinct sets of mutations and GIs will lead to novel insights into genomic evolution of Salmonella and greatly facilitate the elucidation of pathogeneses of Salmonella infections."
https://openalex.org/W2004867769,"Risk-sensitive adaptive spatial organisation during group movement has been shown to efficiently minimise the risks associated with external ecological threats. Whether animals can draw on such behaviours when confronted with man-made threats is generally less clear. We studied road-crossing in a wild, but habituated, population of meerkats living in the Kalahari Desert, South Africa. We found that dominant females, the core member in meerkat social systems, led groups to the road significantly more often than subordinates, yet were consistently less likely to cross first. Our results suggest that a reshuffling occurs in progression order when meerkat groups reach the road. By employing a simple model of collective movement, we have shown that risk aversion alone may be sufficient to explain this reshuffling, but that the risk aversion of dominant females toward road crossing is significantly higher than that of subordinates. It seems that by not crossing first, dominant females avoid occupying the most risky, exposed locations, such as at the front of the group--a potential selfish strategy that also promotes the long-term stability and hence reproductive output of their family groups. We argue that our findings support the idea that animals can flexibly apply phylogenetically-old behavioural strategies to deal with emerging modern-day problems."
https://openalex.org/W2040568123,"Hymenoptera, the insect order that includes sawflies, bees, wasps, and ants, exhibits an incredible diversity of phenotypes, with over 145,000 species described in a corpus of textual knowledge since Carolus Linnaeus. In the absence of specialized training, often spanning decades, however, these articles can be challenging to decipher. Much of the vocabulary is domain-specific (e.g., Hymenoptera biology), historically without a comprehensive glossary, and contains much homonymous and synonymous terminology. The Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology was developed to surmount this challenge and to aid future communication related to hymenopteran anatomy, as well as provide support for domain experts so they may actively benefit from the anatomy ontology development. As part of HAO development, an active learning, dictionary-based, natural language recognition tool was implemented to facilitate Hymenoptera anatomy term discovery in literature. We present this tool, referred to as the ‘Proofer’, as part of an iterative approach to growing phenotype-relevant ontologies, regardless of domain. The process of ontology development results in a critical mass of terms that is applied as a filter to the source collection of articles in order to reveal term occurrence and biases in natural language species descriptions. Our results indicate that taxonomists use domain-specific terminology that follows taxonomic specialization, particularly at superfamily and family level groupings and that the developed Proofer tool is effective for term discovery, facilitating ontology construction."
https://openalex.org/W1989251349,"Researchers often face the problem of needing to protect the privacy of subjects while also needing to integrate data that contains personal information from diverse data sources. The advent of computational social science and the enormous amount of data about people that is being collected makes protecting the privacy of research subjects ever more important. However, strict privacy procedures can hinder the process of joining diverse sources of data that contain information about specific individual behaviors. In this paper we present a procedure to keep information about specific individuals from being ""leaked"" or shared in either direction between two sources of data without need of a trusted third party. To achieve this goal, we randomly assign individuals to anonymous groups before combining the anonymized information between the two sources of data. We refer to this method as the Yahtzee procedure, and show that it performs as predicted by theoretical analysis when we apply it to data from Facebook and public voter records."
https://openalex.org/W1973512844,"Recent studies reveal that COP1 suppresses the expression of gluconeogenetic genes and prohibits hepatic glucose production. To get more insight into COP1 in hepatic cells, we examined the impact of COP1 on insulin-responsive genes and insulin signaling. We found that COP1 increased the responsiveness of insulin-modulated genes to insulin in that it promoted the expression of insulin-induced genes and inhibited that of insulin-suppressed genes and that COP1 enhanced insulin signaling as it promoted phosphorylation of Akt and ERK as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of IRβ induced by insulin. To delineate the mechanism under which COP1 modulates insulin signaling, we examined the possibility that COP1 modulates the activity of PTP1B, the major insulin receptor tyrosine phosphatase. The results indicated that COP1 physically interacted with PTP1B and suppressed PTP1B phosphatase activity as well as the association of PTP1B with IRβ. We suggest that COP1 is a positive regulator of hepatic insulin signaling. Recent studies reveal that COP1 suppresses the expression of gluconeogenetic genes and prohibits hepatic glucose production.

https://openalex.org/W2010748185,"This study reports on the release of a novel natriuretic peptide, CD-NP, from an in situ polymer precipitation delivery system. Following extensive screening of in-vitro release profiles, an in-vivo evaluation of the efficacy of the delivery system was carried out in Wistar rats. Gel injection was performed subcutaneously on the back of the rats. A secondary messenger, cyclic Guanosine 3′5′ Monophosphate (cGMP), was tested for verification of CD-NP bioactivity, in addition to direct measurements of CD-NP levels in plasma and urine using a radio-immuno assay. Plasma evaluation showed an elevated level of CD-NP over 3 weeks' duration. Unexpectedly, plasma cGMP level followed a decreasing trend over the same duration despite high CD-NP level. Loss of drug bioactivity was ruled out as a high level of CD-NP and cGMP excretion was observed in the treatment group as compared to baseline readings. This unexpected low-plasma cGMP levels and high-urinary cGMP excretion suggest that there might be other compensatory responses to regulation of the CDNP bioactivity as a result of the high drug dosing. The results stress the importance of assessing the overall bioactivity of released drug (in-vivo) concurrently in addition to measuring its concentrations, to determine the correct release profile."
