https://openalex.org/W2055824491,A maize embryo having the nuclear constitution of a reduced gametophyte cell is produced in 3 percent of the embryo sacs of inbred strain Wisconsin-23 that carry the mutant indeterminate gametophyte (ig). The nucleus of most monoploid sporophytes so derived is paternal. Such androgenetic monoploids may originate from a sperm nucleus acting in conjunction with the cytoplasm of a maternal cell from which the nucleus has been functionally displaced.

The effect of the altered investment is a significant bias against males in both mortality and growth."

https://openalex.org/W1966620854,Benzene formed a stable coinplex through its pi electrons to the copper ion in copper(II)montmorillonite. Copper(II)was the only exchangeable metal cation in montmorillonite to form a complex with benzene. Only those clay minerals whose charge arises in the octahedral layer produced the complex.

https://openalex.org/W1964914979,"Accurate modeling and prediction of glacier response requires a better understanding of the influence of physical anisotropies on creep. To investigate the effects of variations in the degree of preferred crystallographic orientation and ice crystal size on creep, 19 samples of anisotropic glacier ice were deformed in simple shear. Results indicate that the time required for ice samples to reach the minimum strain rate decreases as crystal size increases; an increase in crystal-fabric development from an isotropic fabric to one with a strong single maximum results in an enhancement of the minimum strain rate by a factor of 4; and a doubling of the crystal size results in about a ninefold increase in the minimum strain rate."
https://openalex.org/W1998038755,"Radio occultation measurements with Mariners 6 and 7 provided refractivity data in the atmosphiere of Mars at four points above its surface. For an atmosphere consisting predominantly of carbon dioxide, surface pressures between 6 and 7 millibars are obtained at three of the points of measurement, and 3.8 at the fourth, indicating an elevation of 5 to 6 kilometers. The temperature profile measured by Mariner 6 near the equator in the daytime indicates temperatures in the stratosphere about 100 degrees K warmer than those predicted by theory. The measurements of Mariner 6 taken at 79 degrees N at the beginning of polar night indicate that conditions are favorable for the condensation of carbon dioxide at almost all altitudes. Mariner 7 measurements taken at 58 degrees S in daytime and 38 degrees N at night also show that carbon dioxide condensation is possible at altitudes above about 25 kilometers. Measurements of the electron density in the ionosphere show that the upper atmosphere is substantially warmer than it was in 1965, possibly because of increased solar activity and closer proximity to the sun."
https://openalex.org/W1994136302,"Pollution effects in the stratosphere and the ocean are exacerbated by buoyant stability. Turbulence in such media is confined to thin layers. To estimate vertical transport by such turbulence, one can view the situation as nature's way of simulating the finite-difference diffusion equation. This analogy finally yields a diffusivity parameter which is valid for this extremely inhomogeneous case."

Body tissues and tunic fluid show a pH of 1.5 due to the presence of sulfuric acid."
https://openalex.org/W2026119207,"Open fissures, from 100 to several hundred feet apart, that have produced polygonal patterns on the Black Rock Desert, Nevada, are believed to be giant desiccation cracks resulting from a secular trend toward aridity in the last few decades. Similar features on the Smoke Creek Desert probably have the same origin."

https://openalex.org/W2092269259,"Bis(3-fluorosalicylaldehyde) ethylenediimine cobalt(II), a reversible oxygen-carrying compound, has been crystallized as a tetramer with two oxygen molecules bound to the four cobalt atomns, each oxygen molecule bridging between two metal atoms. These dimers are further linked by two bonds between the oxygen atom of the salicylaldehyde and the cobalt atom. The oxygen-to-oxygen distance, 1.21 angstroms in molecular oxygen, has increased to 1.308(28) angstroms (where the number in parentheses is the estimated standard deviation) in this compound, the shortest distance yet observed in sutch a bridging arrangement."
https://openalex.org/W2055888616,"As judged by crystal structure analysis, the crystallochemical formula of tuhualite is (Na,K)2VI (Fe+3)2VI (Fe+2)2IV Si12O30 â‹… H2O, with four such formulas in the unit cell. The structure is characterized by six-repeat double chains of silicon tetrahedrons and chains of edge-sharing, alternating iron tetrahedrons and octahedrons. Chains of each kind are connected by corner sharing to four chains of the other type. The iron cations appear to be anomalously ordered with Fe+2 in tetrahedral and Fe+3 in octahedral sites."

https://openalex.org/W2036937356,Divalent phosphate ion activities can be measured in dilute aqueous solutions in the physiological pH range (7.0 to 7.5) with a liquid ionexchange membrane electrode system; the organic ion exchanger consists of an amine chloride membrane. Reference solutions may be either aqueous chloride or bicarbonate solutions. An essentially Nernstian slope is obtained.
https://openalex.org/W2145840076,"Time fluctuations in the intensity of pulsed radiation from CP 0834, CP 1133, AP 1237, and CP 1919 have been investigated. Power spectra, modulation indices, frequency distributions, and decorrelation frequencies are consistent with scintillation theory. If it is assumed that these scintillations are due to irregularities in the interstellar medium that travel at a velocity of 20 kilometers per second, the irregularities have a scale size on the order of 10(4) kilometers and a distance from the earth of approximately 70 parsecs. These interstellar scintillations would not have been observed if the apparent angular diameters of the pulsars were larger than 0.3 X 10(-5) second of arc, and they would cause even a point radio source to have an apparent angular diameter of approximately 10(-3) second of arc at 318 megahertz."
https://openalex.org/W2046906606,Primary leaves of bean plants treated with nonphytotoxic concentrations of the pathotoxin victorin were rendered highly resistant to two plant viruses. Leaves treated with higher concentrations of victorin became necrotic. These effects on plants that are resistant to victorin and to the fungus that produces it lend support to the hypothesis that activation of a defensive self-repair mechanism may account for resistance to this highly selective pathotoxin.
https://openalex.org/W2014936311,"High concentrations of indole-3-butyric acid, when applied at a concentration of 100 to 200 parts per million (ppm) to presoaked seeds, cause a marked inhibition of hypocotyl length in the seedling growth of Phaseolus mungo var. T-2. Gibberellic acid, when applied at a concentration of 5 ppm, quantitatively reversed this inhibition. It is suggested that the interaction between these two growth substances controls the morphogenetic differentiation in regard to hypocotyl formation in seedling growth."

https://openalex.org/W1963675061,Significant separation of the isotopes of calcium was obtained by thermogravitational thermal diffusion of an aqueous calcium nitrate solution. A flow of solvent was used to partially offset the large solute-solvent separation effect in the experimental column. Further development of this technique may lead to separation of the isotopes of calcium and of other elements on a practical scale.
https://openalex.org/W2093188464,It is shown that the color of the planetary surfaces can be a useful indicator of the geochemical history of the planets and their atmospheres. The magnetic field can promote the oxidation of an atmosphere by keeping the solar wind deflected. The amount of water naturally exuded from the planetary interior is an important parameter in determining whether the surface becomes oxidized or remains in the reduced condition in which presumably all planetary surfaces began.

Subsequently, most rats required over half as many trials to learn the same discrimination when it was placed in another location in the maze. Additional evidence was consistent with the assumption that the relevant cues are, in effect, modified by interaction with the contextual stimuli."
