We developed a large-scale, high-resolution, automated remote-sensing analysis of selective logging in the top five timber-producing states of the Brazilian Amazon. Logged areas ranged from 12,075 to 19,823 square kilometers per year (±14%) between 1999 and 2002, equivalent to 60 to 123% of previously reported deforestation area. Up to 1200 square kilometers per year of logging were observed on conservation lands. Each year, 27 million to 50 million cubic meters of wood were extracted, and a gross flux of ∼0.1 billion metric tons of carbon was destined for release to the atmosphere by logging."

The Transient Receptor Potential ion channel TRPV5 has been implicated in this process. We report here that TRPV5 is stimulated by the mammalian hormone klotho. Klotho, a beta-glucuronidase, hydrolyzes extracellular sugar residues on TRPV5, entrapping the channel in the plasma membrane. This maintains durable calcium channel activity and membrane calcium permeability in kidney. Thus, klotho activates a cell surface channel by hydrolysis of its extracellular N-linked oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2157361590,"Future sea-level rise is an important issue related to the continuing buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, with the potential to raise sea level approximately 70 meters if completely melted, dominate uncertainties in projected sea-level change. Freshwater fluxes from these ice sheets also may affect oceanic circulation, contributing to climate change. Observational and modeling advances have reduced many uncertainties related to ice-sheet behavior, but recently detected, rapid ice-marginal changes contributing to sea-level rise may indicate greater ice-sheet sensitivity to warming than previously considered."

 Paterson and Anderson
 suggest that it may be time to revisit the prevailing dogma and consider ways in which natural products could continue to inspire the development of new drugs. Natural products offer high potency and selectivity as a result of long evolutionary selection. Taking bioactive natural substances as a starting point, researchers can then use the methods of organic synthesis to design targeted modifications of specific structures to create new therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2072159031,"Positive feedback is a ubiquitous signal transduction motif that allows systems to convert graded inputs into decisive, all-or-none outputs. Here we investigate why the positive feedback switches that regulate polarization of budding yeast, calcium signaling, Xenopus oocyte maturation, and various other processes use multiple interlinked loops rather than single positive feedback loops. Mathematical simulations revealed that linking fast and slow positive feedback loops creates a “dual-time” switch that is both rapidly inducible and resistant to noise in the upstream signaling system."
https://openalex.org/W2089795799,"Tropical forest biodiversity is declining, but the resulting effects on key ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and sequestration, remain unknown. We assessed the influence of the loss of tropical tree species on carbon storage by simulating 18 possible extinction scenarios within a well-studied 50-hectare tropical forest plot in Panama, which contains 227 tree species. Among extinction scenarios, aboveground carbon stocks varied by more than 600%, and biological insurance varied by more than 400%. These results indicate that future carbon storage in tropical forests will be influenced strongly by future species composition."
https://openalex.org/W1981776932,"There have been numerous recent observations of changes in the behavior and dynamics of migratory bird populations, but the plasticity of the migratory trait and our inability to track small animals over large distances have hindered investigation of the mechanisms behind migratory change. We used habitat-specific stable isotope signatures to show that recently evolved allopatric wintering populations of European blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla pair assortatively on their sympatric breeding grounds. Birds wintering further north also produce larger clutches and fledge more young. These findings describe an important process in the evolution of migratory divides, new migration routes, and wintering quarters. Temporal segregation of breeding is a way in which subpopulations of vertebrates may become isolated in sympatry."
https://openalex.org/W1996971085,"Abstract Chronic infusion of rotenone (Rot) to Lewis rats reproduces many features of Parkinson disease. Rot (3 mg/kg/day) was infused subcutaneously to male Lewis rats for 6 days using Alzet minipumps. Control rats received the vehicle only. Presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin during the isolation procedure completely removed rotenone bound to the mitochondria. Therefore all functional changes observed were aftereffects of rotenone toxicity in vivo. In Rot rat brain mitochondria (Rot-RBM) there was a 30-40% inhibition of respiration in State 3 and State 3U with Complex I (Co-I) substrates and succinate. Rot did not affect the State 4Δψ of RBM and rat liver mitochondria (RLM). However, Rot-RBM required two times less Ca2+ to initiate permeability transition (mPT). There was a 2-fold increase in or H2O2 generation in Rot-RBM oxidizing glutamate. Rot infusion affected RLM little. Our results show that in RBM, the major site of reactive oxygen species generation with glutamate or succinate is Co-I. We also found that Co-II generates substantial amounts of reactive oxygen species that increased 2-fold in the Rot-RBM. Our data suggest that the primary mechanism of the Rot toxic effect on RBM consists in a significant increase of generation that causes damage to Co-I and Co-II, presumably at the level of 4Fe-4S clusters. Decreased respiratory activity diminishes resistance of RBM to Ca2+ and thus increases probability of mPT and apoptotic cell death. We suggest that the damage to Co-I and Co-II shifts generation from the CoQ10 sites to more proximal sites, such as flavines, and makes it independent of the RBM functional state."

Here, we characterize the fitness landscape of the six amino acids controlling coenzyme use in isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IMDH). Although all natural IMDHs use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as a coenzyme, they can be engineered to use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) instead. Intermediates between these two phenotypic extremes show that each amino acid contributes additively to enzyme function, with epistatic contributions confined to fitness. The genotype-phenotype-fitness map shows that NAD use is a global optimum."

Here we present infrared spectra of disks around brown dwarfs and brown dwarf candidates. We show that all three processes occur in such cool disks in a way similar or identical to that in disks around low- and intermediate-mass stars. These results indicate that the onset of planet formation extends to disks around brown dwarfs, suggesting that planet formation is a robust process occurring in most young circumstellar disks."

An increase of 6.4 ± 0.2 centimeters per year (cm/year) is found in the vast interior areas above 1500 meters, in contrast to previous reports of high-elevation balance. Below 1500 meters, the elevation-change rate is –2.0 ± 0.9 cm/year, in qualitative agreement with reported thinning in the ice-sheet margins. Averaged over the study area, the increase is 5.4 ± 0.2 cm/year, or ∼60 cm over 11 years, or ∼54 cm when corrected for isostatic uplift. Winter elevation changes are shown to be linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation."

These 6.5- and 15.7-kilodalton thermolabile proteins are glycine-rich (45% of the residues), and the short isoform is composed of the tripeptide repeat Gly-X-X. This makes them very different from other antifreeze proteins, including two from insects, suggesting independent adaptation to freezing environments."
https://openalex.org/W1982615581,"Cell-cell interactions and cross-talk between signaling pathways specify Caenorhabditis elegans vulval precursor cells (VPCs) to adopt a spatial pattern: a central “1°” VPC, in which epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity is high and LIN-12/Notch activity is low, flanked by two “2°” VPCs, in which LIN-12/Notch activity is high and EGFR-MAPK activity is low. Here, we identify a microRNA gene, mir-61 , as a direct transcriptional target of LIN-12 and show that expression of mir-61 promotes the 2° fate. We also identify vav-1 , the ortholog of the Vav oncogene, as a target of mir-61 , and show that down-regulation of VAV-1 promotes lin-12 activity in specifying the 2° fate. Our results suggest that lin-12, mir-61 , and vav-1 form a feedback loop that helps maximize lin-12 activity in the presumptive 2° VPCs."

Vigorous cloud centers are seen to rise from the middle to the upper troposphere within 30 minutes and dissipate within the next hour. Their development indicates that Titan's clouds evolve convectively; dissipate through rain; and, over the next several hours, waft downwind to achieve their great longitude extents. These and other characteristics suggest that temperate clouds originate from circulation-induced convergence, in addition to a forcing at the surface associated with Saturn's tides, geology, and/or surface composition."
https://openalex.org/W2065693649,"SK channels are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels that underlie after hyperpolarizing (AHP) currents and contribute to the shaping of the firing patterns and regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in a variety of neurons. The elucidation of SK channel function has recently benefited from the discovery of SK channel enhancers, the prototype of which is 1-EBIO. 1-EBIO exerts profound effects on neuronal excitability but displays a low potency and limited selectivity. This study reports the effects of DCEBIO, an intermediate conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel modulator, and the effects of the recently identified potent SK channel enhancer NS309 on recombinant SK2 channels, neuronal apamin-sensitive AHP currents, and the excitability of CA1 neurons. NS309 and DCEBIO increased the amplitude and duration of the apamin-sensitive afterhyperpolarizing current without affecting the slow afterhyperpolarizing current in contrast to 1-EBIO. The potentiation by DCEBIO and NS309 was reversed by SK channel blockers. In current clamp experiments, NS309 enhanced the medium afterhyperpolarization (but not the slow afterhyperpolarization sAHP) and profoundly affected excitability by facilitating spike frequency adaptation in a frequency-independent manner. The potent and specific effect of NS309 on the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons makes this compound an ideal tool to assess the role of SK channels as possible targets for the treatment of disorders linked to neuronal hyperexcitability."
https://openalex.org/W2164619177,"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) constitute a range of progressive neurological disorders primarily affecting children. Although six of the causative genes have been characterized, the underlying disease pathogenesis for this family of disorders is unknown. Using a metabolomics approach based on high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy of the cortex, cerebellum, and remaining regions of the brain in conjunction with statistical pattern recognition, we report metabolic deficits associated with juvenile NCL in a Cln3 knock-out mouse model. Tissue from Cln3 null mutant mice aged 1–6 months was characterized by an increased glutamate concentration and a decrease in γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) concentration in aqueous extracts from the three regions of the brain. These changes are consistent with the reported altered expression of genes involved in glutamate metabolism in older mice and imply a change in neurotransmitter cycling between glutamate/glutamine and the production of GABA. Further variations in myo-inositol, creatine, and N-acetyl-aspartate were also identified. These metabolic changes were distinct from the normal aging/developmental process. Together, these changes represent the first documented pre-symptomatic symptoms of the Cln3 mouse at 1 month of age and demonstrate the versatility of 1H NMR spectroscopy as a tool for phenotyping mouse models of disease.

Genet. 1992; 42: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The disorders are typified by their progressive nature with symptoms including visual disturbances, psychomotor deterioration, mental impairment, worsening seizures, blindness, and, ultimately, premature death (3Gardiner R.M.

Furthermore, all share the histopathological finding of accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment in lysosomes, similar to the pigment lipofuscin found in normal aging brains (8Sekhon S.S.

NCLs have traditionally been divided into subtypes based upon age of onset and clinical course, although the identification of several of the underlying gene defects has enabled a more definitive genetic classification. The following Cln genes are responsible for each subtype: Cln1, infantile NCL (Santavuori-Haltia); Cln2, late infantile NCL (Jansky-Bielschowsky); Cln3, juvenile NCL (Batten disease); and Cln4, adult NCL (Kufs disease). There are also four variant late infantile forms: Cln5, Finnish variant; Cln6, Costa Rican variant; Cln7, Turkish Variant; and Cln8, Turkish variant and Northern epilepsy (11Mole S.E. Gardiner M. Int. J. Neurol. 1991; 25–26: 52-59PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mole S.E. Brain Pathol. 2004; 14: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Even though characterization of these genes has accelerated research into the disease pathology, the precise events downstream of these mutations and how they result in the similar clinical manifestations of NCLs, albeit on different time scales, remain elusive. The generation of genetically accurate mouse models has made this species the principal platform for investigating the NCLs, offering numerous models encompassing a variety of NCL subtypes (5Mitchison H.M. Lim M.J. Cooper J.D. Brain Pathol. 2004; 14: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Cooper J.D. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2003; 16: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this present study we have applied a metabolomics approach to define biochemical abnormalities associated with a mouse model of juvenile NCL or Batten disease (14Mitchison H.M. Bernard D.J. Greene N.D. Cooper J.D. Junaid M.A. Pullarkat R.K. de Vos N. Breuning M.H. Owens J.W. Mobley W.C. Gardiner R.M. Lake B.D. Taschner P.E. Nussbaum R.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which is caused by mutations in the Cln3 gene. Metabolic profiles derived from 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of biofluids and tissue extracts, in conjunction with multivariate statistics, have previously been demonstrated to be highly discriminatory for a number of neurological diseases, including a variant late infantile NCL (Cln8) (15Griffin J.L. Muller D. Woograsingh R. Jowatt V. Hindmarsh A. Nicholson J.K. Martin J.E. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 11: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we have identified a number of metabolic deficits associated with this mouse model of juvenile NCL. In particular, changes in the concentration of glutamate, glutamine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were detected that are indicative of progressive perturbations between glutamate and glutamine cycling and the conversion of glutamate to GABA and that may explain some of the neurological deficits associated with this disease. Tissues—Wild type and Cln3 knock-out mice on the same 129S6/Sv background were used in this study (14Mitchison H.M. Bernard D.J. Greene N.D. Cooper J.D. Junaid M.A. Pullarkat R.K. de Vos N. Breuning M.H. Owens J.W. Mobley W.C. Gardiner R.M. Lake B.D. Taschner P.E. Nussbaum R.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and the University of Rochester Animal Care and Use Committee Guidelines. All animals were housed under identical conditions. Tissue was taken rapidly (typically within 30 s) from animals killed by cervical dislocation. Specifically, tissue was taken from a stable mouse colony consisting of mice aged 1, 2, 3, and 6 months (n = 5 for all ages). The cortex, cerebellum, and remaining cerebral tissue were snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of Tissue Extracts—Frozen tissue samples (30–100 mg) were pulverized using a Polytron (2× 30-s bursts) (Kinematic) in 6% (w/v) perchloric acid (1 ml) (Aldrich). Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were neutralized to pH 7.0 with KOH (5 m). Following lyophilization, dried extracts were reconstituted in 250 μl of D2O (Goss Scientific Instruments) buffered in 240 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.25 mm sodium (3-trimethylsilyl)-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteriopropionate (TSP) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). Extracts were pipetted into a 96-well plate for NMR spectroscopy. Solution 1H NMR Spectroscopy—Samples were analyzed using a 400 MHz DRX Bruker Avance spectrometer with a triple axis inverse flow probe. Spectra were acquired over 128 scans using a conventional presaturation pulse sequence for solvent suppression based on the start of the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) pulse sequence (relaxation delay = 1.3 s; t1 = 3 μs; mixing time = 150 ms; spectral width = 12 ppm; time domain = 32,000 data points; solvent presaturation was applied during the relaxation delay and mixing time) at 25 °C. All spectra were processed using one-dimensional NMR manager software (Advanced Chemistry Development Inc., Toronto, Canada). Spectra were multiplied by an exponential weighting function and Fourier-transformed from the time to frequency domain. Spectra were phased, baseline-corrected, and referenced to the sodium (3-trimethylsilyl)-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteriopropionate singlet at δ0 ppm. Pattern Recognition—Spectra were integrated between 0.2 and 9.96 ppm over a series of 0.04 ppm integral regions, using an integration macro written within the one-dimensional NMR manager software package. To account for dilution or bulk mass differences between samples, individual integral regions were normalized to the total integral region following exclusion of the water resonance. Individual integrals were thereby standardized to the total integral of all low molecular weight metabolites (16Spraul M. Neidig P. Klauck U. Kessler P. Holmes E. Nicholson J.K. Sweatman B.C. Salman S.R. Farrant R.D. Rahr E. Beddell C.R. Lindon J.C. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1994; 12: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Holmes E. Nicholls A.W. Lindon J.C. Ramos S. Spraul M. Neidig P. Connor S.C. Connelly J. Damment S.J. Haselden J. Nicholson J.K. NMR Biomed. 1998; 11: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Data sets were imported into the SIMCA package (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden) and pre-processed using Pareto scaling by weighting each integral region or variable by (1/Sk)½, where Sk represents the standard deviation of the variable. This increased the representation of lower concentration metabolites in the resultant data models while minimizing the contribution from noise. Data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA), projection to latent structures by partial least squares (PLS), and PLS-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) within the SIMCA package (18Eriksson L. Johansson E. Kettaneh-Wold N. Wold S. Introduction to Multi- and Megavariate Data Analysis using Projection Methods (PCA and PLS). Umetrics, Umea, Sweden1999: 69-111Google Scholar). PCA is a technique that transforms the variables in a data set into a smaller number of new latent variables called principal components (PCs), which are uncorrelated with each other and account for decreasing proportions of the total variance of the original variables. Each new principal component is a linear combination of the original variables such that a compact description of the variation within a data set is generated. Observations are assigned scores according to the variation measured by the principal components with those having similar scores clustering together. For example, t1 is the score of a particular observation associated with principal component 1 (PC1). Where PCA proved inadequate to define a clustering, a supervised approach was used. PLS-DA is a supervised extension of PCA used to distinguish two or more classes, e.g. wild type and diseased, by searching for variables (X matrix) that are correlated to class membership (Y matrix). In this approach the axes are calculated to maximize the separation between groups and can be used to examine separation that would otherwise be across three or more principal components (18Eriksson L. Johansson E. Kettaneh-Wold N. Wold S. Introduction to Multi- and Megavariate Data Analysis using Projection Methods (PCA and PLS). Umetrics, Umea, Sweden1999: 69-111Google Scholar). Another supervised extension of PCA, PLS, is used to maximize the correlation between two data sets, e.g. spectral data (X matrix) and age (Y matrix), so that the response variable Y can be predicted from X (18Eriksson L. Johansson E. Kettaneh-Wold N. Wold S. Introduction to Multi- and Megavariate Data Analysis using Projection Methods (PCA and PLS). Umetrics, Umea, Sweden1999: 69-111Google Scholar). For each model built, the loading scores and the variable influence on projection (VIP) parameters were examined, in conjunction with the original spectra, to identify which metabolites contributed most to clusterings or a trend observed in the data. Loading scores describe the correlation between the original variables and the new component variables, whereas VIP parameters are essentially a measure of the degree to which a particular variable explains the Y variance (class membership or linear trend). Model performance was evaluated using the R2 and Q2 parameters, both of which vary between 0 and 1 (18Eriksson L. Johansson E. Kettaneh-Wold N. Wold S. Introduction to Multi- and Megavariate Data Analysis using Projection Methods (PCA and PLS). Umetrics, Umea, Sweden1999: 69-111Google Scholar). R2 provides an indication of how much of the variation within a data set can be explained by the various components of the model. The cumulative score, Rcum2, records how much variation is represented by the total model. Typically, for a PCA plot the first three components can represent 60–90% of the total variation found within a NMR-based metabolomic data set. Q2 indicates how accurately the data, either classed or non-classed, can be predicted, and this term is more relevant to supervised pattern recognition processes. Q2 scores over 0.08 indicate a model that is better than chance, whereas a score between 0.7–1.0 demonstrates a highly robust trend. This figure is calculated by iteratively leaving out samples from the model and predicting either class membership (e.g. presence or absence of disease) or the trend variable (e.g. age). Increases in Glutamate and Decreases in GABA Characterize Cerebral Tissue from Cln3 Mice Aged 1 Month—Solution state 1H NMR spectral profiles from the cortex, the cerebellum, and the remaining brain tissue of wild type and Cln3 mice were examined for metabolic differences (Fig. 1). NMR profiles from the tissue of mice aged 1 month were readily separated by PLS-DA in all three brain regions (data not shown). Analysis of the loading plots revealed similar metabolite changes to be responsible for the clustering across all regions. In particular, concentrations of glutamate, myo-inositol, and creatine were increased in Cln3 tissue relative to wild type, whereas GABA concentrations were consistently decreased. Furthermore, metabolite perturbations including increases in glutamine, choline, N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), and taurine, were also apparent but did not feature in all brain regions (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONESummary of metabolic deficits detected between wild type and Cln3 cerebral tissueAgeTissueRelative increase in Cln3Relative decrease in Cln3One monthCortexGlutamate, glutamine, myo-inositol, taurine, creatine, NAA, cholineGABA, lactateCerebellumGlutamate, glutamine, myo-inositol, creatine, cholineGABARemaining tissueGlutamate, myo-inositol, creatine, NAA, lactateGABATwo monthsCortexGlutamate, myo-inositol, creatine, NAA, lactateGlutamine, GABA, histidineCerebellumGlutamate, creatine, NAAGlutamine, GABA, choline, taurineRemaining tissueNo separationNo separationThree monthsCortexGlutamate, myo-inositol, creatine, cholineGABA, NAACerebellumAspartateLactate, creatine, NAA, myo-inositol, GABA, glutamineRemaining tissueTaurine, alanineGABA, myo-inositol, choline, lactateSix monthsCortexGlutamate, myo-inositol, choline, GABA, creatineGlutamine, taurine, NAACerebellumGlutamate, glutamine, myo-inositol, aspartateGABA, taurine, NAA, lactateRemaining tissueNo separationNo separation Open table in a new tab To investigate common metabolic changes across the whole brain regardless of metabolic differences between different regions, spectral profiles from all three brain regions were simultaneously analyzed by PLS-DA. This supervised pattern recognition process was necessary in order to minimize the variation associated with the different brain regions while maximizing the variation associated with the mouse model mutant/wild type status in the model. Analysis successfully categorized the profiles, with the corresponding loadings plot indicating that the same discriminatory metabolites identified in individual regions are responsible for clustering (Fig. 2). Temporal Profile of Metabolic Changes Associated with Cln3—To evaluate any temporal changes associated with the Cln3 disease progression, spectral profiles derived from mice aged 2, 3, and 6 months were also analyzed. Wild type and Cln3 spectra were successfully categorized for all age groups, although for 2- and 6-month-old mice separation was only evident in two of the three brain regions (TABLE ONE). The failure to find separation in all regions may result from the number of samples analyzed being too small to identify subtle changes or from the confounding effects of aging/development (see below) masking changes associated with the disease. From the accompanying loading plots, changes in glutamate and GABA agreed for all time points examined with those observed at 1 month of age. Specifically, glutamate was increased in Cln3 tissue, whereas the concentration of GABA was decreased in all age groups, one exception being an increase in GABA in Cln3 cortex tissue from 6-month-old mice. However, at all time points and in all brain regions the ratio of glutamate/GABA was increased in Cln3 mice, even in regions where the pattern recognition analysis did not detect separation. Likewise, increases in myo-inositol and creatine, apparent in 1-month-old Cln3 mice, were also observed in mice aged 2, 3, and 6 months, with two exceptions at 3 months old. However, analysis of the loadings revealed that whereas several of the causative metabolic deficits were consistent with those identified in 1-month-old mice, other deficits followed an opposite trend (TABLE ONE). For example, glutamine concentrations in Cln3 mice were generally decreased in mice after 1 month, such that there was an overall decrease in the glutamine/glutamate ratio. Moreover, NAA was found to be increased in both 1- and 2-month-old Cln3 mice but decreased in Cln3 mice aged 3 and 6 months. No discernible trend in choline and taurine changes was identified. Wild Type and Cln3 Mice “Metabolically Age” at the Same Rate between 1 and 6 Months Such That the Disease Process Is Not a Result of Premature Aging—Having analyzed the metabolic changes in the Cln3 mouse of particular age groups, a subsequent PLS analysis was conducted to consider the temporal metabolic variation associated with development/aging. Considering both wild type and Cln3 observations together produced a highly robust model that correlated 1H NMR spectral profiles with age (Fig. 3A), indicating a metabolic aging process common to both wild type and Cln3 mice. Moreover, when further pattern recognition models using PLS were constructed whereby wild type and Cln3 NMR profiles were analyzed individually (data not shown), similar metabolites varied with age in all models. In particular, glutamate, glutamine, myo-inositol, creatine, and NAA concentrations increased with age, whereas lactate and acetate concentrations decreased with age. Because many neurological diseases are associated with an accelerated aging phenomenon, the relative rates of this apparent aging trend between wild type and Cln3 mice were compared. PLS models computed using either wild type or Cln3 spectral data were used to predict the ages of both strains of mice. If an accelerated aging phenomenon was present, the wild type model would be expected to predict Cln3 mice to be older than they were, whereas the Cln3 model would predict wild type mice to be younger than they were. In both models, there was no difference between the age prediction of wild type and Cln3 mice (Fig. 3, B and C). This result signifies that the metabolic processes that characterize the Cln3 mutant are distinct from those associated with normal aging. In this study, solution 1H NMR has been used to examine metabolic profiles from brain tissue of a Cln3 knock-out mouse model. Profound metabolic changes have been detected across the three brain regions investigated, providing the first evidence of metabolic changes at 1 month of age in the Cln3 mouse model, prior to neuronal cell loss detected from 7 months of age (14Mitchison H.M. Bernard D.J. Greene N.D. Cooper J.D. Junaid M.A. Pullarkat R.K. de Vos N. Breuning M.H. Owens J.W. Mobley W.C. Gardiner R.M. Lake B.D. Taschner P.E. Nussbaum R.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The NMR based metabolomic approach used here to phenotype brain tissue from the Cln3 mouse model was both relatively rapid, requiring ∼7 min in full automation, and robust in terms of the reproducibility of the results. The analysis is also cheap on a per sample basis, making it ideal for screening of large populations. One criticism is that it is difficult to draw conclusions about dynamic processes such as flux rates through metabolic pathways from static observations. This is not limited to metabolomic data, but is also a problem of transcriptional and proteomic analyses where a snapshot is obtained of a cell, tissue, or organism. However, direct measurements of rates such as the glutamate/glutamine cycling rate in the intact brain by 13C NMR spectroscopy are time consuming, costly, and pose considerable technical challenges. Furthermore, metabolic control analysis suggests that the measurement of metabolite concentration changes will often be more sensitive to metabolic perturbations than flux rate measurements. An important factor of this analysis is that the multivariate statistical approach considers all of the metabolic changes simultaneously. Furthermore, Pareto scaling of the data allows both high and low concentration metabolites to make a significant contribution to the pattern recognition models. Despite the absolute variations in the concentrations of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA being very different, the multivariate approach was able to consider relative changes of metabolites with respect to one another. It is these perturbations that drive the separation detected in the models rather than absolute changes in concentration. A simple univariate analysis of metabolite concentrations is often less sensitive to metabolic changes. In the present study, concentrations of glutamate were consistently increased across the three regions examined, whereas GABA concentrations were decreased in the brains of Cln3 mice relative to wild type. In addition, glutamine concentrations were also decreased from 2 months of age in Cln3 mice such that the glutamine to glutamate ratio was reduced. The increase in glutamate concentration relative to both GABA and glutamine is consistent with and extends the temporal scope of a previous investigation, which revealed a similar increase in glutamate concentration at 3 months of age (19Chattopadhyay S. Ito M. Cooper J.D. Brooks A.I. Curran T.M. Powers J.M. Pearce D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such an increase was proposed to result from autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), which have been detected in serum from Cln3 knock-out mice and inhibit the enzyme's conversion of glutamate to GABA. These autoantibodies can traverse the blood-brain barrier and have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of Cln3 mice. 4J. D. Cooper and D. A. Pearce, personal communication. Although the decrease in GABA concentration appears reasonable following GAD65 inhibition, in GAD65 knock-out mice, which are completely devoid of GAD65 activity, no decrease in GABA concentration is observed, strongly suggesting some kind of compensatory mechanism, most likely by the second GAD isoform, GAD67 (20Kash S.F. Johnson R.S. Tecott L.H. Noebels J.L. Mayfield R.D. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Another explanation for the decrease in GABA is the well documented loss of GABAergic interneurons, which are particularly vulnerable in Batten disease. However, the first signs of neuronal cell loss do not occur until 7 months of age (14Mitchison H.M. Bernard D.J. Greene N.D. Cooper J.D. Junaid M.A. Pullarkat R.K. de Vos N. Breuning M.H. Owens J.W. Mobley W.C. Gardiner R.M. Lake B.D. Taschner P.E. Nussbaum R.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, the decrease in GABA concentration observed here results either from an inhibition of GAD65 without compensation by GAD67 and/or from the early stages of metabolic impairment within GABAergic neuronal cell loss. Furthermore, the decrease in the ratio of glutamine to glutamate in Cln3 mice after 2 months indicates that there are no compensatory mechanisms for the increase in the excitatory glutamate produced as a result of the decrease in GABA production. Taken together, these findings are suggestive of a profound perturbation in neurotransmitter recycling/production in terms of the changes in the concentrations of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. The metabolism of glutamate, glutamine and GABA are linked via two pathways between neurons and glial cells (21Schousboe A. Westergaard N. Sonnewald U. Petersen S.B. Huang R. Peng L. Hertz L. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 15: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). In general, the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA are cleared from the synaptic cleft largely by uptake into surrounding glial cells. Within glial cells, glutamate is converted to glutamine by the glia-specific enzyme, glutamine synthetase (22Martinez-Hernandez A. Bell K.P. Norenberg M.D. Science. 1977; 195: 1356-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Glutamine is then released from glial cells to be transported into nerve cell terminals, where it is converted back to glutamate by glutaminase to replenish neurotransmitter pools. Our results indicate an imbalance in the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA, respectively, in addition to a perturbation in the glutamate to glutamine ratio, which is strongly suggestive of a deficiency in neurotransmitter cycling. Consistent with this, the expression of glutamate dehydrogenase, glutaminase, and glutamine synthetase, key enzymes in the glutamate-glutamine cycle, have been reported to be markedly altered in the Cln3 mouse (19Chattopadhyay S. Ito M. Cooper J.D. Brooks A.I. Curran T.M. Powers J.M. Pearce D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Brooks A.I. Chattopadhyay S. Mitchison H.M. Nussbaum R.L.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, impaired cycling has been observed/suggested in several neurological disorders including epilepsy and Huntington disease (25Behrens P.F. Franz P. Woodman B. Lindenberg K.S. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Brain. 2002; 125: 1908-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 26Burbaeva G. Boksha I.S. Turishcheva M.S. Vorobyeva E.A. Savushkina O.K. Tereshkina E.B. Prog.

Epilepsia. 2002; 43: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, dysfunction of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in the brain may have a significant impact on the underlying NCL pathophysiology in the Cln3 mouse. myo-Inositol and creatine, both of which were increased in Cln3 tissue relative to controls, also provided a unique insight into the disease process. myo-Inositol is a glial cell marker that has previously been implicated in the osmoregulation of astrocytes (28Brand A. Richter-Landsberg C. Leibfritz D. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 15: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 29Isaacks R.E. Bender A.S. Kim C.Y. Prieto N.M. Norenberg M.D. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The activation of microglia and astrocytes (gliosis) is a well known pathological response readily observed in neurodegenerative diseases (30O'Callaghan J.P. Psychopharmacol. Bull. 1994; 30: 549-554PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kreutzberg G.W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar, 32Streit W.J. Walter S.A. Pennell N.A. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 57: 563-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). During gliosis, astrocytes undergo hypertrophy of astrocytic processes. In contrast, microglia undergo a graded response that proceeds via a distinct series of steps that vary in their morphological and molecular profile. These steps include the transformation from resting ramified cells to phagocytotic brain macrophages and are tightly coupled to the underlying disease pathology (33Raivich G. Bohatschek M. Kloss C.U. Werner A. Jones L.L. Kreutzberg G.W. Brain Res. Brain. Res. Rev. 1999; 30: 77-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Although severe astrocytic hypertrophy and microglial transformation have not been detected in older Cln3 knock-out mice, a low level glial activation has previously been reported at 5 months of age (34Pontikis C.C. Cella C.V. Parihar N. Lim M.J. Chakrabarti S. Mitchison H.M. Mobley W.C. Rezaie P. Pearce D.A. Cooper J.D. Brain Res. 2004; 1023: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase in myo-inositol detected in the present study from 1 month of age most likely reflects an early stage glial activation or at least up-regulation of metabolic processes within glial cells. Creatine, on the other hand, is thought to have a multifaceted role in the brain. Apart from being involved in energy homeostasis, it has recently been implicated in brain osmoregulation (35Bothwell J.H. Rae C. Dixon R.M. Styles P. Bhakoo K.K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1632-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Ross B. Bluml S. Anat. Rec. 2001; 265: 54-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). An increase may therefore reflect increased metabolic activity coupled to a higher level of excitatory neurotransmission in Cln3 tissue, of which similar increases have been detected in frontal lobe epilepsy (37Lundbom N. Gaily E. Vuori K. Paetau R. Liukkonen E. Rajapakse J.C. Valanne L. Hakkinen A.M. Granstrom M.L. Epilepsia. 2001; 42: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or, indeed, gliosis accompanied by a high metabolic activity of the glial cells (38Urenjak J. Williams S.R. Gadian D.G. Noble M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 981-989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bluml S. Zuckerman E. Tan J. Ross B.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1564-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an increase in creatine may be suggestive of a redistribution of cerebral osmolytes (39Bluml S. Zuckerman E. Tan J. Ross B.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1564-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Indeed, during neuronal cell death the decrease in ATP production impedes the normal transmembrane homeostasis of Na+ and K+ ions such that there are large changes in the osmotic state. Moreover, cationic imbalances have been documented in a yeast model of Batten disease whereby a defect in the transport of the basic amino acids lysine and arginine into the vacuole has been identified (40Kim Y. Ramirez-Montealegre D. Pearce D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15458-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Such a transport defect at the lysosomal membrane in neuronal cells may also warrant compensatory changes in osmolyte distribution (41Kim Y. Chattopadhyay S. Locke S. Pearce D.A. Eukaryotic Cell. 2005; 4: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Perturbations in NAA concentration also discriminated between wild type and Cln3 cerebral tissue, showing an increase in 1-month-old mice and decreasing in 2-, 3-, and 6-month-old mice. NAA is synthesized in the mitochondria and has been implicated in lipid synthesis (42Burri R. Steffen C. Herschkowitz N. Dev. Neurosci. 1991; 13: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and acetyl-CoA buffering (43Patel T.B. Clark J.B. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The increase at 1 month may therefore reflect an up-regulation of lipid synthesis resulting from metabolic changes associated with lipid storage and degradation, known to accompany the NCLs. Alternatively, we have shown previously the degradation of NAA to be slower in a mouse model of Cln8 (15Griffin J.L. Muller D. Woograsingh R. Jowatt V. Hindmarsh A. Nicholson J.K. Martin J.E. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 11: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, NAA is commonly thought of as a biomarker for neuronal density (44Bhakoo K.K. Pearce D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and, as such, decreases have previously been linked to neuronal cell loss in numerous experimental and clinical conditions (45Dunlop D.S. Mc Hale D.M. Lajtha A. Brain Res. 1992; 580: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 46Meyerhoff D.J. MacKay S. Bachman L. Poole N. Dillon W.P. Weiner M.W. Fein G. Neurology. 1993; 43: 509-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Klunk W.E. Panchalingam K. Moossy J. McClure R.J. Pettegrew J.W. Neurology. 1992; 42: 1578-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent research has also suggested a role in cellular osmoregulation (35Bothwell J.H. Rae C. Dixon R.M. Styles P. Bhakoo K.K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1632-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In mice aged 2, 3, and 6 months, when glial cell activation is more advanced it is likely that the early stages of neuronal cell loss and neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction will be detected. Because many of the metabolic changes detected between wild type and Cln3 mice also featured in terms of the metabolic changes detected as part of a common aging trend between the two mice, it was tempting to speculate an accelerated aging phenomenon; for example, oxidative stress may constitute part of the disease pathogenesis. Indeed, this has been shown to be the case in certain neurological diseases including Alzheimer and Huntington disease, as well as in animal models of accelerated aging (48Butterfield D.A. Howard B.J. LaFontaine M.A. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The effect has also recently been suggested in Cln5-deficient mice (49Kopra O. Vesa J. von Schantz C. Manninen T. Minye H. Fabritius A.L. Rapola J. van Diggelen O.P. Saarela J. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2893-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the decrease in GABA concentrations did not feature in the aging trend, and there was no significant difference found between wild type and Cln3 age predictions during PLS analyses. Thus, we believe the disease process in young Cln3 knock-out mice is distinct from normal aging. To verify conclusively that accelerated aging plays no part in the disease warrants a similar analysis conducted using older mice. Using a combined approach of 1H NMR-based metabolomics and multivariate statistics, we have identified a profound perturbation in glutamate, glutamine, and GABA concentrations in brain tissue in a mouse model of Batten disease from 1 month of age. In addition, metabolite changes were identified that were consistent with the early stages of glial cell activation. Whether these changes really reflect glial activation, however, or some other metabolic shift will still need to be determined to properly define the order of events during the disease pathogenesis. Nonetheless, these results represent the earliest pathological hallmark in the Cln3 mouse model, suggesting that the pathological trigger of the disease is occurring very early in development in these mice. That such a 1H NMR based metabolic profiling approach has detected these deficits suggests it will be a useful technique in comparing and contrasting all the mouse models of the NCL disorders in order to better define the pathology of this class of diseases."

The biosynthesis of sphingosine 1-phosphate is catalyzed by sphingosine kinase (SK) but the mechanism by which the subcellular localization and activity of SK is regulated in response to various stimuli is not fully understood. To elucidate the origin and structural determinant of the specific subcellular localization of SK, we performed biophysical and cell studies of human SK1 (hSK1) and selected mutants. In vitro measurements showed that hSK1 selectively bound phosphatidylserine over other anionic phospholipids and strongly preferred the plasma membrane-mimicking membrane to other cellular membrane mimetics. Mutational analysis indicates that conserved Thr54 and Asn89 in the putative membrane-binding surface are essential for lipid selectivity and membrane targeting both in vitro and in the cell. Also, phosphorylation of Ser225 enhances the membrane affinity and plasma membrane selectivity of hSK1, presumably by modulating the interaction of Thr54 and Asn89 with the membrane.

Silica thin layer chromatography G-60 plate was from Merck.Protein Expression and Purification—All SK1 proteins were expressed in baculovirus-infected Tn5 cells as soluble proteins with a C-terminal His6 tag and purified from the cell extracts using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All proteins were >90% pure electrophoretically. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce).Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—The kinetic SPR measurements were performed at 23 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl using a lipid-coated L1 chip in the BIACORE X system as described previously (21Stahelin R.V.

Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Five to ten μl of phospholipid solution in ethanol/hexane (1:9 (v/v)) was spread onto 10 ml of subphase (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl, and either 0.1 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm CaCl2) to form a monolayer with a given initial surface pressure (πo). Once the surface pressure reading of monolayer had been stabilized (after about 5 min), the protein solution (typically 40 μl) was injected into the subphase through a small hole drilled at an angle through the wall of the trough and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was measured as a function of time. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 20 min. The maximal Δπ value at a given π depended on the protein concentration and reached a saturation value (i.e. [hSK1] ≥ 1.0 μg/ml). Protein concentrations in the subphase were therefore maintained above such values to ensure that the observed Δπ represented a maximal value. The critical surface pressure (πc) was determined by extrapolating the Δπ versus π0 plot to the x-axis (24Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).SK1 Activity Assay—In vitro hSK1 activity was measured in the absence or presence of lipid vesicles according to the procedure by Olivera and Spiegel (25Olivera A. Spiegel S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 105: 233-242PubMed Google Scholar). For the assays without lipid vesicles, the recombinant hSK1 was added to 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.16 m KCl, 5 μm d-erythro-SPH-bovine serum albumin adduct (99.7:0.3 in mole ratio), 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences; 1 μCi), and 500 μm MgCl2. After the reaction mixture was incubated at 23 °C for 30 min, lipids were extracted with 2.5 volumes of chloroform/butanol/HCl (50:50:1, v/v/v), and the organic layer was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. SPH and S1P were separated by thin layer chromatography using butanol/methanol/acetic acid/water (80:20:10:20, v/v/v/v) as eluent. Bands corresponding to S1P were scraped and the radioactivity measured using a scintillation counter. Activity assays in the presence of lipid vesicles were performed in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.16 m KCl, 5 μm d-erythro-SPH incorporated into phospholipid vesicles of various compositions (5 μm total concentration), 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences; 1 μCi), and 500 μm MgCl2. For cellular SK1 activity assays, transfected HEK293 cells were treated with 2 μm PMA for the indicated times, and 10 min before the end of the time point, cells were pulsed with 300 nm d-[erythro-3H]SPH (American Radiolabeled Co.; 1.0 μCi). The secreted S1P was extracted and counted as described above.Cell Culture, Transfection and Confocal Microscopy—Wild type hSK1 and its mutants were subcloned in-frame with a C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into the pIND vector. Stable HEK293 cells expressing ecdysone receptor (Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 98% humidity. The cell transfection and the protein expression were performed as described elsewhere (22Stahelin R.V. Rafter J.D. Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12452-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Confocal imaging was performed using a four channel Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope. EGFP was excited using the 488-nm line of an argon/krypton laser. A 505-nm line pass filter and a ×63, 1.2 numerical aperture water immersion objective were used for all experiments. Immediately before imaging, induction media was removed and the cells were washed twice with 1 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 6 mm sucrose. The cells were then overlaid with the same buffer and imaged. Translocation experiments were monitored by scanning every 30 s following treatment of the cells with 2 μm PMA. The time lapse changes in EGFP intensity ratio at the plasma membrane (= plasma membrane/[plasma membrane + cytoplasm]) were determined as described previously (22Stahelin R.V. Rafter J.D. Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12452-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Determination of Ser225 Phosphorylation by Mass Spectrometry—The hSK1 bands were excised from the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. The excised bands were washed three times with acetonitrile/H2O (1:1, v/v) for 10 min and dehydrated with acetonitrile. Then, the bands were finally washed with 1:1 (v/v) solution of acetonitrile and 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and dried under vacuum. Proteins contained in gel pieces were reduced by using 10 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C for 45 min and then alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature for 30 min. The alkylated sample was washed as described above, dried, and soaked in sequencing-grade trypsin (500 ng) on ice for 45 min. Then, the gel pieces were immersed in 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C for 14-18 h. Resulting peptides were extracted sequentially for 20 min with 45% acetonitrile in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 45% acetonitrile in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and 75% acetonitrile in 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid with agitation. Pooled peptide extracts were evaporated under vacuum. Digested peptides were dissolved in Solvent A (5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in H2O) and loaded onto fused silica capillary columns containing 8 cm of 5-μm particle size Aqua C18 reverse-phase column material. The column was placed in-line with an Agilent HP 1100 quaternary LC pump and a splitter system was used to achieve a flow rate of 250 nl/min, with a 90-min gradient of Solvent A and Solvent B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in H2O). Eluted peptides were directly electrosprayed into an LCQ Deca XP Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, Palo Alto, CA) by applying 2.3 kV of DC voltage. A data-dependent scan consisting of one full mass scan (400-1400 m/z) and three data-dependent tandem mass scans were used to generate tandem mass spectra of eluted peptides. Normalized collision energy of 35% was used throughout the data acquisition. Tandem mass spectra were searched against an in-house protein data base using TurboSequest and phosphorylation modification (+80 on Ser, Thr, and Tyr) was considered in the differential modification search. Bioworks version 3.1 was used to filter the search results and the following Xcorr values were applied to different charge states of peptides: 1.8 for singly charged peptides, 2.2 for doubly charged peptides, and 3.2 for triply charged peptides. Tandem mass spectra for phosphorylated peptides were generated using Xcalibur version 3.1 and manual assignment of fragment ions was performed to confirm the search results.RESULTSLipid Selectivity of hSK1—Conflicting results have been reported on the lipid selectivity of SK. An earlier report showed that phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most effective activator of SK (26Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biochem. 1996; 60: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas a recent report suggested that SK1 has the high affinity for phosphatidic acid (PA) (27Delon C. Manifava M. Wood E. Thompson D. Krugmann S. Pyne S. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44763-44774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To resolve this controversy and determine the exact role of these lipids in membrane targeting of SK1, we first measured the in vitro membrane binding parameters of recombinant hSK1 using vesicles with various compositions by means of the SPR analysis. The SPR analysis of membrane-protein interactions offers an advantage over other methods in that membrane association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants can be directly determined (21Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 29Schuck P. Annu.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that nonspecific electrostatic interactions driven by ionic residues mainly effect ka, whereas short-range specific interactions and hydrophobic interactions, which result from the membrane penetration of hydrophobic residues, largely influence kd (21Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 31Cho W. Stahelin R.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows representative sensorgrams for hSK1-vesicle binding from which ka, kd, and Kd were determined.hSK1 did not bind to Zwitterionic POPC or POPE vesicles with protein concentrations up to 5 μm, but showed higher affinity for vesicles containing anionic phospholipids. Because the inner plasma membrane of mammalian cells contains about 30 mol % of total anionic lipids, we first determined Kd values for mixed vesicles containing 30 mol % of various anionic lipids (i.e. POPC/POPX (70:30)). The comparison of Kd values (TABLE ONE) shows that hSK1 has definite selectivity for PS over other anionic phospholipids. Although hSK1 bound to PA slightly better than phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol, it still showed 5-fold higher affinity for PS than for PA. When lower concentrations of anionic lipids were employed (e.g. POPC/POPX = 80:20 or 85:15), essentially the same PS selectivity was observed (data not shown). Also, the PS selectivity remained unchanged when pH of the binding solution was varied from 7.4 to 8.1 (i.e. [Kd for POPC/POPA (7:3)]/[Kd for POPC/POPS (7:3)] = 4.7 at pH 8.1), precluding the possibility that selectivity of hSK1 for PS over PA affinity reflects incomplete ionization of PA under our experimental conditions. Higher pH could not be used because of a loss of hSK1 activity at pH > 8.3. Furthermore, the addition (up to 3 mol %) of SPH, PMA, diacylglycerol, or any phosphoinositides to POPC/POPS (70:30) vesicles had little effect on the affinity of hSK1 (data not shown). Higher affinity (i.e. Kd) of hSK1 for PS derives mainly from smaller kd, which suggests that the PS head group specifically interacts with hSK1 and may also induce membrane penetration of hSK1 to slow the membrane dissociation.It has been shown for many membrane-targeting domains and their host proteins that binding of their cognate lipid ligand leads to membrane penetration of the protein (31Cho W.

To see if PS specifically induces the membrane penetration of hSK1, we measured the penetration of hSK1 into various lipid monolayers at the air-water interface. The phospholipid monolayer was spread at a constant area and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was monitored after injection of protein into the subphase. In general, Δπ is inversely proportional to π0 of the lipid monolayer and an extrapolation of the Δπ versus π0 plot yields the critical surface pressure (πc), which specifies the upper limit of π0 of a monolayer that a protein can penetrate into (24Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Verger R. Pattus F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1982; 30: 189-227Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because the surface pressure of cell membranes has been estimated to be in the range of 30-35 dyne/cm (36Blume A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 557: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 37Demel R.A. Geurts van Kessel W.S.M Zwaal R.F.A Roelofsen B. van Deenen L.L.M Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1996; 1286: 183-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), the πc value for a protein that penetrates cell membranes should be above 30 dyne/cm. As shown in Fig. 2A, hSK1 showed weak penetration into the POPC, POPC/POPG (7:3), POPC/POPI (7:3), or POPC/POPA (7:3) monolayer with πc <26 dyne/cm. However, hSK1 had stronger penetration activity toward the POPC/POPS (7:3) monolayer with πc ≥ 30 dyne/cm. This suggests that PS specifically induces the membrane penetration of hSK1 and thus allows its favorable hydrophobic interaction with cell membranes. It should be noted that large unilamellar vesicles used in our SPR measurements are known to have the surface pressure above 30 dyne/cm (36Blume A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 557: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 37Demel R.A. Geurts van Kessel W.S.M Zwaal R.F.A Roelofsen B. van Deenen L.L.M Biochim. Biophys.

This explains why hSK1 shows no affinity for zwitterionic POPC or POPE vesicles and weaker affinities for non-PS-containing anionic vesicles through nonspecific electrostatic interactions in the SPR measurements.FIGURE 2Monolayer penetration of hSK1 into phospholipid monolayers.

The predominant form of PP2A in cells is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme consisting of a scaffolding (A) subunit, a regulatory (B) subunit, and a catalytic (C) subunit. Although PP2A is known to regulate Raf1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling at multiple steps in this pathway, the specific PP2A holoenzymes involved remain unclear. To address this question, we established tetracycline-inducible human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines for overexpression of FLAG-tagged Bα/δ regulatory subunits by ∼3-fold or knock-down of Bα by greater than 70% compared with endogenous levels. The expression of functional epitope-tagged B subunits was confirmed by the detection of A and C subunits as well as phosphatase activity in FLAG immune complexes from extracts of cells overexpressing the FLAG-Bα/δ subunit. Western analysis of the cell extracts using phosphospecific antibodies for MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 demonstrated that activation of these kinases in response to epidermal growth factor was markedly diminished in Bα knock-down cells but elevated in Bα- and Bδ-overexpressing cells as compared with control cells. In parallel with the activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, the inhibitory phosphorylation site of Raf1 (Ser-259) was dephosphorylated in cells overexpressing Bα or Bδ. Pharmacological inhibitor studies as well as reporter assays for ERK-dependent activation of the transcription factor Elk1 revealed that the PP2A holoenzymes ABαC and ABδC act downstream of Ras and upstream of MEK1 to promote activation of this MAPK signaling cascade. Furthermore both PP2A holoenzymes were found to associate with Raf1 and catalyze dephosphorylation of inhibitory phospho-Ser-259.

Heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzymes are composed of a scaffolding/structural subunit (A), a variable regulatory subunit (B), and a catalytic subunit (C).

Although the regulatory subunit families share little amino acid sequence homology, isoforms within each family exhibit significant sequence homology. The variable subunit plays a critical role in the control of PP2A by regulating substrate selectivity and/or directing the localization of the enzyme within the cell (11Kamibayashi C. Estes R.

The identification of multiple signaling modules containing both kinases and phosphatases suggests that the control of the respective signal transduction pathway is mediated via the interplay of these opposing enzymes. Because dephosphorylation of the associated protein kinase by PP2A has been linked to both positive and negative regulatory effects on kinase activation (24Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T.

The MAPKs represent a large family of protein kinases that regulate diverse intracellular signal transduction cascades controlling cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (34Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Thus far, four well characterized families of mammalian MAPKs have been identified: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2), c-Jun NH2-terminal/stress-activated protein kinases, p38 MAPKs, and ERK5 (for a review, see Ref. 34Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation studies have revealed that PP2A associates with ERK2 and the MAPK kinase MEK1 (31Liu Q. Hofman P. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H2204-H2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) as well as with the kinase suppressor of Ras (33Ory S. Zhou M. Conrads T. Veenstra T. Morrison D. Curr.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1356-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The positive regulation of these kinases by PP2A is thought to be mediated via dephosphorylation of phosphorylated serine or threonine residues that inhibit kinase activity. Cell type- or species-specific regulatory effects on MAPK signaling have also been documented for PP2A regulatory subunits. For example, knock-down of the single Drosophila B family subunit results in ERK1/2 activation (16Silverstein A.M. Barrow C.A. Davis A.J. Mumby M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4221-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of a member of the B family of regulatory subunits, Bγ, in a mammalian neuronal cell line leads to ERK1/2 activation (41Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41525-41532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore the Caenorhabditis elegans Bα homolog SUR-6 has been identified as a positive regulator of Raf1 and MPK-1 (the C. elegans ERK ortholog) (42Kao G. Tuck S. Baillie D. Sundaram M.V. Development. 2004; 131: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the PP2A catalytic subunit has been identified in multiple protein kinase macromolecular complexes, the regulatory subunits in these complexes remain largely unknown. Additional studies are needed to determine the oligomeric composition of these complexes as well as the precise function of individual regulatory subunits. To elucidate the role of specific PP2A holoenzymes in MAPK signaling, we altered the cellular levels of Bα or Bδ regulatory subunits in target cells by overexpression and RNAi approaches. Western analyses of the stable cell lines using phosphospecific antibodies revealed opposing effects on the phosphorylation state of ERK1/2 that were dependent upon overexpression or repression of the targeted B subunit protein. Our findings indicate that PP2A Bα-orBδ-containing holoenzymes control ERK1/2 activation via their interaction with and dephosphorylation of the upstream kinase Raf1, leading to sequential phosphorylation/activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Reagents—Anti-FLAG M2-agarose, FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK), and anti-FLAG rabbit and mouse antibodies were obtained from Sigma. IRDye™800- and AlexaFluor® 680-conjugated fluorescent secondary antibodies were obtained from Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA) and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Commercial sources of other antibodies utilized in these studies were as follows: anti-phospho-Raf1(Ser-259), anti-phospho-MEK1/2(Ser-217 + Ser-221), and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202 + Tyr-204/Thr-185 + Tyr-187) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA), anti-Raf1 (sc-133 and sc-7267) and anti-ERK1 (sc-93-G) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody was from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA), and anti-PP2A catalytic subunit antibody was from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. The generation and characterization of affinity-purified Bα/Bδ- and Bδ-specific antibodies were as reported previously (13Strack S. Chang D. Zaucha J.A. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem, and microcystin-LR was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). FLAG-tagged B Subunit Constructs—The FLAG epitope was added to the carboxyl terminus of Bα and Bδ using a two-step PCR protocol. In the first reaction, PCR amplification of a 300-bp fragment was accomplished using the sense primer 5′-GTC ATG ACT GGA TCC TAC AAT-3′ (which overlaps the BamHI site ∼300 bp from the stop codon), the antisense primer 5′-GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC ATT AAT TTT GTC CTG-3′, and rat Bα/pcDNA5/TO as a template. The resulting PCR product served as a template for the second reaction using the same sense primer and the antisense primer 5′-GGC GGC CGC CTA CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT-3′. Underlined nucleotides indicate BamHI and NotI restriction endonuclease sites in the sense and antisense primers, respectively. The second PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI), and the 300-bp Bα-FLAG fragment was excised with BamHI and NotI and ligated into Bα/pcDNA5/TO digested with BamHI and NotI. A similar strategy was utilized to epitope tag the Bδ subunit. Using rat Bδ/pcDNA5/TO as template, the first PCR was performed with the sense primer 5′-ACT GCC GCG GAG TTC CAC CCA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC ATT AAT TTT GTC CTG-3′; primers for the subsequent PCR were the same sense primer and the antisense primer 5′-GGC GGC CGC TTA CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT-3′. Underlined nucleotides indicate SacII and NotI restriction endonuclease sites in the sense and antisense primers, respectively. The second PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T, and the Bδ-FLAG fragment was excised with SacII and NotI and ligated into Bδ/pcDNA5/TO digested with the same enzymes. Generation of the FLAG-tagged B′β construct was as described previously (43Van Kanegan M. Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36029-36036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Proper construction of the plasmids encoding the FLAG-tagged B subunits was verified by automated DNA sequencing (Vanderbilt University DNA Core Facility). Bα RNAi Plasmid—For tetracycline-inducible RNAi, we used the pcDNA3.1/H1-TO plasmid described previously (18Strack S. Cribbs J Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) in which two tetracycline operator (TO) sites flank the TATA box of the H1 promoter. The short hairpin RNA-encoding sequence targeting Bα was synthesized as two complementary primers (forward, GAT CCC CGT GGC AAG CGA AAG AAA GAT TCA AGA GAT CTT TCT TTC GCT TGC CAC TTT TTG GAA A; reverse, AGC TTT TCC AAA AAG TGG CAA GCG AAA GAA AGA TCT CTT GAA TCT TTC TTT CGC TTG CCA CGG G; Bα complementary sequence underlined), phosphorylated, and ligated into pcDNA3.1/H1-TO digested with BglII and HindIII. Inducible Cell Lines for B Subunit Overexpression or Knock-down—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) T-Rex cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml blasticidin. Monoclonal cell lines stably expressing tetracycline-inducible expression plasmids encoding Bα-FLAG, Bδ-FLAG, or FLAG-B′β were generated by transfecting (FuGENE 6, Roche Applied Science) HEK T-Rex cells with Bα-FLAG/pcDNA5/TO, Bδ-FLAG/pcDNA5/TO, or FLAG-B′β/pcDNA5/TO followed by selection of individual clones in medium containing 175 μg/ml hygromycin B. Monoclonal cell lines for tetracycline-inducible repression of Bα were generated by transfecting HEK T-Rex cells with the Bα RNAi vector followed by selection in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. Control cell lines stably expressing pcDNA5/TO or pcDNA3.1/H1-TP were selected in medium containing 175 mg/ml hygromycin or 1 mg/ml G418, respectively. Expression of Bα-FLAG and Bδ-FLAG and suppression of endogenous Bα was accomplished by treating the respective cells with 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 48 h at 37 °C. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was obtained from tetracycline-treated HEK T-Rex cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentrations were determined by spectrometric analysis and adjusted to equal concentrations with Milli-Q H2O prior to cDNA synthesis. Synthesis of cDNA was accomplished using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and ∼1 μg of total RNA. The resulting cDNA products were subjected to PCR amplification using primers specific for Bα, Bδ, and GAPDH. PCR primers for the reactions were as follows: Bα forward, 5′-GGA GGG AAT GAT ATT-3′; Bα reverse, 5′-TAG TGT AGT AAC TGT AGT-3′; Bδ forward, 5′-GCG GGC GGC AAC GAC TTC-3′, Bδ reverse, 5′-TAG CGC CGT GAT CCT AAA-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-GGT CAT CAT CTC TGC CCC-3′; and GAPDH reverse, 5′-CAC CAC CCT GTT GCT GTA G-3′. PCR amplification (30 cycles) was performed in a 50-μl reaction containing 2.5 units of Amplitaq, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 0.5 μm primers; each cycle consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C (Bα/Bδ) or 55 °C (GAPDH) for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Purification of ABαC, ABδC, and AB′βC Holoenzymes—Stable HEK T-Rex cell lines harboring Bα-FLAG/pcDNA5/TO, Bδ-FLAG/pcDNA5/TO, or FLAG-B′β/pcDNA5/TO were treated with 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 48 h to induce protein expression. Stable HEK T-Rex cell lines harboring the empty vector (pcDNA5/TO; EV) were used as controls. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 17 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Following centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g, the clarified lysates (1 mg of protein) were incubated with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-FLAG-agarose for 4 h. Bound proteins were washed twice with PAN buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 17 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 0.5% Igepal CA-630, once with PAN buffer, and once in phosphatase assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Bound proteins were eluted by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C in phosphatase assay buffer (150 μl) containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The amount of PP2A catalytic subunit in the purified PP2A holoenzymes was determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining using serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin as standards. These values were used to calculate the protein concentration of purified PP2A holoenzymes based upon stoichiometric levels of the A, B, and C subunits in each preparation (see Fig. 1A). Aliquots of the purified holoenzymes were either assayed for phosphatase activity or subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver stain or immunoblot analysis. Preparation of Phosphorylated Substrates and Phosphatase Assays— Radiolabeled substrates (e.g. phosphorylase a and cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphorylated histone H1) were prepared as described previously (14Strack S. Westphal R.S. Colbran R.J. Ebner F.F. Wadzinski B.E. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 49: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 44Jakes S. Schlender K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Purified FLAG-Bα/δ PP2A holoenzymes (9 ng) were assayed for phosphatase activity in a 50-μl reaction containing phosphatase assay buffer and 32P-labeled substrate. Following a 15-min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (20% final concentration). The samples were incubated on ice for at least 30 min, and proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and quantified for 32Pi release by liquid scintillation counting. Less than 20% of total phosphorylated substrate was dephosphorylated during the assays, thus assuring that substrate was not limiting. In some experiments, purified PP2A holoenzymes were pretreated for 15 min with 2 nm okadaic acid, a concentration of inhibitor that selectively inhibits PP2A (45Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), prior to assay of phosphatase activity. Kinetworks™ Phosphoprotein Analysis—Detergent-solubilized extracts (∼350 μg of protein) from stably transfected HEK T-Rex cells were subjected to Kinetworks Phospho-Site Screening (KPSS) 1.3 and 4.1 as described on the Kinexus Bioinformatics Corp. website (www.kinexus.ca) and in Ref. 46Pelech S. Sutter C. Zhang H. Terrian D. Methods in Molecular Medicine Series. 218. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 99-111Google Scholar. These screens use panels of 31–34 highly validated commercial phosphosite-specific antibodies and 20-lane multichannel blotters. The intensity of the ECL signals for the target protein bands on the Kinetworks immunoblots were quantified with a FluorS Max Imager and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analysis—HEK T-Rex cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of tetracycline and for an additional 16 h in serum-free medium containing tetracycline. As indicated, some cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 10 min or 10% fetal bovine serum for 15 min prior to cell lysis. Cells (from one confluent 10-cm dish) were quickly washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm benzamidine, 5 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 0.5% Igepal CA-630). Clarified cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Cellular extracts (∼15 μg of protein) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies and corresponding secondary antibodies. Visualization and quantification of the immunolabeled proteins was accomplished using the Odyssey™ infrared imaging system (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) and Odyssey software, which measures integrated pixel intensity. Measurements for p-ERK1/2 or p-MEK1/2 were scaled to reflect the value observed for total ERK1/2 or MEK1/2 in each lane. After scaling, a two-sample t test (two-sided) was performed to determine the significance of the differences in the mean p-ERK1/2 and p-MEK1/2 signals in Bα/Bδ-overexpressing or Bα knock-down cell lines relative to control cells (EV). Luciferase Reporter Assays—The PathDetect Elk1 trans-reporting system (Stratagene) was modified for the dual luciferase assay (Promega) to quantify ERK activation according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bα/δ-inducible HEK T-Rex cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well in 24-well plates and transfected 24 h later with up to 50 ng/well activator plasmid (Ha-Ras V12, MEK1 S218D,S222D; adjusted to 50 ng with pcDNA3.1) and 450 ng/well reporter plasmid mixture (85% pFR-Luc, 5% pFA2-Elk1, 10% p"

Mobilization of stored triglyceride is thought be controlled by interactions among intracellular lipases and proteins that coat lipid storage droplets. A major limitation of previous studies of hormone-mediated lipolysis, however, is the use of cultured model adipocytes whose three-dimensional architectures do not resemble those in real adipose tissue. To address this limitation, we investigated the intracellular targeting of perilipin, a major lipid coat protein, and hormone-sensitive lipase in three preparations that exhibit more appropriate morphologies: 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown in three-dimensional matrix, dissociated mature adipocytes from mouse adipose tissue, and adipocytes within intact fat pads. High resolution imaging of native and fluorescently tagged proteins indicate that: 1) perilipin preferentially targets a special class of peripheral lipid storage droplets, but not the major or central lipid storage droplets, 2) the peripheral droplets are the sites of attack by hormone-sensitive lipase, and 3) perilipin and hormone-sensitive lipase are continuously colocalized following lipolytic activation. These results indicate that in white adipose tissue, lipolysis takes place in a specialized subcellular domain that is distinct from the major lipid storage site and is defined by perilipin.

It has been proposed that Plin covers lipid droplet surfaces and serves as a physical barrier that protects stored triglyceride from hydrolysis by cellular lipases (4Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B.

Upon lipolytic stimulation, Plin is phosphorylated at multiple sites by PKA, thereby altering its association with the droplet surface and allowing hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) access to lipid droplet surface to initiate lipolysis. perilipin adipocyte differentiation-related protein β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL-316,243 epididymal white fat tissue hormone-sensitive lipase 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine lipid storage droplet perilipin, adipophilin, and TIP47 family (-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine streptolysin-O suprascapular white adipose tissue cAMP-dependent kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline numerical aperture. perilipin adipocyte differentiation-related protein β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL-316,243 epididymal white fat tissue hormone-sensitive lipase 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine lipid storage droplet perilipin, adipophilin, and TIP47 family (-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine streptolysin-O suprascapular white adipose tissue cAMP-dependent kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline numerical aperture. Although there is strong evidence that Plin is critically involved in regulating access of HSL to stored triglyceride, several observations indicate that a simple barrier/translocation model is insufficient to explain lipolysis in vivo. For example, bulk translocation of HSL and Plin dissociation are not consistent features of lipolytic activation in primary adipocytes (6Clifford G.M. Kraemer F.B. Yeaman S.J. Vernon R.G. Metabolism. 2001; 50: 1264-1269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 7Clifford G.M. Londos C. Kraemer F.B. Vernon R.G. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5011-5015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lipolysis can be observed in permeabilized fat cells, strongly indicating that the lipolytic machinery is preassembled to such a degree that the soluble pool of HSL may be irrelevant (8Mooney R.A. Ebersohl R.D. McDonald J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Mooney R.A.

Physiol. 1991; 71: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Finally, the barrier/translocation model does not explicitly address the issue of whether all lipid storage droplet (LSD) surfaces are coated with Plin, although the model implies that surfaces not coated by Plin should be subject to attack by HSL. One important difference between the model cells used to develop the barrier/translocation hypothesis and fat cells in their native environment is that normal fat cells contain a single major LSD whereas cultured cells (e.g. 3T3-L1 adipocytes) contain multiple LSDs that rarely exceed 5 microns in diameter. Furthermore, cell shape is known to have important effects on phenotypic gene expression and the organization of signaling pathways in adipocytes (11McBeath R. Pirone D.M. Nelson C.M. Bhadriraju K. Chen C.S. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar). In this study, we have therefore investigated the organization of lipolytic signaling in unilocular mature adipocytes using a novel, in vivo “adiporation” and imaging techniques (12Granneman J.G. Li P. Lu Y. Tilak J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 287: E574-E582Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, we employed 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were supported in a three-dimensional matrix. Unlike model adipocytes grown on flat surfaces, cells in these three-dimensional cultures develop 1-3 major lipid droplets (>20 μm in diameter) that more closely resemble true unilocular adipocytes in vivo. Our results indicate that mature adipocytes contain at least two types of LSDs: a major or central LSD that is typically associated with unilocular fat cells, and novel peripheral LSDs that are interposed between the plasma membrane and the central LSD. Analysis of the distribution of Plin and HSL indicates that these proteins are largely colocalized to peripheral LSDs and not the core LSD during lipolytic stimulation. These data indicate that Plin defines the sites of lipase action and is unlikely to act as a requisite barrier of all LSD surfaces, particularly the core LSD. These observations and recent proteomic studies (13Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 14Liu P. Ying Y. Zhao Y. Mundy D.I. Zhu M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3787-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) suggest that adipocytes contain a specialized domain devoted to regulated lipolysis and that Plin may play a key role in organizing the structure and function of that domain. Materials—Alexa-488-Bodipy was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rabbit anti-Plin and rabbit anti-HSL antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. A. Chaudhry (Pfizer, Ann Arbor, MI). Plin antibody was developed against the N-terminal 15 amino acids of rat Plin (12Granneman J.G. Li P. Lu Y. Tilak J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 287: E574-E582Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the HSL antibody was that described by Syu and Saltiel (15Syu L.J. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The specificities of these antibodies were confirmed using 293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding Plin or HSL; in each case, the antibodies produced a positive immunofluorescence signal only from cells had been transfected with the appropriate construct (data not shown). Rabbit anti-phospho-(Ser/Thr)-PKA substrate antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and guinea pig anti-ADRP antibodies were obtained from Research Diagnostics (Concord, MA). Full-length mouse perilipin A was cloned in-frame into the KnpI site of EYFP-N1 (Plin-A-EYFP) and was obtained from Dr. Chaudhry. Construction and characterization of full-length HSL fused to the C terminus of ECFP/A206K (ECFP-HSL) has been described (16Smith A.J. Sanders M.A. Thompson B.R. Londos C. Kraemer F.B. Bernlohr D.A.

Streptolysin-O (SLO) was purchased from Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi (Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Mainz, Germany). Cell Culture—Three-dimensional cultures of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were prepared as follows. Confluent cultures of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were incubated for 3 days in differentiation medium (DMEM/high glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin supplemented with 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine or IBMX, and 1 μg/ml insulin). The differentiation medium was replaced with growth medium supplemented with only insulin (1 μg/ml) and incubated for 2 more days. The cells from one 10-cm dish were then trypsinized and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). Forty microliters of the cell suspension were placed on each 12-mm coverslip placed in a 24-well culture plate and allowed to solidify at 37 °C for 10 min. Growth medium (DMEM/high glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin) was added, and the cells were maintained in this medium for 2 more weeks. At the end of this period, over 75% of the cells had developed 2-3 major lipid droplets with diameters >20 μm. In Fig. 4B, the cells were grown on Matrigel for 4 days before the SLO experiment.FIGURE 4A, localization of Plin and HSL in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by double label immunofluorescence. 14-day-old adipocytes in Matrigel were either stimulated for 12 min or kept in control conditions.

Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, peri-ovarian fat pads from two, 3-month-old, female 129/S1SvImJ mice were removed and finely minced with scissors. The tissue was then digested with 1.5 mg/ml collagenase (306 units/mg, Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) in Isolation Buffer (DMEM, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% BSA, 100 nm PIA, or (-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine) for 30 min at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Adipocytes were separated from stromal cells by centrifugation, and the floating adipocytes were then washed three times with Isolation Buffer before being resuspended in ice-cold Matrigel and plated on coverslips as described above. Cells were cultured overnight in a 1:1 mixture of Isolation Buffer and growth medium (DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. To examine lipolytic activation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes or isolated mature adipocytes were rinsed with PBS and preincubated with DMEM, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4/3 nm PIA for 1 h at 37 °C. A concentrated stock of lipolytic stimulating reagents was added to one set of wells to achieve a final concentration of 10 μm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX. The other set of wells (unstimulated control) received additional PIA at a final concentration of 200 nm. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 5 to 30 min, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. In some experiments (Fig. 4B), stimulated or control cells were first permeabilized with 10 μg/ml SLO in an intracellular buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 140 mm KCl, 6 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 nm buffered calcium-EGTA, 0.2% glucose, 4% BSA) for 15 min at 37 °C before fixation. Fluorescence Staining Procedures—Antibodies against Plin, HSL, and phospho-PKA substrate were generated in rabbits. Therefore, to examine colocalization of two proteins in the same cell by immunofluorescence histochemistry we employed the procedure of Negoescu et al. (18Negoescu A. Labat-Moleur F. Lorimier P. Lamarcq L. Guillermet C. Chambaz E. Brambilla E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The key to this approach is the application of saturating levels of a monovalent secondary antibody when detecting the first antigen. Fixed cells were first permeabilized with PBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.01% saponin (permeabilization buffer) for 1 h. They were then incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies against the first antigen (rabbit anti-HSL at 1:500 dilution, or rabbit anti-Plin at 1:1000 dilution). The slides were washed four times with PBS over a 40-min period, and then incubated for 1 h with 3 μg/ml Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Fab fragment (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). The slides were washed as before, and then incubated for 45 min with primary antibodies against the second antigen (rabbit anti-Plin at 1:1000 dilution or rabbit anti-phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody at 1:150 dilution). The slides were again washed and incubated for 45 min with 2 μg/ml Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Fab)2 antibodies (Molecular Probes). Washed slides were post-fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. All antibodies were diluted in permeabilization buffer, and incubations were carried out at room temperature. For each pair of antibodies used, control experiments were performed in which one of the primary antibodies was omitted. In all cases, omission of the primary antibody resulted in total elimination of fluorescent signals in the corresponding channel (supplementary Fig. S1, and data not shown), validating this double staining approach. In experiments where immunofluorescence staining patterns were compared with those of central lipid storage droplets (Figs. 1 and 3), the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with primary antibodies as described above. The coverslips were then incubated for 45 min with 4 μg/ml Alexa-555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and 0.25 μg/ml Bodipy-493/503 (both from Molecular Probes).FIGURE 3Immunolocalization of Plin, HSL, and phospho-PKA substrate in 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown in three-dimensional matrix. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown in Matrigel for 14 days, and the cells were either treated with 100 nm PIA (control) or 10 μm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX (stimulated) for 5, 12, and 30 min. Cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy with the indicated antibodies. 0.25 μg/ml Bodipy was included in the secondary antibody to stain central lipid droplets.

A control plasmid (DsRed) was added to yield 2.1 μg of total plasmid per well. Four hours later, the transfection mixture was removed, and the cells were fed with growth medium containing 300 μm oleic acid, 1% BSA, 0.5 μg/ml insulin for 16 h. The cells were rinsed once with Krebs Ringers supplemented with 4% fatty acid-free BSA, and then incubated in this medium (200 μl per well) containing either 1 μm PIA (control) or 10 μm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX (stimulated) for 2 h at 37 °C. Glycerol content of 100 μl of the medium was determined using the glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase technique (Sigma F6428). In parallel experiments, cells cotransfected with ECFP-HSL and Plin-A-EYFP were treated under control and stimulated conditions for 30 min, then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and imaged by spinning disc confocal microscopy, as detailed below. In Vivo Adiporation—Adiporation was performed according to our published procedure (12Granneman J.G. Li P. Lu Y. Tilak J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 287: E574-E582Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3-month-old male 129/S1SvImJ mice were anesthetized with Avertin, and skin in the interscapular region was removed of fur and disinfected with alcohol. A 15-mm incision was made along the midline between and the skin overlying suprascapular white adipose tissue (SSWAT) was gently dissected so that an approach to this subcutaneous pad could be easily made on either side. Plasmid DNA was reconstituted in sterile water at a total concentration of 1 μg/μl and 4 injections (7 μl per injection) were made into the SSWAT pad with 30-gauge needle and a Hamilton microliter syringe. For adiporation with both Plin-A-EYFP and ECFP-HSL, the plasmids were mixed at a mass ratio of 1:2 prior to injection. The injection site was gently gathered to a gap width of 1.0 mm with Gerald bipolar forceps and seven 50 V, 20 ms square-wave pulses were delivered over 3 s immediately after injection. In experiments shown in Fig. 8, bottom, the animals were implanted at the time of adiporation with osmotic minipumps (Alzet) that delivered the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL-316,243 (CL) at a rate of 0.75 nmol/hr. Control and drug-treated tissues were harvested 3 days after adiporation. In parallel experiments, a group of adiporated mice received a single injection of 5 nmol of CL 15 min before harvesting (Fig. 8, top). Three days after adiporation, SSWAT was dissected and immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The region of electroporation was identified by fluorescence microscopy, dissected, and stored in PBS at 4 °C until imaged. Tissue containing adipocytes expressing fluorescent fusion proteins was placed in between two coverslips in a Leiden chamber and visualized without further processing with wide field or confocal fluorescence microscopy. Microscopy and Image Analysis—Images (Figs. 1, 3, and 5) were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwoods, NJ) and a ×40 1.2 NA Apochromat water immersion differential interference contrast objective lens. Bodipy-493/503 and Alexa-488 were excited with Argon laser line at 488 nm, and Alexa-555 and Cy3 were excited with Argon laser line at 543 nm, using a dichroic beam splitter (HFT 488/543). All image acquisition was done in the multitrack mode with pinholes set to 1 Airy unit. Emissions from Bodipy-493/503 were passed through a beam splitter (NFT545) and light below 545 nm was collected with a band pass filter (BP505-550), resulting in collection from 505 nm to 545 nm. Alexa-555 emissions above 560 nm were collected with a long pass filter (LP560). Images in Fig. 4A were acquired using a ×63 1.2 NA Apochromat water immersion objective lens, and emissions were collected by a band pass filter (BP 500-530 IR) for Alexa-488 and a long pass filter (LP 560) for Cy3. Under these conditions, no channel bleed-through was observed as assessed by cells stained with a single fluorescent probe. ECFP and EYFP (Figs. 7 and 8) were excited with argon laser lines at 458 nm and 514 nm, respectively, and images were acquired using a ×63 1.2 NA Apochromat water-immersion objective lens using a dichroic beam splitter (HFT 458/514). Emissions were collected by band pass filters BP480-520 IR and BP535-590 IR for ECFP and EYFP, respectively. Control single transfection experiments demonstrated that ECFP and EYFP signals were optically separated. Images in Fig. 2 were acquired using an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with the Olympus spinning disc confocal system, a ×40 0.85 NA UPlan Apochromatic objective lens, and a Retiga 1300 cooled CCD camera. Confocal z-axis images were deconvolved using the point spread function algorithm and rendered in three dimensions with Microtome and VoxBlast imaging software (Vaytek, Fairfield, IA). Images in Fig. 6B were acquired with the Olympus spinning disc confocal system, a ×60 1.2 NA water immersion lens, and a Hamamatsu Orca cooled CCD camera. EYFP and ECFP signals were isolated using Chroma (Rockingham, VT) filter sets 31044 and 41028, respectively. Quantitation of fluorescence intensities and colocalization were performed using the colocalization and line profile tools of Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD).FIGURE 7Distribution of Plin-A-EYFP and ECFP-HSL in mature fat cells in situ.

These predictions were first tested in 3T3-L1 grown in the three-dimensional matrix. After 2 weeks of culture in Matrigel, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes developed a few large (20-30 μm) central LSDs. These cultures exhibit a much higher lipolytic response than those grown on plastic surfaces as measured by glycerol release into the medium (supplementary Fig. S2), consistent with their more differentiated phenotype. The central LSDs were strongly labeled by Alexa-488-bodipy (Fig. 1panel A, green). Costaining of the cells with anti-Plin antibodies and Alexa-555-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by laser scanning confocal microscopic analysis showed that these central LSDs contained little Plin, if any, on their surfaces (Fig. 1, panel A, red). Instead, Plin was most concentrated on numerous small LSDs in the cell periphery. (Note that peripheral LSDs are largely photobleached because of low volumes of lipid.)

https://openalex.org/W2114845709,"Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, is a major therapeutic target. A prototypic uncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH, mycophenolic acid (MPA), is the active form of mycophenolate mofeteil (CellCept®), a widely used immunosuppressive drug. We have found that MPA interacts with intracellular IMPDH in vivo to alter its mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. MPA also induces a striking conformational change in IMPDH protein in intact cells, resulting in the formation of annular aggregates of protein with concomitant inhibition of IMPDH activity. These aggregates are not associated with any known intracellular organelles and are reversible by incubating cells with guanosine, which repletes intracellular GTP, or with GTPγS. GTP also restores IMPDH activity. Treatment of highly purified IMPDH with MPA also results in the formation of large aggregates of protein, a process that is both prevented and reversed by the addition of GTP. Finally, GTP binds to IMPDH at physiologic concentrations, induces the formation of linear arrays of tetrameric protein, and prevents the aggregation of protein induced by MPA. We conclude that intracellular GTP acts as an antagonist to MPA by directly binding to IMPDH and reversing the conformational changes in the protein."

Here we report a 3.2 Å crystal structure of the tetrameric AqpZ (tAqpZ).

A. 2004; 101: 14045-14050Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). All known AQP structures share a common molecular architecture containing four monomeric subunits assembled into a homotetrameric structure. Each monomer is characterized by an hourglass-like structure with an internal quasi-2-fold symmetry, corresponding to an intragenic gene duplication of AQP protein sequences (9Wistow G.J. Pisano M.M. Chepelinsky A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 170-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The functional unit of AQPs is a monomer that embraces a central water/glycerol-conducting channel surrounded by six transmembrane helices and two half-spanning helices joined end-to-end in the middle of the membrane by interlocking interactions of two highly conserved NPA tripeptide sequences. The channel lumen surface is strongly amphipathic, with oxygens and nitrogens lined up on one side and carbons on the opposite side (4Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamic simulations of AQPs have suggested that water molecules can coordinate each of the hydrogen-bonding groups to form a continuous single file that spans the entire length of the water-conducting channel (10de Groot B.L. Grubmuller H. Science. 2001; 294: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 11Tajkhorshid E. Nollert P. Jensen M.O. Miercke L.J. O'Connell J. Stroud R.M. Schulten K. Science. 2002; 296: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The rate of permeation is limited by two significant energetic barriers in the channel, corresponding to two channel constriction regions: one is located at the narrowest point at the channel entrance on the periplasmic side and the other at the NPA region about the quasi-2-fold axis. The narrowest constriction has been identified as the selective filter of the channel, which is formed by the side chains of Arg-189, Phe-43, and His-174 in the water-conducting channel AqpZ (6Savage D.F. Egea P.F. Robles-Colmenares Y. O'Connell III, J.D. Stroud R.M. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E72Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) or Arg-206, Phe-200, Trp-48 in the glycerol-conducting channel GlpF (4Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). These side chain differences render a narrower and more hydrophilic selective filter in AqpZ, accounting for its selectivity for water over glycerol (6Savage D.F. Egea P.F. Robles-Colmenares Y. O'Connell III, J.D. Stroud R.M. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E72Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Recent structural solutions of two AQP0 proteins have shown that the AQP0 water pore is much more constricted compared with those of AqpZ, AQP1, and GlpF (7Gonen T. Sliz P. Kistler J. Cheng Y. Walz T. Nature. 2004; 429: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 8Harries W.E. Akhavan D. Miercke L.J. Khademi S. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14045-14050Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The narrowest region of the AQP0 channels is formed by an additional channel constriction in the cytoplasmic half of the pore, suggesting that additional structural components may contribute to limiting water permeation through the AQP0 channels, the rate of which is ∼40 times lower than that of AQP1 at neutral pH (12Chandy G. Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Hall J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). aquaporin or aquaglyceroporin non-crystallography symmetry root mean square difference tetrameric AqpZ. The emerging evidence suggests that AQP channels are not constitutive conduits of water or glycerol. The crystal structures of AQP1, GlpF, and AqpZ all showed that their narrowest constrictions (selective filters) are open to water/glycerol binding, whereas the electron diffraction structure of the sheep AQP0 revealed a closed water pore. Intriguingly, the x-ray structure of bovine AQP0 exhibited a water-filled channel that contained constriction regions narrower than would be required for the passage of a water molecule. Thermal fluctuations of AQP0 side chain rotamers appeared to cause dilation of channel constrictions to larger sizes sufficient for a water molecule to pass; thus, the bovine APQ0 channel was thought to be dynamically open to water passage. This finding raised a question as to how the side chain dynamics play a role in controlling the AQP channel opening or closing. Molecular dynamic simulations of AqpZ revealed thermal fluctuations of the Arg-189 side chain between two distinct conformational states, resulting in an open or closed channel conformation (13Wang Y. Schulten K. Tajkhorshid E. Structure. 2005; 13: 1107-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic gradient is expected to be quite shallow for this thermally activated conformational equilibrium. It is not clear whether the simulated Arg-189 thermal fluctuations could lead to steady states of channel opening and closing in milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds, a time scale commonly observed in ion channel kinetic studies (14Katz B. Miledi R. J. Physiol. 1972; 224: 665-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 15Anderson C.R. Stevens C.F. J. Physiol. 1973; 235: 655-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined the AqpZ tetrameric structure in the space group of P4122 with two tetramers/asymmetrical unit; thus, the four monomeric structures were solved independently without crystallographic averaging. Intriguingly, the tAqpZ structure revealed two distinct conformations among the four monomeric channels. One of the four channels was found in a fully open state, whereas the remaining three were closed by the side chain displacement of Arg-189 that occluded the selective filter. The tAqpZ structure therefore provides structural evidence for the presence of two distinct channel conformations during water permeation. A unique crystal packing contact between two open channels is implicated in a role of trapping the Arg-189 side chain into one of the two dynamic conformations that appear to be sufficiently stable to be resolved in the tAqpZ crystal structure. Further, Arg-189 is the only channel-lining residue in tAqpZ that shows a significant side chain displacement. This finding highlights the localization of the channel conformational dynamics to the narrowest constriction region. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—As described previously (16Daniels B.V. Jiang J.S. Fu D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 561-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), His-AqpZ was overexpressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and purified by one-step metal affinity chromatography. The N-terminal His tag was then removed by thrombin digestion, resulting in AqpZ that was further purified by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml prior to crystallization screens. The best AqpZ crystals were obtained in hanging drops by a 1:1 mix of pure AqpZ with a crystallization solution containing 16% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.75% β-OG, 20% glycerol, 0.064 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 0.128 m (NH4)2SO4, 100 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm CoCl2. Data Collection and Processing—A complete x-ray dataset was collected on beam line X25 at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The dataset was indexed, integrated, and merged using the software package HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol., Macromol. Crystallogr. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Because of significant x-ray beam variations during data collection, the 347-frame dataset was divided into three subsets, (frames 0 - 82, 90 - 134, and 140 - 359), processed independently, and then merged together to achieve an overall Rmerge of 12.2% to 3.2 Å with an Rmerge of 34.6% for the outer shell. Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure was solved by molecular replacement using a homologous tAqpZ model generated by 4-fold symmetry rotation of a GlpF monomer. Self-rotation function calculations (18Tong L.A. Rossmann M.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) revealed a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS), leading to an initial model of two tAqpZ/asymmetric unit related by a 2-fold NCS. The resultant model was refined using the software package CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). After the first round of refinement, the 2-fold NCS relation matrix was calculated again and used as a strict constraint for further refinement with one tAqpZ as a search model, assuming structures of two tetramers are identical. After several rounds of refinements and model rebuilding, water molecules were identified and iteratively incorporated into the final model. The σA-weighted (2 Fo - Fc) and difference (Fo - Fc) density maps were used throughout the model building (20Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). All graphic presentations were prepared using the software package PyMol. Determination of the tAqpZ Structure—Diffraction data to 3.2 Å were collected under cryoconditions. AqpZ crystals belonged to space group P4122 (a = b = 119.152, c = 380.394) with two tetramers/asymmetric unit, related by a 2-fold NCS axis perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and initially refined to an Rcryst of 19.1% and Rfree of 36.9% without any NCS restraint. Applying gradual weighted restraints between two tetramers led to minimization of tetramer-tetramer root mean square differences (r.m.s.d.) to 0.01 Å, accompanied by narrowing of the Rcryst-Rfree difference. Thus, a strict 2-fold NCS constraint was applied to the structural refinement, yielding an Rcryst of 23.1% and Rfree of 25.0%. At this stage of refinement, several strong electron densities were evident on the surface of the membrane-spanning domain. The locations and appearances of these electron densities were indicative of ordered detergents and lipids. The numerical values of Rcryst and Rfree were further improved to 22.5 and 24.7%, respectively, by modeling these detergent/lipid densities. Finally, water molecules were added, leading to a final Rcryst of 20.1% and Rfree of 23.9% (Table 1). The final tAqpZ model included 270 waters/tetramer, together with two detergent molecules and six lipid fragments accounting for elongated electron densities found on the tetramer peripheral surface as well as in the center of the AqpZ tetramer (Fig. 1A). The strongest water electron densities were observed within four monomeric channels, A, B, C, and D (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics Rmerge = Σ|I-〈I〉|/ΣI, where 〈I〉 is the average intensity of the multiple hkl observations for symmetry-related reflections.

However, applying additional tetramer 4-fold NCS constraints did not improve structural refinement, suggesting that there are genuine structural differences among the four AqpZ monomers. Alignment of Cα traces yielded a r.m.s.d. of 0.25-0.29 Å among four monomers, with differences mainly visible in the extracellular loops where different crystal contacts were made between AqpZ monomers. Slightly higher r.m.s. differences (0.27-0.43 Å) were obtained when comparing the AqpZ monomer structures solved previously in a space group of P4 (a = b = 93.6, c = 80.4 Å) with two monomers/asymmetric unit. Similar structural differences (r.m.s.d. = 0.44 Å) were also noted between two monomers in the P4 AqpZ crystals (6Savage D.F. Egea P.F. Robles-Colmenares Y. O'Connell III, J.D. Stroud R.M. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E72Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Structure of the Water-conducting Channel—The monomeric structure of AqpZ displays six transmembrane helices and two half membrane-spanning helices in a right-handed helical bundle that revolves around a pseudo-2-fold symmetry axis in the membrane plane as described previously (6Savage D.F. Egea P.F. Robles-Colmenares Y. O'Connell III, J.D. Stroud R.M. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E72Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The AqpZ channel consists of a periplasmic and a cytoplasmic vestibule, both conical in shape and connected by a central narrow amphipathic pore ∼25 Å in length. The hydrophilic face provides two patches of solvent-accessible carbonyl oxygens, each contributed by four adjacent main chain carbonyls of Asn-182, Thr-183, Ser-184, and Val-185 from the periplasmic side and those of quasi-2-fold related Gly-59, Gly-60, His-61, and Phe-62 from the cytoplasmic side. Between these main chain carbonyls is the highly constrained and interlocked NPA conjunction centered about the quasi-2-fold axis where Asn-186 and Asn-63 project ND2 groups of their side chains to the channel. This complete set of pore-lining carbonyl oxygens and asparagine amines are arranged on the hydrophilic face to form a contiguous chain of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors for coordination of water molecules, thus establishing a water-conducting pathway. On the opposing hydrophobic face of the channel, an abundance of valines, phenylalanines, and isoleucines provides steric limits to shape the size of the pore. The channel contains two highly conserved regions, the selective filter and the NPA region. Located ∼10 Å away from the NPA junction on the periplasmic side is the selectivity filter formed by the side chains of His-174, Arg-189, and the carbonyl of Thr-183 on the hydrophilic face and the aromatic ring of Phe-43 on the opposite hydrophobic face (Fig. 2). Different Water Binding in AqpZ Channels—Clusters of discreet electron densities were observed in each of the AqpZ monomer channels (Fig. 1B). The strongest electron densities were located in the periplasmic half of the central amphipathic pore between the selective filter and the NPA junction, resulting in unambiguous assignments of several water molecules. Unexpectedly, the number of water molecules and their locations are different among the four monomer channels. In the selective filter region, there are two water molecules (WA1, WA2) in monomer A, one (WB1) in monomer B, and no water observed in monomers C and D (Fig. 2, A--D). Locations of WA1 and WA2 do not overlap with WB1. WA1 is above the selective filter, where it is hydrogen bonded to the NH2 of the Arg-189 guanidino group (O-N distance of 2.7 Å). WA2 snugly nests within the selective filter, forming a tridentate H-bond with the NE2 of the His-174 imidazole group (O-N 2.6 Å), NE of Arg-189 guanidino group (O-N 2.6 Å), and Thr-183 main chain carbonyl oxygen (O-O 2.9 Å). WB1 is below the selective filter coordinated by the Thr-183 carbonyl oxygen (O-O 3.1 Å) and the Arg-189 NH1 (O-N 2.7 Å). In the NPA region, there are two water molecules (WA3 and WA4) in monomer A, three in monomer B (WB2, WB3, WB4), two in monomer C (WC1, WC2), and one in monomer D (WD1). These water molecules occupy the same general positions. From NPA junction to the cytoplasmic vestibule, the innermost waters (WA3, WB2, WC1) are present in monomers A, B, and C, forming a coordinating H-bond with either ND2 of Asn-186 or Asn-63 (O-N distances, 2.9 - 3.0 Å). The middle waters (WA4, WB3, WC2, WD1) are invariantly present in all four monomers and bind to His-61 carbonyl oxygen (O-O distances, 2.6 - 2.9 Å). The outermost water (WB4) is only seen in monomer B with an H-bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-60 (O-O distance, 2.9 Å). The orientations of water molecules in all four monomers are consistent with a bipolar ordering with their oxygen atoms facing the center of the channel as described previously (11Tajkhorshid E. Nollert P. Jensen M.O. Miercke L.J. O'Connell J. Stroud R.M. Schulten K. Science. 2002; 296: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Two Distinct Arg-189 Conformational Orientations in the Channel-selective Filters—Channel-lining hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups in the four monomer channels are approximately held in the same positions, with one marked exception occurring in the selective filter where the side chain of Arg-189 was found in two distinct conformational orientations. Omit maps on Arg-189 (before inclusion of waters) show a difference in the placement of the guanidino group of Arg-189 in the monomer A as compared with those in monomers B, C, and D, which are essentially identical (Fig. 1C). In monomer A, the Arg-189 guanidino group is orientated parallel to the length of the channel, creating an opening in the selective filter for accommodation of a bound water molecule, WA2 (Fig. 2A). This upward Arg-189 orientation is approximately identical to those of Arg-189 equivalents observed in all of the AQP x-ray structures determined thus far. In monomers B, C, and D, the Arg-189 guanidino group bends over toward the carbonyl oxygen of Thr-183 to form an NH1-O hydrogen bond and closes up the selective filter (Fig. 2, B–D). To validate two different fits of the Arg-189 side chain, we switched Arg-189 side chains between monomers A and B-D, removed water molecules from the model, and applied energy minimization and simulated annealing. Arg-189 side chain orientations in both monomers A and B-D returned to their original conformations. Furthermore, we replaced the Arg-189 side chains in monomer A with several randomly selected rotamers and found that these different rotamers converged on a single upward orientation by energy minimization and annealing in the absence of water molecules. Likewise, Arg-189 rotamers in monomers B and C converged on the same down orientation regardless of the initial rotomeric conformations. B-factors for atoms in Arg-189 were in the range of 21-30 for monomer A, 23-26 for monomer B, 34 - 38 for monomer C, and 36 - 41 for monomer D. The overall B-factor values of Arg-189 in monomers C and D were similar to the average tAqpZ B-factor (35.9), whereas binding of water molecules to monomers A and B reduced the Arg-189 B-factors to below the average. Therefore, these analyses supported the two different fits of the Arg-189 guanidino group. The observed side chain displacement was unique to Arg-189, because side chain orientations of all other channellining residues were nearly identical. Further, we only observed two distinct Arg-189 side chain conformations among four monomer channels. This observation was in agreement with molecular dynamic simulations of AqpZ showing that Arg-189 side chain could only adopt one of two distinct conformations, as opposed to many randomly rotameric conformations (13Wang Y. Schulten K. Tajkhorshid E. Structure. 2005; 13: 1107-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Different Crystal Packing Interactions in the Membrane-spanning Domain—To understand how the Arg-189 in monomer A could be stabilized to a conformation differing from those in monomers B, C, and D, we examined the difference in crystal packing contacts between monomer A versus B, C, and D. As shown in Fig. 3A, there are three different types of intersubunit contacts in the xy-plane: A-A and B-B contacts at the interface of two AqpZ tetramers within an asymmetric unit and a C-D contact between two asymmetric units. The tetramer-tetramer interface is formed by an angular association (∼5° in the xy-plane) of two monomer A proteins; thus, monomer A is more extensively involved in the tetramer-tetramer contact. Monomer B only partially contributes to the tetramer interface, whereas monomer C and D are completely disconnected from the tetramer interface. The buried surface areas at the A-A, B-B, and C-D interfaces are 1087.8, 885.3, and 500.8 Å2, respectively. A close examination of the A-A contact revealed a strong electron density that connected two aromatic rings of Phe-10 in the first transmembrane helices (Fig. 3A). The elongated appearance of the electron density was suggestive of a lipidic nature, but we were not able to make a molecular assignment at the current resolution. The contact point at Phe-10 is close to the highly conserved Glu-8, which forms two hydrogen bonds with main chain amines to orient four successive main chain carbonyls of Gly-59, Gly-60, His-61, and Phe-62 on the channel lumen surface. The carbonyl of Phe-62 forms another highly conserved hydrogen bond with ND2 of Asn-186 as a part of the interlocking hydrogen bond network that holds the two NPA signature sequences together. The OD1 of Asn-186 forms yet another highly conserved hydrogen bond with the main chain amine of Arg-189. Thus, Arg-189 is connected to Glu-8 through a chain of highly conserved hydrogen bond interactions (Fig. 3B). The geometry of this chain of hydrogen bonds remains almost identical among the four subunits, suggesting the rigidity of these hydrogen bonds, mainly attributed to the constrained NPA-NPA interlocking interaction. It appears that the side chain of Arg-189 is the weakest link at the end of this rigid chain of hydrogen bonds, which may allow the impact of crystal packing contact at Phe-10 to be delivered effectively to Arg-189. Apparently, this unique lateral crystal packing contact between two monomers A is correlated with the open conformation of this subunit. Crystal stacking contacts in the z direction are also different among four subunits. However, there is no obvious correlation to implicate how differences in vertical stacking contacts may contribute to stabilization of the Arg-189 conformations. All the known AQP crystal structures thus far have been determined with crystallographic averaging of monomeric structures due to crystal packing symmetries. The tAqpZ structure represents a unique tetrameric solution that allows the observation of two distinct Arg-189 side chain orientations in the channel-selective filter. This observation is partially consistent with molecular dynamic calculations that also suggested the presence of two distinct conformations. Nevertheless, the Arg-189 side chain in molecular dynamic simulations appeared to be unusually dynamic, in rapid equilibrium between two distinct conformations driven only by thermal fluctuations. In contrast, the B-factors of the Arg-189 side chains in the tAqpZ structure were similar or lower than the average protein B-factor, showing no sign of excessive flexibility. Further, the omit maps on Arg-189 exhibited distinct side chain features, indicative of two orientations of the Arg-189 guanidino group even at a limited resolution. Refinement of Arg-189 conformations consistently converged to one of the two distinct orientations, regardless of the initial rotameric conformations. These results suggest that the observation of two distinct Arg-189 conformations in tAqpZ crystals is valid. It is not clear, however, whether the two Arg-189 conformations correspond to open and closed states of an AqpZ channel or whether they represent two dynamic conformations found during water permeation through the narrowest constriction of the channel. Without kinetic measurement of possible opening and closing of AqpZ channels by single channel recording, the crystal structure of tAqpZ only provides clues as to the transient nature of the Arg-189 conformation. The structural difference between the “open” and “closed” conformation is mainly localized to the Arg-189 side chain orientations. This lack of a more global protein conformational change suggests a marginal free energy barrier separating the two Arg-189 conformational states. Thus, the observed two Arg-189 conformations are likely interconvertible by thermal fluctuation. The thermodynamic equilibrium between two Arg-189 conformations is anticipated to regulate the open probability of the water pore, whereas the shallow thermodynamic gradient between the two Arg-189 conformations may be inadequate to stabilize the AqpZ channel into either one of these two states without additional stabilizing free energy input. The Arg-189 in tAqpZ crystals appeared to be trapped into two distinct stable conformational states by asymmetrical crystal packing contacts. Unlike earlier AQP crystal structures where there was no or little packing interaction involved with the transmembrane domain, the tAqpZ structure reveals lateral tAqpZ-tAqpZ interactions in the transmembrane domains and demonstrates that asymmetrical crystal packing contacts are correlated with differences in Arg-189 side chain displacements. The conformations of four Arg-189 side chains are stabilized differently, whereas orientations of other side chains are essentially identical in four monomer channels. This finding highlights the dynamic nature of the Arg-189 side chain in a rather stable local protein fold. The unique Arg-189 conformation in monomer A is linked to a crystal packing interaction at Phe-10 in the first transmembrane helix. Because the molecular dynamics calculations indicated that the orientations of Arg-189 are in equilibrium between two thermally activated rotameric states, it is anticipated that a modest free energy input may be able to stabilize Arg-189 in one of the two conformations. It is possible that interactions at Phe-10 may allosterically alter the equilibrium of Arg-189 conformations through a chain of highly constrained hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, free energy differences derived from other asymmetrical crystal packing contacts may also contribute to stabilization of the Arg-189 in different conformations. Most mechanisms ascribed to ion channels involve reversible transitions among discrete open and closed conformational states. The opening or closing of an ion channel results in discontinuous flow of electric current in an all-or-none fashion down an electrochemical potential gradient across the channel. Thus, channel opening and closing can be followed directly by single channel current measurements. Because water/glycerol permeation through AQP channels is not accessible to electrophysiological studies, high resolution crystal structures may be used to access the opening or closing of the water-conducting pore. A simplistic view of an open channel consists of one or several binding sites arranged in a transmembrane pathway that are accessible from both sides of the membrane at the same time (21Lauger P. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 57: 163-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The Arg-189 conformation observed in monomer A allows a water molecule binding to the narrowest constriction of the channel; thus, monomer A is in an open channel conformation. The assessment of the closed channel conformation is not so clear-cut. The static water pore structure in the bovine AQP0 was noted to be too narrow for water permeation, but side chain rotomeric movements could sufficiently widen the channel constrictions for water passage (8Harries W.E. Akhavan D. Miercke L.J. Khademi S. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14045-14050Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Taking thermodynamics into consideration, membrane channels may be represented by a sequence of potential wells separated by activation barriers (22Lauger P. Apell H.J. Biophys. Chem. 1982; 16: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Water permeation through membrane channels may involve a sequence of thermally activated jumps between sites of low potential energy. Because the activation barriers (channel constrictions) in AQP0 could be surmounted by thermal fluctuations of side chain rotamers, AQP0 could be considered a dynamically open channel. On the other hand, asymmetrical crystal contacts in tAqpZ trap monomers B, C, and D into a thermodynamically stable conformation in which NH1 of Arg-189 bends over to form a strong hydrogen bond (see below) with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Thr-183 in the channel-selective filter, thus making the narrowest constriction of the channel not available for water binding. The main chain-side chain interaction between Thr-183 and Arg-189 was shown to be stable regardless of the initial Arg-189 rotameric conformations. Molecular dynamic simulations of the presteady state of the AqpZ channel also demonstrated that the closure of the selective filter by Arg-189 could lead to a complete dehydration of the water pore (13Wang Y. Schulten K. Tajkhorshid E. Structure. 2005; 13: 1107-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the Arg-189 conformation in monomers B, C, and D may impose an insurmountable activation barrier for thermally activated water permeation. Thus, monomers B, C, and D are in a closed channel conformation, stabilized in vitro by asymmetrical subunit interactions of crystal packing contacts. By analogy, in vivo AqpZ monomers may interact differently with cellular regulatory proteins, thereby regulating the overall tetramer water conductivity by varying the number of open or closed channels in an AqpZ homotetramer. The driving force for a closed-to-open conformational transition appears to be electrostatic in nature. As shown in Fig. 4A, the closed state is energetically favored by bridging the Arg-189-Glu-138 charge pair through the Thr-183 carbonyl oxygen and Ser-184 main chain amine nitrogen. NH1 from the Arg-189 guanidino group forms an H-bond with the Thr-183 main chain carbonyl oxygen, which is negatively charged due to the resonance of the main chain peptide bond under the influence of the Glu-138 carboxylate through a side chain-main chain hydrogen bond to the Ser-184 main chain amine nitrogen (O-N distance 3.0 Å). In the channel open state, the Arg-189 NH1-Thr-183 oxygen H-bond is replaced by two H-bonds involved with two water molecules: WA1 bound to Arg-189 NH2 and WA2 to Thr-183 oxygen. WA2 also bind to Arg-189 NE, thus connecting the Arg-189-Glu-138 charge pair through a string of hydrogen bonds mediated by WA2, the Thr-183 carbonyl oxygen, and Ser-184 main chain amine nitrogen (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the Arg-189 conformational equilibrium between the open and closed state is associated with two alternative hydrogen bond networks between Arg-189 and Glu-138. In both cases, the hydrogen bond networks are stabilized by an indirect Arg-189-Glu-138 interaction. This finding emphasizes the electrostatic contribution of the Glu-138 to the Arg-189 side chain dynamics and provides a mechanistic clue as to the observation of only two distinct Arg-189 conformations, as opposed to many random rotameric states. Intriguingly, as noted earlier, the quasi-2-fold symmetry-related Glu-8 might also contribute to Arg-189 conformational dynamics through a rigid chain of hydrogen bonds mediated by the NPA-NPA interlocking network. Arg-189, Glu-138, and Glu-8 are among the most conserved residues in the AQP protein family. The extremely high level of genetic conservation attests to their functional importance. We thank M.

We show that 120 protein spots in a two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/electrophoretic analysis were affected during vascular endothelial growth factor-A-induced endothelial cell tubular morphogenesis in vitro, as a result of changes in charge or expression level of the corresponding proteins. For about 22% of the spots, the protein products could be identified, of which several previously have been implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization and angiogenesis. One such protein was heat shock protein 27, a chaperone involved in β-actin rearrangement that was identified as regulated in degree of serine phosphorylation. We also identified regulation of chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4), the expression of which decreased during tubular morphogenesis. CLIC4 was expressed at high levels in resting vessels, whereas expression was modulated during pathological angiogenesis such as in tumor vessels. The subcellular localization of CLIC4 in endothelial cells was dependent on whether cells were engaged in proliferation or tube formation. Antisense- and small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of CLIC4 expression led to arrest in tubular morphogenesis. Our data implicate CLIC4 in formation of a vessel lumen."

The change in the MT molecule after zinc release in vivo is unknown although in vitro studies have identified MT disulfide bond formation. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that MT disulfide bond formation occurs in vivo. A cardiac-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic mouse model was used. Mice were administered saline as a control or doxorubicin (20 mg/kg), which is an effective anticancer drug but with severe cardiac toxicity at least partially because of the generation of reactive oxygen species. A differential alkylation of cysteine residues in MT of the heart extracts was performed.

It has been shown in vitro that MT directly interacts with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to prevent oxidative and nitrosative damage to macromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and DNA (5Thornalley P.J. Vasak M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 6Thomas J.P. Bachowski G.J. Girotti A.W. Biochim. Biophys.

However, this interaction has never been demonstrated in vivo and would unlikely be a major mechanism for the antioxidant action of MT in vivo because the reactivity of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species would only allow their reaction with molecules that have a close proximity to their generation sites. Alternatively, in vitro studies have demonstrated that the multiple cysteine residues of MT can be oxidized. The sulfur clusters that bind zinc in MT create an oxidoreductive environment for zinc at a redox potential so low that MT can be readily oxidized by mild cellular oxidants, such as glutathione disulfide, with the release of zinc (9Jiang L.J. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3483-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This MT oxidation and zinc release process would play a critical role in the cellular response to oxidative and nitrosative stress. metallothionein transgenic doxorubicin N-ethylmaleimide iodoacetamide dithiothreitol reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The high content of cysteine residues enables MT to avidly bind zinc and other metals (10Romero-Isart N. Vasak M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 88: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The binding of divalent metals to MT occurs in two dumbbell-shaped domains, of which the N-terminal β-domain usually binds 3 metals, whereas the C-terminal α-domain binds 4 metals. Under physiological conditions, MT primarily binds zinc. In vitro studies have shown that the interaction between MT and nitric oxide (NO) results in the release of 3 metals from the β-domain, leaving the α-domain metal binding unchanged (11Zangger K. Oz G. Haslinger E. Kunert O. Armitage I.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1303-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas other studies with synthetic and zinc-reconstituted domain peptides demonstrate that S-nitrosothiols indeed release zinc from both the α- and the β-domains of MT (12Chen Y. Irie Y. Keung W.M. Maret W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8360-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). That MT is involved in zinc mobilization by NO in cultured cells has been demonstrated in several studies. Treatment of lung fibroblasts isolated from wild-type and MT-null (MT-KO) mutant mice with S-nitrosocysteine caused a differential zinc mobilization response. Specifically, an increase in intracellular labile zinc, as detected by a zinc-specific fluorophore Zinquin, was observed in the wild-type but not in the MT-KO fibroblasts (13St. Croix C.M.

(14Pearce L.L. Gandley R.E. Han W. Wasserloos K. Stitt M. Kanai A.J. McLaughlin M.K. Pitt B.R. Levitan E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1303-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Upon storage under aerobic conditions, MT becomes dimerized through a disulfide bridge between two cysteine residues in thr C-terminal α-domain (19Zangger K. Shen G. Oz G. Otvos J.D. Armitage I.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 353-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the Cu4 cluster in the β-domain of Cu4Zn4-MT-3 was stable to air oxidation, the Zn4 cluster in the α-domain was found to be air sensitive resulting in the release of one zinc ion, presumably accompanied by the formation of disulfide bonds. This process can be reversed under reducing conditions indicating the redox sensitivity of the Zn4 cluster (20Roschitzki B. Vasak M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9822-9828Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An important question that remains to be answered is whether the formation of MT disulfide bonds occurs in vivo. It is thus important to determine whether MT becomes oxidized in vivo to elucidate the mechanism of action of MT. Although experiments aimed at estimating the level of oxidized MT in weanling rat liver cytosol have been carried out, no precautions were taken to exclude the oxidation of MT during sample processing (21Klein D. Sato S. Summer K.H. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study, a cardiac-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic (MT-TG) mouse model was employed (1Kang Y.J. Chen Y. Yu A. Voss-McCowan M. Epstein P.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), which has proven to be a valuable tool in dissecting the role of MT in cardiac protection from oxidative stress induced by an anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). In these mice, MT was overexpressed solely in cardiomyocytes and all other major antioxidants, including GSH, GSHpx, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, were not changed (1Kang Y.J. Chen Y. Yu A. Voss-McCowan M. Epstein P.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The results obtained from the present study demonstrate that MT undergoes disulfide bond formation under physiological conditions in the hearts of MT-TG mice. In response to DOX-induced oxidative stress, MT becomes more oxidized, recruiting more cysteine clusters to form additional disulfide bonds. Reagents—N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), iodoacetamide (IAA), dithiothreitol (DTT), protease inhibitors, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (adriamycin, DOX) were purchased from Sigma. Iodo-[14C]acetamide ([14C]IAA) and PD-10 desalting column were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma, or otherwise stated. Animals and DOX Treatment—The cardiac-specific MT-TG mice produced previously (1Kang Y.J. Chen Y. Yu A. Voss-McCowan M. Epstein P.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) were used in the present study. The MT-TG mice express human MT-IIa specifically in the heart. Mice were housed in plastic cages at 22 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle and provided free access to laboratory chow and tap water ad libitum. Mice of 8–10 weeks were randomly assigned to either the DOX treatment group or the control group. The DOX treatment group received 20 mg/kg DOX dissolved in physiological saline by a single intraperitoneal injection at a concentration of 4 mg/ml, and the control group received an equal volume of saline. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after the treatment, and the hearts were removed and processed immediately. All of the animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which is certified by the American Association of Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care. Sample Preparation—Immediately after removal from mice, the hearts were homogenized using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer by drilling for 10 strokes at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.0, containing freshly made NEM (10 mm) and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The buffer was degassed by sonication and nitrogen flushing for at least 30 min to minimize the possibility that disulfide bonds might form during homogenization and processing. The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Because MT is heat-resistant, the samples were incubated at 80 °C for 5 min and cooled on ice for 3 min. The heat-precipitated protein pellets were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatants containing MT were loaded onto PD-10 desalting columns. The eluates were treated with 5 mm DTT or phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min at 37 °C. All samples were then treated with [14C]IAA (5.2 dpm/pmol of a total 0.5 mm) and incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark. High Performance Liquid Chromatography Separation (HPLC)—The samples, prepared as described above, were concentrated with a Microcon YM-3 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and loaded onto a reversed-phase column (3.9 × 150 mm, Delta Pak 5μ C4, Waters, Milford, MA) equilibrated with eluent A (5% acetonitrile, water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Analysis was performed on a Beckman HPLC system (Beckman) consisting of a model 126 Programmable Solvent Module and a model 166 Programmable detector. Solvent programming, data collection, and analysis were accomplished using Beckman Nouveau Gold software. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–25% eluent B (95% acetonitrile, water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for 10 min, 25–50% B for 50 min, and 50–95% B for 15 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. All fractions were collected and subjected to scintillation counting for identifying [14C]carbamidomethylated fractions and to immunoassay for MT detection. SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, and Autoradiography—An aliquot of samples, prepared as described above, or dried HPLC fractions were dissolved in a non-reducing Western blot sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue), and were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. A Seeblue Prestained Protein Standard (Invitrogen) was used as molecular weight markers. Gels were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed for MT using a mouse anti-MT monoclonal antibody (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA) as primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) as secondary antibody, followed by chemiluminescent detection (ECL, Amersham). SDS-PAGE gels, performed in parallel, were electroblotted onto nitrocellular membranes. Autoradiography was performed by exposure of the membranes to Kodak BIO-MS films at –80 °C for 7 days. Trypsin Digestion—Bands on SDS-PAGE were excised from the gel, and the proteins were digested with 25 ng/μl sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega). Because all of the cysteine residues in the samples were previously alkylated, further reduction with DTT and alkylation with iodoacetamide was not performed. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis of Tryptic Peptides—Digests (1 μl) were mixed with 1 μlof α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, acetonitrile, 1:1, v/v). The mixture (1 μl) was deposited onto a fast evaporation nitrocellulose matrix surface, washed twice with 2 μl of 5% formic acid, and analyzed with a TofSpec 2E MALDI/TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in reflectron mode. The mass axis was adjusted using a trypsin autolysis peak (m/z 2211.10) as the lock mass. Data base search was performed to compare the monoisotopic peaks of the peptides with the theoretical molecular weights of peptides that were produced by digestion of the proteins in the Swiss-PROT data base. The maximum error allowed was set to 0.15 Da. Molecular Mass Determination of Alkylated MT—The molecular mass of alkylated MT, separated by reversed-phase HPLC, was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) using a Quattro LC mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The fractions from HPLC were dried and redissolved in a solution of water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (50:50:0.1, v/v/v)), and introduced into the mass spectrometer by direct injection at a flow rate of 0.5 μl/min. MassLynx software was used to obtain the molecular masses of proteins from their original mass spectra. ESI-MS/MS Analysis—Tandem MS/MS was performed on a Q-TOF API-US mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA). The parent ion was selectively isolated and fragmented to give a series of fragment ions. The identity of the peptide and NEM and IAA modifications of cysteine were determined from the fragmentation pattern produced by the collision-induced dissociation. Statistical Analysis—The data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences were tested by Student's t test and were considered to be significant when p < 0.05. A strategy of differential alkylation of cysteine residues in MT to identify disulfide bond formation in vivo was developed. A pH of 6.0 and nitrogen-flushed buffer was used for tissue homogenization immediately after removal of the heart, in the presence of NEM, to trap the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues that were not present as disulfide bonds. Then, after reduction of the disulfide bonds with DTT, radiolabeled IAA was used to alkylate the cysteine thiols. Because it has been shown that NEM thiol adducts of Zn-MT are reversible upon prolonged treatment (7.5 h) with mercaptoethanol (22Shaw III, C.F. He L. Munoz A. Savas M.M. Chi S. Fink C.L. Gan T. Petering D.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 65-73Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we conducted control experiments using 14C-labeled NEM to substantiate the differential alkylation strategy used in our sample preparation. MT-TG hearts were alkylated with [14C]NEM and the free label was removed by gel filtration. The MT-NEM adduct was then incubated with or without DTT under the conditions described under “Materials and Methods.” After removal of the DTT and unbound [14C]NEM by gel filtration, the MT fractions were analyzed for radioactivity. The results (data not shown) indicated an ∼3% loss of [14C]NEM after DTT treatment, suggesting that under the conditions used for differential alkylation in these experiments, the reversibility of NEM modification by DTT treatment was negligible. As shown in Fig. 1, when DTT was present, a significant incorporation of 14C was observed in both DOX-treated and control hearts, whereas no 14C incorporation was observed when DTT was absent, indicating the existence of disulfide bonds. Western blotting confirmed the identity of MT in the band of the corresponding molecular mass (Fig. 1), which was the only band observed in the presence or absence of DTT. This suggests that there are no detectable dimers or multimers of MT and that the disulfide bonds were apparently formed intramolecularly, although the possibility of mixed disulfides with low molecular weight thiols such as glutathione cannot be ruled out. Quantification of the autoradiographic results by densitometric scanning revealed that DOX treatment enhanced the formation of disulfide bonds by about 33%. To further characterize the nature of the MT disulfide bonds, the differentially alkylated MT preparations were separated by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) on a C4 column. Chromatograms were monitored at 214 nm and showed little difference between the DOX-treated and control samples (Fig. 2A). The variation from sample to sample was minor as well (data not shown). Immunoassay of all RP-HPLC fractions revealed that both DOX-treated and control samples had peaks corresponding to MT (Fig. 2B). The first MT-immunopositive peak showed considerable 14C incorporation, whereas the second peak had negligible 14C incorporation, indicating that MT was present in forms with and without disulfide bond(s). The different retention times of the two MT-related peaks may reflect differences in the polarity of the MT molecules because of differential alkylation. Samples from DOX-treated animals showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in 14C incorporation as shown in Fig. 2C. The two major MT-containing fractions separated by RP-HPLC were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify the nature of these modifications. Human MT-IIA has a metal-free molecular mass of 6042 Da. Modification of one cysteine residue by NEM will add 125.1 Da. It has been shown that MT-IIA is usually acetylated at the N-terminal, which adds an additional 42 Da. In the MT fraction containing no 14C incorporation (fraction 28), the most intense peak in the ESI-MS spectrum was at 8585 Da (Fig. 3). This agrees well with the molecular mass calculated for human MT-IIA derivatized with NEM at all 20 cysteine residues (Mr = 8586). To further confirm the identity of the NEM-modified MT in this fraction, mass spectral analysis was performed. Following trypsin digestion and mass analysis using MALDI-TOF/MS, seven peptide fragments were detected (Fig. 4A) and could be assigned to peptides derived from human MT-IIA with modification of all 20 cysteines by NEM. These fragments had mass errors ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 Da and covered 100% of the amino acid sequence (Table 1). This result indicates that all the cysteine residues in MT in the heart could be alkylated by NEM under the experimental conditions, and thus excluded the possibility of artifactual disulfide bond formation during the sample processing conducted in this study.FIGURE 4Mass spectra of tryptic fragments of the HPLC fractions 22 and 28 in Fig. 2.

Open table in a new tab HPLC fraction 22 was digested with trypsin and subjected to MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. Five individual experiments were performed and diverse mass profiles were obtained. A representative example is shown in Fig. 4B. Efficient digestion of MT by trypsin should generate eight peptides and one lysine, of which two peptides (amino acids 21–22 and 23–25) in MT and the lysine (31Nettesheim D.G. Engeseth H.R. Otvos J.D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) are too small to be assigned precisely by MALDI-TOF/MS. However, peptide masses covering the complete sequence of MT have been observed when trypsin miscuts were allowed. Table 2 shows all of the observed masses that were matched with tryptic peptides alkylated differentially by NEM and IAA in five experiments. Most of the peptides detected were in multiply modified forms, and the same cysteine residue could be modified by NEM or IAA among different experiments or in the same experiment. For example, the two cysteines in peptide 21–25 were both modified by NEM (Mr = 860.47) or IAA (Mr = 724.23). Similarly, peptides 21–30, 32–43, and 44–51 were observed in multiple modified forms. However, the N-terminal tryptic fragment 1–20 in the β-domain was only observed with all of its five cysteine residues modified by NEM. Other modifications were not detected. Moreover, this peptide was observed both in control and DOX-treated animals. This indicates that these five cysteine residues in the N-terminal are unlikely to be involved in disulfide bond formation, suggesting some resistance to oxidation. Only one form of peptide 57–61 was detected. Nevertheless, the alternative modifications of the same cysteine residue by either NEM or IAA among different experiments or in the same experiment undoubtedly reflect the dynamic nature of disulfide bond formation between the multiple cysteine residues in MT. The apparent rapid exchange among metal-bound and disulfide bonded cysteines precludes repeatedly capturing a single species. On the other hand, the most abundant peptide observed in all five experiments performed on control and DOX-treated hearts, was peptide 14 with a mass of 1064.49 Da, in which two of the three cysteine residues were involved in disulfide bond formation. Tandem MS/MS spectrometry allowed us to identify the specific cysteines involved in disulfide bond formation. The doubly charged ion of peptide 14, at m/z 533.3, was selected for sequencing. The product ion spectrum for this peptide is illustrated in Fig. 4C. Fragments b1, b2, and b3, which contain cysteine 44, are 57.0 Da larger than the calculated masses without alkylation, indicating that cysteine 44 was IAA-modified. Similarly, analysis of the y2 ion, which contains cysteine 50, shows it is 125.1 Da more than calculated without alkylation, indicating that cysteine 50 was alkylated by NEM. Further analyses of y4, y5, y6, and y7 ions, which contain cysteine 48 and cysteine 50, showed that they were 182.1 Da more than calculated without cysteine alkylation. Considering that cysteine 50 was shown above to be alkylated by NEM, thus cysteine 48 must be modified by IAA. Therefore, cysteine 44 and cysteine 48 were involved in disulfide bond formation.TABLE 2Masses of MT-IIA tryptic peptides observed in RP-HPLC fraction 22 (Fig. 2)PeptideaTryptic digestion fragments from MT-IIA.PositionbAmino acid sequence position.DomainCalculatedcMasses are the calculated monoisotopic masses for the sequences in the table.ErrordErrors are the largest difference between the calculated monoisotope masses and the masses detected in the samples in 5 experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2053295714,"We present a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study of K x C 60 monolayers on Au(111) for 3 ≤ x ≤ 4. The STM spectrum evolves from one that is characteristic of a metal at x = 3 to one that is characteristic of an insulator at x = 4. This electronic transition is accompanied by a dramatic structural rearrangement of the C 60 molecules. The Jahn-Teller effect, a charge-induced mechanical deformation of molecular structure, is directly visualized in the K 4 C 60 monolayer at the single-molecule level. These results, along with theoretical analyses, provide strong evidence that the transition from metal to insulator in K x C 60 monolayers is caused by the Jahn-Teller effect."

Most bacterial secretory proteins are synthesized with amino-terminal signal peptides and are exported through the Sec pathway. This process is best understood in Escherichia coli. The SecA ATPase subunit interacts with most of the components of the reaction, including the SecYEG membrane “channel,” chaperones, preprotein signal and mature domains, acidic phospholipids, and nucleotides. Preproteins bind to SecYEG-associated SecA with high affinity, and this interaction initiates cycles of ATP-driven SecA insertion and deinsertion at SecYEG (1Economou A. Wickner W.

However, where precisely on SecA preproteins bind and how they stimulate its ATPase remains unresolved. This central question must be answered before the molecular basis of SecA-dependent preprotein movement through translocase can be understood. The Stem and Bulb substructures have been indirectly implicated in preprotein binding (12Baud C. Karamanou S. Sianidis G. Vrontou E. Politou A.S. Economou A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13724-13731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Kimura E. Akita M. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated NBD fragments that also include the β1 strand (Fig. 1C) retain signal peptide binding of high affinity, whereas deletion of the β1 strand in SecA prevents signal peptide binding (12Baud C. Karamanou S. Sianidis G. Vrontou E. Politou A.S. Economou A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13724-13731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, this study could not conclusively determine whether signal peptide binding occurs on the Stem or whether the Stem is indirectly involved in binding. In another study, N-terminal SecA fragments that were refolded from inclusion bodies and included parts of the Bulb (aa 267-340) were cross-linked to a complete preprotein (24Kimura E. Akita M. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specificity of this reaction is unclear, since (a) cross-linking occurred only when SecA was partially “reconstituted” by mixing N-terminal fragments together with C-terminal peptides, and (b) the cross-linker used was nonspecific. Now we have investigated the functional role of the SecA domain that encompasses residues 221-377. We demonstrate that this domain is essential for cell viability, protein translocation, and preprotein-stimulated translocation ATPase. Moreover, we provide direct evidence that this region is essential for preprotein loading onto SecYEG-containing membranes and retains the ability to bind preproteins in solution even when detached from SecA. This region is therefore a preprotein-binding domain (PBD). Further, we show that PBD has two distinct domains with distinct subsites (Stem and Bulb) with discrete functional subsites. SecA binds signal peptide through the PBD Stem and mature regions through the PBD Bulb. These binding events influence PBD and DEAD motor conformation and subsequently DEAD motor ATP hydrolysis. We propose that PBD due to its strategic location acts as a physical and functional bridge between preproteins and the ATPase DEAD motor.

PBD Is Essential for SecA-dependent Translocation—To analyze the effect of PBD on SecA function, we used the following mutants of oligohistidinyl-tagged SecA (Fig. 1C): SecAΔ219-240, which lacks the Stemout (12Baud C. Karamanou S. Sianidis G. Vrontou E. Politou A.S. Economou A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13724-13731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Jarosik G.P. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); SecAΔ351-368, in which a 17-amino acid deletion removes the highly conserved helix 4 of Bulb 2 (13Jarosik G.P. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); SecAΔ233-365 (hereafter SecAΔBulb), which is missing the entire Bulb region but retains β1 and β7 of the Stem joined directly with a linker; and SecA(W349A), in which a highly conserved aromatic residue found in all SecA proteins is substituted by alanine. The ability of SecA PBD mutants carried on a plasmid to rescue the BL21.19 secAts strain (30Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) at 42 °C was examined (Fig. 1D). None of the deletion mutants could complement BL21.19 in vivo, whereas secA(W349A) could, albeit poorly. Purified SecA PBD mutant proteins are chromatographically stable, dimeric (supplemental Fig. 1) proteins and were tested for their ability to support ATP-dependent translocation of the model preprotein [35S]proOmpA into SecYEG-proteoliposomes (Fig. 1E). In agreement with the in vivo complementation test (Fig. 1D), SecA(W349A) (Fig. 1E, lane 8) retains some translocation activity compared with SecA (lane 3), whereas no translocation was detected with the deletion mutants (lanes 5-7). It became clear from the above results that PBD is essential for SecA-mediated protein translocation. To understand at which step of the translocation pathway the role of PBD is essential, we proceeded to characterize the effect of the mutations on each step of the reaction. SecA PBD Mutants Retain Nucleotide Binding and ATP Hydrolysis—To examine the effect of PBD on the ability of SecA to bind nucleotide, we determined the equilibrium binding constants of SecA mutants for nucleotide (TABLE ONE), using a MANT-ADP fluorescence-based assay (15Vrontou E.

This highly conserved threonine residue in a large number of the more than 5000 known P450s is proposed to be involved in stabilizing the oxy complex or hydroperoxy intermediate (17Nagano S. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31659-31663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In CYP101A1, it stabilizes the dioxygen complex by hydrogen bonding to the dioxygen itself (15Martinis S.A. Atkins W.M. Stayton P.S. Poulos T.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 20: 9252-9253Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and a water molecule within hydrogen-bonding distance from the dioxygen (16Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Proton transfer is thought to originate from the water molecule (15Martinis S.A. Atkins W.M. Stayton P.S. Poulos T.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 20: 9252-9253Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 16Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). However, CYP107A1 does not contain this conserved threonine but instead contains an Ala245 (18Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of the ferrous dioxygen complex of CYP107A1 suggests that the 5-hydroxyl group of the substrate 6-deoxyerythronolide B can directly donate a hydrogen bond to the iron-linked dioxygen for the proton transfer (19Nagano S. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22101-22107Google Scholar). cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence heteronuclear multiple bond coherence kinetic solvent isotope effect. We reported the crystal structure of CYP158A2 containing two substrate molecules of flaviolin in the active site (7Zhao B. Guengerich F.P. Bellamine A. Lamb D.C. Izumikawa M. Lei L. Podust L.M. Sundaramoorthy M. Reddy L.M. Kelly S.L. Kalaitzis J.A. Stec D. Voehler M. Falck J.R. Moore B.S. Shimada T. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11599-11607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This crystal structure complex suggested that the flaviolin 2-OH might be responsible for anchoring substrate to the enzyme and the 5-OH and/or 7-OH may stabilize catalytically important water molecules. Three water molecules (WAT505, WAT600, and WAT640) in the vicinity of the two flaviolin molecules may have both a structural as well as a functional role in dioxygen binding and/or proton transfer for oxygen activation. Interestingly, in CYP158A2 the residue position of the conserved threonine in the I-helix is also occupied by Ala245 as observed in the CYP107A1 (18Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In CYP107A1 the postulated crucial catalytic water molecule (WAT519) present in the ferric enzyme is absent in the ferrous dioxygen complex (19Nagano S. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22101-22107Google Scholar). To explore the unique features of the CYP158A2 proton transfer system, we determined the catalytic activity of the substrate flaviolin analogue lacking 5- and 7-hydroxyl groups (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (2-OH NQ)) and solved the ferric crystal structure of a CYP158A2·2-OH NQ complex at 2.15 Å. We measured the kinetics of formation and decay of the CYP158A2 ferrous dioxygen complex in the presence of flaviolin as well as 2-OH NQ and subsequently obtained the structure of the ferrous dioxygen-bound complex with flaviolin at 1.8 Å. The crystal structures of the different CYP158A2 complexes, combined with biochemical data, indicate that substrate hydroxyl groups stabilize a well ordered water chain from the active site to the protein surface providing a novel path for proton transfer and dioxygen scission. Protein Purification and Assays—CYP158A2 and Escherichia coli flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase were expressed and purified as reported earlier (7Zhao B. Guengerich F.P. Bellamine A. Lamb D.C. Izumikawa M. Lei L. Podust L.M. Sundaramoorthy M. Reddy L.M. Kelly S.L. Kalaitzis J.A. Stec D. Voehler M. Falck J.R. Moore B.S. Shimada T. Waterman M.R. J. Biol.

Binding and catalytic activity assays and NMR spectral analysis with 2-OH NQ were carried out as described previously with flaviolin (7Zhao B. Guengerich F.P. Bellamine A. Lamb D.C. Izumikawa M. Lei L. Podust L.M. Sundaramoorthy M. Reddy L.M. Kelly S.L. Kalaitzis J.A. Stec D. Voehler M. Falck J.R. Moore B.S. Shimada T. Waterman M.R. J. Biol.

Absorbance spectra were recorded using a double-beam Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer or a modified Cary 14/OLIS instrument (OLIS, Bogart, GA). CYP158A2 (5 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl was divided between two tandem cuvettes. After thermal equilibration at 25 °C a baseline was established between 350 and 450 nm, and sequential additions (2 μl) of concentrated 2-OH NQ (15 mm stock, dissolved in methanol) were added to the sample cuvette to give a final ligand concentration in the range of 30-180 μm. An equal volume of methanol was added to the reference cuvette, and the difference spectrum was recorded after each titration. For activity assays, CYP158A2 (3 nmol), flavodoxin (20 nmol), and flavodoxin reductase (10 nmol) were reconstituted in 400 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 2-OH NQ (150 nmol). The reaction was started by the addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 5 mm and was conducted for 2 h in a 1.5-ml tube, at which time the reaction was quenched with 4 μl of concentrated HCl and extracted three times with 400 μl of ethyl acetate. The extracts were combined and dried under a stream of N2, the residues were dissolved in 50 μl of methanol, and 20 μl of this extract was injected onto an HPLC/MS system for analysis. UV light detection was at 254 nm. Negative control incubations (minus CYP158A2) were carried out as described above. For HPLC/MS analysis, electrospray ionization mass spectra were obtained using a Finnigan TSQ Quantum mass spectrometer (Thermo, Sunnyvale, CA) in the positive ion mode. HPLC separations were achieved using a YMC™ ODS-AQ 2.0 mm × 250 mm reversed-phase octadecylsilane column (Waters, Milford, MA) with a linear solvent gradient from 90% solvent A (0.5% formic acid, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in water, v/v) to 100% solvent B (0.5% formic acid, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile, v/v) over 20 min, followed by isocratic elution with solvent B for 10 min, at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 500 AVANCE spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA) operating at a proton frequency of 500.13 MHz and carbon frequency of 125.77 MHz. Samples were prepared in acetone-d6. 1H and 13C chemical shifts are reported as δ values with reference to acetone-d6 at 2.04 and 206 ppm, respectively. All measurements were run at 25 °C using standard pulse sequences. Two-dimensional techniques (1H-13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC)) were also used for structure elucidations. Spectral and Kinetic Analyses of CYP158A2 Ferrous Dioxygen Complex—CYP158A2 (6.7-9.5 μm) was mixed with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 10 mm EDTA, 1.0 μm 5-deazaflavin, and either 25 μm flaviolin or 375 μm 2-OH NQ, in a final volume of 7.0 ml in an all-glass tonometer, fitted with a sidearm attached to a cuvette for optical measurements. The contents were deaerated by >12 cycles of mild vacuum/argon using a manifold attached to a gas train, with prepurified argon passed through two Oxy-Trap devices attached in tandem (Alltech, Deerfield, IL). Spectra of the ferric complexes were recorded in the cuvette, and the P450 (in the body of the tonometer) was reduced with sequential 2-min exposures (4Caffrey P. Lynch S. Flood E. Finnan S. Oliynyk M. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Graziani E.I. Cane D.E. Betlach M.C. Kealey J.T. McDaniel R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 3117-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to a visible lamp until reduction was complete, as judged by the spectral changes (Cary 14-OLIS). When reduction was complete, the contents of the tonometer were introduced into one of the drive syringes of an OLIS RSM-1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer, which had been scrubbed with Na2S2O4 (overnight), subsequently with anaerobic buffer containing a reduced safranine T/methyl viologen mixture, and finally with anaerobic 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (22Guengerich F.P.

Chem. 2005; 280: 12279-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The other syringe contained an aerated solution of the same substrate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Equal amounts of the contents of the two syringes were mixed (23 °C), and the reaction was observed in the rapid monochromator-scanning mode (either 62 or 1000 scans s-1, depending on the reaction time). The absorbance spectra were used to select individual wavelengths for kinetic analysis, i.e. fitting to pseudo-first order kinetic plots for the formation and decay of the FeO22+ complex. Kinetic Solvent Isotope Assay—Buffer solutions were prepared by lyophilizing Tris-HCl buffers and then dissolving the dry residue in D2O or H2O. Reaction mixtures contained CYP158A2 (1 nmol), flavodoxin (20 nmol), and flavodoxin reductase (10 nmol) and flaviolin (260 nmol) in a total volume of 400 μl of freshly prepared various H2O/D2O mixtures of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol. The turnover rate constants for flaviolin oxidation, and the rates of formation of each product were analyzed using a nonlinear regression analysis described by Vidakovic et al. (24Vidakovic M. Sligar S.G. Li H. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9211-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The pD of the buffer was determined using the equation pH = pD + 0.4 (25Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. Freeman, San Francisco1979: 121-123Google Scholar, 26Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Emzymology. McGraw-Hill, New York1969: 243-281Google Scholar). The pH effect control incubations with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.1) in H2O alone were carried out as above. Crystallization—Crystals of CYP158A2 were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method as described previously (7Zhao B. Guengerich F.P. Bellamine A. Lamb D.C. Izumikawa M. Lei L. Podust L.M. Sundaramoorthy M. Reddy L.M. Kelly S.L. Kalaitzis J.A. Stec D. Voehler M. Falck J.R. Moore B.S. Shimada T. Waterman M.R. J. Biol.

At 20 °C, the ferric flaviolin-bound crystals appeared within a few days; for 2-OH NQ crystals, the substrate flaviolin was replaced in the protein solution by 2 mm 2-OH NQ. Preparation of the Ferrous Dioxygen-bound Complex—The procedure for preparation of the ferrous dioxygen-bound complex was described by Nagano et al. (19Nagano S. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22101-22107Google Scholar). CYP158A2 ferric flaviolin-bound crystals were transferred into cryobuffer (50 mm bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 1 mm flaviolin, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 20% glycerol, v/v), washed for 5 min, and then reduced with 1-5 mm sodium dithionite under anaerobic conditions (N2) in a glove box (Fisher, Vernon Hills, IL). The crystals were kept in the dithionite solution for another 5 min. After reduction, crystals were washed thoroughly by transfer sequentially into three fresh drops in deoxygenated cryobuffer for 10 min in the glove box. The reduced crystals were transferred to the oxygen saturated cryobuffer (atmospheric conditions) at -5 to -10 °C for 10 min. The crystals were cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature for x-ray analysis. Data Collection and Structure Determination—All diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-BM beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL. The x-ray data were processed and scaled with the HKL package programs HKL2000 (27Owtinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). The ferric 2-OH NQ-bound crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 55.8 Å, b = 69.24 Å, and c = 103.74 Å. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program CNS1.1 (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

The initial model was built in O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crysallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and refinement was performed using CNS1.1 (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

D. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4356) Google Scholar). For the ferrous dioxygen-bound complex of CYP158A2 with flaviolin, crystals also belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 55.0 Å, b = 70.94 Å, and c = 102.92 Å. The ferric flaviolin-bound complex (Protein Data Bank code 1T93) as an initial model was subjected to rigid body refinement followed by B-factor refinement and energy minimization using CNS1.1 (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). After this stage, the position and orientation of dioxygen was guided by both 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps. The dioxygen ligand was fit to the electron density using O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crysallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The Fe-O bond was restrained to be 1.9 Å using a force constant of 4.0 kcal/mol/Å2, whereas the Fe-O-O bond angle was restrained to 130° using a force constant of 3.5 kcal/mol/Å2. Final refinement statistics are given in TABLE ONE. The coordinates and associated structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession codes ferric 2-OH NQ complex, 2D0E, and ferrous dioxygen-bound complex, 2D09).TABLE ONEData collection and refinement statisticsFerric 2-OH NQ-bound complexFlaviolin ferrous dioxygen-bound complexData collection statistics Space groupP212121P212121 Wavelength (Å)1.0350.95 Total observations131,906194,245 Unique reflections21,59437,024 Completeness (%)96.1 (94)aValues for the highest resolution shell in parentheses97.1 (89) I/σ (I)21.3 (1.9)18.3 (2.6) Rmerge (%)10.0 (72)8.5 (35) Refinement statistics Resolution range (Å)10–2.1515–1.8 No. of reflections used in refinement20,33931,890 No. of water molecules185258 Protein atoms3,1333,104 Heme atoms4343 Ligand atoms26bTwo 2-OH NQ molecules30cTwo flaviolin molecules/2dDioxygen atoms Rwork/Rfree (%)22.6/28.123.2/23.9 Root mean square deviation in bond lengths (Å)0.0060.007 Root mean square deviation in bond angles (°)1.41.2a Values for the highest resolution shell in parenthesesb Two 2-OH NQ moleculesc Two flaviolin moleculesd Dioxygen atoms Open table in a new tab 2-OH NQ Binding and Activity—To identify the roles of substrate flaviolin hydroxyl groups and catalytic water molecules in the ferric flaviolin complex active site, 2-OH NQ was examined as a substrate analogue. 2-OH NQ produced a partial shift in the Soret band from 418 to 388 nm upon binding, indicating that 2-OH NQ can substitute for flaviolin in the active site (Fig. 1). The binding affinity constant (Kd) was estimated to be 43 μm, ∼6-fold higher than that found with flaviolin (Kd = 7.3 μm) (7Zhao B. Guengerich F.P. Bellamine A. Lamb D.C. Izumikawa M. Lei L.

Analysis of the reaction of CYP158A2 with 2-OH NQ by electrospray mass spectrometry indicated a single dimerization product with mass 346 (Fig. 2). The turnover number for this activity was estimated to be 0.02 min-1. The activity is ∼70 times less than with flaviolin (1.4 min-1) as substrate. These results suggest a role for the 5- and 7-hydroxyl groups of flaviolin in CYP158A2 catalysis.FIGURE 2Oxidation of 2-OH NQ by CYP158A2.

The dimer was clearly a symmetric structure as judged by its 1H NMR spectra, which showed two doublets at δ 8.08 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H, H-8/8′) and 8.04 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H, H-5/5′) and two triplets at δ 7.84 (t, J = 14.8 Hz, 2H, H-6/6′) and 7.78 (t, J = 14.8 Hz, 2H, H-7/7′). This structure was assigned as 3,3′-bi-2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (Fig. 2), which was further verified by analysis of the 1H-13C HMQC and 1H-13C HMBC spectra (see supplemental data). Kinetics of Formation and Decomposition of the Ferrous-Dioxygen Complex—The ferric form of CYP158A2 has absorbance maxima at 415, 527, and 567 nm, even in the presence of a saturating concentration of flaviolin (Fig. 3). Second-derivative spectroscopy (31O'Haver T.C. Green G.L. Anal. Chem. 1976; 48: 312-318Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 32Guengerich F.P.

When anaerobically reduced CYP158A2 (in the presence of 25 μm flaviolin) was mixed with air (∼100 μm O2 final concentration), a rapid change in the spectrum to the putative FeO22+ complex was observed (Fig. 4A), at a rate of ∼120 s-1 (at 23 °C) (Fig. 4B).

Most of the data obtained so far have been in experiments with endogenous Vpr protein; therefore the effects of extracellular Vpr protein remain largely unknown. We used synthetic Vpr protein to activate nuclear transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB in the promonocytic cell line U937 and in primary macrophages. Synthetic HIV-1 Vpr protein activated AP-1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and MKK7 in both U937 cells and primary macrophages. Synthetic Vpr activated NF-κB in primary macrophages and to a lesser extent in U937 cells. Because synthetic Vpr activated AP-1 and NF-κB, which bind to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, we investigated the effect of synthetic Vpr on HIV-1 replication. We observed that synthetic Vpr stimulated HIV-1 long terminal repeat in U937 cells and enhanced viral replication in chronically infected U1 promonocytic cells. Similarly, synthetic Vpr stimulated HIV-1 replication in acutely infected primary macrophages. Activation of transcription factors and enhancement of viral replication in U937 cells and primary macrophages were mediated by both the N-terminal and the C-terminal moieties of synthetic Vpr.

The vpr gene encodes a 14-kDa, 96-amino acid nonstructural protein that is expressed primarily from a singly spliced Rev-dependent mRNA during the late phase of the virus HIV 5The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency virusMΦmacrophagesAP-1activator protein-1IκBinhibitor of NF-κBJNKJun N-terminal kinaseNF-κBnuclear factor κBLTRlong terminal repeatTNFtumor necrosis factor αCBPcAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding proteinSEAPsecreted alkaline phosphatase.5The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency virusMΦmacrophagesAP-1activator protein-1IκBinhibitor of NF-κBJNKJun N-terminal kinaseNF-κBnuclear factor κBLTRlong terminal repeatTNFtumor necrosis factor αCBPcAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding proteinSEAPsecreted alkaline phosphatase. life cycle (1Cohen E.A.

Vpr shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and is incorporated into virions through a specific interaction with the p55Gag precursor (2Paxton W. Connor R.I. Landau N.R. J.

Although the open reading frame for Vpr is frequently lost in viruses adapted to passage in tissue culture, Vpr is highly conserved in primary isolates (4Goh W.C. Rogel M.E. Kinsey C.M. Michael S.F.

For example, Vpr plays a role in the nuclear transport of the preintegration complex in newly infected nondividing cells, such as macrophages (MΦ) (5Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S. Dempsey M.P. Sharova N.

Although this protein does not confer a significant viral growth advantage in primary T cells (28Dedera D. Hu W. Vander Heyden N. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3205-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its function is strictly required for viral replication in nondividing cells, such as monocytes/macrophages (3Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M.

However, positive effects of Vpr on HIV replication have been observed in a number of cell types as a result of its ability to delay infected cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, in which the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) is transcriptionally more active (4Goh W.C.

Vpr has been shown to associate as an adaptor with transcription factors (e.g. Sp1) or co-activators (e.g. p300/CBP), to activate the transcription factors NF-interleukin-6 and NF-κB and to induce interleukin-8 expression (20Vanitharani R.

The N terminus of Vpr including the first α-helical domain has been reported to promote nuclear import, to transactivate the HIV LTR, to be involved in virion packaging, to be important for Vpr oligomerization, and to localize both in the nucleus, especially in the nuclear membrane and, to a lesser extent, in the cytoplasm (34Jenkins Y.

Virology. 2002; 302: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).HIV replication is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level through the specific interaction of viral regulatory proteins, namely, Tat and cellular transcription factors binding to a variety of cis-acting DNA sequences in the HIV LTR (51Van Lint C. Amella C.A. Emiliani S. John M. Jie T. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6113-6127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the main mediators of HIV LTR transcription is NF-κB (52Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). As an inducible transcription factor, NF-κB is composed of homo- and heterodimers of Rel family proteins (53Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). All of them contain an N-terminal Rel homology domain, which mediates DNA binding, dimerization, and interaction with the inhibitory proteins, or IκBs. In addition, c-Rel, p65 (RelA), and RelB contain a C-terminal transactivation domain (53Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). The classical NF-κB complex (p50/p65) is sequestered in the cytoplasm by interaction with a family of inhibitory proteins, or IκBs, including IκBα, IκBβ, IκBϵ, IκBγ, and the proto-oncogene Bcl-3 (54Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). After cell activation by a variety of extracellular stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, IκBα is phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser-32 and Ser-36 residues by the IκB kinase complex, leading to ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation, which allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates gene expression. Since the identification of NF-κB elements in the HIV LTR (52Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar), multiple studies have assessed the effect of this family of transcription factors on the transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR and its impact on HIV reactivation from latency (55Finzi D. Hermankova M. Pierson T. Carruth L.M. Buck C. Chaisson R.E. Quinn T.C. Chadwick K. Margolick J. Brookmeyer R. Gallant J. Markowitz M. Ho D.D. Richman D.D. Siliciano R.F. Science. 1997; 278: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). Studies of the interaction between NF-κB and HIV in both human monocytic cells and transformed human MΦ have mainly focused on how monocyte differentiation may lead to HIV expression (56Griffin G.E. Leung K. Folks T.M. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and how HIV infection leads to NF-κB activation. In the promonocytic cell line U937, HIV activates the inducible pool of NF-κB as a result of enhanced IκBα degradation, which is believed to be secondary to IκB kinase activation (57Jacque J.M.

Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the activation of NF-κB is regulated by some upstream mitogen-activated protein kinases that also regulate JNK activation in the cells (59Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar).Extracellular Vpr protein has been detected in the sera and cerebral spinal fluid of HIV-infected subjects at levels similar to those of p24 antigen (50Sherman M.P.

Vpr has been shown to be efficiently taken up from the extracellular medium by cells in a process that occurs independently of other HIV-1 proteins and appears to be independent of cellular receptors (50Sherman M.P.

Confocal microscopy indicates that the intracellular distribution of internalized Vpr is identical to that of endogenously produced Vpr, localizing both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (41Kamata M.

Although most of the results reported so far in regard to signaling were obtained after expression of endogenous Vpr protein, extracellular Vpr protein could also be involved in the modulation of cell signaling, especially in promonocytic cells and in primary MΦ. Because activation of NF-κB and AP-1 results in stimulation of HIV-1 replication (57Jacque J.M. Fernandez B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thomas D. Baleux F. Virelizier J.L. Bachelerie F. J.

Anti-HIV-1 Vpr antibody was provided by Dr. Josephine Sire (INSERM U372, Marseille, France). Antibody against phospho-IκBα (Ser-32) and phospho-MKK7 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The antibody against β-actin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (A1978, clone AC15). The antibodies anti-p50 (C19, catalogue #sc109X), anti-p65 (AX, catalogue #sc52X), anti-RelB (C19, catalogue #sc226X), anti-c-Rel (B6, catalogue #sc1190X), anti-p52 (C5, catalogue #sc6955X), anti-c-fos (4, catalogue #sc44X), and anti-c-Jun (D, catalogue #sc52X) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The double-stranded oligonucleotide having the AP-1 and NF-κB consensus sequence were obtained from Eurobio (Courtaboeuf, France). TNF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).Cell Lines and Primary MΦ—Most of the studies were performed with the promonocytic cells U937 obtained from the American Tissue Cell Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The promonocytic cell line U1, derived from cells surviving acute infection of the U937 cell line, contains two integrated HIV copies per cell (69Folks T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Schnittman S. Orenstein J. Poli G. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1117-1122PubMed Google Scholar). U1 cells were a gift from Dr. U. Mahlknecht (University of Heidelberg, Germany). U937 and U1 cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from peripheral blood of healthy donors as previously described (70Herbein G. Gordon S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4150-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ficoll-Hypaque (Eurobio)-isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated for 2 h on plastic. Adherent differentiated MΦ (>94% CD14+ by flow cytometric analysis) were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) pooled human serum (kindly provided by the Etablissement Français du Sang Bourgogne Franche-Comté, France) as previously reported (71Mahlknecht U.

To measure AP-1 activation, nuclear extracts, prepared as described above, were incubated with 32P-end-labeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (bold indicates the AP-1-binding site) and analyzed on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The specificity of binding was examined by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide, with a heterologous unlabeled oligonucleotide (5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′), with a consensus unlabeled oligonucleotide (5′-TCTGTTGTGGACTCTG-3′), and with a mutated AP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-CGCTTGATGACTTGGCCGGAA-3′) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To determine ATF2 activation, we used the Nufshift™ ATF2 kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium). Nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 23-mer double-stranded ATF2 oligonucleotide, 5′-GATTCAATGACATCACGGCTGTG-3′ (bold indicates ATF2-binding sites). The specificity of the binding was examined by competition with a mutated unlabeled oligonucleotide, 5′-GATTCAAGAACATAGCGGCTGTG-3′. The DNA-protein complex formed was analyzed on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel.

After 24 h, cell culture conditioned medium was harvested and analyzed for alkaline phosphatase activity, as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). SEAP activity was assayed on a 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates suitable for plate luminometers (Victor Wallac2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). This reporter system was specific since TNF-induced NF-κB SEAP activity was inhibited by overexpression of the IκBα mutant, IκBα-DN, which lacks Ser-32 and Ser-36 (72Varin A. Manna S.K. Quivy V.

A replica of the ProPEc C terminus (Asp468–Arg497) forms an intermolecular α-helical coiled-coil. This structure is implicated in the osmoregulation of intact ProPEc, in vivo. Like that from Corynebacterium glutamicum (ProPCg), the ProP orthologue from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (ProPAt) sensed and responded to extracellular osmolality after expression in E. coli. The osmotic activation profiles of all three orthologues depended on the osmolality of the bacterial growth medium, the osmolality required for activation rising as the growth osmolality approached 0.7 mol/kg. Thus, each could undergo osmotic adaptation. The proportion of cardiolipin in a polar lipid extract from E. coli increased with extracellular osmolality so that the osmolality activating ProPEc was a direct function of membrane cardiolipin content. Group A ProP orthologues (ProPEc, ProPAt) share the C-terminal coiled-coil domain and were activated at low osmolalities. Like variant ProPEc-R488I, in which the C-terminal coiled-coil is disrupted, ProPEc derivatives that lack the coiled-coil and Group B orthologue ProPCg required a higher osmolality to activate. The amplitude of ProPEc activation was reduced 10-fold in its deletion derivatives. The coiled-coil structure is not essential for osmotic activation of ProP per se. However, it tunes Group A orthologues to osmoregulate over a low osmolality range. Coiled-coil lesions may impair both coiled-coil formation and interaction of ProPEc with amplifier protein ProQ.

Crane R.A. Culham D.E. Richmond D. Wood J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ProQ is a basic, cytoplasmic protein that may act directly or indirectly on ProPEc (17Smith M.N. Crane R.A. Keates R.A.B. Wood J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12979-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The central cytoplasmic loop (C3) and C terminus of ProPEc are longer than those of its paralogues (7Poolman B.

The latter terminates in six or seven of the heptad repeats that characterize α-helical coiled-coil-forming proteins (11Culham D.E. Lasby B. Marangoni A.G. Milner J.L. Steer B.A. van Nues R.W.

Biol. 2003; 334: 1063-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) of ProPEc showed that residues 468–497 (encompassing four heptads) form an antiparallel, homodimeric α-helical coiled-coil of low stability (Fig. 1, B and C). The low stability of this structure was expected, because basic residues are present at core heptad “a” positions His495 and Arg488 (11Culham D.E. Lasby B. Marangoni A.G. Milner J.L. Steer B.A. van Nues R.W. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Unexpectedly, replacement R488I disrupted coiled-coil formation by this peptide replica, providing the first evidence that the orientation of the coiled-coil might be antiparallel (18Culham D.E. Tripet B. Racher K.I. Voegele R.T. Hodges R.S. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Recog. 2000; 13: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The antiparallel orientation was substantiated by the NMR solution structure, which appears to be stabilized by interactions of Arg488 with Asp475 and Asp478 on the opposing monomer strand (Fig. 1B) (20Zoetewey D.L. Tripet B.P. Kutateladze T.G. Overduin M.J. Wood J.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 1063-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This antiparallel structure was also detected in intact ProPEc, in vivo, by chemical cross-linking of introduced Cys residues (21Hillar A. Culham D.E. Ya Vernikovska Wood I. Boggs J.M.J.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10170-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A higher osmolality was required to activate the R488I variant than wild type ProPEc, and the R488I variant was activated only transiently, whereas activation of wild type ProPEc was sustained indefinitely (18Culham D.E. Tripet B. Racher K.I. Voegele R.T. Hodges R.S. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Recog. 2000; 13: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the C-terminal coiled-coil of ProPEc plays a role in its osmotic activation. Amino acid sequence comparisons reveal two groups of bacterial ProP orthologues. All have longer C termini than ProP paralogues with known functions not related to osmosensing or osmoregulation (e.g. ShiA and KgtP) (7Poolman B. Spitzer J.J. Wood J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 88-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Group A orthologues (typified by ProPEc) include a C-terminal α-helical coiled-coil domain and Group B orthologues (typified by C. glutamicum ProP (ProPCg)) do not. The coiled-coil domain unique to Group A orthologues is not essential for osmosensing, since ProPCg was found to act as an osmosensor and osmoregulator after expression in E. coli (22Peter H. Weil B. Burkovski A. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6005-6012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial aim of this study was to further elucidate the role of the C-terminal coiled-coil in the osmoregulation of ProP activity. Here we show that the coiled-coil structure shared by Group A ProP orthologues tunes the transporter so that it can be activated in media of low osmolality. We have also discovered that the osmolality required to activate ProPEc in vivo is modulated by the osmolality at which E. coli is cultured. This osmotic adaptation, which correlates with changing membrane cardiolipin (CL) content, ensures that ProP is poised to respond to ambient osmotic conditions. Thus, both the coiled-coil domain shared by Group A orthologues and the membrane cardiolipin content are involved in tuning the functional response range of ProP. Culture Media—E. coli strains were cultivated at 37 °C, whereas the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain was cultivated at 30 °C, in LB medium (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. 1972; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar) or in NaCl-free MOPS medium, a variant of the MOPS medium described by Neidhardt et al. (24Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), from which all NaCl was omitted. MOPS medium was supplemented with NH4Cl (9.5 mm) as a nitrogen source and glycerol (0.4% v/v) as a carbon source. l-Tryptophan (245 μm) and thiamine hydrochloride (1 μg/ml) were added to meet auxotrophic requirements, and NaCl or sucrose was added to adjust the osmolality as indicated. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was included to maintain plasmids, and arabinose was added as specified to adjust ProP expression.

Oligonucleotides were purchased from Cortec DNA Services (Kingston, Canada). Each recombinant plasmid was recovered from a ligation mixture by transformation of E. coli DH5α (29Hanahan D. J. Mol.

Genes encoding ProP and its variants were expressed from the AraC-controlled PBAD promoter in plasmid-bearing derivatives of E. coli WG350 (F- trp lacZ rpsL thi Δ(putPA)101 Δ(proU)600 Δ(proP-melAB)212) (11Culham D.E.

Isolation of Genes proPCg and proPAt—A BglII site overlapping the proPEc stop codon in pDC79 was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis, the resulting plasmid (pYT6) was cleaved with EcoRI and BglII to excise proPEc, and the vector fragment was purified. The gene encoding ProPCg was PCR-amplified using plasmid pHP5 (22Peter H. Weil B. Burkovski A. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6005-6012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template, and the gene encoding the putative Group A ProP orthologue from A. tumefaciens (ProPAt) was PCR-amplified using the linear chromosome of A. tumefaciens C58 (ATCC number 33970) (American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA)) as template. During amplification, an EcoRI site was introduced 5′ to each open reading frame, and a BglII restriction site was introduced overlapping the stop codon. Each PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BglII, purified, mixed with the vector fragment of pYT6, and ligated with T4 DNA ligase to create plasmids pYT12 (encoding ProPCg) and pYT13 (encoding ProPAt). C-terminal Truncation of ProPEc—The proPEc gene encoded by pYT1 was PCR-amplified so that the introduced EcoRI site 5′ to the open reading frame was included, and a stop codon, with an overlapping BglII site, was introduced after the codon for Ala482 or Thr489. The resulting PCR products and plasmid pYT6 were cleaved with EcoRI and BglII. The desired DNA fragments were purified, mixed, and ligated, creating plasmids pMD2 (encoding His6-ProPEc-Δ11, truncated at Ala482) and pMD3 (encoding His6-ProPEc-Δ18, ProPEc truncated at Thr489).

Osmolalities of culture media and buffers were adjusted with NaCl or sucrose, as specified, and measured with a Wescor vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Logan, UT). Initial rates of proline uptake were measured using l-[U-14C]proline (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.2 mm. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (34Smith P.K. Krohn R.I.

All assays were done in triplicate, and all experiments were performed at least twice. The rates are cited as mean ± S.D. Regression lines were obtained by fitting the data to empirical Equation 1 (10Culham D.E. Henderson J. Crane R.A. Wood J.M.

This process yielded estimates for parameters Amax, Π½/RT, and B.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7324-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as described by Racher et al. (4Racher K.I. Voegele R.T. Marshall E.V. Culham D.E. Wood J.M. Jung H. Bacon M. Cairns M.T.

Base pairs 1318–1500 of proPEc (encoding ProPEc (Glu440–Glu500)) were PCR amplified using primers that created flanking BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. The primers were designed to facilitate insertion of the resulting oligonucleotide in vector pQE82L (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), fusing the proP-derived open reading frame to the upstream vector sequence encoding the MRGSH6 tag (32Khambati J. Does the Coiled-coil Domain of ProP of Escherichia coli Mediate Osmoregulation via Protein-Protein Interaction?. 2003; (M.Sc. thesis, University of Guelph)Google Scholar). The amplicon and vector were cleaved, purified, mixed, and ligated, and recombinant plasmids were recovered. A primer-encoded mutation (P496T) was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis, yielding the desired plasmid (pJKK2) (32Khambati J. Does the Coiled-coil Domain of ProP of Escherichia coli Mediate Osmoregulation via Protein-Protein Interaction?. 2003; (M.Sc. thesis, University of Guelph)Google Scholar), which was introduced to E. coli MG1655 (35Blattner F.R.

Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6025) Google Scholar) to create E. coli WG864. To produce peptide MRGSH6-ProPEc (Glu440–Glu500), E. coli WG864 was cultivated in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside (final concentration 1 mm) was added at a culture A600 of 0.5–0.6, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation when the A600 reached 2. The resulting pellet was washed twice with 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm Na-EDTA, pH 8) per g, wet weight. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were disrupted by two passages through a French pressure cell (AMINCO, Silver Spring, MD) at 1600 bars pressure. The lysate was centrifuged in the Sorvall SS34 rotor at 12,100 × g for 20 min and then in the Beckman Ti45 rotor at 100,000 × g for 2 h. MRGSH6-ProPEc (Glu440–Glu500) was purified from the resulting supernatant by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions for protein purification under nondenaturing conditions. It was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex-75 HR 10/30 column and an Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography component system. The resulting 8.5-kDa peptide was homogeneous as determined by Tricine SDS-PAGE (36Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar). Western Immunoblotting Analysis—Whole cell proteins were prepared for Western Immunoblotting, and it was performed as described above (see “Transport Assays”) and by Culham et al. (18Culham D.E. Tripet B. Racher K.I. Voegele R.T. Hodges R.S. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Recog. 2000; 13: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), using the procedure of Towbin et al. (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) and selective anti-ProP antibodies, prepared as follows. Anti-ProP antibodies were recovered from 4 ml of adsorbed anti-ProP serum (4Racher K.I. Voegele R.T. Marshall E.V. Culham D.E. Wood J.M. Jung H. Bacon M. Cairns M.T. Ferguson S.M. Liang W Henderson J. White P.J.F. Hallett G.F.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1676-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) by affinity purification as described by Salamitou et al. (38Salamitou S. Lemaire M. Fujino T. Ohayon H. Gounon P. Beguin P. Aubert J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2828-2834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using ProP-His6 (0.3 mg) as ligand. Peptide MRG-SHis6-ProPEc (Glu440–Glu500) (0.6 mg) was bound to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (0.2 ml; Qiagen Inc.) in lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole and no EDTA. The loaded resin was recovered in a Micro Bio-Spin chromatography column (Bio-Rad), establishing a 0.1-ml column bed. The purified anti-ProP (1 ml) was added to the column, mixed with the resin by pipetting, transferred to a 2-ml vial, and incubated at 20 °C, shaking, for 60 min. It was transferred back to the chromatography column, and the column flow-through was collected as selective anti-ProP. The recovered antibodies recognized full-length ProPEc but not MRGSH6-ProPEc (Glu440–Glu500) on a Western blot. Determination of Phospholipid Head Group Composition—E. coli cells expressing ProPEc (strain WG350 pDC79) were grown as described above (see “Transport Assays”) in MOPS medium supplemented with [32P]phosphate at 5 μCi/ml. Polar lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol, and thin layer chromatography was performed as described by Wikstrom et al. (39Wikstrom M. Xie J. Bogdanov M. Mileykovskaya E. Heacock P. Wieslander A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10484-10493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of the lipid species, identified by comparison with standards, were determined with a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. Osmotic Adaptation of ProPEc—We previously reported that the transport assay medium osmolality required to activate ProPEc-His6 was independent of the osmolality of the medium in which E. coli was grown (NaCl-supplemented MOPS media with osmolalities in the range 0.12–0.32 mol/kg; Fig. 1B of Ref. 10Culham D.E. Henderson J. Crane R.A. Wood J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 410-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A more complex picture emerged when the bacteria were grown at higher osmolalities (up to 0.7 mol/kg). For cells grown in the higher osmolality range, the osmolality required to activate ProPEc depended on the osmolalities of both the growth medium and the assay medium (Fig. 2). The response of ProPEc to assay medium osmolality fits an empirical relationship (see “Experimental Procedures”) that supports extraction of parameters quantitatively describing its osmotic activation (10Culham D.E. Henderson J. Crane R.A. Wood J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 410-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Measurements of the initial rate of proline uptake (a0) as a function of osmolality (Π/RT) are used to determine the uptake rate that would be observed at infinite osmolality (Amax), the osmolality yielding half-maximal activity (π½/RT), and the slope of the activation curve (inversely proportional to parameter B). Such analysis showed that, for bacteria grown in NaCl-supplemented MOPS media, the osmolality required to activate ProPEc and parameter B were direct functions of growth medium osmolality (Fig. 3, circles) whereas the ProPEc activity attained upon full osmotic activation (Amax) was not (Fig. 2). To determine whether growth medium salinity or osmolality determined the osmolality at which ProPEc would activate, cells expressing ProPEc were grown in a sucrose-supplemented, high osmolality medium (0.72 mol/kg). A higher osmolality was required to activate ProPEc in cells grown in this sucrose-supplemented medium than in those grown without added osmolyte (Fig. 2, inset). Furthermore, the assay medium osmolalities yielding half maximal ProPEc activity (Π½/RT) and the slopes of the activation curves (indicated by B) were similar for cells cultivated in NaCl- and sucrose-supplemented media of similar osmolality (compare circles and triangles in Fig. 3). An osmotic adaptation process appeared to modulate the osmosensory range of ProPEc so that its activity would vary over an osmolality range relevant to ambient conditions. Osmotic Activation and Adaptation of ProP Orthologues—Two groups of ProP orthologues are found in bacteria, all with extended C termini (7Poolman B. Spitzer J.J. Wood J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 88-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Group A orthologues, typified by ProPEc, include a C-terminal α-helical coiled-coil domain, and Group B orthologues, typified by ProPCg, do not (Fig. 1C). Putative Group A orthologue ProPAt and Group B orthologue ProPCg were expressed in E. coli, and their osmotic activation profiles were examined to determine whether the ability to undergo osmotic adaptation was correlated with the structure of the C-terminal domain. To assess the function and osmotic sensitivity of ProPAt, E. coli cells in which that transporter was expressed from plasmid vector pBAD24 were cultivated, harvested, and resuspended in low osmolality medium (0.14 mol/kg). Proline uptake rates of these bacteria increased substantially from base line levels as the assay medium osmolality approached 0.51 mol/kg (0.2 m NaCl) (data not shown), with a maximum proline uptake rate of 5.6 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein. This suggested an osmotic response for ProPAt, although the absolute activity observed was low. Arabinose was used to induce ProPAt expression so that its activity could be more directly compared with that of ProPEc. The proline uptake rate increased with increasing arabinose concentration, as expected, and a rate of 67 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein (comparable with the activity of ProPEc without arabinose induction) was achieved at an arabinose concentration of 0.4 mm (data not shown). When the impact of osmolality on ProPAt activity was again determined after such arabinose induction, the resulting activity profile was similar to that of ProPEc (Fig. 4A). To determine whether ProPAt would undergo"
https://openalex.org/W2162593372,"Resistin and resistin-like molecules (RELMs) are a family of proteins reportedly related to insulin resistance and inflammation. Because the serum concentration and intestinal expression level of RELMβ were elevated in insulin-resistant rodent models, in this study we investigated the effect of RELMβ on insulin signaling and metabolism using transgenic mice and primary cultured hepatocytes. First, transgenic mice with hepatic RELMβ overexpression were shown to exhibit significant hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and pancreatic islet enlargement when fed a high fat diet. Hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp showed a decreased glucose infusion rate due to increased hepatic glucose production. In addition, the expression levels of IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins as well as the degrees of insulin-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt activations were attenuated in RELMβ transgenic mice. Similar down-regulations of IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins were observed in primary cultured hepatocytes chronically treated (for 24 h) with RELMβ, suggesting the insulin resistance-inducing effect of RELMβ to be direct. Furthermore, it was shown that RELMβ acutely and markedly activates ERK and p38, while weakly activating JNK, in primary cultured hepatocytes. This increased basal p38 phosphorylation level was also observed in the livers of RELMβ transgenic mice. In conclusion, RELMβ, a gut-derived hormone, impairs insulin signaling probably via the activations of classic MAPKs, and increased expression of RELMβ may be involved in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia in some insulin-resistant models. Thus, RELMβ is a potentially useful marker for assessing insulin resistance and may also be a target for future novel anti-diabetic agents.

Thus, RELMβ is a potentially useful marker for assessing insulin resistance and may also be a target for future novel anti-diabetic agents. Insulin resistance is a major cause of type 2 diabetes, and recent studies have revealed many independent mechanisms regulating insulin sensitivity. Among them, much attention has been paid to the roles of secreted proteins in insulin resistance. Resistin (also known as FIZZ3 ADSF, mXCP4, or hXCP1) was identified as a factor that is secreted by adipocytes and causes insulin resistance (1Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar). This finding was supported by not only in vitro experiments using cultured cells but also animal experiments, i.e. mice with adenoviral resistin expression, infusion of recombinant resistin, the use of neutralizing antibody, or by generating resistin gene knock-out mice (2Kim K.H. Lee K. Moon Y.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 3Moon B. Kwan J.J. Duddy N. Sweeney G. Begum N. Am. J.

Invest. 2004; 114: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, some clinical studies have failed to demonstrate a close relationship between obesity or insulin resistance and the serum resistin concentration in humans (7Fehmann H.C. Heyn J. Horm. Metab. Res. 2002; 34: 671-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Lee J.H. Chan J.L. Yiannakouris N. Kontogianni M. Estrada E. Seip R. Orlova C. Mantzoros C.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 4848-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Thus, while resistin apparently induces insulin resistance, the involvement of resistin in the pathogenesis of human diabetes and obesity remains unclear. On the other hand, there are three resistin-related proteins, termed RELMα 2The abbreviations used are: RELMresistin-like moleculeMAPKmitogen-activate protein kinaseIRSinsulin receptor substrateSAPKstress-activated protein kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinase2DG2-deoxy-d-glucosePIphosphatidylinositolSAPserum amyloid PPPARαperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. (resistin-like molecule, FIZZ1, or mXCP2), β (FIZZ2, mXCP3, or hXCP2), and γ (mXCP1) (9Steppan C.M. Brown E.J. Wright C.M. Bhat S. Banerjee R.R. Dai C.Y. Enders G.H. Silberg D.G. Wen X. Wu G.D. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). RELMα is expressed in white adipose tissue, the lung, tongue and bone marrow, whereas the expression of RELMβ is strictly limited to the small and large intestines, especially goblet cells. Although RELMγ is expressed in mouse spleen, bone marrow, intestines, and a variety of other tissues, corresponding to each developmental stage depending on CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-ϵ (10Chumakov A.M. Kubota T. Walter S. Koeffler H.P. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3414-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), its human homolog has not been identified. These proteins contain a highly conserved cysteine-rich C terminus (Cys-X11-Cys-X8-Cys-X-Cys-X2-Cys-X10-Cys-X-Cys-X-Cys-X9-Cys-Cys) and a signal peptide sequence at their N termini, as observed in resistin. Assuming that they have biological activities similar to that of resistin, these RELMs and resistin are considered to be equally important for the regulation of insulin sensitivity. Indeed, it was reported that injecting mice with either resistin or RELMβ induced insulin resistance (11Rajala M.W. Obici S. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In addition, we found the intestinal expression and serum concentration of RELMβ to be increased in insulin resistant models such as high fat fed and db/db mice (12Shojima N. Ogihara T. Inukai K. Fujishiro M. Sakoda H. Kushiyama A. Katagiri H. Anai M. Ono H. Fukushima Y. Horike N. Viana A.Y. Uchijima Y. Kurihara H. Asano T. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 984-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that the inflammatory state of the intestine, overeating, bowel movements, and/or nutrient absorption might regulate the intestinal expression and serum level of RELMβ and thereby regulate whole-body insulin sensitivity. resistin-like molecule mitogen-activate protein kinase insulin receptor substrate stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2-deoxy-d-glucose phosphatidylinositol serum amyloid P peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Herein, to examine chronic effects of the elevated serum RELMβ observed under insulin-resistant conditions such as a high fat diet and in db/db mice, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing RELMβ and analyzed their metabolic profiles relating to insulin resistance and changes in the insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, to investigate the physiological significance of elevated serum RELMβ, we investigated the effects of RELMβ on insulin signaling using primary cultured hepatocytes. Herein, we show that RELMβ activates three MAPKs and down-regulates IRS-1/2 proteins and suppresses insulin signaling. Our observations suggest that RELMβ may be a useful marker for assessing insulin resistance associated with obesity and may also serve as a target for future novel anti-diabetic agents. Antibodies—The affinity-purified antibodies against RELMβ, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, IRS-2, tyrosine phosphorylation (4G10), and Akt/protein kinase B were prepared as previously described (13Ono H. Shimano H. Katagiri H. Yahagi N. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Anai M. Ogihara T. Fujishiro M. Viana A.Y. Fukushima Y. Abe M. Shojima N. Kikuchi M. Yamada N. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The antibodies against phospho-Ser473 of Akt, phospho-p44/p42, p44/42, phospho-p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, phospho-SAPK/JNK, and SAPK/JNK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Preparation of Recombinant RELMβ—Adenoviruses expressing RELMβ were constructed using an Ad Easy kit (Quantum Biotechnology). HEK293 T cells transfected with RELMβ adenovirus produced 50–100 mg/liter RELMβ protein in the medium. Serum-free medium CD293 (Invitrogen) was used to collect the secreted protein from confluent HEK293 T cells for 2 days. The medium was harvested and spun down to remove cells. The medium was then purified and concentrated using a high S column and Biologic LP system (Bio-Rad) as described previously (4Banerjee R.R. Rangwala S.M. Shapiro J.S. Rich A.S. Rhoades B. Qi Y. Wang J. Rajala M.W. Pocai A. Scherer P.E. Steppan C.M. Ahima R.S. Obici S. Rossetti L. Lazar M.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1195-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Greater than 95% purity was confirmed by silver staining with a Silver Staining Kit (BEXEL Biotechnology), and quantities were determined by Western blotting, using commercially available recombinant RELMβ (Peprotech) as the standard. The medium of HEK293T cells transfected with β-galactosidase expressing adenovirus was used to prepare a control solution. The pH values of RELMβ and control solution were adjusted to 7.4. Construction of RELMβ and Generation of Transgenic Mice—The open reading frame of RELMβ was obtained employing PCR based on the previously reported sequence (9Steppan C.M. Brown E.J. Wright C.M. Bhat S. Banerjee R.R. Dai C.Y. Enders G.H. Silberg D.G. Wen X. Wu G.D. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). This RELMβ cDNA was cloned into a pAT15-3 vector containing the SAP promoter and rat β-globin intron (Fig. 1a), which was used for the generation of RELMβ transgenic mice. Animals and High Fat Diet—The C57/Bl6 line was used to generate RELMβ transgenic mice. All animal studies were conducted according to the Japanese guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. All animal experiments were performed after 4-week high fat diet loading, unless otherwise indicated. The high fat diet had, basically, the previously described composition (14Anai M. Funaki M. Ogihara T. Kanda A. Onishi Y. Sakoda H. Inukai K. Nawano M. Fukushima Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), except that the skim was added to the formulation. Food intakes were determined daily for 5 consecutive days. Food was withdrawn 12 h before each experiment. Immunoblotting of RELMβ—Serum RELMβ concentrations in transgenic mice and their littermates were determined by immunoblotting. Two microliters of serum was boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to 0.1-μm pore nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using anti-RELMβ antibody (1:1000). Proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL or ECL plus) and exposed to ECL film (Amersham Biosciences) Serum Glucose, Lipids, and Hepatic Triglyceride and Glycogen— Blood glucose was measured with a portable blood glucose monitor, Freestyle Kissei (Kissei Pharmaceutical, Japan). The plasma insulin level was determined with an enzymatic immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Serum triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acids were assayed with Triglyceride E test Wako, Cholesterol E test Wako, and NEFA C test Wako (Wako Chemicals, Japan), respectively. Serum adiponectin was assayed with an adiponectin measurement kit (Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Japan). Hepatic total lipid was extracted and assayed using the Folch method, as described previously (15Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The triglyceride content was assayed as described above. Hepatic glycogen content was measured as previously described (16Bergmeyer H. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analys-is. 3rd ed. Wiley, Hoboken, NJ1984: 11-18Google Scholar). Tolerance Test—Glucose (2 g/kg glucose load), insulin (0.75 unit/kg insulin), and pyruvate (2 g/kg pyruvate) tolerance tests were performed as previously described (17Miyake K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Nakamura T. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Glucose Clamp Study—The glucose clamp study was performed, as previously described (18Onishi Y. Honda M. Ogihara T. Sakoda H. Anai M. Fujishiro M. Ono H. Shojima N. Fukushima Y. Inukai K. Katagiri H.

In brief, mice were implanted with catheters that were exteriorized at the back of the neck and encased in silastic tubing. Four days after surgery, the animals were fasted for 3 h and used for the experiments. [d-3H]Glucose (Amersham Biosciences) was injected (bolus 10 μCi, 0.1 μCi/min, for 240 min) intravenously. After a 90-min basal period, a blood sample was collected for determination of glucose-specific activity and the blood glucose level. At time 0, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were started, and 10 milliunits/kg/min human insulin (Novolin R, Novo Nordisk) was continuously infused for 150 min. The blood glucose concentration was clamped at 90–120 mg/dl, for at least 60 min, by estimating the blood glucose concentration at 5-min intervals and adjusting the rate of glucose solution infusion. Blood samples were taken to determine blood glucose, insulin, and plasma [d-3H]glucose every 30 min for 120 min. Then, 12 μCi of [14C]2-deoxy-d-glucose ([14C]2DG, Amersham Biosciences) was injected, and blood samples were taken at 122, 125, 130, and 150 min to determine blood glucose and plasma [14C]2DG. At 150 min, the gastrocnemius (type IIB fibers) muscle, soleus (type I and type IIA fibers) muscles, and epididymal fat were immediately excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at –80 °C until future tissue analysis. Plasma and Tissue Assays in Glucose Clamp Study—After deproteinization with barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2, 0.3 n) and zinc sulfate (ZnSO4, 0.3 n), [d-3H]glucose and [14C]2DG radioactivities of plasma were determined by dual channeled liquid scintillation counting. Hepatic glucose production and the glucose disposal rate were calculated for the basal period and the steady-state portion of the glucose clamp as previously described (21Fisher S.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Muscle and fat samples were weighed and homogenized in 0.5% perchloric acid. Homogenates were centrifuged and neutralized with NaHCO3. The sample was then separated into two aliquots. One was counted directly to determine [14C]2DG and [14C]2DG-6-phosphate ([14C]2DGP) radioactivities. The other was treated with Ba(OH)2 and ZnSO4 to remove [14C]2DGP and any tracer incorporated into glycogen and then counted to determine [14C]2DG radioactivity. [14C]2DGP is the difference between the two aliquots. Tissue glucose uptake was calculated as described (20Fueger P.T. Bracy D.P. Malabanan C.M. Pencek R.R. Granner D.K. Wasserman D.H. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In Vivo Insulin Stimulation—In vivo insulin stimulation was performed, as previously described (22Ogihara T. Shin B.C. Anai M. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Funaki M. Fukushima Y. Ishihara H. Takata K. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12868-12873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with some modifications. In brief, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. The portal vein was exposed, and 0.4 ml of normal saline (0.9% NaCl) with or without insulin (25 milliunits/g body wt) was injected. The livers were removed 30 s later, and hind limb skeletal muscles were removed 90 s thereafter and immediately homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in 6 volumes of solubilization buffer. Both extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used as samples for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, or kinase assay of PI 3-kinase and Akt/protein kinase B. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Supernatants containing equal amounts of protein (8 mg) were incubated with anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 antibodies (5 mg/ml each) and then incubated with 100 μlof protein A- and G-Sepharose. The samples were washed and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Total lysates were also boiled to allow detection of Akt, AktSer473 phosphorylation, the three MAPKs, and their phosphorylations. Total lysates or immunoprecipitants were subjected to Western blotting, blotted with one of the antibodies or 4G10 antibody. Band intensities were quantified with Image J (National Institutes of Health). Measurement of PI 3-Kinase and Akt/Protein Kinase B Activity—For PI 3-kinase assay, the supernatants containing equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4°C with anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2 or 4G10 antibody and protein A- or G-Sepharose. PI 3-kinase activities in the immunoprecipitants were assayed as previously described (23Ogihara T. Asano T. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Anai M. Shojima N. Ono H. Fujishiro M. Kushiyama A. Fukushima Y. Kikuchi M. Noguchi N. Aburatani H. Gotoh Y. Komuro I. Fujita T. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 794-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For the Akt kinase assay, an Akt kinase assay kit (Cell signaling) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glucose Uptake by Isolated Soleus Muscle in Vitro—Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by the soleus muscle was measured as described previously (24Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M. Fujishiro M. Ono H. Onishi Y. Katagiri H. Abe M. Fukushima Y. Shojima N. Inukai K. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Am. J. Phys-iol. 2002; 282: E1239-E1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mouse soleus muscles were isolated and incubated for 30 min in KHB buffer, with or without human insulin (2 milliunits/ml). The muscles were then rinsed for 10 min at 29 °C and incubated for 20 min at 29 °C in KHB buffer containing 8 mm 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (2-DG) (2.25 μCi/ml) and 32 mm [14C]mannitol (0.3 μCi/ml). After incubation, the muscles were rapidly solubilized. Radioactivity in the resultant samples was counted, and 2-DG uptake rates were corrected for extracellular trapping with mannitol counts. Effects of RELMβ on Insulin Action in Primary Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were isolated from fasted C57/bl6 mice by collagenase perfusion, as described previously (25Sakoda H. Gotoh Y. Katagiri H. Kurokawa M. Ono H. Onishi Y. Anai M. Ogihara T. Fujishiro M. Fukushima Y. Abe M. Shojima N. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Hirai H. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25802-25807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of RELMβ on insulin signaling, the dishes were split into two groups corresponding the presence and absence of RELMβ stimulation for 24 h. The RELMβ concentration was 1 μg/ml. The cells were then serum-starved for 3 h and stimulated with 10–6 m insulin for 5 min at 37 °C. IRS-1 and IRS-2 protein contents were evaluated by immunoblotting as described above. Insulin-induced IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylations were evaluated by 4G10 immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described above. Effect of RELMβ on Phosphorylations of MAPKs—To determine the effects of RELMβ on MAPK phosphorylations with their time course and dose dependence, primary hepatocytes were stimulated with 1 μg/ml RELMβ for 10 or 30 min, and with 0.01, 0.1, or 1 μg/ml RELMβ for 15 min. Phosphorylations of p44/p42 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and p54/p46 (SAPK/JNK) were evaluated by immunoblotting as described previously (26Fujishiro M. Gotoh Y. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M.

Tissue Hematoxylin-Eosin Staining—The liver and pancreas were removed from transgenic mice and their littermates and formalin-fixed. Samples were routinely embedded in paraffin. Approximately 5-μm-thick slices obtained from these samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Mean pancreatic islet area was histomorphometrically analyzed as previously described (27Tomimoto S. Hashimoto H. Shintani N. Yamamoto K. Kawabata Y. Hamagami K. Yamagata K. Miyagawa J. Baba A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 796-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Riboprobes of enzymes were amplified from mouse embryonic cDNA using PCR primers and subcloned as already described (13Ono H. Shimano H. Katagiri H. Yahagi N. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Anai M. Ogihara T. Fujishiro M. Viana A.Y. Fukushima Y. Abe M. Shojima N. Kikuchi M. Yamada N. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Total RNA from the liver and primary cultured hepatocytes was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Isogen, Nippon Gene, Japan). A 10-μg RNA sample was used for each assay. RNase protection assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (RPA III kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). Intensities of the resultant bands were determined using BAS2000 (Fuji film, Japan). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E., and significance was assessed using unpaired Student's t tests, unless otherwise indicated. Generating RELMβ Transgenic Mice—We generated transgenic mice, the livers of which express RELMβ, by inserting RELMβ cDNA downstream from the serum amyloid P (SAP) promoter. As expected, liver-specific expression in these transgenic mice was confirmed (data not shown), and two lines were established. In the livers of line 1 mice, RELMβ was highly overexpressed, and the serum RELMβ concentration exceeded that of the non-transgenic mice by 10-fold (Fig. 1c). In line 2 mice, RELMβ was moderately overexpressed, and the resulting elevation of serum RELMβ was approximately double that in non-transgenic mice (Fig. 1c). Hepatic RELMβ expression was reportedly increased in response to high fat feeding. Thus, increases in serum RELMβ with a high fat diet were observed in wild-type and line 2 mice, whereas there was no marked increase in the line 1 mice in which hepatic RELMβ overexpression was high. These observations indicate that a high fat diet increases endogenous RELMβ expression but not transgene-derived RELMβ expression. No significant difference was observed in terms of growth or adolescence between RELMβ transgenic mice and their littermates. At the time of sacrifice (age 16 weeks, after 4 weeks of being fed a high fat diet) and within the observation period, there was no significant difference in body weight or food intake. Glucose and Lipid Metabolic Profiles of RELMβ Transgenic Mice— The body weight, fasting serum glucose, serum insulin, and lipid concentrations of RELMβ transgenic mice did not differ from those of control mice when both were fed normal chow, at the age of 16 weeks. Furthermore, glucose, insulin, and pyruvate tolerance tests showed no significant differences between 16-week-old RELMβ-overexpressing mice and their littermates (Fig. 2, a–d, and TABLE ONE). However, the serum glucose concentration was significantly more elevated in both lines of transgenic mice (n = 25, p < 0.01) when fed a high fat diet (TABLE TWO), than those in the control mice. Under these conditions, hyperinsulinemia (n = 6, p < 0.05), hyperlipidemia (n = 6, p < 0.05), and increased hepatic triglyceride content (n = 8, p < 0.05) were observed in the transgenic mice.TABLE ONEGlucose and lipid metabolic profiles of 16-week-old RELMβ transgenic mice on normal chowControl (line 1)Transgenic (line 1)Control (line 2)Transgenic (line 2)BW (g)17.2 ± 0.817.9 ± 0.515.4 ± 1.116.4 ± 0.6FBS (mg/dl)88.9 ± 4.192.0 ± 2.481.2 ± 2.786.8 ± 2.6Serum insulin (ng/ml)0.08 ± 0.020.11 ± 0.02Serum TC (mg/dl)38.2 ± 2.236.7 ± 3.3Serum TG (mg/dl)49.6 ± 8.149.0 ± 5.8Serum free fatty acid (mEq/liter)0.80 ± 0.080.63 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab TABLE TWOGlucose and lipid metabolic profiles of RELMβ transgenic mice, at the age of 16 weeks, which had been fed a high fat diet for 4 weeksControl (line 1)Transgenic (line 1)Control (line 2)Transgenic (line 2)Body weight (g)37.1 ± 2.636.5 ± 1.431.5 ± 1.533.9 ± 2.6Food intake (g/day)4.6 ± 0.44.5 ± 0.54.1 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.8FBS (mg/dl)109.5 ± 8.3156.1 ± 10.6aStatistical significance: p < 0.05 for control mice versus transgenic mice.117.3 ± 3.9132.0 ± 2.8aStatistical significance: p < 0.05 for control mice versus transgenic mice.Serum insulin (ng/ml)3.8 ± 0.712.3 ± 2.7aStatistical significance: p < 0.05 for control mice versus transgenic mice.5.4 ± 1.37.6 ± 1.4Serum TC (mg/dl)48.0 ± 3.661.2 ± 7.9aStatistical significance: p < 0.05 for control mice versus transgenic mice.50.3 ± 4.576.4 ± 13.6Serum TG (mg/dl)51.7 ± 6.484.6 ± 6.4aStatistical significance: p < 0.05 for control mice versus transgenic mice.75.9 ± 8.0103.3 ± 14.0aStatistical significance: p < 0.05 for control mice versus transgenic mice.Serum free fatty acid (mEq/l)0.59 ± 0.020.56 ± 0.04NTbNT, not tested.NTSerum adiponectin (μg/ml)14.1 ± 1.411.1 ± 0.9NTNTLiver TG (mg/g liver)14.3 ± 1.921.0 ± 2.9aStatistical significance: p < 0.05 for control mice versus transgenic mice.NTNTLiver glycogen (mg/g liver)1.96 ± 0.081.97 ± 0.10NTNTIslet area (μm2)36310 ± 635792760 ± 9571aStatistical significance: p < 0.05 for control mice versus transgenic mice.NTNTa Statistical significance: p < 0.05 for control mice versus transgenic mice.b NT, not tested. Open table in a new tab Starting at the age of 16 weeks (line 1), or 20 weeks (line 2), mice were given a high fat diet for 4–6 weeks, and glucose, insulin, and pyruvate tolerance tests were then performed (Fig. 3). The glucose tolerance test confirmed an elevated fasting serum glucose concentration (Fig. 3, a and d) and revealed glucose intolerance in the transgenic mice. The insulin tolerance test revealed insulin resistance in the transgenic mice (Fig. 3, b and e). Finally, the pyruvate tolerance test showed greater elevation of the serum glucose concentration in the transgenic mice, as compared with the control mice (Fig. 3, c and f), indicating insufficient suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis in the transgenic mice. Taking these results together, RELMβ transgenic mice are insulin-resistant and glucose-intolerant, particularly in the liver. These tendencies were more evident in the highly RELMβ-overexpressing line. In terms of adipocytokines, the levels of serum free fatty acid and adiponectin were not altered (n = 8–10). Histological Analysis of Liver and Pancreas—Histology showed fatty liver and islet hyperplasia in transgenic mice as compared with control mice (n = 3, age 16 weeks, after 4 weeks on a high fat diet, Fig. 4). Quantitatively, the mean islet area in RELMβ-overexpressing mice was significantly increased, as compared with that in control mice, by approximately 2.5-fold (TABLE TWO). In contrast, no significant difference in adipocyte size or mass was seen in epididymal or subcutaneous fat at the time of sacrifice (data not shown). Glucose Clamp Study and Glucose Uptake in Vivo and in Vitro—Six-month-old mice fed a high fat diet for 4 weeks were used for the glucose clamp study. In the basal state, glucose levels were 113.3 ± 2.0 versus 158 ± 9.5 mg/dl (control versus transgenic), and insulin levels were 5.0 ± 1.2 versus 12.1 ± 5.4 ng/ml."

CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an apical membrane chloride channel. The regulation of CFTR by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and other protein kinases has been extensively documented. PKA can phosphorylate the CFTR regulatory domain (R domain) on at least 11 serine residues (1Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E.

Work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated that PKA and other regulatory proteins are compartmentalized in close proximity to CFTR. The cellular machinery capable of generating cAMP, including the adenosine receptor and membrane-bound adenylate cyclase are present with CFTR in apical membrane patches (6Huang P. Lazarowski E.R.

Less is known about the ability of serine/threonine phosphatases to regulate CFTR activity or how they are compartmentalized with CFTR. Work from many laboratories suggests that multiple phosphatases, including PP2A, PP2B, PP2C, and alkaline phosphatase, are involved in the deactivation of CFTR (13Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R.

Furthermore, exogenous PP2A and PP2C inactivate CFTR in excised membrane patches (13Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J.

Pflugers Arch. 1998; 436: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of PP2A and PP2B to CFTR deactivation may vary in different cell types (15Travis S.M.

Additionally, PP2C overexpression in Fischer rat thyroid cells decreases CFTR chloride conductance (15Travis S.M. Berger H.A. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11055-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the ability of endogenous PP2C to regulate CFTR in native epithelial tissues is unclear, since no PP2C inhibitors have been identified. To date, no single phosphatase has been demonstrated to be both necessary and sufficient to completely down-regulate CFTR channel activity, suggesting that CFTR is dephosphorylated by multiple phosphatases. Here, we present evidence for a direct interaction between CFTR and the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A. This interaction involves the COOH terminus of CFTR and the PP2A B′ϵ regulatory subunit. PP2A localizes to the apical cell surface, where it negatively regulates CFTR channel activity in Calu-3 cells and intact mouse jejunum. Furthermore, inhibition of PP2A increases the airway surface liquid in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells by a mechanism requiring CFTR channel activity. We conclude that PP2A is indeed a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues. Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence—Calu-3 cells were maintained as described previously (21Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Human airway epithelial cells were obtained from freshly excised bronchial specimens from normal subjects by protease digestion, seeded directly as primary cultures on 12-mm Transwell Col membranes (T-Col; Costar) in modified BEGM media under ALI conditions, and studied when fully differentiated (3-5 weeks). Cultures with transepithelial resistances (Rt) > 300 ohms cm2 were studied. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were performed as described previously using anti-PP2A subunit antibodies (22Kreda S.M. Mall M. Mengos A. Rochelle L. Yankaskas J. Riordan J.R. Boucher R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2154-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-catalytic subunit, monoclonal anti-A regulatory subunit, and polyclonal anti-B′ subunit were acquired from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Affinity Purification of CFTR-interacting Proteins—Peptides corresponding to residues 1375-1401, 1411-1441, 1451-1476, and 1471-1480 of human CFTR synthesized with an N-terminal biotin tag (Genemed Synthesis) were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4). 20 nmol of the peptides were immobilized on 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) and incubated with Calu-3 cell lysates. Lysates were prepared by incubating twenty 100-mm dishes of Calu-3 cells in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS, and protease (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase (Sigma) inhibitor mixtures) at 4 °C for 1 h. Following ultracentrifugation, the soluble fraction was precleared over empty streptavidin beads and incubated with CFTR peptides conjugated to streptavidin beads for 1 h. The bound fractions were washed extensively in binding buffer, eluted with 5% formic acid, and lyophilized. Prior to MS analysis, the protein samples were reduced, alkylated, and digested with proteomics grade trypsin (Sigma). The peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS on a Q-Tof micro (Waters, Manchester, UK). All data were acquired using Masslynx 4.0 software and than processed using Proteinlynx module. The processed data were searched against updated NCBInr and Sprot data bases using the Mascot search engine. Mascot probability-based Mowse individual ion scores of >46 were accepted as indicating identity or extensive homology (p < 0.05). The MS/MS spectrum scores between 20 and 45 were examined individually, with the acceptance criteria being that the parent and fragment ion masses were within the calibrated tolerance limits and that the spectrum contained an extended series of consecutive y- or b- ions. Small scale experiments analyzed by Western blot were performed using lysates from two 100-mm dishes of Calu-3 cells and 2 nmol of CFTR peptide. In Vitro Binding Assays—Binding assays were performed as described previously, with several exceptions (21Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J.

Briefly, the cDNA sequence of the human PP2A B′ϵ subunit was amplified by PCR and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pET-28C (Novagen, Madison, WI). Recombinant B′ϵ subunit was produced in either rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega, Madison, WI) or BL21 Escherichia coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For reticulocyte lysates, the PP2A B′ϵ subunit was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). To remove any reticulocyte proteins that co-purify with the B′ϵ subunit, the beads were washed three times in binding buffer plus 2 m urea followed by three washes in binding buffer. The B′ϵ subunit was eluted with binding buffer plus 10 mm EDTA. Bacterially, expression of B′ϵ subunit was performed as previously described (24Smith F.D. Oxford G.S. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19894-19900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Purified PP2A core dimer consisting of the catalytic and A regulatory subunit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Purified proteins were then incubated with indicated CFTR peptides immobilized to streptavidin beads in binding buffer plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4°C. Following extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot or phosphorimaging analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation and Phosphatase Assays—Calu-3 cells were scraped into a hypotonic lysis buffer (150 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors) and physically disrupted by Dounce homogenization on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to pellet cell membranes. Membranes were resuspended in binding buffer for 1 h on ice. CFTR was immunoprecipitated using CFTR 596 antibodies (gift of Dr. J. Riordan, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) or isotype-matched control antibodies covalently conjugated to Protein G dynabeads. Bound proteins were washed extensively and analyzed by Western blot using specific antibodies for PP2A subunits or for phosphatase activity using a PP2A immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). CFTR Currents in Outside-out Membrane Patches of Calu-3 Cells—The procedures were essentially as described previously (6Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, CFTR Cl- channel activity was recorded at a membrane potential of 30 mV with a 6-8-megaohm resistance for an open pipette. Both the pipette and the bath solutions were the same as described previously (6Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). CFTR channel activity was recorded digitally (PClamp software) for 300 s following patch excision. PP2A inhibitors or protein kinase A inhibitor was included in the pipette solution as indicated. CFTR Currents in Mouse Jejunum—Details of this approach have been described previously (25Grubb B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268 (-G513): G505PubMed Google Scholar, 26Grubb B.R. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 70: 525-535PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sections of the midportion of mouse jejunum were studied under short circuit current (Isc) conditions during a 90-min recording. A constant voltage pulse (1-5 mV, 1-s duration) was applied to the tissue every minute (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). Potential difference and resistance were calculated by Ohm's law from the changes in Isc in response to the voltage pulse. Tissues were treated with 100 μm endothall or vehicle. Confocal Microscopy Measurement of Periciliary Liquid (PCL)—The technique has been described in detail (27Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Parsons D. Picher M. Hirsh A.J. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphate-buffered saline (20 μl) containing 2 mg/ml Texas Red-dextran (10 kDa; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and benzamil (10-4 m) was added to cultured bronchial epithelium, and excess was aspirated to bring PCL height to ∼7 μm. The CFTR-specific inhibitor CFTRinh172 was also included where noted at a concentration of 10-5 m. To measure the average height of the PCL, five predetermined points (one central and four 2 mm from the edge of the culture) were XZ-scanned as previously described (27Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Parsons D. Picher M. Hirsh A.J. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For all studies, perfluorocarbon was added mucosally to prevent evaporation of the PCL, and the culture was placed on the stage of the confocal microscope over a serosal reservoir (80 μl of TES-buffered Ringer). Okadaic acid was added to the apical surface as a dry powder in perfluorocarbon (5 μg of okadaic acid/25 ml of perfluorocarbon/cm2 of culture). Perfluorocarbon has no effect on PCL height or ion transport, as previously described (27Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Parsons D. Picher M. Hirsh A.J. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Mol.

Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) to regulate cell surface stability, membrane trafficking, and channel activity. In the present study, we asked whether the highly conserved CFTR COOH terminus can interact with additional proteins that regulate channel function. We chose to focus on the last 25 amino acids of CFTR (encompassing residues 1451-1476), which precede, but do not include, the PDZ binding motif. Previous studies suggest that this region is important for CFTR trafficking and channel activity (32Ostedgaard L.S. Randak C. Rokhlina T. Karp P. Vermeer D. Ashbourne Excoffon K.J. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, no protein interactions have been reported. We immobilized biotinylated CFTR-(1451-1476) peptides on streptavidin-agarose beads, incubated the peptides in cell lysates prepared from Calu-3 cells, and eluted the bound proteins with formic acid. Using nanoliquid chromatography MS/MS, we identified the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A associated with CFTR-(1451-1476). PP2A dephosphorylates CFTR in vitro and decreases channel activity in multiple cell systems (14Hwang T.C. Horie M. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 629-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Reddy M.M. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270 (-C480): C474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Berger H.A. Travis S.M.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3392-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) also identified an interaction between the regulatory domain of CFTR and PP2A, suggesting that PP2A anchoring to CFTR may involve multiple contacts. PP2A is a major cellular phosphatase that regulates many protein targets. PP2A functions as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic subunit and two regulatory subunits, A and B (34Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). The specificity of PP2A is determined by the unique combination of regulatory subunits associated with the catalytic subunit. The A regulatory subunit is encoded by one of two genes α and β, which are 86% identical. The A regulatory subunit is tightly associated with the catalytic subunit and functions as a scaffold to recruit the B regulatory subunit. The B regulatory subunit is highly divergent in comparison with the other PP2A subunits. The B regulatory subunit is divided into the B, B′, B″, and B‴ families, which are encoded by at least 14 different genes, some of which produce as many as five splice variants. The diversity of regulatory subunits gives rise to over 75 distinct PP2A enzymes. By mass spectrometry, we observe peptides from all three PP2A subunits (Fig. 1A). Importantly, the MS/MS spectra provide amino acid sequence information that allowed us to precisely identify the PP2A regulatory subunits associated with CFTR-(1451-1476) as Aα and B′ϵ (Fig. 1B). By Western blot, we confirmed that the PP2A catalytic, A regulatory, and B′ regulatory subunits associate with CFTR-(1451-1476) but not other CFTR C-terminal peptides (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, these PP2A subunits also co-precipitate with endogenous CFTR from Calu-3 cell membranes (Fig. 2B), consistent with an interaction in vivo. The PP2A Bα subunit, which is structurally unrelated to the B′ family, does not co-purify with CFTR-(1451-1476) or co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous CFTR. In addition, we asked whether PP2A phosphatase activity purified with full-length CFTR. CFTR immunoprecipitates were assayed for PP2A using a colorimetric phosphatase assay. We find that a PP2A-like activity specifically co-precipitates with CFTR, but not an IgG control (Fig. 2C). Characteristic of PP2A, the phosphatase activity was inhibited by 1 μm okadaic acid or 1 μm endothall, potent inhibitors of PP2A (IC50 = 0.1 and 90 nm, respectively). Although okadaic acid and endothall can also inhibit PP1 (IC50 = 10 nm and 5 μm, respectively), previous studies have found no evidence to support the ability of PP1 to physically associate with CFTR, to dephosphorylate CFTR in vitro, or regulate channel activity (13Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274 (-C1410): C1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Berger H.A. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Although PP2C has been shown to be associated with CFTR in baby hamster kidney cells, the assay buffer does not contain Mg2+, which is required for PP2C activity. Taken together, these data suggest that the phosphatase activity associated with CFTR is PP2A. The PP2A B′ϵ Subunit Binds Directly to the COOH Terminus of CFTR—It is clear that multiple phosphatases can regulate CFTR channel activity. However, the degree to which PP2A contributes to this regulation varies in different functional assays and cell systems. Given the diversity of PP2A enzymes, we were intrigued by the possibility that the B regulatory subunit may, in part, account for these differences. Therefore, we asked whether the PP2A B′ϵ subunit could interact directly with CFTR. We find that PP2A B′ϵ subunit expressed and purified from reticulocyte lysates binds to CFTR-(1451-1476) but not other CFTR C-terminal peptides (Fig. 3A). NHERF-1, previously shown to interact with the extreme COOH terminus of CFTR, is enriched by the CFTR-(1471-1480) peptide, demonstrating the specificity of this assay (Fig. 3A). Although we do not find the catalytic or A subunit associated with the purified B′ϵ subunit from reticulocyte lysates (data not shown), we cannot rule out the possibility that these subunits are present at low levels and may be influencing binding to CFTR-(1451-1476). Using bacterially expressed, purified B′ϵ subunit, we observe direct and dose-dependent binding to CFTR-(1451-1476) (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we also find that the core PP2A dimer, composed of the catalytic and A regulatory subunit, do not bind to CFTR-(1451-1476) unless the B′ϵ subunit is present (Fig. 3C). Whereas it is not clear whether the B′ϵ subunit alone is necessary and sufficient for targeting PP2A to CFTR, these data suggest that the B′ϵ subunit may play a critical role in the binding specificity. PP2A Localizes to the Apical Cell Surface of Airway Epithelia—If PP2A is a physiologically relevant CFTR phosphatase, we reasoned that its subcellular localization should partially overlap with CFTR. Given the large number of PP2A substrates, we expect the ubiquitously expressed catalytic and tightly coupled A regulatory subunits to have a broad cellular distribution. However, specific B regulatory subunits, which target the PP2A enzyme to distinct subcellular compartments, should have a more restricted localization. Using a pan-B′ antibody, which recognizes all five gene products (α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ), we examined the localization of PP2A in the human airway. The B′ subunits exhibit a broad subcellular distribution in the human airway (Fig. 4). We find that B′ staining strongly localizes to the apical membrane of ciliated cells in superficial epithelia and gland ducts, consistent with the localization of CFTR in these tissues. Although we cannot unambiguously attribute the apical localization to the B′ϵ subunit, it is likely that this staining reflects the distribution of one or a combination of the cytosolic B′ subunits, B′α, B′β, B′δ, and B′ϵ (35McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition, we observe staining of perinuclear membranes and nuclear speckles, which is consistent with the observation that the B′γ and B′δ localize to the nucleus (35McCright B. Rivers A.M.

As we expected, the PP2A catalytic and A regulatory subunits are more broadly localized in airway epithelia (data not shown) but clearly localized to the apical cell surface of ciliated cells.

Using a rapid coculture system, we found that a neural cell line free of immune system cells similarly supported substantial CJD agent interference without PrPres. In addition, SY-CJD prevented superinfection by sheep-derived Chandler (Ch) and 22L scrapie agents. However, only 22L and not Ch prevented FU-CJD infection, even though both scrapie strains provoked abundant PrPres. This relationship between particular strains of sheep- and human-derived agents is likely to affect their prevalence and epidemic spread."
https://openalex.org/W1970286009,"Although the cytoskeletal network is important for insulin-induced glucose uptake, several studies have assessed the effects of microtubule disruption on glucose transport with divergent results. Here, we investigated the effects of microtubule-depolymerizing reagent, nocodazole and colchicine, on GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. After nocodazole treatment to disrupt microtubules, GLUT4 vesicles were dispersed from the perinuclear region in the basal state, and insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation was partially inhibited by 20-30%, consistent with other reports. We found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which did not stimulate GLUT4 translocation in intact cells, was surprisingly able to enhance GLUT4 translocation to ∼50% of the maximal insulin response, in nocodazole-treated cells with disrupted microtubules. This effect of PDGF was blocked by pretreatment with wortmannin and attenuated in cells pretreated with cytochalasin D. Using confocal microscopy, we found an increased co-localization of GLUT4 and F-actin in nocodazole-treated cells upon PDGF stimulation compared with control cells. Furthermore, microinjection of small interfering RNA targeting the actin-based motor Myo1c, but not the microtubule-based motor KIF3, significantly inhibited both insulin- and PDGF-stimulated GLUT4 translocation after nocodazole treatment. In summary, our data suggest that 1) proper perinuclear localization of GLUT4 vesicles is a requirement for insulin-specific stimulation of GLUT4 translocation, and 2) nocodazole treatment disperses GLUT4 vesicles from the perinuclear region allowing them to engage insulin and PDGF-sensitive actin filaments, which can participate in GLUT4 translocation in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner.

A number of studies have investigated the role of cytoskeletal structures, showing that both microtubules and actin filaments are important for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (4Olson A.L.

It is well known that GLUT4 vesicles located in the perinuclear storage pool are anchored by microtubules and that the disruption of microtubules with microtubule-depolymerizing reagents, such as nocodazole and colchicine, disperses GLUT4 vesicles into a cytoplasmic compartment (7Liu L.B.

The above studies point to the importance of microtubule elements in the process of GLUT4 vesicle translocation; however, not all studies are consistent with this view. Thus, in several reports, investigators have disrupted microtubules with nocodazole or colchicine and have demonstrated that an intact microtubule network is required for normal insulin-stimulated glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation (4Olson A.L.

For siRNA injection, 24 or 48 h after microinjection, cells were serum-starved for 3-4 h, pretreated with or without 33 μm nocodazole for 2 h, followed by stimulation with or without 10 ng/ml (1.7 nm) insulin or 50 ng/ml (2 nm) PDGF for 20 min. Cells were then fixed and processed for immunostaining as described below. Plasma Membrane Sheet Assay—3T3-L1 adipocyte plasma membrane sheet assays were performed as described elsewhere (17Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by brief incubation with hypotonic buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) for 1 min, three times. The cells were then sonicated at power setting 4 for 4 s in sonication buffer (70 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, 6 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). After washing with sonication buffer two times, the plasma membrane sheets were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and processed for immunostaining as described below. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Immunostaining of GLUT4 and measurement of GLUT4 translocation were performed as described before (18Huang J. Imamura T. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13084-13089Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, after being fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 3% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and incubated with anti-GLUT4 antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Antibody-injected cells were detected with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. siRNA-injected cells were recognized by FITC-dextran co-injected with siRNAs. The measurement of the cell surface GLUT4 (ring assay) was performed as previously described (19Imamura T. Ishibashi K. Dalle S. Ugi S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33691-33695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The FITC-positive microinjected cells were evaluated for the presence of plasma membrane-associated GLUT4 staining. The observer was blinded to the experimental condition of each coverslip. F-actin was detected by incubating with Oregon green phalloidin in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h. Localization of GLUT4 and F-actin was examined using a confocal microscope (AXIOVERT 100M, ZEISS, Germany). 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DOG) Uptake—Glucose uptake assay was performed as described before (20Usui I. Imamura T. Satoh H. Huang J. Babendure J.L. Hupfeld C.J. Olefsky J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved for 2-3 h in KRP-Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 131.2 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 2.5 mm NaH2PO4) incubating together with or without 33 μm nocodazole for 2 h, 10 μm colchicine for 3 h, 2 μm cytochalasin D for 3 h, 10 μm jasplakinolide for 2 h, or vehicle Me2SO for 2-3 h, or vehicle Me2SO for 3 h, followed by stimulation for 30 min with or without 100 ng/ml (17 nm) insulin or 50 ng/ml (2 nm) PDGF. The assay was started immediately without changing buffer. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Results were analyzed using analysis of variance. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effects of Insulin and PDGF on Glucose Transport and GLUT4 Translocation after the Disruption of Microtubules—To study the role of the cytoskeletal network on GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, cells were pretreated with or without a vehicle control (Me2SO) for 2-3 h, 33 μm nocodazole for 2 h, or 10 μm colchicine for 3 h, 2 μm cytochalasin D for 3 h, or 10 μm jasplakinolide for 2 h. Cells were then stimulated with or without 10 ng/ml (1.7 nm) insulin for 20 min, followed by measurement of GLUT4 translocation by immunofluorescence microscopy, as previously described (9Imamura T. Huang J. Usui I. Satoh H. Bever J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). After treatment with nocodazole or colchicine, the cellular microtubule structure, as visualized by tubulin immunostaining, was completely disrupted (data not shown), and GLUT4 vesicles were dispersed from the perinuclear region throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3), consistent with previous reports (7Liu L.B. Omata W. Kojima I. Shibata H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30157-30169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Fletcher L.M. Welsh G.I. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cytochalasin D treatment completely destroyed actin filaments, as observed by phalloidin staining, but did not significantly change the pattern of basal GLUT4 localization (data not shown). Jasplakinolide treatment is known to inhibit only the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, which is required for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation (21Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1A, cell surface GLUT4 levels in the basal state were not affected by pretreatment with nocodazole or colchicine. Insulinstimulated GLUT4 translocation was decreased by 15-25% after nocodazole or colchicine treatment, consistent with previous studies (7Liu L.B. Omata W. Kojima I. Shibata H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30157-30169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Shigematsu S. Khan A.H. Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because both microtubules and actin filaments play important roles in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (4Olson A.L. Trumbly A.R. Gibson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10706-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Omata W. Shibata H. Li L. Takata K. Kojima I. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 321-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wang Q. Bilan P.J. Tsakiridis T. Hinek A. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), this partial inhibition by microtubule disruption raises the possibility that actin filament-based transport can mediate GLUT4 vesicle movement to the cell surface following the dispersal of GLUT4 vesicles. To test the above hypothesis, we treated cells with 50 ng/ml (2 nm) PDGF after pretreatment with nocodazole or colchicine with or without cytochalasin D or jasplakinolide. As we (14Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25139-25147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and others (15Shigematsu S. Miller S.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have reported previously, PDGF did not stimulate GLUT4 translocation in intact cells. Interestingly, after nocodazole or colchicine treatment, we found that PDGF stimulation increased the cell surface GLUT4 level to ∼50% of the maximal insulin effect (p < 0.05) and that this effect of PDGF was markedly attenuated in cells pretreated with both nocodazole/colchicine and cytochalasin D/jasplakinolide (Fig. 1A). These results support the hypothesis that after GLUT4 vesicles are dispersed from their normal perinuclear localization into the cytoplasm, PDGF is now able to stimulate GLUT4 translocation as long as the actin cytoskeleton response is intact, consistent with an F-actin mediated mechanism. We also conducted comparable 2-DOG uptake experiments to study the effect of PDGF on glucose transport. As seen in Fig. 1B, insulin caused a 7.8-fold increase in 2-DOG uptake, whereas PDGF had only a very slight effect, consistent with previous reports that PDGF does not stimulate glucose transport (14Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25139-25147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Shigematsu S. Miller S.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, when cells were pretreated with colchicine, insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake was slightly, but not significantly decreased, whereas PDGF was now able to stimulate 2-DOG uptake 3.3-fold (p < 0.05). This effect of PDGF was attenuated by pretreatment with the combination of colchicine and cytochalasin D or the actin cytoskeleton inhibitor jasplakinolide (Fig. 1B, righthand section). Consistent with a previous report showing that nocodazole has an inhibitory effect on glucose transporter function (12Molero J.C. Whitehead J.P. Meerloo T. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43829-43835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we found that nocodazole treatment showed marked inhibition of 2-DOG uptake in all conditions, although the surface GLUT4 levels were not significantly decreased (Fig. 1A). Although 2-DOG uptake was inhibited by nocodazole because of direct interference with GLUT4 transporter function (12Molero J.C. Whitehead J.P. Meerloo T. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43829-43835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), similar direction for insulin/PDGF-induced 2-DOG uptake was observed (Fig. 1B, middle section). Thus, with respect to PDGF action, the 2-DOG uptake results are consistent with the GLUT4 translocation data shown in Fig. 1A. The Stimulatory Effect of PDGF on GLUT4 Translocation after Microtubule Disruption Is PI3-kinase-dependent—We pretreated serum-starved cells with 33 μm nocodazole or vehicle for 2 h, followed by treatment with PI3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (50 μm)) for 30 min, or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) for 30 min, prior to insulin or PDGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2A, after nocodazole treatment, insulin and PDGF caused a 165 and 67% increase in GLUT4 translocation, respectively. Although there is no statistical significance in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation between Me2SO and nocodazole pretreatment, PGDF significantly increased GLUT4 translocation in nocodazole-treated cells (p < 0.05). The stimulatory effects of insulin and PDGF were completely inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002 treatment, but PD98059 treatment had no effect. These results show that PDGF-stimulated and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, after nocodazole treatment, is PI3-kinase-dependent but not MEK-dependent. To confirm these results with another method, we performed similar experiments using the plasma membrane sheet assay to measure GLUT4 translocation. As shown in Fig. 2B, there was a significant increase in GLUT4 immunofluorescence on the plasma membrane sheets upon PDGF stimulation in cells treated with nocodazole compared with control vehicle-treated cells. The PDGF stimulatory effect was completely inhibited by pretreatment with wortmannin (100 nm,30 min), but pretreatment with PD98059 had no effect. As shown in Fig. 2C, the intensities of GLUT4 immunofluorescence on the plasma membrane sheets (as quantitated using SimplePCI software (C-Imaging Systems)) are comparable with the GLUT4 translocation data measured by immunofluorescence microscopy in Fig. 2A. On the other hand, plasma membrane GLUT1 expression, as assessed by the plasma membrane sheet assay, was increased 1.8-fold by insulin stimulation but was not significantly affected by microtubule disruption (Fig. 2, D and E), consistent with previous reports (4Olson A.L. Trumbly A.R. Gibson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10706-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Wang Q. Bilan P.J. Tsakiridis T. Hinek A. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PDGF did not significantly affect PM GLUT1 expression either with or without nocodazole treatment. Actin-based Transport Can Translocate GLUT4 Vesicles after Disruption of Microtubules—We postulated that after nocodazole-induced microtubule disruption, dispersed GLUT4 vesicles can engage actin filaments allowing PDGF to stimulate GLUT4 translocation through an F-actin-mediated mechanism (Fig. 1). To explore this possibility, we examined the co-localization of GLUT4 and actin filaments using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3, in basal cells pretreated with Me2SO, GLUT4 vesicles were localized predominantly to the perinuclear region, and the F-actin structure was poorly discriminated (time 0). After insulin stimulation, GLUT4 vesicles are translocated to the plasma membrane, displaying a strong fluorescence ring, cortical actin filaments were now clearly formed, and there was co-localization of GLUT4 and F-actin (overlay). This observation is consistent with studies showing co-localization of translocated GLUT4 with rearranged actin after insulin treatment in L6 myotubes (22Khayat Z.A. Tong P. Yaworsky K. Bloch R.J. Klip A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 279-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Asahi Y. Hayashi H. Wang L. Ebina Y. J. Med. Investig. 1999; 46: 192-199PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, after PDGF stimulation, the majority of the GLUT4 vesicles remained in a perinuclear location, but there was marked membrane ruffling indicative of PDGF-induced cortical actin rearrangement. There was little co-localization of GLUT4 and F-actin (Fig. 3). In basal cells pretreated with nocodazole, GLUT4 vesicles were dispersed from the perinuclear region, and were now localized throughout the cytoplasm. Upon insulin stimulation, cortical actin filaments became clearly visible, a circumferential ring of GLUT4 could be detected, which co-localized with F-actin in the cortical region of the cell (Fig. 3). Similarly, the PDGF stimulation of nocodazole-treated cells resulted in GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface, formation of visible cortical actin structures, and co-localization of GLUT4 with F-actin. These results suggest that after disruption of the microtubule network with nocodazole, the dispersed GLUT4 vesicles can be recruited to the plasma membrane via actin filaments with PDGF or insulin stimulation. Motor proteins participate in vesicle trafficking by moving cargo along the cytoskeleton (1Kamal A. Goldstein L.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the motor protein kinesin KIF3 plays an important role in insulin-induced GLUT4 exocytosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (9Imamura T. Huang J. Usui I. Satoh H. Bever J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and another kinesin family member, KIF5, has also been implicated in this process (10Semiz S. Park J.G. Nicoloro S.M. Furcinitti P. Zhang C. Chawla A. Leszyk J. Czech M.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2387-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Besides microtubule-associated motor proteins, the actin motor protein, Myo1c, has recently been shown to facilitate GLUT4 transport in response to insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (24Bose A. Guilherme A. Robida S.I. Nicoloro S.M. Zhou Q.L. Jiang Z.Y. Pomerleau D.P. Czech M.P. Nature. 2002; 420: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). If the actin system can mediate GLUT4 translocation in the absence of intact microtubules, the actin motor Myo1c may be responsible for transporting GLUT4 vesicles under these conditions. To examine the roles of motor proteins in GLUT4 translocation with or without microtubule disruption, we conducted single cell microinjection experiments. As seen in Fig. 4A, microinjection of Myo1c-siRNA into cells pretreated with Me2SO significantly inhibited insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation by 65%, consistent with a previous study showing a role for Myo1c in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation (24Bose A. Guilherme A. Robida S.I. Nicoloro S.M. Zhou Q.L. Jiang Z.Y. Pomerleau D.P. Czech M.P. Nature. 2002; 420: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Microinjection of Myo1c-siRNA into nocodazole-pretreated cells significantly inhibited not only insulin- but also PDGF-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by ∼50 and ∼85%, respectively. This same Myo1c-siRNA has been shown to knock down protein expression, as well as inhibit 2-DOG uptake when electroporated into 3T3-L1 adipocytes (24Bose A. Guilherme A. Robida S.I. Nicoloro S.M. Zhou Q.L. Jiang Z.Y. Pomerleau D.P. Czech M.P. Nature. 2002; 420: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We also examined the role of KIF3 in this system by microinjecting an antibody against KAP3A, a binding subunit of KIF3. Consistent with our previous report (9Imamura T. Huang J. Usui I. Satoh H. Bever J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), KAP3A antibody injection inhibited insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation in control cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4 from left side, p < 0.05). However, it did not significantly affect either insulin- or PDGF-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in nocodazole-treated cells in which the microtubule system had been disrupted (Fig. 4B, lanes 5-10 from left side). Similar results were obtained when KAP3A-siRNA was injected (Fig. 4C). These results further support the idea that the actin network can mediate GLUT4 translocation after GLUT4 vesicles are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm from their normal perinuclear location by microtubule disruption. Insulin- and PDGF-induced Akt/PKB Activation Is Not Affected by Disruption of Microtubules—To determine whether the initial signaling events of PDGF-stimulated GLUT4 translocation were affected by microtubule disruption, we measured the insulin and PDGF activation of Akt/PKB. As seen in Fig. 5, both insulin (100 ng/ml, 10 min) and PDGF (50 ng/ml, 10 min) led to phosphorylation of Akt Ser-473 with or without nocodazole or colchicine, although the PDGF effects are only 20% of the maximal insulin response, consistent with our (14Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25139-25147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and other (25Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14063-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) previous reports. These results show that microtubule disruption does not affect these aspects of insulin and PDGF signaling and clearly does not result in enhanced PDGF-mediated Akt activation. Recent studies reveal a role for the intact microtubule network in the process of GLUT4 translocation (26Lizunov V.A. Matsumoto H. Zimmerberg J. Cushman S.W. Frolov V.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); however, it remains somewhat controversial. For example, several studies have suggested that an intact microtubule network is necessary for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Thus, disruption of microtubules led to inhibition of insulinstimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation (4Olson A.L. Trumbly A.R. Gibson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10706-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Liu L.B. Omata W. Kojima I. Shibata H. J. Biol.

Inhibition of the microtubule-based motor proteins dynein or kinesin decreased insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes (9Imamura T. Huang J. Usui I. Satoh H. Bever J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Huang J. Imamura T. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, other groups have reported that insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is microtubule-independent (11Shigematsu S. Khan A.H. Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Molero J.C. Whitehead J.P. Meerloo T. James D.E. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2003; 285: E836-E844Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and that nocodazole inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport via a microtubule-independent mechanism (12Molero J.C. Whitehead J.P. Meerloo T. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43829-43835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Ai H. Ralston E. Lauritzen H.P. Galbo H. Ploug T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E836-E844Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The differences between these reports have not been well resolved. The current study directly addresses this issue, and we have hypothesized that after microtubules are disrupted by nocodazole or colchicine, GLUT4 vesicles become dispersed and can now reside in the vicinity of the cortical actin network, which participates in the process of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. Using confocal microscopy, we show co-localization of actin filaments with GLUT4 vesicles in 3T3-L1 adipocytes upon insulin stimulation after nocodazole treatment (Fig. 3). In addition, microinjection of siRNA targeted to the actin-associated motor protein Myo1c, but not the microtubule-associated motor KIF3, significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in cells pretreated with nocodazole (Fig. 4). These data indicate that after disruption of microtubules, insulin-stimulated translocation of the dispersed GLUT4 vesicles can occur through the actin network and that this is now independent of microtubule function. Membrane ruffling due to cortical actin rearrangement is PI3-kinase-dependent and plays an important role in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation (29Martin S.S. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17605-17608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 30Vollenweider P. Clodi M. Martin S.S. Imamura T. Kavanaugh W.M. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Like insulin, PDGF can also stimulate activation of PI3-kinase with subsequent membrane ruffling (29Martin S.S. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17605-17608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 31Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L.

Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23858-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on our results with insulin stimulation in nocodazole-treated cells, it seemed possible that PDGF, which can induce cortical actin rearrangement, might also be able to stimulate translocation of dispersed GLUT4 vesicles after microtubule disruption. To test this idea, we stimulated nocodazoletreated cells with PDGF and measured 2-DOG uptake and GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 1). The results showed that PDGF was now able to stimulate glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation in these cells, and the stimulatory effect of PDGF was PI3-kinase-dependent. These findings further support the idea that the actin network can mediate the translocation of dispersed GLUT4 vesicles to the cell surface. The PI3-kinase dependence of the PDGF effect after nocodazole treatment is consistent with reports showing that PDGF-induced membrane ruffling is PI3-kinase-dependent (30Vollenweider P. Clodi M.

Chen J.J. Birnbaum M.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Regarding early signaling events following microtubule disruption, we found that neither insulin- nor PDGF-induced Akt/PKB phosphorylation was affected by pretreatment with nocodazole or colchicine (Fig. 5). The magnitude of the PDGF effect on Akt phosphorylation was ∼20% of the maximal insulin response, consistent with the previous reports (14Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25139-25147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that PDGF does not stimulate Akt2/PKBβ activation, whereas others found that PDGF induced Akt2/PKBβ activation as assessed by a kinase activity assay (32Summers S.A. Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Lipfert L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23858-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that there is heterogeneity of PDGF receptor expression with 3T3-L1 adipogenesis (15Shigematsu S. Miller S.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), this could possibly explain these differences. Taken together, it is suggested that in the presence of an intact cytoskeletal network, both microtubules and actin filaments participate in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Perinuclear GLUT4 vesicles, anchored by the microtubule structure, are first transported by microtubule-associated motor proteins, such as kinesins, along the microtubules to the cell periphery, where the actin-associated motor myosins can then transport the GLUT4 vesicles along the cortical actin filaments to the plasma membrane. When microtubules are disrupted, the perinuclear GLUT4 vesicles are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm allowing them to gain access to the F-actin system. The dispersed GLUT4 vesicles can be transported directly by myosins along the actin filaments to the plasma membrane. In this case, PDGF, which normally does not stimulate GLUT4 translocation, can enhance GLUT4 vesicle movement to the cell surface by stimulating actin rearrangement. In the same vein, insulin can also induce GLUT4 translocation after microtubule disruption. Insulin is unique among hormones and growth factors in its ability to stimulate glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation in muscle and adipose tissues, but the mechanisms for this insulin specificity are still unclear. Although many growth factors can stimulate PI3-kinase activity, it has been suggested that the lack of, or the low number of, receptors for other growth factors, such as PDGF, may account for their inability to activate glucose transport (15Shigematsu S. Miller S.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Whiteman E.L. Chen J.J. Birnbaum M.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Alternatively it has also been proposed that insulin and PDGF have different compartmental effects on the activation of PI3-kinase (35Ricort J.M. Tanti J.F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and the generation of PIP3 (36Oatey P.B. Venkateswarlu K. Williams A.G. Fletcher L.M. Foulstone E.J. Cullen P.J. Tavare J.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which may also be a mechanism for insulin specificity. Our study points out that the localization of GLUT4 vesicles is also an important factor. We propose that the normal perinuclear localization of GLUT4 vesicles is one of the factors contributing to insulin-specific GLUT4 translocation, because insulin is necessary to overcome the mechanisms that lead to retention of GLUT4 vesicles in this compartment. It is possible that insulin acts at the microtubule level to begin the process of GLUT4 translocation but also has effects on the actin skeletal network, which is needed to continue this process. This would explain why insulin still causes translocation in the presence of nocodazole. If PDGF exerts its effects only at the level of the actin network, this would explain why PDGF can cause GLUT4 translocation in microtubule-disrupted cells with dispersed GLUT4 vesicles but has only weak effects in control cells. In summary, these data suggest that the anchoring of GLUT4 vesicles in the perinuclear storage pool is important for insulin-specific effects on GLUT4 translocation and that both microtubule- and actin filament-based transport systems participate in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation.

https://openalex.org/W2067314188,"Insulin is susceptible to fibrillation, a misfolding process leading to well ordered cross-β assembly. Protection from fibrillation in β cells is provided by sequestration of the susceptible monomer within zinc hexamers. We demonstrate that proinsulin is refractory to fibrillation under conditions that promote the rapid fibrillation of zinc-free insulin. Proinsulin fibrils, as probed by Raman microscopy, are nonetheless similar in structure to insulin fibrils. The connecting peptide, although not well ordered in native proinsulin, participates in a fibril-specific β-sheet. Native insulin and proinsulin exhibit similar free energies of unfolding as inferred from guanidine denaturation studies: relative amyloidogenicities are thus not correlated with global stability. Strikingly, the susceptibility of proinsulin to fibrillation is increased by scission of the connecting peptide at single sites. We thus propose that the connecting peptide constrains a large scale conformational change in the misfolded protein. A tethering mechanism is proposed based on a model of an insulin protofilament derived from electron-microscopic image reconstruction. The proposed relationship between cross-β assembly and protein topology is supported by studies of single-chain analogs (mini-proinsulin and insulin-like growth factor I) in which foreshortened connecting peptides further retard fibrillation. In addition to its classic function to facilitate disulfide pairing, the connecting peptide may protect β cells from toxic protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum."

Catalase-peroxidases (KatG) are present in prokaryotes and fungi. These bifunctional enzymes have a predominant catalase activity together with a substantial peroxidatic activity with broad specificity. KatG enzymes are the only heme peroxidases that exhibit a catalatic activity comparable with that of the classical monofunctional heme catalases. On the basis of sequence similarity, KatG enzymes have been recognized as part of the class I superfamily of plant, fungal, and bacterial peroxidases (1Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 388-393Crossref Scopus (761) Google Scholar).

In particular, the distal and proximal heme pockets contains the amino acid triads His-Arg-Trp and His-Trp-Asp, respectively. Moreover, features unique to catalase-peroxidases were found. (a) Compared with cytochrome c peroxidase or ascorbate peroxidase, they are double in length, with the N-terminal half, which includes the heme b-binding site, being more conserved. This has been ascribed to gene duplication (6Welinder K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). (b) They have an unusual covalent adduct consisting of the distal side tryptophan, tyrosine, and methionine (Trp122, Tyr249, and Met275 in Synechocystis numbering) (2Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T.

Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). (d) They have a more deeply buried active site, and the proposed access route for H2O2 is provided by a channel that is similar but longer and more constricted than that in the other heme peroxidases (3Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The constriction of the access channel results from the LL1 and LL2 insertions, as the former is positioned at one edge of the heme between helices D and E (see Fig. 1A). It also connects the distal and proximal catalytic domains. The LL1 insertion is of particular interest, as it contains a number of residues neighboring the covalently linked tyrosine (Tyr249 in Synechocystis numbering) that are highly conserved in KatG enzymes, viz. Ile248, Asn251, Pro252, and Glu253 (see Fig. 1B). This latter residue creates an acidic entrance to the channel, which is characterized by a pronounced funnel shape and a continuum of water (2Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat.

After passing the narrowest part of the channel, corresponding to the two KatG-specific residues Asp152 and Ser335, substrates come immediately into contact the with distal active-site residues Arg119, His123, and Trp122. Recently, it has been demonstrated that Asp152 is hydrogen-bonded to the LL1 residue Ile248 (7Santoni E. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5792-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This hydrogen bond is important for the stability of the heme architecture, and its substitution markedly changes the proximal His-Asp hydrogen bond interaction (7Santoni E. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C.

Moreover, Asp152 has been shown to be essential for the catalase (but not peroxidase) activity of KatG enzymes (8Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Regelsberger G. Jantschko W. Furtmuller P.G. Ruker F. Obinger C.

Recent studies have unequivocally demonstrated that the catalase (but not peroxidase) activity is very susceptible to exchange of amino acids at both the distal and proximal heme sites (8Jakopitsch C.

These findings suggest a correlation between the loss of catalase activity and the disruption of the particularly extensive hydrogen-bonding network typical of KatG (7Santoni E. Jakopitsch C.

Therefore, to establish the role of the main access channel in KatG catalysis, we have extended the study to four conserved amino acids belonging to LL1 of Synechocystis KatG, viz. Ile248, Pro252, Asn251, and Glu253, the latter three being on the surface of this channel (Fig. 1). In particular, the I248F, N251L, P252A, E253Q, and E253D variants were investigated by combining pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetics with electronic absorption and resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopies. Reagents—Standard chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma at the highest grade available. Mutagenesis—A pET-3a expression vector containing the cloned catalase-peroxidase gene from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 (16Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used as the template for PCR. Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was performed using PCR-mediated introduction of silent mutations as described previously (17Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Ruker F. Krois D. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22854-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Unique restriction sites flanking the region to be mutated were selected. The flanking primers were 5′-AAT GAT CAG GTA CCG GCC AGT AAA TG-3′ (containing a KpnI restriction site) and 5′-AGT GCA GAC TAG TTC GGA AAC G-3′ (containing an SpeI restriction site). The internal 5′-primer was 5′-GAG GGG GTC GAC GGG CAC CCG GAT C-3′ and possessed an SalI restriction site. The following mutant primers with the desired mutation and a silent mutation introducing the SalI restriction site were constructed (with point mutations in italics and restriction sites underlined): 5′-GCC CGT CGA CCC CCT CAG CGT TAA CGT AAA TTA ATC-3′ changed Pro252 to Ala, 5′-GCC CGT CGA CCC CCT CAG GGT TAA CGT AAA ATA ATC CCA TTT G-3′ changed Ile248 to Phe, 5′-GCC CGT CGA CCC CCT CAG GGA GAA CGT AAA TTA ATC CCA TTT G-3′ changed Asn251 to Leu, and 5′-GGT GCC CGT CGA CCC CCT GAG GGT TAA CG-3′ changed Glu253 to Gln. To substitute Glu253 with Asp, the following internal primers containing an AccIII restriction site were used: 5′-TAA TCC GGA CGG GGT GGA TGG-3′ and 5′-CGT CCG (G/A)T TAA CGT AAA TTA ATC CC-3′. The fragment defined by the KpnI and SpeI restriction sites was replaced with the new construct containing the point mutation. All constructs were sequenced to verify DNA changes by thermal cycle sequencing. Electronic Absorption—Absorption spectra were measured with a Cary 5 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Absorption spectra were measured prior to and after Raman experiments. No degradation was observed under the experimental conditions used. Kinetic measurements were performed using a Zeiss Specord S10 diode array spectrophotometer and a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cell holder. Circular Dichroism—CD studies were carried out using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. Far-UV (190-260 nm) experiments were carried out using a protein concentration of 1.5 μm and a cuvette with a 1-mm path length. A good signal-to-noise ratio in the CD spectra was obtained by averaging 12 scans (resolution, 1 nm; bandwidth, 1 nm; response, 2 s; and scan speed, 10 nm/min). The protein concentration was calculated from the known amino acid composition and absorption at 280 nm according to Gill and Hippel (18Gill C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—The RR spectra of the ferric and ferrous forms were obtained with excitation from the 406.7-nm line of a Kr+ laser (Coherent Innova 302) and the 441.6-nm line of a helium/cadmium laser (Kimmon IK4121R-G), respectively. To minimize the local heating of the sample, a gentle flux of N2 passed through liquid N2 was used. The sample was cooled to a temperature of ∼15 °C. The backscattered light from a slowly rotating NMR tube was collected and focused into a computer-controlled triple spectrometer (consisting of two Acton Research SpectraPro 2300i models and one SpectraPro 2500i model in the final stage with a grating of 3600 grooves/mm) working in the subtractive mode and equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Roper Scientific, Inc.). The polarized RR spectra were obtained by collecting and focusing the backscattered light from a slowly rotating NMR tube into a computer-controlled double monochromator (Jobin-Yvon HG2S) equipped with a cooled photomultiplier (RCA C31034A). Polarized spectra were obtained by inserting a Polaroid analyzer between the sample and the entrance slit of the monochromator. The depolarization ratios (ρ = I⊥/I∥) of the bands at 314 and 460 cm-1 of CCl4 were measured to check the reliability of the polarization measurements. The values obtained (0.73 and 0.00, respectively) compare well with the theoretical values of 0.75 and 0.00, respectively. The RR spectra were calibrated with indene and CCl4 as standards to an accuracy of 1 cm-1 for intense isolated bands. In the figures, the relative intensities of the high- and low-frequency RR bands of the ferric form were normalized on the ν4 and ν7 bands at 1373 and 679 cm-1, respectively. In the case of the ferrous form, the low-frequency region was normalized on the ν8 band at 347 cm-1. Peak intensities and positions of the ν(C=C) vinyl stretches in the 1600-1650 cm-1 frequency region of the RR spectra of ferric KatG enzymes and mutants were determined by a curve-fitting program (Lab Calc, Galactic Industries Corp.)

The ferrous form of the protein was obtained by adding a small volume (2-5 μl) of fresh sodium dithionite solution (10-20 g/liter) to a deoxygenated protein solution. The sample concentrations were ∼80-150 μm for electronic absorption spectra and ∼30-80 μm for RR experiments. Steady-state Kinetics—Catalase activity was determined polarographically in 50 mm phosphate buffer using a Clark-type electrode (YSI 5331 oxygen probe) inserted into a stirred thermostatted water bath (YSI 5301B). All reactions were performed at 30 °C and started by addition of KatG. One unit of catalase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of H2O2/min at pH 7 and 30 °C. To cover the pH range 4.0-9.0, 50 mm citrate/phosphate or 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer was used. Peroxidase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically using 1 mm H2O2 and 5 mm guaiacol (ϵ470 = 26.6 mm-1 cm-1) or 1 mm o-dianisidine (ϵ460 = 11.3 mm-1 cm-1). Alternatively, 1 mm peroxoacetic acid and 5 mm guaiacol were used. One unit of peroxidase is defined as the amount that oxidizes 1 μmol of electron donor/min at pH 7 and 30 °C. Transient-state Kinetics—Transient-state measurements were made using a Model SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer and a PiStar-180 circular dichroism spectrometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) equipped with a 1-cm observation cell thermostatted at 15 °C. Calculation of pseudo first-order rate constants (kobs) from experimental traces at the Soret maximum was performed with a SpectraKinetic work station (Version 4.38) interfaced to the instrument. The substrate concentrations were at least five times that of the enzyme to allow determination of pseudo first-order rate constants. Second-order rate constants were calculated from the slope of the linear plot of the pseudo first-order rate constants versus substrate concentration. To follow spectral transitions, a Model PD.1 photodiode array accessory (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) connected to the stopped-flow machine together with XScan diode array scanning software (Version 1.07) were utilized. The kinetics of oxidation of ferric catalase-peroxidase to compound I by peroxoacetic acid or hydrogen peroxide as well as the kinetics of cyanide binding to ferric KatG were followed in the single mixing mode. Catalase-peroxidase and the peroxides or cyanide were mixed to give a final concentration of 1 μm enzyme and 5-250 μm peroxide or 20-500 μm cyanide. The first data point was recorded 1.5 ms after mixing, and 2000 data points were accumulated. Sequential mixing stopped-flow analysis was used to measure compound I reduction by one-electron donors. In the first step, the enzyme was mixed with peroxoacetic acid, and after a defined delay time, the formed compound I was mixed with the electron donor aniline, ascorbate, or o-dianisidine. All stopped-flow determinations were made in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 15 °C, and at least three determinations were performed per substrate concentration. Electronic Absorption and Resonance Raman Spectra of Ferric KatG Variants—The far-UV (190-250 nm) CD spectrum is a sensitive probe of protein secondary structure. The CD spectra of all variants (data not shown) were similar to that of wild-type KatG and showed the typical features of α-helical protein structure with the 222 and 208 nm dichroic bands. Therefore, mutations did not induce changes in the overall secondary structure, and if conformational changes did occur, they must be very localized and minimal. Fig. 2 (A and B) compares the UV-visible and RR spectra of ferric KatG and its variants at pH 7.0. The UV-visible absorption spectra of recombinant wild-type KatG and the four variants exhibited the typical bands of heme b-containing peroxidases in the visible and near-UV region. It was recently shown that, in the UV-visible spectrum of wildtype (WT) KatG, a Soret band at 407 nm, Q-bands at 502 and 542 nm, and a CT1 band (long wavelength (>600 nm) porphyrin-to-metal charge transfer band) at 637 nm are indicative of a five-coordinate (5-c) high-spin (HS) heme coexisting with a six-coordinate (6-c) HS heme and a 6-c low-spin (LS) heme (19Heering H.A. Indiani C. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9237-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The RR spectrum in the high-frequency region confirmed that the predominant form is a 5-c HS heme (ν3 at 1493 cm-1, ν11 at 1551 cm-1, ν2 at 1571 cm-1, ν37 at 1594 cm-1, and ν10 at 1631 cm-1), coexisting with a 6-c LS heme (ν3 at 1501 cm-1 and ν10 at 1639 cm-1) and a 6-c HS heme (ν3 at 1485 cm-1, ν11 at 1545 cm-1, and ν2 at 1566 cm-1). Furthermore, by means of polarized RR spectra, two distinct vinyl stretches have been identified at 1624 and 1629 cm-1 (19Heering H.A. Indiani C. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9237-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The different frequencies correspond to different torsion angles (τ; i.e. the relative orientation of the vinyl Ca=Cb π-bond with respect to one of the two pyrrole Cα=Cβ π-bonds) of the 2-vinyl group with respect to the 4-vinyl group (20Marzocchi M. Smulevich G. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2003; 34: 725-736Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) resulting from interaction with the protein matrix. The UV-visible and RR spectra of E253Q and E253D were identical to those of the WT protein (data not shown). The replacement of Glu253 affected neither the spin state of the iron atom nor the vinyl stretches. On the contrary, mutation of Pro252, Asn251, and Ile248 led to the conversion of the 6-c HS form to both 5-c HS and 6-c LS hemes. The replacement had minor effects in the P252A mutant, but changes were progressively more evident in the order P252A, N251L, and I248F. The substitution of Pro252 with Ala only slightly affected the coordination of the iron atom. The maximum of the Soret band did not change with respect to WT KatG. However, the amount of the LS form increased, as indicated by the red shift in the Q-band to 507 nm and by the intensity increase of the band at 542 nm. Moreover, the increase of the shoulder at 380 nm and the red shift of the CT1 band to 643 nm indicate that the mutation increased the 5-c HS form at the expense of the aquo 6-c species, as confirmed by the intensity decrease of the ν3 band at 1485 cm-1 in the corresponding RR spectrum (Fig. 2B). The replacement of Asn251 with Leu gave rise to similar effects. However, the amount of the 6-c LS form was even larger, as shown by the red shift of the Q-band to 512 nm and the intensity increases of the 542 nm band (Fig. 2A) and of the RR bands at 1501 (ν3) and 1639 (ν10) cm-1 (Fig. 2B). Finally, the substitution of Ile248 with Phe led to the disappearance of the 6-c HS heme with the concomitant increase of the 5-c HS heme. In fact, in the UV-visible spectrum, the shoulder at 380 nm markedly increased, and the CT1 band shifted to 643 nm. Accordingly, the RR spectrum showed core size marker bands of 5-c HS and 6-c LS forms only. Because we observed an intensity variation in the 1600-1650 cm-1 region in the N251L and I248F RR spectra compared with the WT protein spectrum (Fig. 2B), we collected polarized RR spectra (Fig. 3) to determine if and how the frequencies of the vinyl stretches differ from that of the WT protein. In fact, in this region, upon Soret excitation, the polarized bands due the ν(C=C) vinyl stretching modes overlap with the ν10 depolarized bands due to the non-totally symmetric modes (B1g). The curve-fitting analysis (supported by measurement of the depolarization ratios, ρ = I⊥/I∥) showed that the two ν(C=C) vinyl stretching modes of the N251L mutant downshifted by 2-3 cm-1 with respect to the WT protein (TABLE ONE). Therefore, it appears that, compared with the WT protein, the N251L mutation changed the vinyl group orientation with respect to the heme plane. The conclusions drawn from the analysis of the UV-visible and RR core size marker bands were confirmed by the RR spectra in the low-frequency region (Fig. 4). The low-frequency region spectra of the E253Q and E253D mutants were identical to that of WT KatG. The spectra were analyzed following the previous assignment proposed for WT KatG (19Heering H.A. Indiani C. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9237-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the assignment of myoglobin by Hu et al. (30Hu S. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (463) Google Scholar), which was based on isotopically labeled hemes. The band at 336 cm-1 (assigned to the out-of-plane γ6 mode) is active only in the 5-c HS form and is thus present in the spectra of all mutants. The band at 349 cm-1 (ν8) in the spectrum of WT KatG was shifted to 347 cm-1 in the spectra of P252A, N251L, and I248F. The band at 376 cm-1 (assigned to the porphyrin propionate bending mode δ(CβCcCd)) was relatively less intense in the spectra of P252A and N251L compared with that of WT KatG. The variation of the intensity of this band may be related to conformational changes of the propionate substituents. The band observed at 430 cm-1 in the WT protein (assigned to the δ(CβCaCb) bending modes of the vinyl substituents) downshifted to 421 cm-1 in the N251L spectrum, reflecting the variations of the vinyl stretching modes observed in the high-frequency region. Moreover, in the I248F mutant, a remarkable intensity increase was observed for the band at 754 cm-1 (assigned to the ν15 mode; pyrrole breathing).

To determine if Akt also regulates insulin-independent exocytosis, we used adrenal chromaffin cells, a popular neuronal model. Akt1 was the predominant isoform expressed in chromaffin cells, although lower levels of Akt2 and Akt3 were also found. Secretory stimuli in both intact and permeabilized cells induced Akt phosphorylation on serine 473, and the time course of Ca2+-induced Akt phosphorylation was similar to that of exocytosis in permeabilized cells. To determine if Akt modulated exocytosis, we transfected chromaffin cells with Akt constructs and monitored catecholamine release by amperometry. Wild-type Akt had no effect on the overall number of exocytotic events, but slowed the kinetics of catecholamine release from individual vesicles, resulting in an increased quantal size. This effect was due to phosphorylation by Akt, because it was not seen in cells transfected with kinase-dead mutant Akt. As overexpression of cysteine string protein (CSP) results in a similar alteration in release kinetics and quantal size, we determined if CSP was an Akt substrate. In vitro 32P-phosphorylation studies revealed that Akt phosphorylates CSP on serine 10. Using phospho-Ser10-specific antisera, we found that both transfected and endogenous cellular CSP is phosphorylated by Akt on this residue. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel role for Akt phosphorylation in regulating the late stages of exocytosis and suggest that this is achieved via the phosphorylation of CSP on serine 10.

Exocytosis is the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. Constitutive exocytosis, where fusion is apparently unregulated, is used by all cells to deliver integral membrane proteins to the plasma membrane, and for the secretion of various substances. In contrast, regulated exocytosis, where fusion is triggered by an intracellular signal, is characteristic of “professional” secretory cells that release material only on demand, such as neurons, endocrine, and exocrine cells (1Morgan A. Essays Biochem. 1995; 30: 77-95PubMed Google Scholar). Regulated exocytosis is not always used for secretion, however, because it is also an important mechanism for the stimulus-dependent insertion of cell surface receptors and transporters. In the great majority of cell types, the intracellular signal that triggers regulated exocytosis is an increase in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration. Although Ca2+ can be thought of as a near universal trigger for exocytosis, protein phosphorylation can be considered as an equally widespread modulator of regulated exocytosis (2Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Indeed, many studies over the past 20 years have shown that Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis is controlled by protein kinases and/or phosphatases in almost all cell types, including neurons (3Lindau M. Gomperts B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Hille B. Billiard J. Babcock D.F. Nguyen T. Koh D.S. J.

For example, activation of PKC has been shown to enhance exocytosis in exocrine pancreatic acinar cells (7O'Sullivan A.J. Jamieson J.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), endocrine adrenal chromaffin cells (8Knight D.E. Baker P.F. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and in various neuronal systems, including neuromuscular junctions (9Shapira R. Silberberg S.D. Ginsburg S. Rahamimoff R. Nature. 1987; 325: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), synaptosomes (10Coffey E.T. Sihra T.S. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol.

Likewise, activation of PKA increases exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells (7O'Sullivan A.J. Jamieson J.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), adrenal chromaffin cells (13Morgan A. Wilkinson M.C. Burgoyne R.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3747-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and neuronal preparations ranging from the squid giant synapse (14Hilfiker S. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. Augustine G.J. J.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 773-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Abundant evidence suggests that these effects of PKA and PKC are due to phosphorylation of components of the exocytotic machinery. Although the molecular details are not entirely clear, good candidates for such PKA substrates are cysteine string protein (CSP) (17Evans G.J.O. Wilkinson M.C. Graham M.E. Turner K.M.

PKA and PKC may not be the only kinases with a general function in modulating exocytosis, however. Recent studies have hinted that Akt/PKB may also be an important kinase in the control of regulated exocytosis. Akt is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, three isoforms of which have been identified in mammals (Akt1, -2, and -3; PKBα, -β, and -γ), which has important functions in the regulation of metabolism and cell fate (22Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Birnbaum M.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 444-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). A role for Akt in regulated exocytosis was first discovered in the insulin-stimulated exocytosis of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) containing vesicles. Expression of a constitutively active Akt construct stimulated GLUT4 translocation, whereas micro-injection of an Akt substrate peptide or an antibody to Akt inhibited translocation in adipocyte cell lines (23Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 24Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in transfected skeletal muscle myoblast cell lines, overexpression of constitutively active Akt1 was seen to increase GLUT4 translocation, whereas a dominant negative Akt1 construct inhibited translocation (25Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 26Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell.

Studies of Akt2 knock-out mice have revealed defects in glucose disposal due to an impairment of GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes, thus clearly demonstrating a physiological role for this Akt isoform in exocytosis (27Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw 3rd, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49530-49536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been shown that insulin secretion is inhibited in transgenic mice expressing a kinase-dead mutant Akt construct in pancreatic β cells (29Bernal-Mizrachi E. Fatrai S. Johnson J.D. Ohsugi M. Otani K. Han Z. Polonsky K.S. Permutt M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 928-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism(s) by which Akt regulates exocytosis is unknown, however. Here we report a novel role for Akt in regulating exocytotic release kinetics and quantal size in adrenal chromaffin cells. We also identify Akt as a cellular CSP kinase that phosphorylates CSP on Ser10, a residue that is essential for the alteration of exocytosis release kinetics and quantal size by CSP. Taken together, these findings suggest a mechanism whereby Akt phosphorylation of CSP on serine 10 regulates the late stages of exocytosis. Materials—Plasmids encoding wild-type and mutant constructs of CSP (pQE30-CSP1, pQE30-CSP1 (S10A), pcDNA3-myc-CSP1, and pcDNA3-myc-CSP1(S10A)) and Akt (pLNCX1-HA-AKT1, pLNCX1-HA-myr-AKT1, and pcDNA3-HA-AKT AAA) have been previously described (17Evans G.J.O.

Anti-pan-Akt and anti-phospho-Ser473-specific antisera were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-rabbit biotinylated antibody, [32P]ATP, and Hyperfilm ECL were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Streptavidin-Alexa 488, anti-mouse-Alexa 594, and anti-sheep-Alexa 350 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Synthetic peptides were generated by MWG Biotech (Milton-Keynes, UK). Lipofectamine was from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK), and protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were from Sigma. Recombinant Protein Purification and in Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Recombinant His6-CSP was expressed and purified as previously described (32Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation of His6-CSP was performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 15 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm NaVO43-, 0.03% Brij-35 for Akt, and in 50 mm MES, pH 6.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol for PKA. In both cases, 5 μg/ml purified kinase was added, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and unlabeled ATP to a final concentration of 100 μm. Samples were solubilized in Laemmli buffer, boiled, and run on SDS-PAGE. 32P incorporation was visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For peptide phosphorylation assays, Csp-(4–14)-peptides or Crosstide were used at 0.1–30 μm and incubated for 5 min with 0.5 μg/ml purified Akt. Under these conditions, the incorporation of phosphate was linear with respect to time and enzyme concentration. Reactions were terminated by spotting onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper followed by extensive washing in 5 mm orthophosphoric acid, and determination of incorporated 32P was by liquid scintillation counting. Kinetic parameters were calculated by linear regression of S/V versus S plots (S = substrate concentration, and V = initial rate of phosphorylation). Generation of CSP and Phospho-CSP Antisera—Rabbit polyclonal anti-serum to CSP has been previously described (30Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7320-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sheep polyclonal antiserum to CSP was generated by ProSci (Poway, CA) by immunization with recombinant purified His6-CSP protein. The generation of rabbit polyclonal phospho-CSP-specific antiserum is described elsewhere (33Evans G.J. Morgan A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 2671-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the phosphopeptide CQRQRSLpSTSGE, containing amino acid residues 4–14 of CSP with a phosphorylated serine at position 10, was used as an immunogen in rabbits. The resulting antiserum was affinity-purified using the P-CSP phosphopeptide coupled to an immobilized matrix. Specificity of detection in immunoblotting and immunofluorescence was demonstrated by preincubating antisera with recombinant purified His6-CSP protein, the P-CSP phosphopeptide, or an unphosphorylated CSP-(4–14)-peptide (CQRQRSLSTSGE). HEK293 Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryo kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with CSP, CSP(S10A), myr-Akt, and AAA-Akt plasmids using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. 36 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 8 h and then treated with or without 172 nm insulin for 20 min. The cells were chilled at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and collected in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton) with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation by Myc antibody. SDS-PAGE and immunoblots were performed using standard procedures. Chromaffin Cell Culture and Transfection—Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were isolated as previously described (17Evans G.J.O. Wilkinson M.C. Graham M.E. Turner K.M. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47877-47885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For transfection, cells were plated onto non-tissue culture-treated 10-cm Petri dishes and left overnight at 37 °C. Non-attached cells were resuspended in fresh growth medium at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Plasmid constructs were added to the chromaffin cell suspension at 20 μg/ml. For amperometry experiments, plasmids were co-transfected with a vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein to identify co-transfected cells. Cells were electroporated using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad), immediately diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and maintained in culture for 3–5 days. For secretion assays and Western blotting, cells were plated directly onto 24-well plates at a density of 1 million cells per well and maintained in culture for 3–6 days before use. Immunofluorescence—Chromaffin cells grown on collagen-coated cover slips were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 min and then permeabilized and blocked for nonspecific antibody binding in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies (mouse anti-HA-tag, sheep anti-CSP, or rabbit anti-phospho-CSP) were applied for 2 h at room temperature, and then the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. For triple labeling studies, anti-phospho-CSP antisera was incubated first, followed by anti-CSP to prevent epitope masking by the anti-CSP antiserum, which was raised against the full-length recombinant protein. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h followed by washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline; then streptavidin-fluorophore was added for 30 min. Coverslips were washed, air-dried, and mounted on slides in anti-fade glycerol (90% glycerol, 0.25% triethylenediamine, 0.002% p-phenylenediamine). For conventional fluorescence microscopy, staining was visualized with a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope, and images were acquired using a Nikon Coolpix 995 digital camera. For confocal microscopy, staining was visualized using a Leica AOBS TCS SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 63× oil immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1.2. The following fluorophores and parameters were used: 416 nm excitation and 506 nm light collection for Alexa-350; 476 nm excitation and 500–581 nm light collection for Alexa-488; and 606 nm excitation and 757 nm light collection for Alexa 594. For quantification of fluorescence, the region of interest was defined, and the CSP (blue) and P-CSP (green) signals were quantified using the Leica confocal software. The ratio of P-CSP:CSP was then calculated after subtraction of background fluorescence. At least 10 cells were imaged and quantified for each condition. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t test. Single Cell Amperometric Recording—Electrophysiological recording conditions were as described previously (34Barclay J.W. Craig T.J. Fisher R.J. Ciufo L.F. Evans G.J.O. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10538-10545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in bath buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm PIPES, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5) and a 5-μm-diameter carbon fiber was positioned in contact with the target cell. Exocytosis was stimulated with a permeabilization/stimulation buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 μm digitonin, and 10 μm free Ca2+, pH 6.5) pressure-ejected from a glass pipette on the opposite side of the cell. Amperometric responses were monitored with a VA-10 amplifier (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany) and saved to a computer using Axoscope 8 (Axon Instruments). Experiments were carried out in parallel on control (untransfected cells) and transfected cells from the same batch of cells in the same cell culture dishes. Transfected cells were identified by expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein. Previous studies have established that 95% of cells co-express proteins from both plasmids in the transfection (35Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recordings of both control and transfected cells used the same carbon fibers to eliminate any potential effects of inter-fiber variability. Amperometric data were exported from Axoscope and analyzed using Origin (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). Amperometric spikes were selected for analysis provided that the spike amplitude exceeded 40 pA, to remove any confounding effects of diffusion by selecting those fusion events not occurring directly beneath the carbon fiber end. Individual spikes were analyzed for total charge released (measured by the integral of the spike), amplitude (the height from baseline to peak), rise time (time from spike onset to peak), and fall time (time from spike peak to return to baseline). Spike frequency (spikes per cell) was calculated as the number of exocytotic events within the 210 s of recording time. All data presented are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences were assessed with nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests. Population Secretion Assays—Assays of bulk exocytosis from populations of cultured cells were performed as previously described (13Morgan A. Wilkinson M.C. Burgoyne R.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3747-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For intact cells, cells were incubated in Krebs buffer in the presence or absence of nicotine; for permeabilized cells, cells were incubated in permeabilization/stimulation buffer or in the same buffer with no added Ca2+. Catecholamine release was assayed using a fluorometric assay and expressed as the percentage of total cellular catecholamine. To determine which Akt isoforms are expressed in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE alongside recombinant Akt protein standards and Western blotted with isoform-specific Akt antibodies (Fig. 1A). Anti-Akt1 gave a readily detectable band in chromaffin cells, equivalent to between 5 and 10 ng of recombinant Akt1. This antibody was not entirely specific, however, as bands of lesser intensity were also detected using 10 ng of Akt2 and Akt3 (Fig. 1A, upper panel). In contrast, the Akt2 and Akt3 antibodies were absolutely specific for their corresponding recombinant protein. The Akt2 and Akt3 signals in chromaffin cells were much lower than those seen with 5 ng of recombinant Akt2/3. Therefore, the partial cross-reactivity of anti-Akt1 with Akt2/3 can at most account for only a small proportion of the staining intensity seen with anti-Akt1. We therefore concluded that Akt1 is the predominant isoform expressed by bovine chromaffin cells, although lower levels of Akt2 and -3 are also present. Exocytosis is triggered by Ca2+ in chromaffin cells, so we investigated whether secretory stimuli resulted in activation of cellular Akt. To do this we treated cells with nicotine, which activates acetylcholine receptors and triggers Ca2+ entry through channels to elicit exocytosis. Akt activity was assayed by Western blotting of cell lysates with a phospho-Ser473-specific antibody. Nicotine treatment resulted in a clear increase in phospho-Akt staining, despite no change in total Akt levels (Fig. 1B, left panel). To determine if Ca2+ directly drives Akt activation, we used digitonin-permeabilized cells. Application of 10 μm Ca2+, the optimal concentration for triggering exocytosis, again resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, right panel). To determine the time course of Akt activation relative to secretion, we simultaneously monitored catecholamine release and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1, C and D). Both processes followed broadly similar time courses, with Ca2+-induced Akt phosphorylation being detectable within 2 min of stimulation. To determine if Akt regulates exocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells, we transfected cell cultures with HA-tagged Akt1 constructs and analyzed individual exocytotic release events using carbon fiber amperometry. Transfected cells were visualized by the endogenous fluorescence of an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid that was co-transfected as a marker. After stimulation of regulated exocytosis with digitonin and calcium, transient spikes of catecholamine oxidation were recorded, indicative of individual chromaffin granule fusion events (Fig. 2A). Transfection of wild-type Akt had no significant effect on the frequency of exocytotic fusion events elicited (Fig. 2B). In contrast, analysis of individual exocytotic events revealed a 43% increase in the amount of catecholamine released per fusion event (Fig. 2C). This increased quantal size was due to a slowing of catecholamine release kinetics, as evidenced by an increase in both the rise- and fall-time of amperometric spikes (Fig. 2, D and E). Transfection of a myristoylated, constitutively active form of Akt produced a similar increase in quantal size of individual fusion events and likewise had no effect on overall frequency of release events (data not shown). To confirm that the Akt constructs were active upon transfection into chromaffin cells, double label immunofluorescence was used. Total transfected Akt was visualized using a HA tag antibody (red), while active Akt was visualized using a phospho-Ser473-specific antibody (green). A clear increase in cellular activated Akt (as defined by phospho-Ser473 immunoreactivity) was seen in all HA-positive cells transfected with wt-Akt (Fig. 2F) or constitutively active Akt (data not shown). To establish whether these effects of Akt on exocytosis were due to Akt phosphorylation of target proteins, or alternatively reflected a kinase-independent function, we transfected chromaffin cells with a mutant Akt construct, AAA-Akt. This construct encodes Akt1 containing three point mutations: K179A, T308A, and S473A. These mutations result in a kinase-dead, phosphorylation-deficient form of Akt that has been shown to act as a dominant negative mutant in some cell types (26Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Stimulation of AAA-Akt-transfected cells by digitonin and calcium again resulted in transient spikes of catecholamine release due to exocytosis (Fig. 3A). As with wild-type Akt, there was no statistically significant effect on the overall frequency of exocytotic fusion events (Fig. 3B). In pointed contrast to wt-Akt, however, no significant changes in charge, rise time or fall time were observed upon transfection of AAA-Akt (Fig. 3, C–E). These data strongly suggest that the effect of Akt on quantal size and the kinetics of exocytotic release requires Akt kinase activity. To rule out the possibility that the AAA mutant was not stably expressed in the transfected cells, transfected Akt was visualized using an HA tag antibody (Fig. 3F, red). Similar transfection efficiency and fluorescence intensity was seen for both AAA-Akt and wt-Akt, thus ruling out this trivial explanation. In contrast to wt-Akt, however, no increase in phospho-Ser473 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3F, green) was apparent in AAA-Akt-transfected cells, as predicted for this mutant protein. Transfection of CSP in chromaffin cells has two effects on exocytosis as measured by amperometry: a reduction in the frequency of exocytotic fusion events and an increased quantal size as a result of a slowing of release kinetics (36Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This latter effect on quantal size (but not the effect on frequency) is abolished in a mutant CSP(S10A) construct that cannot be phosphorylated on serine 10 (17Evans G.J.O. Wilkinson M.C. Graham M.E. Turner K.M. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47877-47885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Table 1). This raised the possibility that the similar effect of Akt and CSP transfection in amperometry was due to direct Akt phosphorylation of CSP on this residue. A comparison of the coding sequence of CSP with the minimal Akt consensus phosphorylation motif revealed a potential Akt phosphorylation site at serine 10 (Fig. 4A), the same residue that is phosphorylated in vitro by PKA (17Evans G.J.O.

An in vitro kinase assay using activated Akt and recombinant purified CSP in the presence of 32P-labeled ATP was then set up to test this experimentally. As can be seen in Fig. 4B, 32P was readily incorporated into wild-type CSP, indicating phosphorylation by Akt. However, when the assay was performed"

Molecular study of the MEC channel complex has outlined a premier model for mechanically gated channels and has provided mechanistic understanding of the physiological basis of the sense of touch. Although the normal physiological actions of DEG/ENaC channels are essential for diverse functions, exacerbated activation of these channels can be severely neurotoxic. In the case of the C. elegans MEC touch channel, large side chain amino acid substitutions near the MEC-4 channel pore enhance Na+ and Ca2+ conductance significantly (30Goodman M.B. Ernstrom G.G.

When mouse ASIC1a is hyperactivated in the brain by local acidosis consequent to arterial occlusion (which models ischemia/stroke), brain neurons die in large numbers, a channel toxicity that is on par with glutamate receptor channel excitotoxicity under the same circumstances (33Xiong Z.G.

Disruption of ASIC1a dramatically ameliorates this neuronal death. ENaC channel hyperactivity can be accomplished by another molecular mechanism, assembly of excess functional channels at the plasma membrane.

Taken together, these findings underscore the profound therapeutic importance of understanding the molecular nature of both the normal and hyperactivated functions of DEG/ENaC channels. One advantage of studying the nematode DEG/ENaCs is the capacity to conduct extensive genetic characterization of these channels within a physiological context. To identify molecular requirements for mec-4(d)-induced necrosis, we screened for genetic suppressors of neuronal death. One major suppressor class we isolated includes intragenic second site changes that maintain the channel hyperactivating mec-4(d) substitution (A713V) but have a second site mec-4 mutation that otherwise disrupts channel activity. Here we report on characterization of 22 intragenic mec-4 mutations. We focus on one distinctive mec-4 allele (mec-4(u231bz2)) in which the dramatic swelling associated with necrosis can occur, but some neurons can recover to survive. We show that the genetic change encoded by mec-4(u231bz2) alters an intracellular C-terminal residue that influences channel trafficking or stability. Moreover, this substitution (MEC-4(A745T)) renders necrosis strongly temperature-inducible. We discuss implications for structure/function/regulation of neuronally expressed DEG/ENaCs and expand understanding of in vivo mechanisms of necrosis induction.

Integrated lines were outcrossed at least 3× before further constructions. bzIs8 appeared X-linked because crossing bzIs8 males to N2 hermaphrodites yielded 70/70 males that were not fluorescent. Three factor mapping positioned bzIs8 at approximately +18 on the X chromosome. Mutagenesis strain ZB1081 bzIs8 [pmec-4GFP +pMJ23(lin-15)] mec-4(u231)] X was constructed by recombining in mec-4(u231) using standard genetic approaches. Our screen used nematode strain ZB1081, harboring the mec-4(d) mutation and expressing a GFP transgene exclusively in touch neurons (pmec-4GFP). In this strain, the GFP signal is absent because of the death of the touch neurons. L4/young adult animals were mutagenized using ethane methyl sulfonate (EMS) according to standard protocols (38Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). F1 animals were distributed onto individual plates and allowed to self-fertilize. Four days later, about 20 F2 animals from each plate were screened on a Nikon fluorescent microscope for fluorescent touch cells. Individuals with multiple fluorescent touch cells were cloned out so that stocks of candidate homozygous suppressor mutants with most animals harboring >3 fluorescent touch cells were generated for further study. Eighty-five mutants were isolated using a COPAS BIOSORT (Complex Object Parametric Analyzer and Sorter) from Union Biometrica. Mutations were mapped using standard procedures (38Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and identified by sequence of PCR products. Primers used for sequencing were: 5′-GGC TGC TAC CGT TCT TGC TTC C-3′ and 5′-GAG AAC GGA GCA ATG GTG GAA G-3′. General Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopy, we immobilized L1, L4, and young adult nematodes with 20 mm NaN3 and screened for fluorescent touch cells in L1 or L4 animal at ×20, ×40, ×60, or ×100 magnification. Because in some animals GFP signal persisted faintly even in dying neurons, we scored PLMs as alive when they expressed bright GFP, and neuronal processes were clearly visible. We scored for swollen necrotic-like PLM touch neurons by examining tails of L1 stage larvae with DIC microscopy as described (39Driscoll M. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 323-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For the experiment in which individual animals were scored at L1 and then at the L4 stage, we immobilized L1 worms in drops of 17% ethanol in M9 placed on 8-well teflon-ringed slides. The L1 worms were then recovered to standard nematode growth medium (NGM) plates and scored at the L4 stage for glowing PLM tail cells. Photographs were taken by a digital camera mounted on a Zeiss Axioplan 2. Temperature sensitivity assays of mec-4(u231) versus mec-4(u231bz2) genetic strains and bzEx10 [Pmec-4(u231)::GFP]inN2, as well as bzEx11[Pmec-4(u231bz2::GFP)] in null mutant mec-4(u253) were conducted as follows. Strains were grown at 15 and 25 °C. Extragenic transformants were maintained by picking animals that expressed the PMYO-2::GFP co-injection marker. After at least one generation, L4 worms were scored at 40× for glowing PLM tail cells. For puncta counts, processes from L4 bzEx12[PMEC-4::GFP]in mec-4(u253) and bzEx13[PMEC-4(bz2)::GFP] in null mec-4(u253) were photographed at ×40 and the puncta within 10 cell body lengths of the cell body were counted. C. elegans Strains, Growth, and Touch Assay—Nematode strains were maintained at 20 °C unless otherwise stated on NGM seeded with Escherichia coli strain OP50 as food source (38Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For bz2 GFP expression studies, plasmids were injected into Bristol (N2) and mec-4(u253)(mec-4-null) strains. We performed gentle touch tests by stroking the body at anterior and posterior positions with an eyelash as described (40Chalfie M. Sulston J. Dev. Biol. 1981; 82: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Molecular Biology—The pmec-4GFP vector was created by introducing a HindIII/BamHI fragment including the mec-4 promoter into vector pPD95.77, which includes enhanced GFP (constructed by Scott Clark, NYU). The BamHI fragment was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at the mec-4 initiation codon. PMEC-4::GFP was constructed by subcloning a 4.7-kb HindIII-BamHI fragment from plasmid TU44 (41Mitani S. Du H. Hall D.H. Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Development. 1993; 119: 773-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which includes mec-4 promoter and coding sequences except for those encoding the last 7 amino acids, into pPD95.77 (Fire lab vector kit, Ref. 42Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The PMEC-4(u231)::GFP and PMEC-4(u231bz2)::GFP were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using PMEC-4::GFP as template. mec-2, mec-4(d), and mec-10(d) cDNAs subcloned into pGEM-HE or pSGEM, a gift from the Chalfie laboratory (30Goodman M.B. Ernstrom G.G. Chelur D.S. O'Hagan R. Yao C.A. Chalfie M. Nature. 2002; 415: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), were amplified using the SMC4 bacterial strain (30Goodman M.B. Ernstrom G.G. Chelur D.S. O'Hagan R. Yao C.A. Chalfie M. Nature. 2002; 415: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The A745T mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit). Oocyte Expression and Electrophysiology—Capped RNAs were synthesized using T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion), purified (Qiagen RNAeasy columns), and run on denaturating agarose gels to check for size and cRNA integrity. cRNA quantification was then performed spectroscopically. Stage V-VI oocytes were manually defolliculated after selecting them among multistaged oocytes dissected by a 2-h collagenase treatment (2 mg/ml in Ca2+-free OR2 solution) from Xenopus laevis ovaries (NASCO). Oocytes were incubated in OR2 media, which consists of 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter polyvinyl pyrrolidine, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. Oocytes were then injected with 52 nl of cRNA mix for a final amount of 5 ng/oocyte of each cRNA except for MEC-6, which was injected at the concentration of 1 ng/oocyte. Oocytes were incubated in OR2 at 20 °C for 4 days before recording. Currents were measured 4–10 days after cRNA injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (GeneClamp 500B, Axon Instruments) at room temperature. Electrodes (0.3–1 m) were filled with 3 m KCl, and oocytes were perfused with a NaCl solution containing (in mm): NaCl (100), KCl (2), CaCl2 (1), MgCl2 (2), HEPES (10), pH 7.2 or with a CaCl2 solution containing CaCl2 (73), KCl (2), HEPES (10), pH 7.2. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem. We used the pCLAMP suite of programs (Axon Instruments) for data acquisition and analysis. Currents were filtered at 200 Hz and sampled at 1 kHz. Immunocytochemistry—Staining of oocytes was performed following previously reported procedures (31Bianchi L. Gerstbrein B. Frokjaer-Jensen C. Royal D.C. Mukherjee G. Royal M.A. Xue J. Schafer W.R. Driscoll M. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 43Bianchi L. Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Surewicz K.A. Dennis A.T. Memmi M. Schwartz P.J. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H3003-H3011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 days after injection, oocytes were fixed at 4 °C overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde. The next day, oocytes were washed four times for 5 min each in PBS, imbedded in low melting point agarose (3% in PBS), and cut in 50-μm thick slices using a vibrotome. Slices were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 and subsequently incubated with anti-MEC-4 antibody directed against amino acids 527–539 in the extracellular loop ((44Lai C.C. Hong K. Kinnell M. Chalfie M. Driscoll M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)1:50 in 1% bovine serum albumin dissolved in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. Slices were washed three times for 5 min with PBS and incubated with Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. After slices were washed three times for 5 min in PBS, they were mounted with VECTOREX medium (Vector) and photographed using a Zeiss Axiplan 2 microscope equipped with digital camera. Images were analyzed and mounted with Adobe Photoshop. Suppressors of mec-4(d)-induced Neurodegeneration Include Intragenic Mutations That Disrupt MEC-4 Function—With a goal of defining genes required for mec-4(d)-induced necrosis, we screened for novel mutations that block or delay the death of the touch receptor neurons in a mec-4(d) mutant background. We expressed GFP exclusively in the six touch neurons using the mec-4 promoter (reporter bzIs8[pmec-4GFP]) (Fig. 1A). We then introduced mec-4(d) (allele mec-4(u231)) into the bzIs8 background (Fig. 1B) and compared neuronal survival in the L4/young adult stage by counting fluorescent touch neurons. mec-4(d) induces necrosis efficiently in the bzIs8[pmec-4GFP] line such that 94% animals (n>200) lack any detectable fluorescent touch neurons and the remaining 6% have only one fluorescent touch cell (nearly always the PVM neuron that functionally differs from the other touch cells (45Chalfie M. Sulston J.E. White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 956-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1C). We confirmed that the extent of touch neuron degeneration, as scored by the presence of swollen PLM touch neurons in the L1 larval stage, was tightly correlated with the lack of fluorescent touch neurons in L4 or adult stage animals as we had previously documented (31Bianchi L. Gerstbrein B. Frokjaer-Jensen C. Royal D.C. Mukherjee G. Royal M.A. Xue J. Schafer W.R. Driscoll M. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 46Chung S.

Open table in a new tab We reasoned that touch neurons genetically spared from death (but still able to express mec-4) would be easily identified by their restored fluorescence in the bzIs8[pmec-4GFP];mec-4(d) background (Fig. 1D). We therefore treated this strain with EMS and screened ∼76,000 mutagenized genomes for rare F2 progeny with multiple fluorescent touch neurons, initially scoring manually at high magnification, and later scoring with assistance of a COPAS BIOSORT, which can identify and sort animals based on differential fluorescence scores. We identified 110 strains that exhibit partial or complete suppression of necrosis. Intragenic Death Suppressor Mutations Alter Multiple Amino Acids within and near the Channel Pore—We expected that second site intragenic mutations in mec-4(d) that disrupt function of the MEC-4 channel subunit would constitute one death suppressor class and that intragenic mutations should have genetic properties of X-linked recessive loss-of-function mec-4 alleles (i.e. mec-4(+)/mec-4(u231bzx) trans-heterozygotes should be touch-sensitive, where x indicates the new intragenic mutation). In addition, we anticipated that most intragenic mec-4 loss-of-function alleles should express GFP strongly in all six touch receptor neurons. 80 necrosis suppressor alleles had these genetic properties, and we therefore considered them strong candidates for second site mutations in mec-4(u231). To determine if amino acid changes near or within the MEC-4 channel pore were encoded by any intragenic mec-4 alleles, we sequenced the mec-4 genomic sequence over an interval that included coding regions of part of the third extracellular Cys-rich domain, the transmembrane channel pore, and the cytosolic C-terminus (see Ref. 47Hong K. Mano I. Driscoll M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2575-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for details of domain structure). We identified single nucleotide changes in 22 mec-4(d) suppressor alleles, 14 of which encode single amino acid substitutions, 2 of which encode frame-shifts, 2 of which encode stop codons, and 4 of which alter splicing sites (TABLE TWO). Our data confirm that intragenic null mutations and other likely loss-of-function mutations constitute a significant death suppressor class isolated in our screen. In addition, we identify several residues previously unknown to be critical for function of the hyperactivated mec-4(d) channel, including the first EMS-induced mutations affecting the MEC-4 C terminus. We note implications of specific changes for channel structure/function in greater detail in the “Discussion.”TABLE TWOEMS-induced intragenic suppressor mec-4(d) mutations that alter the genome sequence in the vicinity of the MEC-4 pore-encoding regionAlleleMutation siteBase changeAlterationLocationbz1492956C-TR601CExtracellularbz1833055G-AR619KExtracellularbz1953103ΔCS635F frameshiftExtracellularbz1333116G-A5′-AGGTRAGExtracellularbz1343116G-A5′-AGGTRAGExtracellularbz1433116G-A5′-AGGTRAGExtracellularbz943194C-TP643LExtracellularbz1043220C-TP655LExtracellularbz1123230G-AW658StopExtracellularbz1503246C-TQ664StopExtracellularbz1223349G-A3′-TTTCAGRExtracellularbz1593406C-TT701IExtracellularbz1733590G-AG716SPorebz113593G-AG717EPorebz1653602G-AG720DPorebz1393611G-AC723YPorebz453620C-TS726FPorebz1013625C-TL728FPorebz1843629C-TT729IPorebz83658G-AL739EPorebz1793748T-Astop769R, 7 AA extensionC terminusbz23676G-AA745TC terminusa The underlined nucleotide is changed to A causing loss of the splice site.

https://openalex.org/W2033514025,"Sex hormones have emerged as important modulators of cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology. Our previous studies demonstrated that testosterone increases expression and activity of L-type, voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav1.2) in coronary arteries of males. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether testosterone (T) alters coronary protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) expression and whether PKCδ plays a role in coronary Cav1.2 expression. For in vitro studies, porcine right coronary arteries (RCA) and post-confluent (passages 3-6) 5-day, serum-restricted coronary smooth muscle cell cultures (CSMC) were incubated in the presence and absence of T or dihydrotestosterone (10 and 100 nm) for 18 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. For sex and endogenous testosterone-dependent effects, RCA were obtained from intact males, castrated males, castrated males with T replacement, and intact females. In vitro T and dihydrotestosterone caused an ∼2-3-fold increase in PKCδ protein levels, ∼1.5-2-fold increase in PKCδ kinase activity, and localization of PKCδ toward the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope. PKCδ protein levels were higher in coronary arteries of intact males compared with intact females. Elimination of endogenous testosterone by castration reduced RCA PKCδ protein levels, an effect partially (∼45%) reversed by exogenous T (castrated males with T replacement). In CSMC, PKC inhibition with either the general PKC inhibitor, cheylerythrine, or the putative PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin, completely inhibited the T-mediated increase in coronary Cav1.2 protein levels. Conversely, Go6976, a conventional PKC isoform inhibitor, failed to inhibit T-induced increases in coronary Cav1.2 protein levels. PKCδ short interference RNA completely blocked T-induced increases in Cav1.2 protein levels in CSMC. These results demonstrate for the first time that 1) endogenous T is a primary modulator of coronary PKCδ protein and activity in males and 2) T increases Cav1.2 protein expression in a PKCδ-dependent manner.

Coronary heart disease is a major cause of global mortality and represents an underlying cause for most heart attacks and sudden death (1American Heart Association (2003) Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-Update, DallasGoogle Scholar). Men 30-50 years of age have an increased incidence of coronary heart disease compared with women of similar age (2Alexandersen P. Haarbo J. Christiansen C. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 125: 1-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 3Barrett-Connor E. Khaw K.T.

However, recent clinical studies have failed to support a detrimental effect of testosterone on coronary heart disease (5Sieminska L. Wojciechowska C. Swietochowska E. Marek B. Kos-Kudla B.

Men with low testosterone levels are often more obese, hypertensive, and have increased blood glucose and serum cholesterol levels and increased carotid artery atherosclerosis with diabetes (5Sieminska L.

Szymczak J. Jedrzejuk D. Kuliczkowski W. Salomon P. Nowicki P. Aging Male. 2004; 7: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that low levels of total testosterone, testosterone/estradiol ratio, and free androgen index are associated with coronary artery disease in men. These findings underscore the need to fully understand the effects of testosterone on coronary vascular wall biology.Sex hormones exert multiple and diverse effects on the vascular wall. Both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells express estrogen (8Karas R.H. Patterson B.L. Mendelsohn M.E. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1943-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and androgen receptors (9Higashiura K. Mathur R.S. Halushka P.V. J. Cardiovasc.

We recently provided the first evidence for an increased L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav1.2) current in coronary artery smooth muscle of male swine compared with females (11Bowles D.K. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we demonstrated that coronary Cav1.2 expression and activity are stimulated by endogenous testosterone in males (12Bowles D.K. Maddali K.K. Ganjam V.K. Rubin L.J. Tharp D.L. Turk J.R. Heaps C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2091-H2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

Thus, endogenous testosterone increases Cav1.2 expression in porcine coronary smooth muscle cells. However, the mechanisms by which androgens elevate Cav1.2 protein levels in males are poorly understood.Many aspects of vascular smooth muscle biology, including contraction, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and myogenic responses, share common signaling pathways involving the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (13Andrea J.E. Walsh M.P. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 14Khalil R.A. Lajoie C. Resnick M.S. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C714-C719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, acute activation of PKC with phorbol esters increases Ca2+ influx in vascular smooth muscle, purportedly via PKC-dependent activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (15Itoh H. Yamamura S. Ware J.A. Zhuang S. Mii S. Liu B. Kent K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H359-H370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Obejero-Paz C.A. Auslender M. Scarpa A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C535-C543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kanashiro et al. (17Kanashiro C.A. Khalil R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C34-C45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed an increased expression and activity of PKCα, -δ, and -ζ in aortas from intact males and ovariectomized females compared with intact females, revealing an isoform-specific effect of sex hormones, specifically estrogen, to PKC expression and activity. We previously reported a 4-fold greater expression of PKCδ protein levels in male coronary arteries compared with females, a sex difference that was eliminated by castration of males (18Korzick D.H. Rishel M.E. Bowles D.K. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 2005; 37: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), suggesting increased PKCδ levels in males might be driven by male sex hormones, e.g. testosterone.Despite evidence for an important regulatory role of PKC in vasoreactivity and vascular disease progression, to our knowledge no information exists regarding androgen effects on PKCδ expression and its role in coronary Cav1.2 protein expression. In the present study, we therefore compared expression, activity, and subcellular distribution of PKCδ in coronary smooth muscle following testosterone (T) stimulation and, in addition, tested the hypothesis that testosterone-induced increases in Cav1.2 were PKCδ dependent. The results demonstrate that androgens increase both PKCδ activity and expression, which serve as a mandatory intermediate for testosterone-induced increases in Cav1.2 protein levels.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—Sexually mature male and female Yucatan swine were obtained from the breeder (Sinclair Research Farm; Columbia, MO) and housed in pens at the College of Veterinary Medicine. Animal protocols were approved by the University of Missouri Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the “Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training” as described previously (12Bowles D.K. Maddali K.K. Ganjam V.K. Rubin L.J. Tharp D.L. Turk J.R. Heaps C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2091-H2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Castration and Hormone Replacement—Data for PKCδ in swine with altered hormone status were obtained from coronary arteries of swine utilized in a previous study (12Bowles D.K.

Maddali K.K. Ganjam V.K. Rubin L.J. Tharp D.L. Turk J.R. Heaps C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2091-H2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), castration (orchiectomy) and hormone replacement were performed by the Swine Hormone Core within the National Center for Gender Physiology. One week after arrival, sexually mature animals (6-7 months of age) were castrated with aseptic techniques under sedation with xylazine (15 mg/kg im) and ketamine (2.5 mg/kg intramuscular) and maintained under anesthesia with 1.5-2.0% isoflurane. Males were castrated (CM) via an incision made through the scrotum over each testicle (intact males; IM) and subsequently randomized to receive testosterone replacement (CMT; 10 mg/day; Androgel, Solvay Pharmaceuticals) or vehicle. Testosterone replacement occurred at the time of castration to avoid disruption of hormonal influence. Females remained gonadally intact. Animals were euthanized for study 5-6 weeks after surgery.Isolation of Coronary Arteries—Miniature swine were anesthetized with ketamine (35 mg/kg), rompun (2.25 mg/kg), and pentothal sodium (10 mg/kg) followed by administration of heparin (1000 units/kg). Swine were euthanized by removal of the heart, and the heart was placed in 4 °C PSS. The right coronary artery (RCA) was isolated, cleaned of fat and connective tissue, and placed in low Ca2+ physiological saline solution containing 20 mm HEPES at 4 °C.Coronary Artery Culture and Treatment—An intact coronary artery tissue culture model was used to study sex hormone effects on coronary artery smooth muscle in vitro as modified from Hill et al. (19Hill B.J. Katwa L.C. Wamhoff B.R. Sturek M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 484-491PubMed Google Scholar) and Maddali et al. (20Maddali K.K. Korzick D.H. Turk J.R. Bowles D.K. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2005; 42: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). RCA (intact vessels) were cut into 1-cm rings and incubated for 18 h in the presence and absence of testosterone (0 and 100 nm) or DHT (10 and 100 nm) in serum-free, phenol-free RPMI 1640 medium (SFM) with l-glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator.Coronary Smooth Muscle Cell Cultures and Treatment—Primary cell cultures (passages 3-6) of medial CSMC were obtained from the RCA. Post-confluent, 5-day serum-restricted cells were treated with varying doses of testosterone (10 and 100 nm) or DHT (10 and 100 nm) for 18 h in SFM at 37 °C in a humidified chamber.Immunoblots—Protein levels were determined using standard immunoblots as described by our laboratory (12Bowles D.K. Maddali K.K. Ganjam V.K. Rubin L.J. Tharp D.L. Turk J.R. Heaps C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2091-H2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Korzick D.H. Rishel M.E. Bowles D.K. Med. Sci.

Membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies overnight at 4 °C as follows: PKCα(1:1000), -ϵ(1:1000), -δ(1:1000), -ζ(1:1200), β-actin (1:3000), and Cav1.2 (1:400). Enhanced chemiluminescence techniques were used to visualize the immunoblots according to the manufacturer's protocol (ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences). Digitized images of the luminograms were used for densitometric measurements with Scion Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) with care taken to prevent saturation.Kinase Activity Assays—Kinase activity levels were determined using standard PKC kinase activity assays as described (17Kanashiro C.A. Khalil R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C34-C45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intact vessels (RCA) and CSMC treated with T or DHT were homogenized or lysed, respectively, in phosphorylation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin A, 10% v/v glycerol, and 0.25% Triton X-100). Homogenates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against PKCδ using protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). The immunocomplexes were washed three times with phosphorylation lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm Mgcl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mg of phosphatidylserine, and 20 mm ATP, 25 mm Mgcl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 mg of histone H1, and then 20-30 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP was added. The reaction was incubated for 15-30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of histone H1 was detected by autoradiography.Immunocytofluorescence—Freshly dispersed coronary smooth muscle cells were obtained enzymatically from RCA segments as previously described (20Maddali K.K. Korzick D.H. Turk J.R. Bowles D.K. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2005; 42: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed on polylysine-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences) in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline plus 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum for 30 min. Cells were washed and incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies for PKCδ (1:1000) and tagged with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were visualized with the nuclear dye, propidium iodide (5 × 10-5 m, 10 min; Molecular Probes). Images were obtained using a ×60 water immersion objective (1.2 NA) on an Olympus IX-70 (Tokyo, Japan) inverted microscope coupled with a Bio-Rad Radiance-2000 confocal system.

Specificity of secondary antibody was verified in all experiments by addition of secondary antibody in the absence of primary antibody, which showed no fluorescent signal (not shown). Cells prepared from five animals were dispersed onto eight slides. Approximately 40-50 cells were imaged for PKCδ isoform, and representative images were presented.PKCδ siRNA Protocol—Transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Briefly, 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 20 pm PKCδ siRNA or control siRNA pool (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were diluted in 250 μl of serum-free phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated at room temperature for not more than 5 min. The diluted siRNA pools were then mixed with the diluted Lipofectamine 2000 and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. For transfection, post-confluent cells were subcultured at 90% confluence and serum starved for 2 days. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 6 h with siRNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes. After the transfection period, the medium was removed, the wells were washed twice with SFM, and 2 ml of fresh SFM was added. The cultures were then allowed to recover for 48 h with SFM changes every 24 h. At the end of the 48-h recovery period, the cells in 1-2 wells from each siRNA group (control and PKCδ) were harvested and cell numbers were evaluated. The remaining wells in each group were either treated with ethanol (vehicle controls) or T (100 nm). The total treatment time was 18 h. The cells in each group were collected, pelleted, and used for immunoblots analysis. All the siRNA experiments were conducted in serum-free medium containing no antimicrobials.Materials—The following were purchased from Sigma: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin A, glycerol, Laemelli buffer, Triton X-100, bovine serum albumin (fraction V), soybean trypsin inhibitor (type I-S), testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone. Collagenase (CLS II) and elastase were purchased from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ). RPMI 1640 medium, phosphate-buffered saline, goat serum, and rabbit serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Antibodies to PKC isoforms were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody to Cav1.2 was purchased from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). Molecular mass markers and Tris-HCl gels were purchased from Bio-Rad. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and ECL Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences.Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons among treatment groups were made using analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc analyses when indicated. A p value ≤0.05 was set as the criterion for significance in all comparisons.RESULTSTo determine whether the sex differences in PKCδ expression were driven by testosterone, we examined the influence of sex on PKCδ protein in an in vivo model. As we have previously demonstrated (18Korzick D.H. Rishel M.E. Bowles D.K. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 2005; 37: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), males were found to have greater PKCδ compared with intact females (Fig. 1). Castration markedly reduced PKCδ protein levels in males, whereas testosterone replacement partially (∼45%) prevented the loss of protein due to castration (Fig. 1). Thus, endogenous testosterone increases coronary PKCδ protein and likely contributes to greater PKCδ protein levels in coronary arteries of males.To further investigate the mechanism of testosterone stimulation of PKCδ protein expression (Fig. 1), we determined the effects of testosterone on PKCδ protein levels in an in vitro cell culture model and organ culture model (intact RCA). For this, PKCδ expression was determined in homogenates obtained from intact RCA and post-confluent, 5-day serum-restricted coronary smooth muscle cells incubated with testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. In intact vessels, both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone produced similar, concentration-dependent increases in PKCδ protein with a maximal response of ∼2.5- and ∼3.5-fold, respectively, at 100 nm (Fig. 2, A and C). We observed a similar response in CSMC (Fig. 2, B and D), whereby PKCδ protein levels increased ∼2.3- and ∼3.6-fold following testosterone and dihydrotestosterone treatment, respectively. Together with intact vessel data, these results confirm the up-regulation of PKCδ protein levels by testosterone. In vivo, testosterone can be converted to either estrogen or dihydrotestosterone by aromatase or 5-α reductase, respectively. Dihydrotestosterone is a non-aromatizable androgen that acts through binding to the androgen receptor. The similar effects of testosterone and DHT on PKCδ protein levels provide strong evidence that testosterone conversion to estrogen by aromatization is not necessary for these observed effects of testosterone on PKCδ.FIGURE 2Testosterone and DHT increase coronary PKCδ protein in vitro. Densitometric analysis of in vitro effects of testosterone (A and B) and dihydrotestosterone (C and D) on PKCδ protein (n = 5). Right coronary arterial segments (A and C) and CSMC (B and D) were incubated for 18 h in the absence or presence of hormones. Densitometric bands for each sample were normalized to the average control value obtained from the same blot. Inset, representative immunoblot showing right coronary artery whole cell homogenates and CSMC whole cell homogenates probed with anti-PKCδ antibody from control C, testosterone (10 and 100 nm T; panels A and B) and dihydrotestosterone (10 and 100 nm DHT; panels C and D) groups. PKCδ-positive band appeared at ∼80 kDa. Both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone increased PKCδ protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner in both right coronary arteries and CSMC. Values are mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 versus all.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether testosterone affects PKCδ kinase activity, PKCδ protein was immunoprecipitated from homogenates of intact vessels and cultured CSMC treated with testosterone (10 or 100 nm) or DHT (10 or 100 nm). Testosterone treatment significantly elevated PKCδ kinase levels in both intact vessels and primary CSMC in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). Densitometric analysis indicated ∼1.5- and ∼3-fold increases in total PKCδ activity with 10 and 100 nm testosterone, respectively. DHT also increased PKCδ kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner (∼5- and ∼7-fold for 10 and 100 nm, respectively) in both intact vessels and CSMC (Fig. 3, A and B). These data provide evidence that a non-aromatizable androgen, DHT, mimics the effects of testosterone on PKCδ kinase activity.FIGURE 3Testosterone and DHT increase PKCδ activity. In-gel kinase activity assay (A and B) for in vitro effects of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone on PKCδ activity (n = 4).

Right coronary arterial segments and CSMC were incubated for 18 h in the absence or presence of hormones.

C, representative confocal micrographs showing the immunolocalization of PKCδ in coronary smooth muscle cells dispersed from right coronary arterial segments and stimulated with vehicle (left) or 100 nm testosterone (right). Cells were probed with anti-PKCδ protein (green) and the nuclear stain propidium iodide (red). Images are representative of those obtained in five individual experiments from five animals (total of 40-50 cells). Original magnification at ×400; bar indicates 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate the subcellular distribution of PKCδ in response to testosterone, CSMC were dispersed from testosterone-treated RCA and subcellular distribution examined by confocal immunocytochemistry. In untreated cells, PKCδ was diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol (Fig. 3C, left). Conversely, cells treated with 100 nm testosterone showed a localization of PKCδ toward plasma membrane and a perinuclear, reticular pattern that extended into the central cytosol (Fig. 3C, right). These data demonstrate a specific subcellular distribution of PKCδ in response to testosterone, suggesting a role for PKCδ in membrane and nuclear signaling.We have previously demonstrated that testosterone drives Cav1.2 mRNA and protein expression in coronary smooth muscle (12Bowles D.K. Maddali K.K. Ganjam V.K. Rubin L.J. Tharp D.L. Turk J.R. Heaps C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2091-H2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The finding in the present study that testosterone also increases coronary smooth muscle PKCδ protein levels is consistent with previous sex differences in coronary PKCδ protein levels (18Korzick D.H. Rishel M.E. Bowles D.K. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 2005; 37: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and led us to determine the contribution of PKCδ in testosterone-mediated effects on Cav 1.2 protein expression. RCA segments and primary CSMC were pretreated with chelerythrine (10 μm), a general inhibitor of PKC, Go6976 (5 μm), a conventional PKC isoform inhibitor, or rottlerin (5 μm), a putative PKCδ-selective inhibitor, and incubated for 18 h in the presence/absence of testosterone (100 nm). Both chelerythrine and rottlerin inhibited testosterone-induced Cav1.2 protein levels (Fig. 4). In contrast, Go6976 had no effect on T-induced Cav1.2 protein levels. These data demonstrate that testosterone stimulation of Cav1.2 protein expression in coronary smooth muscle is mediated by PKCδ and/or novel PKC isoforms with no apparent contribution from conventional PKC isoforms.FIGURE 4Testosterone increases coronary Cav1.2 protein via PKC. Densitometric analysis of the inhibitory effects of Go6976 (5 μm), cheylerythrine chloride (10 μm), and rottlerin (5 μm) on testosterone-induced Cav1.2 protein expression (n = 5).

Structurally, BAD-1 is composed of a short N-terminal region, a core of 30 tandem repeats critical for virulence, and a C-terminal epidermal growth factor domain that binds the protein to yeast cell surface chitin. Each of the 30 acidic residue-rich tandem repeats contains a sequence that resembles the calcium-binding loop of the EF-hand domain found in many calcium-binding proteins. Here, we investigated the binding of calcium by BAD-1 and its biological significance. Yeast washed with double distilled H2O released surface-bound BAD-1, but EGTA washes were an order of magnitude more efficient, suggesting an interaction between BAD-1 and calcium. Immobilized BAD-1 was stained with ruthenium red dye, an indicator of calcium-binding proteins. In equilibrium dialysis, BAD-1 bound 45Ca2+ with an affinity of 0.41 × 10-5 m and a capacity of 27 calcium/mol. Mass spectrometry confirmed this capacity. Elevated [Ca2+] diminished BAD-1 solubility. Upon deletion of its C-terminal epidermal growth factor-like domain, BAD-1 resisted aggregation by elevated [Ca2+] but retained its affinity and capacity for calcium. Removing 20 copies of the tandem repeat, however, sharply reduced the capacity of BAD-1 for calcium. Growth of the bad-1 null yeast was inhibited by 5 mm EGTA, and re-expression of BAD-1 in trans or the addition of exogenous purified BAD-1 restored growth. Thus, BAD-1 is a high capacity calcium-binding protein. This property contributes to the structure and function of BAD-1, as well as to B. dermatitidis acquisition of calcium from the environment.

Blastomyces dermatitis is a dimorphic fungus endemic to the Ohio-Mississippi river valleys that causes pneumonia and/or disseminated disease after inhalation of conidia or hyphal fragments. Upon entry into the host, the organism undergoes a temperature-dependent phase transition into the pathogenic yeast form. Upon transition, yeast phase cells secrete and display on their surface BAD-1 (Blastomyces adhesin 1), which is a 120-kDa multifunctional protein that promotes adherence to macrophages by binding CD11b/CD18 (CR3) and CD14 (1Newman S.L. Chaturvedi S. Klein B.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 753-761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and deviates host pro-inflammatory responses by suppressing tumor necrosis factor-α (2Finkel-Jimenez B.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 5746-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Soluble BAD-1 released by wild-type yeast enters macrophages via CR3 receptor-mediated endocytosis, and this event has likewise been demonstrated to suppress tumor necrosis factor-α responses and control of the infection (3Brandhorst T.T. Finkel-Jimenez B. Wüthrich M. Warner T. Klein B.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7444-7453Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) To fully characterize the pathogenic role of BAD-1 in B. dermatitidis infection, we targeted and disrupted the BAD-1 locus by gene replacement. The resulting engineered bad-1 knock-out strain (strain 55) is devoid of BAD-1 but remains viable and morphologically similar to its parent strain, ATCC 26199 (5Brandhorst T.T. Wüthrich M. Warner T. Klein B.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type B. dermatitidis, strain 55 binds poorly to macrophages in vitro and lung tissue ex vivo and fails to suppress phagocyte tumor necrosis factor-α production. Strain 55 is avirulent in a murine model of lethal pulmonary infection (5Brandhorst T.T. Wüthrich M. Warner T. Klein B.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), thereby demonstrating the critical role of BAD-1 in the pathogenicity of B. dermatitidis. Structurally, BAD-1 consists of a 150-amino acid N-terminal region, 30 tandem repeats consisting of a 24-amino acid sequence that makes up the core of the protein, and a 103-amino acid-long C-terminal region with homology to epidermal growth factor (EGF) 2The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorddH2Odouble distilled H2OTSPthrombospondinICPinductively coupled plasma. (6Hogan L.H. Josvai S. Klein B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30725-30732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The short N-terminal stretch has no known function as yet, whereas the EGF-like C-terminal region anchors BAD-1 to the yeast surface through its interaction with chitin. The C-terminal region is dispensable for mediating B. dermatitidis virulence (7Brandhorst T.T. Wuethrich M. Finkel-Jimenez B. Klein B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The tandem repeat region of BAD-1, which comprises ∼80% of the length of the protein, is rich in both aspartic and glutamic acid residues, an amino acid composition that is typical of sequences that govern calcium binding in other proteins (8Vogel, H.

In prior work, we observed a role for calcium in situating BAD-1 on the surface of B. dermatitidis yeast. BAD-1 attaches to the yeast cell surface in the presence of calcium and can be released from the yeast surface in its absence (10Brandhorst T.T. Klein B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7925-7934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Magnesium does not effectively substitute for calcium in these interactions, and mono- and tri-valent cations do not influence binding. In the absence of yeast cell surface chitin receptors, BAD-1 self-aggregates in the presence of calcium (10Brandhorst T.T. Klein B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7925-7934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a characteristic that a number of well characterized calcium-binding proteins have in common (8Vogel, H.

The binding of calcium to these proteins is believed to trigger a change in secondary structure, exposing hydrophobic residues that bind their targets. In the absence of an appropriate target, these exposed hydrophobic regions promote self-aggregation (12Maki M. Yamaguchi K. Kitaura Y. Satoh H. Hitomi K. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although binding of calcium is crucial in the action of other well established virulence factors (13Sebghati T.S. Engle J.T.

Several features of BAD-1 have offered intriguing hints that it might bind calcium: its amino acid composition, its dependence on calcium for attaching to yeast surfaces, and its highly distinctive domain structure reminiscent of mammalian thrombospondin (TSP) (17Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

Herein, we investigated BAD-1 binding of calcium, as well as the structural basis and functional consequences of this interaction. We demonstrate a newly appreciated function of BAD-1 involving high capacity calcium binding. The binding of calcium by BAD-1 in turn has functional consequences on the localization of BAD-1 and the ability of the fungus to survive conditions of calcium limitation.

Microbiol. 2003; 48: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ΔRepeat20-6H derivative was produced by digesting the plasmid pBAD1-6H (7Brandhorst T.T. Wuethrich M. Finkel-Jimenez B. Klein B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with BamH1 and religating, thus deleting the coding sequence for 20 of the 30 tandem repeats while maintaining the reading frame. The sequence of the resultant plasmid was confirmed and used to transform strain 55. Stable transformants were screened to select a strain with protein production comparable with wild-type strain 26199. Stock cultures were maintained in the yeast form on slants of Middlebrook 7H10 agar with oleic acid-albumin complex (Sigma) at 39 °C. Liquid cultures were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks containing Histoplasma macrophage medium (20Worsham P.L. Goldman W.E. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1988; 26: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) at 37 °C in a New Brunswick floor model gyratory incubator shaker at 200 rpm. Calcium limitation medium (3M-trace Ca2+) was based on the recipe for 3M minimal medium but contained only trace calcium (2.5 μm/liter) (7Brandhorst T.T. Wuethrich M. Finkel-Jimenez B. Klein B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Preparation of BAD-1 Protein—Full-length BAD-1 protein can be isolated with a high degree of purity by simply washing B. dermtatitidis yeast with buffer and then extracting the surface BAD-1 protein with three sequential 1-h-long water washes, but proteins were engineered to display a six-histidine tag in the transgenic strains to allow an additional purification step on a nickel affinity agarose (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid) column (Qiagen) as previously described (6Hogan L.H. Josvai S. Klein B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30725-30732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid purification is applied directly to the C-terminally truncated BAD-1 protein released in culture supernatants because it does not adhere to the yeast surface and must be purified from culture medium (7Brandhorst T.T. Wuethrich M. Finkel-Jimenez B. Klein B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Washing and protein elution were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. All of the proteins employed in this work were verified to yield one predominant band upon silver stain of a PAGE gel separation (Fig. 1B). Faint bands flanking the predominant band were found to bind anti-BAD-1 monoclonal antibody DD5-CB4 (21Green J.H. Harell W.K.

Jones J.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3890-3900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in Western analysis, indicating that they are minor degradation products or multimerizations of the BAD-1 protein (data not shown). Eluted fractions were further purified, concentrated, and desalted on Centriprep-50 ultrafiltration units (Millipore Corp., Bedford MA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Protein concentrations were quantified by measuring the A280 of samples and multiplying by the previously published correction factor (0.15, based on BAD-1 amino acid sequence) (23Audet R. Brandhorst T.T. Klein B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ruthenium Red Staining of BAD-1—Ten micrograms of purified full-length BAD1-6H protein were spotted onto nitrocellulose adjacent to an equal quantity of a non-calcium binding control protein, RNase A. Staining was done with 25 mg/liter ruthenium red in 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (24Charuk J.H. Pirraglia C.A. Reithmeier R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Extraction of BAD-1 from Yeast Surfaces—Wild-type ATCC strain 26199 yeast were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline briefly to remove loosely associated proteins and collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. Yeast were washed with either ddH2O or EGTA for 10 min, as opposed to the 1-h-long washes performed in our published protein purification protocol (10Brandhorst T.T. Klein B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7925-7934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), to accentuate the faster action of the EGTA extraction. Supernates were collected and filtered to remove residual yeast prior to application to a PAGE gel for Western blotting. BAD-1 protein was detected on Western blots by anti-BAD-1 monoclonal antibody DD5-CB4 followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-AP conjugate (Promega). Radioactive Calcium Binding—Yeast were heat-killed with a 15-min incubation at 55 °C, washed four times with ddH2O, and suspended to a density of 107 cells/ml. 100 μl of yeast was then added to 100 μl of Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 50 μCi of 45CaCl2. The cells were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with agitation and then spun down in a microcentrifuge. 300 μl of phase separation oil (81% silicon oil, 9% mineral oil) was then added, and the cells were spun again to isolate them from the aqueous phase. Pellet-bound calcium was quantified by snipping off the ends of the microcentrifuge tubes and placing them into liquid scintillation vials. The counts were determined with a LSC 6000 (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Calcium Precipitation of BAD-1—50 μg of purified BAD-1 was placed into each of six microcentrifuge tubes containing ddH2O and/or CaCl2 at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 mm in a volume of 1 ml. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 24 °C with agitation, after which the tubes were spun down for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Precipitation was quantified by measuring a decrease in soluble phase BAD-1 using a Beckman DU-64 Spectrophotometer at A280. Equilibrium Dialysis—Purified BAD-1 protein (1 mg/ml) was treated with 20 mm EDTA, placed into dialysis tubing (Pierce), and then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 24 h with three 1-liter exchanges at 4 °C (to minimize residual calcium). Dialysis buffer was treated with Chelex-100 (Sigma) prior to use to remove trace calcium. Equilibrium dialysis analysis consisted of dialyzing the calcium-free protein in a Slide-A-Lyzer MINI® dialysis unit (Pierce) against Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing varied concentrations of calcium (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 μm). Dialysis buffer was spiked with 1.25 μCi of 45CaCl2, and dialysis proceeded for 18 h at room temperature with orbital rotation. 0.5% Tween 20 was added to both the protein sample and calcium buffers to minimize complications caused by calcium-induced protein self-aggregation (25Subramanian L. Crabb J.W. Cox J. Durussel I. Walker T.M. van Ginkel P.R. Bhattacharya S. Dellaria J.M. Palczewski K. Polans A.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11175-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in both the protein sample and the dialysate was assessed via scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000TA). The protein concentrations of the samples were measured post-dialysis by BCA assay (Pierce). The molar quantity of calcium bound to the protein sample, and thereafter the molar ratio of calcium to protein, was calculated as previously described (26Hannah B.A. Misenheimer T.M. Pranghofer M.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51915-51922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To minimize calcium contamination, only plasticware (polypropylene and polyethylene) was utilized for these assays. Atomic emission spectrometry (Galbraith Laboratories, Knoxville, TN) ensured that buffers used in this protocol were calcium-free (<0.5 μm). Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and Optical Emission Spectrometry Analysis—The Soil and Plant Analysis Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed the calcium content of samples of purified BAD-1 protein using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry (VG PlasmaQuad PQ2 Turbo Plus ICP-MS) and ICP optical emission spectroscopy (TJA IRIS Advantage ICP-OES). Standard Soil and Plant Analysis Lab procedures were followed in the analysis of total minerals and heavy metals. Prepared samples included fresh, intact BAD-1 that was: 1) untreated, 2) treated with 50 mm EGTA, pH 8, for 1 h at 24 °C with agitation, or 3) exposed to 3 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at 24°C with agitation. Preparations of ΔC-term and ΔRepeat20 protein were treated similarly and analyzed in parallel. Unbound calcium and EGTA were removed to trace levels (<8 parts/billion) via a desalting step involving multiple rounds of ultrafiltration in a Microcon® YM-50 unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Growth of B. dermatitidis under Calcium Limiting Conditions—Strains of 26199 (wild type), strain 55 (bad-1 knock-out), and BAD1-6H (BAD-1 reconstituted knock-out) yeast were washed with 0.1 m EGTA two times for 5 min each. Flasks of minimal fungal medium, 3M-trace Ca2+ (containing trace calcium at 2.5 μm/liter) were inoculated with 1 × 106 yeast of each strain at the outset of the experiment. In parallel, the cultures were treated as follows: 1) 5 mm EGTA was added to one set of cultures, 2) 5 mm EGTA + 5 mm CaCl2 was added to a second set, and 3) nothing was added to the control set. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 200 rpm, and growth was determined over the course of the experiment by removing aliquots to measure A600 and count yeast on a hemacytometer. CD, Spectrofluorophotometry, and UV Absorbance Spectroscopy—UV absorption spectra over the 200-350-nm range were collected with a Beckman DU-64 spectrophotometer at 25 °C, in quartz cuvettes with a 1-cm light path. The spectra were recorded for 50 μg/ml BAD-1 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and for 50 μg/ml BAD-1 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, plus 300 mm calcium chloride. Base-line spectra for buffer and buffer plus calcium, respectively, were subtracted from experimental spectra (27Jordan P.A. Bohle D.S. Ramilo C.A. Evans J.N.S Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8387-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopy data were collected using a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and emission data were collected between 300 and 400 nm. All of the measurements were performed in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, at 25 °C using quartz cuvettes with a 3 mm light path. BAD-1 was used at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Calcium chloride of 100-300 mm was added. The spectra were collected for protein with and without calcium (28Cox J.A. Durussel I. Comte M. Nef S. Nef P. Lenz S.E. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32807-32813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Near- and far-UV CD spectra were recorded with an Aviv 62A DS circular dichroism spectrometer at the Biophysics Instrumentation Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biochemistry Department. The temperature was set to 25 °C, and the work was done under nitrogen gas using quartz cuvettes with a 0.1-cm light path. The CD spectra were recorded for 50 μg/ml BAD-1 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and for 50 μg/ml BAD-1 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, plus 300 mm calcium chloride. Base-line spectra for buffer and buffer plus calcium, respectively, were then subtracted from the experimental spectra. Trypsin Digestion—BAD-1 (1 mg/ml) was incubated with calcium (final concentration, 1.25 mm) or not (EGTA; final concentration, 1.25 mm) and digested with trypsin (protein:trypsin ratio of 1:15). As a control, bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) was similarly treated with trypsin in the presence and absence of calcium. The reactions were performed in HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, at 50 °C for varying intervals of 1 min to 2 h (29Cleveland D. W Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Eylar E.H. Roomi M.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1978; 100: 307-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by mixing samples with 2× PAGE gel loading buffer and heating for 3 min at 95 °C. The samples were kept on ice until they were run on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and duplicate gels were immunoblotted. For immunoblotting, the proteins were transferred overnight at 30 V from PAGE gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Nonspecific proteins were blocked for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk. The blots were incubated with primary chicken antibody (1:500) raised against the EGF-like domain of the BAD-1 C terminus (Aves Labs, Inc. Tigard, OR). Secondary antibody of anti-chicken IgY (Promega, Madison, WI) was used at a dilution of 1:2000. BAD-1 Sequence Shows an EF-hand-like Motif—Each of the 24-amino acid tandem repeats present in the core of BAD-1 displays homology to the calcium-binding loop of the EF-hand consensus sequence (Fig. 2) (8Vogel, H. (ed) Methods Mol. Biol. 172, 4-11Google Scholar, 9Tuckwell D.S. Brass A. Humprhies M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, these sequences do not adhere precisely to the canonical EF-hand sequence: 1) a histidine instead of a glycine is present at position 6 and 2) a lysine instead of an isoleucine or some other aliphatic residue occupies position 8. The tandem repeats also lack the α-helical motifs that normally flank each calcium-binding loop in an EF-hand (8Vogel, H. (ed) Methods Mol. Biol. 172, 4-11Google Scholar, 9Tuckwell D.S. Brass A. Humprhies M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The acidic loops found in BAD-1 do not precisely duplicate any other known type of calcium-binding domain, to our knowledge, but the absence of α-helical flanking sequences is not unprecedented (e.g. -TSP) (17Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Our prior finding that BAD-1 binding to yeast cell surfaces depends on the concentration of calcium (10Brandhorst T.T. Klein B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7925-7934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), taken together with the fact that BAD-1 consists of 30 EF-hand-like motifs strung together, raised the possibility that BAD-1 could be a calcium-binding protein. BAD-1 Release from the Yeast Surface—In prior work, we showed that BAD-1 could be removed from the yeast by washing the cells in ddH2O (10Brandhorst T.T. Klein B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7925-7934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Inclusion of 5 mm calcium during these extractions retarded the release of BAD-1, whereas the inclusion of 5 mm magnesium did not, suggesting that this release hinges on the depletion of calcium ions. Here, we extended these studies. During three consecutive 10-min washes in ddH2O, BAD-1 was released into the soluble phase (Fig. 3A). The addition of a calcium chelator, 10 mm EGTA, pH 8, for an equivalent length of time released >10-fold more BAD-1 protein. The addition of 11 mm CaCl2 to this EGTA extraction completely inhibited BAD-1 release (data not shown). These results show that BAD-1 attachment to the yeast cell surface and subsequent release are dependent upon calcium, but they are insufficient alone to demonstrate calcium binding by BAD-1. Ruthenium Red Staining of BAD-1—Staining with ruthenium red dye is frequently employed in the detection and indication of calcium-binding proteins following electrophoresis or dot blotting (24Charuk J.H. Pirraglia C.A. Reithmeier R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Compared with an RNase A control, which has no calcium binding activity, intact BAD-1 protein immobilized on a nitrocellulose filter was stained by ruthenium red (Fig. 3B). The observation that ruthenium red binds preferentially to BAD-1 suggests a calcium binding capacity for BAD-1. Ruthenium red does not bind exclusively to calcium-binding proteins, however, and can also stain polyanionic substrates, so this observation alone is not conclusive. Equilibrium Dialysis of BAD-1 Calcium Binding—To definitively evaluate the binding capacity and affinity of BAD-1 for calcium, we performed equilibrium dialysis (Fig. 4 and TABLE ONE). Intact BAD-1 protein led to the enrichment of 45Ca2+ in the dialysis chamber over a wide range of calcium concentrations tested. At 10 μm, calcium occupied 15% of the theoretical BAD-1 binding sites, and this rose to 67% at 100 μm. Nonlinear regression analysis indicated a dissociation constant (Kd) of 41.3 ± 6.8 μm, and maximal binding was calculated to be 27 calcium ions/molecule of BAD-1. Thus, intact BAD-1 not only responds to perturbations in calcium concentration but also binds calcium.TABLE ONEComparison of mass spectroscopy and equilibrium dialysis quantification of calcium ions bound to BAD-1 and its derivatives and of relative dissociation constants The calcium to BAD-1 ratios for intact BAD-1 and derivatives were measured by mass spectrometry and equilibrium dialysis and compared to a non-calcium binding control (RNase A). ΔC-term lacks the C-terminal EGF region, and the ΔRepeat20 has 20 of the 30 tandem repeats deleted. Mass spectroscopy showed that the purified proteins retained negligible calcium after EGTA extraction, and except for the RNase A control, each monomer bound 1-3 calcium ions in the absence of calcium saturation. Calcium saturation was achieved by incubating proteins with 3 mm CaCl2 for 1 h followed by repeated ultrafiltration to remove unbound calcium. ICP mass spectroscopy was done as described under “Experimental Procedures” and confirmed by optical emission spectroscopy (not shown). The Kd values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2138780244,"Peptide deformylase is an attractive target for developing novel antibiotics. Previous studies at pH 3.0 showed peptide deformylase from Leptospira interrogans (LiPDF) exists as a dimer in which one monomer is in a closed form and the other is in an open form, with different conformations of the CD-loop controlling the entrance to the active pocket. Here we present structures of LiPDF at its active pH range. LiPDF forms a similar dimer at pH values 6.5-8.0 as it does at pH 3.0. Interestingly, both of the monomers are almost in the same closed form as that observed at pH 3.0. However, when the enzyme is complexed with the natural inhibitor actinotin, the conformation of the CD-loop is half-open. Two pairs of Arg109-mediated cation-π interactions, as well as hydrogen bonds, have been identified to stabilize the different CD-loop conformations. These results indicate that LiPDF may be found in different structural states, a feature that has never before been observed in the peptide deformylase family. Based on our results, a novel substrate binding model, featured by an equilibrium between the closed and the open forms, is proposed. Our results present crystallographic evidence supporting population shift theory, which is distinguished from the conventional lock-and-key or induced-fit models. These results not only facilitate the development of peptide deformylase-targeted drugs but also provide structural insights into the mechanism of an unusual type of protein binding event.

This process is required for bacterial survival, because mature proteins do not retain N-formyl-methionine, and all known N-terminal peptidases cannot utilize formylated peptides as substrate. Eukaryotic cytosolic protein synthesis, however, does not involve deformylase activity. Thus, inhibition of PDF would halt bacterial growth and spare host cell function. In fact, PDF has represented one of the most promising bacterial targets in the search for a novel mode of action antibiotics that lack cross-resistance to existing drugs (5Mazel D. Pocher S. Marliere P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 6Bradshaw R.A. Brichey W.W. Walker K.W. Trends Biochem.

Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Peptide deformylase inhibitors appear to be one of the most promising classes of antibacterial agents discovered to date. As a metalloprotease, the high degree of structure-function conservation makes rapid progress possible in the development of peptide deformylase inhibitors. Very recently, a new peptide deformylase inhibitor of clinical importance (LBM415) has been characterized (8Fritsche T.R. Sader H.S. Cleeland R. Jones R.N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 1468-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, a new human peptide deformylase (HsPDF) has been suggested to be involved in the deformylation and processing of mitochondrially encoded proteins and may provide a novel selective target for anticancer therapy based on the observation that inhibition of human peptide deformylase (HsPDF) by actinonin (a naturally occurring competitive inhibitor of PDF) also inhibits the proliferation of 16 human cancer cell lines (9Lee M.D. She Y. Soskis M.J. Borella C.P. Gardner J.R. Hayes P.A. Dy B.M. Heaney M.L. Philips M.R. Bornmann W.G. Sirotnak F.M. Scheinberg D.A. J. Clin.

As a ubiquitous pathogenic bacterium, Leptospira can cause strong leptospirosis infection of animals (including humans) by entering the host through mucosa and broken skin. The resultant bacteremia, for example, is frequently found as a post-operative complication. Our previous study about peptide deformylase from Leptospira interrogans (LiPDF) revealed some unusual characteristics for the crystal structure obtained at pH 3.0, where no activity is detected (10Zhou Z. Song X. Li Y. Gong W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Structure comparison suggests LiPDF may represent a new type of PDF, belonging to neither type I nor type II PDFs. As the only dimeric PDF reported so far, the substrate pocket adopts distinct conformations (closed and open) in the two monomers. The primary difference between these two conformations is the structure adopted by a flexible loop (CD-loop, residue 65-76 of LiPDF), which controls access of substrate to the active site of the enzyme. Part of the C-terminal peptide from a symmetry-related molecule is bound to the active site in the open conformation, which was suggested as a mimic of substrate binding (not interacting with an active metal ion). In contrast, access of substrate to the active site is totally blocked in the closed conformation. However, what the conformation is at the active pH (6.5-8.0) and whether the conformational change is triggered by crystal packing remain unknown. Here we present five LiPDF crystal structures (resolutions from 2.3 to 3.1 Å) determined under different conditions. The existence of the closed conformation has been confirmed within the active pH range, with its binding cleft slightly enlarged. Specific interactions between the CD-loop and nearby residues of binding cleft are observed to stabilize the closed conformation. Meanwhile a novel half-open conformation, which has not been observed previously, is defined in the structure of LiPDF bound to an inhibitor molecule actinonin. The CD-loop and Arg109 have been repositioned in this new conformation to accommodate the bound actinonin. Based on the three conformational states of LiPDF, an inhibitor binding model has been proposed to include a pre-existing equilibrium and a population shift. This may extend the insights into PDF inhibition, facilitating novel drug design. The hypothetical model may provide an example for an unusual type of protein binding event. LiPDF protein was obtained following previously described procedures (10Zhou Z. Song X. Li Y. Gong W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and was crystallized using the hanging drop method at 277 K. All conditions for experimentation were similar to those reported previously (10Zhou Z. Song X. Li Y. Gong W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Li Y. Ren X. Gong W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 58: 846-848Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except the solution buffer was subsequently changed to 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, respectively. The co-crystallization of LiPDF and actinonin at pH 7.5 has been described previously (12Zhou Z. Gong W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). All phases of the native crystals were obtained by molecular replacement with the AMORE software package (13Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

After rigid body and energy minimization refinements, manual building of the C terminus and CD-loop followed by simulated annealing were carried out, with 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetrical redundancy exploited. A zinc atom and the coordinating ligands, as well as the small molecules (DDT, HEPES, MES) in the S1′ pocket, were incorporated into the model by direct examination of 2Fo - Fc maps. The structure of LiPDF complexed with actinonin was determined to a resolution of 3.1 Å using the molecular replacement method. There were eight molecules in each asymmetric unit. Some side chains from the flexible CD-loop were missing. Nevertheless, thanks to the 8-fold non-crystallographic symmetrical redundancy, all of the main chains of CD-loops, as well as the key residue Tyr72, were clear enough for comparison with the native structure.

Open table in a new tab Crystal Structures of Free LiPDF between pH Values 6.5 and 8.0, Unusual Closed Conformation—Because the previous study of both the “closed” and “open” states in crystals of LiPDF was performed at pH 3.0, where the enzyme is inactive (10Zhou Z. Song X. Li Y. Gong W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is possible that the structure that was determined for the closed state is not a representative conformation of the free active enzyme. We have therefore determined four crystal structures (see TABLE ONE) of free LiPDF within the pH range 6.5-8.0, where the enzyme is fully active (16Li Y. Chen Z. Gong W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, all four of these structures adopted the same closed conformation, which was similar to that observed at pH 3.0. Nevertheless, a detailed comparison of the closed cleft at active pH with the one at inactive pH does reveal subtle differences, which could be important for the conformational change required for substrate binding (see “Discussion”). The structure of LiPDF determined at pH 7.5 is representative of those within the active pH range. The crystal of LiPDF at this pH belongs to space group P41212, with two molecules/asymmetric unit. Each molecule associates with a symmetry-related molecule through hydrophobic interactions, forming a stable dimer (Fig. 1, top right). The structures of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are highly similar, with a root mean square deviation of 0.125 Å for 171 α carbon atoms. The active site metal is a pentacoordinated zinc ion as we have described previously (10Zhou Z. Song X. Li Y. Gong W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which is liganded by residues Cys102, His143, His148, and a formate group providing two oxygen atoms. The formate group, which is one of the catalytic products of PDF, comes from the crystallization solution. Similar to the closed structure observed at pH 3.0 (10Zhou Z. Song X. Li Y. Gong W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the substrate pocket of all of the structures within the active pH range was fully covered by the extended CD-loop, especially by Arg71 and Tyr72. (Note that the CD-loop is not involved in crystal packing.) These two bulk residues strongly interacted (cation-π and hydrogen bonding) with the side chain of Arg109, which is on the opposite side of the binding cleft (Fig. 1A). As such, in all of these closed structures, the substrate entrance to the catalytic site was blocked. The specific conformation of the CD-loop was highly stabilized by anchoring at three points (N terminus, C terminus, and middle tip), which appears to account for the predominance of this state in free enzyme. One hydrogen bond between the Asn69 side chain and the Glu46 carbonyl oxygen and another between the Glu70 main chain nitrogen and the Glu46 side chain formed the N terminus anchor. The middle tip anchor included the cation-π interaction between Tyr72 and Arg109 and the hydrogen bond between the Arg109 side chain and the Arg71 carbonyl oxygen. On the C-terminal end of the CD-loop, the hydrophobic packing of residues Pro76, Thr75, Phe98, and Tyr137 provides the third anchor. Despite the high similarity between closed structures from the active pH and from the inactive pH, the subtle differences observed around the CD-loop anchoring could be significant for the conformational change between the closed and open states. Compared with the structure at pH 3.0, a slightly open substrate binding cleft was observed under active pH (Fig. 2B). In the middle tip anchor for the CD-loop, the hydrogen bonding between the Arg109 side chain and Arg71 carbonyl oxygen was weakened, whereas the cation-π interaction between Tyr72 and Arg109 became stronger (TABLE TWO). This comparison suggests that the middle tip anchoring is flexible and susceptible to environmental factors, such as pH and ionic strength.TABLE TWOStatistics of Arg-involved cation-π interactionsPDB codepHInteracting pairsE(es)E(vdw)EtotalConformational substateCationPikcal/molkcal/molkcal/mol1Y6H(A)3.0Arg109Trp99−1.78−1.09−2.87Open1Y6H(B)3.0Arg109Tyr72−2.04−2.08−4.12Closed1VEV6.5Arg109Tyr72−1.93−2.54−4.47Closed1VEY7.0Arg109Tyr72−1.83−2.69−4.52Closed1SV27.5Arg109Tyr72−2.34−2.45−4.79Closed1VEZ8.0Arg109Tyr72−1.72−3.13−4.85Closed1SZZ7.5Arg109Trp99−2.03−1.09−3.12Half-open Open table in a new tab Crystal Structure of the LiPDF-Inhibitor Complex, Novel Half-open Conformation—Because what we observed in the active pH range was a closed conformation that blocks the substrate entrance, the structure of the complex of LiPDF with its competitive inhibitor actinonin was then determined (to 3.1 Å resolution at pH 7.5) to examine its substrate binding ability and catalytic activity on the molecular level. In the crystal of the LiPDF-actinonin complex, each asymmetric unit contained eight PDF molecules organized as four dimers. The structures of all eight molecules were nearly identical with variations observed in the flexible CD-loop region and the side chain of Arg109.As expected, one actinonin is observed in the substrate pocket of each PDF molecule. The zinc-coordinating formate group in the free LiPDF structure was then replaced with two oxygen atoms of the bound actinonin. The overall structures of the LiPDF in the actinonin-bound and free states were similar, except the marked conformational change of the CD-loop. A “half-open” conformation was observed, where the actinonin was intimately bound (Fig. 1B, right). Relative to the closed state, the CD-loop was repositioned with its top end swung outward from the binding cleft by ∼6 Å (Fig. 1). Due to the large displacement of the N-terminal and middle part of the CD-loop, stabilizing interactions at this region observed in the closed state did not exist in the half-open state. However, as a result of conformational adjustment, new hydrophobic interactions were formed between the residue Tyr72 at the top end of the CD-loop and P3′ Pro and P2′ Val of the bound actinonin. In contrast, for the C-terminal part of CD-loop, the hydrophobic stacking of Pro76 and Thr75 with Tyr137 and Phe98 was preserved due to the synchronous outward movement of these four residues. Another impressive feature of the half-open conformation was the “swing up” of the Arg109 side chain (rotating the χ1 angle ∼45°) from the previous horizontal orientation (Figs. 1 and 2). There the side chain of Arg109 formed a salt bridge with Asp171 from the C-terminal tail helix, as well as a cation-π interaction with Trp99. The unique topology and positioning of LiPDF C terminus seemed to be required for the interaction between Arg109 and Asp171. Although the binding cleft in this novel conformation was significantly splayed compared with that of the closed structure, it was still much narrower than that of any other PDF where the substrate pocket remained fully open prior to and following inhibitor/substrate binding. Therefore it was not surprising that such a compact binding pocket did not even allow clear access for actinonin without conformational change (see more under “Discussion”). Comparison of this half-open structure with all of the available inhibitor complexes of PDFs revealed a highly conserved inhibitor binding mode. However, additional hydrophobic interaction between Tyr72 of the CD-loop and P3′ Pro of actinonin was observed only in the half-open conformation of LiPDF. Three Conformational States of LiPDF—Our previous study of LiPDF at pH 3.0 (10Zhou Z. Song X. Li Y. Gong W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) revealed a non-free open conformation and a free closed conformation. The open conformation, as a peculiar artifact of crystallization, resulted from the binding of the C terminus peptide of a symmetry-related molecule. Coincidentally, the N terminus of a symmetry-related molecule was also observed in the substrate pocket of the peptide deformylase from Staphylococcus aureus, which was suggested to mimic substrate binding (17Kreusch A. Spraggon G. Lee C.C. Klock H. McMullan D. Ng K. Shin T. Vincent J. Warner I. Ericson C. Lesley S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus the open conformation of LiPDF may resemble the state where actual substrate is bound. However, the CD-loop in this state was specifically stabilized by the interaction between Tyr72 and the bound peptide (10Zhou Z. Song X. Li Y. Gong W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Removal of the bound peptide would result in a completely solvent-exposed and hence highly unstable CD-loop. All structures of LiPDF indeed adopted a closed (but not open) conformation in the free state. Actinonin could freely dock into the substrate pocket of the open state when bound peptide was removed (Fig. 3C). The existence of the closed conformational state is now confirmed at the active pH range. Both monomers in the asymmetric unit showed the same closed conformation, even though they faced a different environment in the crystal. Nevertheless, here the closed form of free LiPDF possibly describes a state that was ready to open its binding cleft. Furthermore, the recurrence of the stable closed state for free LiPDF in different conditions suggests that such a conformation would also occur in solution and would predominate in the absence of substrate/inhibitor. On the other hand, the side chain of Tyr72 would collide with the side chains from P2′ and P3′ when the inhibitor actinonin is modeled into the closed substrate pocket. This clearly indicates that the active site in the closed state of free LiPDF is not accessible when no conformational changes occur. The current structure of the complex substantiates the substrate binding ability as well as the catalytic activity of LiPDF, in keeping with our previous biochemical studies (16Li Y. Chen Z. Gong W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here a novel conformation was observed as half-open, instead of fully open. Crystal-packing examination also revealed that the CD-loop region is essentially solvent-exposed in all of the eight molecules. In this half-open state, the actinonin molecule was snugly bound in the active crevice. In contrast to studies of PDFs from different species, where P3′ proline of the bound actinonin is solvent-exposed (18Hao B. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T. Zhou Y. Pei D. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Guilloteau J.P. Mathieu M. Giglione C. Blanc V. Dupuy A. Chevrier M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), in LiPDF, the P3′ proline of the bound actinonin was partially covered by a hydrophobic environment due to the special positioning of the CD-loop. This hydrophobic S3′ subsite consisted of Tyr72 and Thr75 from the CD-loop and the adjacent residues Tyr137, Phe98, and Val48. A detailed examination of the binding cleft revealed an unexpectedly confined entrance. Although the close interaction between Tyr72 and Arg109 did not exist, their side chains are still within a distance of 6 Å. Here it is worth noting that the half-open cleft of the enzyme trapped the bound actinonin. A free docking or release (no close contact with a distance of <1.5Å between actinonin and enzyme) of actinonin into the half-open state therefore requires a conformational change to take place. Thus it can be safely inferred that the present half-open state is an induced outcome from a more open state where actinonin can freely dock. In summary, three distinct conformational states of LiPDF (open, closed, and half-open) have now been identified. At this stage, these states have not been assigned to the inhibitor binding mechanism. However, our cation-π interaction analysis for all of these states identified two energetically significant pairs, both of which involve Arg109 (Fig. 1 and TABLE TWO). One was formed between Arg109 and Tyr72, observed only in the closed state. Another was formed between Arg109 and the pocket rim residue Trp99, observed only in the half-open or open states. In keeping with the cation-π interaction, the hydrogen bond between Arg109 and Arg171 only existed in the closed state, and the salt bridge between Arg71 and Asp109 only existed in the half-open or open states. In the closed state, the Arg109-related cation-π interaction and hydrogen bonding formed a bridge across the active pocket. In the half-open or open state, because Arg109 and Trp99 were on the same side of the binding cleft, the cation-π interaction between them, together with the salt bridge between Arg109 and Asp171, helped to keep the specific conformation of the Arg109 side chain after the CD-loop was released from the Arg109-mediated bridge. Therefore Arg109 appears to be a pivotal residue for the conformational changes triggered by substrate binding. Note that Arg109 structurally corresponds to residue Arg97 in peptide deformylase from Escherichia coli (20Chan M.K. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T. Hao B. Tsai C.M. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13904-13909Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Hypothetical Model for Substrate Binding—Traditionally, conformational changes related to protein binding events have been described by lock-and-key or induced-fit models. However, these two models do not fit the case of LiPDF, because the free enzyme was observed to be in a closed form, and no inducer molecule has been found for LiPDF or for other PDFs. As an alternative, the pre-existing equilibrium hypothesis (21Tsai C.J. Kumar S. Ma B. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) is based on protein folding and conformational selection theories of the funnel energy landscape (22Frauenfelder H. Sligar S.G. Wolynes P.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1598-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2611) Google Scholar, 23Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar, 24Feher V.A. Cavanagh J. Nature. 1999; 400: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 25Fereire E. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10118-10122Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which postulates that the native state of a protein contains an ensemble of conformations at its binding site, rather than a unique fold. In this view, the energy landscape of the protein is dynamic, changing with environmental factors such as pH, ionic strength, and the presence of other molecules. The most populated conformation of a protein may be different prior to and following a binding event, corresponding to a change in the energy landscape. A ligand will bind selectively to an active conformation, thereby biasing the equilibrium toward the binding conformation. An elegant example comes from the study of a monoclonal IgE antibody, SPE7, in which both x-ray crystallography and presteady-state kinetics revealed an equilibrium between at least two different pre-existing isomers (binding structurally distinct antigens) that can both be crystallized in the absence of any ligand (26James L.C. Roversi P. Tawfik D.S. Science. 2003; 299: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Based on this theory and our observations, we suggest that the closed state of free LiPDF might not be the only conformation adopted in solution. Instead, the open form of LiPDF may co-exist with the closed form, although as the minor population. Because the crystallization process may select one of the populations to form a crystal, but not necessarily the “active” conformers, the three conformational states imply a hypothetical model for substrate binding in LiPDF (Fig. 3). For the free enzyme, a strong, biased equilibrium between closed and open states is suggested, as above. The substrate binding would trigger a redistribution of the closed and open states in the ensemble of conformations. After an initial binding to the open state, the substrate pocket is then induced to shut, leading to the final half-open conformation, as observed in the complex. In this model, we suggest that the pivotal residue Arg109, which is on molecular surface, could be sensitive to the environmental disturbances; therefore the locking bridge (mainly contributed by the interactions between Arg109 and the CD-loop) could be momentarily broken, leading to a conformational ensemble. Among these conformations, the predominant closed state is thermodynamically favored in the absence of ligand, whereas other minor states (including the observed half-open and open states from non-free enzyme) would have a low population time. However, in the presence of substrate, tight binding to the active site stabilizes the open sate. At the final stage, the hydrophobic interactions between Tyr72 and the substrate (especially proline at P3′ and valine at P2′) possibly induce the repositioning of the CD-loop and result in the half-open state. Conclusion and Perspective—As a novel drug design target from a real pathogen, LiPDF showed unique structural features highlighted by its three conformational states. A pre-existing equilibrium-based model has been proposed for the competitive inhibitor binding. Besides providing structural information for drug development, this model may extend our insights into an unusual type of enzymatic binding event. Meanwhile, we have noticed that the structures of deformylase from other bacteria do not show significant conformational changes upon inhibitor binding. This suggests that the conformational change observed in LiPDF is not a general feature regarding deformylase activity itself. Why does LiPDF use this machinery? It has been realized that a protein that adopts several different conformations could, in principle, have several different functions (28Ma B. Shatsky M. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Protein. Sci. 2002; 11: 84-197Google Scholar). Genomics data indicate that many species have two copies of similar but different PDF genes, and PDF genes are also found in eukaryotics. Thus at this stage, we cannot rule out the possibility that peptide deformylase (in at least some species) have additional biological functions besides modifying the newly synthesized peptide.

One contact is through the H-I helices, and the other is through a novel GXXLE region. The side chain of Leu, in the GXXLE region, forms a hydrophobic cluster with residues of the H helix (Shimamura, T., Koike-Takeshita, A., Yokoyama, K., Masui, R., Murai, N., Yoshida, M., Taguchi, H., and Iwata, S.

The results are as follows: (i) cross-linking between introduced cysteines confirmed that the GXXLE region in the E. coli GroEL·GroES complex is also in contact with GroES; (ii) when Leu was replaced by Lys (GroEL(L309K)) or other charged residues, chaperone activity was largely lost; (iii) the GroEL(L309K)·substrate complex failed to bind GroES to produce a stable GroEL(L309K)·GroES·substrate complex, whereas free GroEL(L309K) bound GroES normally; (iv) the GroEL(L309K)·GroES·substrate complex was stabilized with BeFx, but the substrate protein in the complex was readily digested by protease, indicating that it was not properly encapsulated into the internal cavity of the complex.

The binding of GroES induces the encapsulation of the substrate protein into an enlarged cavity (the cis-cavity) inside the cis-ring, which is capped by GroES. In the cis-cavity, non-native protein initiates folding without the risk of aggregation (8Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 9Mayhew M. da Silva A.C.R Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U.

Based on studies of crystal structures and mutagenesis, it is thought that the residues of GroEL involved in binding of GroES are overlapped, to a large extent, with those for binding of the substrate protein (16Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Therefore, it might appear that binding of GroES results in freeing of the unfolded protein into the cis-cavity through deprivation of its binding sites. However, simple competition between substrate protein and GroES for the same binding sites does not explain how the release of substrate protein always results in encapsulation into the cis-cavity rather than diffusion into the bulk solution. Analysis of an intermediate in the process of encapsulation may help clarify the mechanism by which GroEL operates at this critical stage. We recently determined a crystal structure of the native GroEL·GroES complex purified from Thermus thermophilus, the cis-cavity of which is filled with cellular proteins (20Shimamura T. Koike-Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Masui R. Murai N. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. Iwata S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1471-1480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The structure shows several significant differences to the GroEL·GroES complex of E. coli, which was obtained by reconstitution of purified GroEL and GroES, in the presence of ADP (19Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). A new contact region between GroEL and GroES was identified in the T. thermophilus GroEL·GroES structure (Fig. 1A). In E. coli GroES, residues 24-27 are part of a mobile loop structure (comprising residues 24-30) that interacts with helices H and I at the apical domain of GroEL, located in the inner rim of the central cavity. In the GroEL·GroES of T. thermophilus, the same interactions are observed. The region 305GFKLE309 of GroEL (corresponding to the E. coli GroEL sequence 306GMELE310) makes contact with the sequence 33PDT35, in the mobile loop of the adjacent GroES (28TGS30 in E. coli GroES). The residues Gly305, Leu308, and Glu309 of T. thermophilus GroEL are well conserved across species, and hereafter, we refer this region as the GXXLE region. This region also has an intrasubunit interaction with the H helix; the side chain of Leu308 (Leu309 in E. coli GroEL) points at the N terminus of the H helix to form a hydrophobic cluster with other residues (Fig. 1, A, circle, and B). Fenton et al. (16Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) reported that a Leu309 mutant of E. coli GroEL (GroEL(L309K)) was unable to assist folding. The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of the GXXLE region to chaperonin function, using E. coli GroEL and GroES. We investigated the GXXLE region in the E. coli GroEL·GroES complex to determine whether it is also in contact with GroES and whether or not Leu309 in E. coli GroEL plays a role for the efficient encapsulation of substrate protein into the cis-cavity.

Strains and Plasmids—E. coli XL2-Blue (Stratagene) was used for site-directed mutagenesis and cloning. E. coli GroEL mutants were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The mutated groEL gene fragment was amplified using PCR, and the mutation containing pET-EL plasmid was used as a template. PCR products were digested with NcoI and HindIII and ligated into the NcoI/HindIII site of pTV118N (Takara), forming pTV-EL. The wild type groES gene fragment was amplified using PCR, digested with SalI and EcoRI, and ligated into the SalI/EcoRI site of pSTV29, forming pSTV-ES. E. coli MM100 (supplied by Dr. M. Masters) was used for complementation experiments (25McLennan N. Masters M. Nature. 1998; 392: 139Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mutated GroEL and wild type GroES were co-expressed (from expression plasmids pTV-EL and pSTV-ES, respectively) in E. coli MM100. Formation of the GroEL Cross-linked Product—The mixtures (40 μl) containing HKM buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2), 0.25 μm GroEL, 0.5 μm GroES, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and, when indicated, 1 mm ATP, were loaded onto centrifugal ultrafiltration units (Microcon YM-100) to remove DTT gradually. After treatment for 60 min, 200 μm iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 10 μm to prevent excessive cross-linking. The intramolecular cross-linked product was formed as follows: 40 μl of mixture containing HKM buffer, 0.25 μm GroEL(E232C/L309C), 20 μm CuCl2 and, when indicated, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm ADP, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 μm GroES was incubated at 25 °C. After 30 min, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. Cross-linked products (∼10 μg) were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 0.1% SDS (SDS-PAGE) in the absence of reducing agent. Folding Assays—For measurement of GFP folding, an acid-denatured GFP solution (12.6 μm) was diluted 252-fold in HKM buffer (1.3 ml) containing 0.15 μm GroEL, 5 mm DTT, 200 mm glucose, and 0.3 μm GroES. Where indicated as “+trap”, this was followed by the addition of 0.04 unit/μl hexokinase and 0.3 μm “trap-GroEL” (GroEL(N265A) (8Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar)); trap-GroEL binds free unfolded proteins irreversibly even in the presence of ATP. Then 0.8 mm ATP was added to initiate folding. The intensity of GFP fluorescence was monitored continuously with a fluorometer (excitation at 485 nm, emission at 510 nm; FP-6500, Jasco). MDH was denatured in 6 m urea and 1 mm DTT for 1 h and diluted in HKM buffer containing 0.1 μm GroEL, 0.3 μm GroES, 5 mm DTT, and 2 mm ATP. The final MDH subunit concentration was 0.2 μm. At the times indicated, a 25-μl aliquot was injected into 1.2 ml of the assay solution containing 0.5 mm oxalacetic acid, 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The rate of oxidation of NADH at 25 °C was monitored at 340 nm. Rhodanese was denatured in 6 m guanidine HCl (20 μm) and 1 mm DTT for 1 h and diluted 40-fold into HKM buffer containing 1 μm GroEL, 2 μm GroES, 20 mm Na2S2O3, and 1 mm DTT. ATP was then added to a final concentration of 4 mm. At the times indicated, 5-μl aliquots were added to 750 μl of a solution containing 100 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm Na2S2O3, and 1 mm EDTA. Recovery of rhodanese activity was measured colorimetrically by absorbance at 460 nm, indicating formation of a complex between ferric ions and the thiocyanate reaction product (26Sörbo B.H. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). Binding Assays Using Gel Filtration—The GroEL·Cy3-labeled MDH (MDHCy3) complex was formed in the presence or absence of GroES, and the GroEL·Cy3-labeled GroES (GroESCy3) complex was formed in the presence or absence of denatured MDH. Denatured MDH (or MDHCy3) was diluted in HKM buffer containing GroEL and incubated for 2 min at 25 °C. The solution containing ATP, with (or without) GroES, was added and incubated for 2 min at 25 °C. Final concentrations of the components were 0.125 μm MDH (or MDHCy3), 0.25 μm GroEL, 0.125 μm GroES, and 0.5 mm ATP. Aliquots (100 μl) were loaded onto a gel filtration HPLC column (G3000SWXL; Tosoh, Japan) equilibrated with HKM buffer containing 50 mm Na2SO4 and 0.2 mm ATP. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and elution was monitored by an in-line fluorometer (excitation at 550 nm, emission at 570 nm). Protease Sensitivity of Substrate Protein in the GroEL·GroES Complex—GroEL that had been saturated with denatured rhodanese was prepared as described previously (21Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45737-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 1 mm nucleotide, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm BeCl2, 20 mm Na2S2O3, 1 μm rhodanese-saturated GroEL, 2.0 μm GroES, and 1 mm DTT in HKM buffer. Unbound GroES and substrate proteins were removed by ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-100) at 90 min after initiation of the reaction. Chymotrypsin (final concentration, 1 μg/ml) and glycerol (final concentration, 10% v/v) were added to 25 μl of the mixture containing 1 mm DTT and 15 μg of protein in HKM buffer. Following incubation for 20 min at 25 °C, components with a molecular mass of <100 kDa were removed by ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-100). An aliquot of the resulting solution was analyzed by 13% SDS-PAGE. The intensity of band staining was quantified using the NIH Image program and calibrated using known protein concentrations. Conservation of Novel Contacts in the E. coli GroEL·GroES Complex—To investigate whether or not the GXXLE region is in contact with GroES in the E. coli GroEL·GroES complex, we conducted a series of cross-linking experiments using mutants of E. coli GroEL and GroES. We replaced Met307, Glu308, Leu309, and Glu310 in GroEL, and Thr28, Gly29, and Ser30 in GroES with Cys. The removal of DTT from the reaction mixture containing GroEL and GroES led to the generation of a single high molecular mass band, corresponding to cross-linked GroEL-GroES (Fig. 2, A and B). Binding of GroES to GroEL is known to be ATP (or ADP)-dependent, and the cross-linking was only successful when ATP was present. Among the mutants, the combination GroEL(E308C)/GroES(S30C) was most efficiently cross-linked, followed by the combination of GroEL(E308C)/GroES(G29C). We found efficient intrasubunit cross-linking between L309C and E232C at the N terminus of the H helix (Fig. 2C), and cross-link formation was not affected by nucleotides or GroES. These results confirm that the topological arrangement of the GXXLE region in the GroEL·GroES complex of E. coli is similar to that of the T. thermophilus complex, where the mobile loop of GroES and the H helix interact with the GXXLE region. Effect of Mutation of Leu309 on Growth of E. coli—The results above indicate that Glu308 of GroEL and Gly29/Ser30 of GroES are in close proximity. Next we investigated a role for the highly conserved Leu309 in chaperonin function. We replaced Leu309 of GroEL with Val, Ala, Asn, Asp, and Lys. E. coli MM100 (25McLennan N. Masters M. Nature. 1998; 392: 139Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a strain in which expression of chromosomal GroEL-GroES is under control of the PBAD promoter (arabinose induction), was co-transformed with the expression plasmids encoding the GroEL Leu309 mutants and wild type GroES. Transformants were cultured on LB plates, in the absence of arabinose (Fig. 3). Cells with expression plasmids encoding the mutants GroEL(L309A) and GroEL(L309V) grew normally, as did cells expressing wild type GroEL. In contrast, as previously described by Fenton et al. (16Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), cells expressing the mutant GroEL(L309K) could not grow in the absence of arabinose, Similarly, cells expressing the mutants GroEL(L309N) or GroEL(L309D) were unable to rescue GroEL-deficient E. coli MM100. Thus, the GroEL mutants, in which Leu309 was replaced by polar residues, could not support growth of GroEL-deficient E. coli MM100, indicating a critical role for Leu309 in chaperonin function in vivo. Chaperone Activity of the Leu309 Mutants—The GroEL Leu309 mutants were purified, and their properties were examined. ATPase activities of the mutants were similar to those of the wild type (data not shown). Protein folding activity was tested using GFP. Denatured GFP was diluted into a solution of GroEL and GroES. Upon dilution, denatured GFP was bound efficiently to the GroEL mutant, because no spontaneous GFP folding occurred (Fig. 4A, inset). GFP started folding upon the addition of ATP, and regardless of mutations, a similar yield of folded protein (∼70%) was achieved after 200 s (Fig. 4A). In the parallel experiments, hexokinase was included in the mixtures to eliminate ATP and to prevent the secondary turnover of the GroEL reaction cycle. Excess trap-GroEL (GroEL(N265A)) (8Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) was added prior to ATP addition, to capture unfolded proteins in the bulk solution. Under these conditions, only folding of proteins encapsulated in the cis-cavity during the first round of the GroEL reaction cycle would be observed. Under the single cycle reaction conditions, the yield of folded GFP differed among the mutants (Fig. 4B). Two mutants, GroEL(L309A) and GroEL(L309V), retained wild type-like folding activity, whereas GroEL(L309N), GroEL(L309D), and GroEL(L309K) gave significantly reduced yields of folded protein. These results indicate that the GroEL mutants in which Leu309 was replaced by polar residues tend to fail in encapsulating unfolded proteins into the cis-cavity. In addition, we tested the effect of these mutations on the folding of stringent substrate proteins, such as MDH and rhodanese, the folding of which depends on the GroEL/GroES system. GroEL(L309V) and GroEL(L309A) mediated efficient folding of both proteins, with the former giving a better yield of folded protein than wild type GroEL (Fig. 4C). As expected, substitution of Leu309 by polar residues, particularly Lys and Asp substitutions, resulted in a significant decrease in the yields of reactivated proteins (MDH and rhodanese). Binding of Substrate Protein and GroES to GroEL(L309K)—In the light of previous investigations of GroEL(L309K) by Fenton et al. (16Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), we sought to analyze further the properties of GroEL(L309K). The mutant protein was mixed with denatured MDHCy3 and analyzed using gel filtration HPLC with elution in a buffer containing ATP (Fig. 5A). Like the wild type protein, GroEL(L309K) bound and retained MDHCy3. The binding of MDHCy3 to GroEL(L309K) was not affected by the presence of GroES in the mixture (Fig. 5B). Next we investigated the binding of GroESCy3. In the absence of denatured MDH, GroEL(L309K) formed a complex with GroESCy3 (Fig. 5C). However, in the presence of denatured MDH, GroESCy3 was primarily eluted as the free GroES heptamer (Fig. 5D). Under the same conditions, the wild type GroEL formed a complex with both MDHCy3 (Fig. 5B) and GroESCy3 (Fig. 5D). These results demonstrate that GroEL(L309K) can bind denatured substrate protein or GroES individually but cannot form a GroEL·GroES·MDH cis-ternary complex that has sufficient stability to survive gel filtration. cis-Ternary Complexes of GroEL(L309K) Formed in BeFx and Their Sensitivity to Protease Digestion—In general, BeFx can mimic the phosphate of enzyme-bound nucleotides and stabilize transient complexes in ATP- and GTP-metabolizing proteins (28Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In the case of GroEL, BeFx stabilizes the cis-ternary complex of GroEL; a 1:2:2 GroEL·GroES·substrate protein complex with double cis-cavities and a 1:1:2 GroEL·GroES·substrate protein complex with a single cis-cavity are formed with ATP and ADP, respectively (27Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45737-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Each cavity contains a substrate protein that is able to fold and that is protected from the attack by protease (27Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45737-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In anticipation that BeFx would also stabilize the cis-ternary complex of GroEL(L309K), we included BeFx in the reaction mixtures that contained rhodanese as a substrate protein. The complex was isolated using ultrafiltration and analyzed with SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6, lanes 1-6). In a control experiment, 1 mol of free wild type GroEL or GroEL(L309K) (without GroES, nucleotide and BeFx) bound 2 mol of rhodanese (lanes 1 and 2). The GroEL(L309K) complex that formed in the presence of ATP and BeFx, GroEL(L309K)·GroES·rhodanese, had an apparent composition of 1:2:1 (lane 4). This indicated that, for the GroEL(L309K) mutant, one of the two rhodanese molecules in the 1:2:2 GroEL·GroES·rhodanese complex (lane 3) had dissociated. The GroEL(L309K) complex, formed in the presence of ADP and BeFx, had an apparent composition of 1:1:2 (GroEL(L309K)·GroES·rhodanese) (lane 6). This composition is the same as found for wild type (lane 5). In this complex, one substrate occupies the cis-cavity, whereas the other is positioned on the opposite (trans) GroEL ring, without GroES. In parallel experiments, the isolated complexes were treated with chymotrypsin, reisolated using ultrafiltration, and analyzed with SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6, lanes 7-12). The rhodanese molecules that had bound to free GroEL (wild type or GroEL(L309K)) were digested completely (lanes 7 and 8). Rhodanese molecules in the 1:2:2 GroEL·GroES·rhodanese complex were fully protected from digestion (lane 9). Rhodanese molecules in the 1:2:1 GroEL(L309K)·GroES·rhodanese complex were digested completely (lane 10). For the complexes formed in the presence of ADP and BeFx, only one rhodanese molecule in the wild type 1:1:2 GroEL·GroES·rhodanese complex was digested (lane 11). Both rhodanese molecules in the 1:1:2 GroEL(L309K)·GroES·rhodanese complex were digested (lane 12). Thus, the substrate proteins in the GroEL(L309K)·GroES complexes are all accessible to attack by chymotrypsin. Similar results were obtained when MDH was used as a substrate protein (data not shown). It appears, therefore, that GroEL(L309K) can form a relatively stable ternary complex with GroES and substrate proteins in the presence of BeFx; however, it cannot properly shield the substrate proteins from the bulk medium. Thus, the substrate polypeptide is exposed, at least partially, to the protease-containing medium in this experiment. These results indicate that GroEL(L309K) is impaired in its ability to encapsulate substrate protein efficiently into the cis-cavity. Decreased Cross-linking between GroEL(L309K) and GroES—We tested whether or not the GroEL(L309K) mutation affects the contact between the GXXLE region and a loop region of GroES. The level of cross-linking between E308C of GroEL and S30C of GroES was lower in the GroEL(L309K) mutant that in wild type, in the presence of ATP or ATP and BeFx (Fig. 7). These results suggest an aberrant contact between the GXXLE region of GroEL(L309K) and GroES. Leu309 Plays a Critical Role in the Encapsulation of Substrate—It was previously reported by Fenton et al. (16Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), that GroEL(L309K) was unable to assist with either folding in vitro or the rescue of GroEL-deficient E. coli. The results from this study indicate that GroEL(L309K) cannot properly encapsulate substrate protein into the cis-cavity. It appears that the GroEL(L309K)·substrate protein complex cannot bind GroES in a stable and productive manner. When the complex is stabilized by BeFx, the substrate protein is unable to fold and is susceptible to protease digestion. This indicates that the substrate protein in the BeFx-stabilized complex is still tethered to GroEL and is exposed to the outside medium because of incomplete capping by GroES. It is possible that GroES cannot completely sequester the common binding sites on all GroEL subunits, and so both GroES and the substrate protein remain bound to GroEL. Because BeFx is thought to stabilize transient complexes in many ATP-metabolizing proteins, it is likely that the wild type GroEL also forms a transient intermediate like the GroEL(L309K)· GroES·substrate protein complex, before assuming the productive cis-ternary complex structure. If this suggestion is correct, then the next step of the wild type GroEL reaction cycle must be the discharge of substrate into the cis-cavity, accompanied by completion of GroES capping. The contention above is similar to the two-timer model of GroEL functioning (11Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In that model, the GroEL·substrate complex binds GroES to generate a key intermediate whereby the substrate protein is tethered at some point to GroEL, and decay of this complex (∼3 s) accompanies discharge of the substrate protein into the cis-cavity. In our experiments, the substrate protein was still in a non-native, protease-susceptible state in the BeFx-stabilized GroEL(L309K)· GroES·substrate complex. Thus, this ternary complex may resemble the intermediate described in the two-timer model. The Role of the GXXLE Region—GroEL(L309K) and the other mutants in the GXXLE region bind substrate protein normally (Figs. 4 and 5, A and B). In nucleotide-dependent GroES binding, GroEL(L309K) binds GroES normally in the absence of substrate (Fig. 5C). This demonstrates that the GXXLE region does not contribute to GroES binding in the absence of substrate. These results confirm previous studies showing that the H-I helices of GroEL are sufficient for GroES binding (16Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 19Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). In contrast, the GroEL(L309K)·substrate protein complex binds GroES poorly (Fig. 5D), unless BeFx is included in the reaction mix to stabilize the transient ATP-bound complex (Fig. 6). These findings indicate that the integrity of the GXXLE region is critical for the binding of GroES to the GroEL/substrate protein complex. The following model suggests a means by which Leu309 plays a pivotal role in subunit association and function (Fig. 1B). When associated with GroEL, one GroES subunit interacts with two adjacent GroEL subunits, using different stretches of the mobile loop (Fig. 1B). Similarly, one GroEL subunit is in contact with two adjacent GroES subunits at the H-I helices and the GXXLE region (Fig. 1B). The two contact sites in a GroEL subunit can communicate with each other through a hydrophobic cluster formed by the side chain of Leu in the GXXLE region and residues at the entrance formed by the H helix. Consequently, in the whole GroEL-GroES ring structure, these contacts form an interaction sequence connecting all of the GroES/substrate-binding sites in the apical domain of GroEL and the mobile loop of GroES. Therefore, one can assume that binding of one GroES subunit to the GXXLE region can induce conformational transitions in the H helix, which can stimulate release of the substrate and free the binding site for the next GroES subunit. If communication between the GXXLE region and the H helix is interrupted, as in the L309K mutation, the interaction sequence will halt and produce an unstable ternary complex. However, further study is required to confirm this hypothesis. We thank Dr. M. Masters for kindly providing us with E. coli MM100."

These two families have different specificities for metal cofactors, which is thought to be because of the fact that family II PPases have three active site histidines, whereas family I PPases have none. Here, we report the structural and functional characterization of a unique family I PPase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtPPase) that has two His residues (His21 and His86) in the active site. The 1.3-Å three-dimensional structure of mtPPase shows that His86 directly interacts with bound sulfate, which mimics the product phosphate. Otherwise, mtPPase is structurally very similar to the well studied family I hexameric PPase from Escherichia coli, although mtPPase lacks the intersubunit metal binding site found in E. coli PPase. The cofactor specificity of mtPPase resembles that of E. coli PPase in that it has high activity in the presence of Mg2+, but it differs from the E. coli enzyme and family II PPases because it has much lower activity in the presence of Mn2+ or Zn2+. Replacements of His21 and His86 in mtPPase with the residues found in the corresponding positions of E. coli PPase had either no effect on the Mg2+- and Mn2+-supported reactions (H86K) or reduced Mg2+-supported activity (H21K). However, both replacements markedly increased the Zn2+-supported activity of mtPPase (up to 11-fold). In the double mutant, Zn2+ was a 2.5-fold better cofactor than Mg2+. These results show that the His residues in mtPPase are not essential for catalysis, although they determine cofactor specificity.

(EC 3.6.1.1), is an essential metal-dependent enzyme that converts pyrophosphate into orthophosphate. This simple reaction provides a thermodynamic pull for many biosynthetic reactions that yield pyrophosphate as a byproduct (1Kornberg A. Kasha H. Pullman B. Horizons in Biochemistry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1962: 251-264Google Scholar). Soluble PPases belong to two nonhomologous families (2Young T.W. Kuhn N.J. Wadeson A. Ward S. Burges D. Cooke G.D.

In eubacteria and archaebacteria, the family I PPases are usually homohexamers, whereas in eukaryotes, they are homodimers. In contrast, all family II PPases are homodimers. The subunit size is generally 19–22 kDa in hexameric PPases and 31–34 kDa in dimeric forms. Despite the variability of the subunit size in family I PPases, their active site cavities are formed by the same 13 functionally important polar residues, which is reflected in the conservation of the catalytic mechanism (4Heikinheimo P.

Although no sequence or overall structural similarity is observed between the two families, there is a striking similarity in the spatial arrangement of six key active site residues, a remarkable example of convergent enzyme evolution (6Merckel M.C.

Functionally, family II differs from family I in its preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+ as a cofactor. Mg2+ is a better cofactor for family I PPases, and it also activates family II PPases to the same extent. However, Mn2+ confers a 20-fold higher activity to family II PPases than Mg2+ (8Parfenyev A.N. Salminen A. Halonen P. Hachimori A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J. Biol.

The difference in cofactor specificity is thought to arise from the presence of histidine residues in the active site of family II PPases. There are a total of three such histidine residues, two act as ligands that bind to metal ions and one is believed to interact with bound PPi (6Merckel M.C. Fabrichniy I.P. Salminen A. Kalkkinen N.

Wang, Protein Data Bank entry 1TWL. Here, we present the structure of a family I PPase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtPPase), which closely resembles the structure of other bacterial family I PPases but is unique in having two histidine residues (His21 and His86) in the active site. To elucidate the role of these histidine residues in mtPPase, we replaced them with the residues (Lys and Ala, respectively) found in the corresponding positions in the best studied bacterial family I PPase from Escherichia coli (ecPPase) and measured the effects of these replacements on catalysis and cofactor specificity. Cloning of mtPPase—The Rv3628 gene encoding mtPPase was kindly provided by Dr. Florence Proux (Institut Pasteur, Paris) on a pDEST17 vector and was amplified by PCR using: 5′-CACCACCACCACATGCAATTCGACGTGACCATCGAAA-3′ as forward primer and 5′-GAGGAGAAGGCGCGTTATCAGTGTGTACCGGCCTTGAAGCGCTC-3′ as a reverse primer. The PCR was performed using KOD Hot start DNA polymerase (Thermococcus kodakaraensis; Novagen) with an initial denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and extension for 2 min at 72 °C. A final extension was carried out for 3 min at 72 °C. The purified PCR product was inserted via ligation-independent cloning using a modified pET28a vector (pET-YSBLIC) with a noncleavable His tag, giving a total overhang of 10 residues (MGSSHHHHHH). Mutagenesis was performed by an overlapping PCR technique using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of mtPPase—The mtPPase-pET-YSBLIC plasmid was first transformed into NovaBlue singles (Novagen) for plasmid production and then into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. A single colony was used to inoculate 10 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (15Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin, which was then grown overnight at 30 °C with vigorous shaking (160 rpm in a Gallenkamp orbital shaker). The overnight culture (10 ml) was used to inoculate 1 liter of Terrific Broth (TB) medium (15Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), which also contained 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and was grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking until the A600 reached 0.6. The temperature of the culture was decreased to 30 °C, and protein production was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate imidazole buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.6) supplemented with 20% glycerol and 0.5% Triton X-100, and resuspended in 50 ml of the same medium supplemented with a tablet of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were lysed for 30 min with 1 mg/ml of hen egg white lysozyme (Sigma). The cell suspension, kept on ice, was then sonicated using a Soniprep 150 MSE (with a 19-mm probe tuned to 23 kHz) with 10 pulses of 60 s with 30-s intervals between pulses at half-power to prevent foaming. After sonication, the lysed cell suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g to remove cell debris, and the crude extract was loaded at a flow rate of 2 ml/min onto a 10-ml column containing nickel-charged chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with the phosphate-imidazole buffer. The column was washed at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with phosphate-imidazole buffer until the A280 baseline was stable, and a linear gradient of 20 column volumes from 20 to 500 mm imidazole was applied. Fractions containing mtPPase were pooled (50 ml), dialyzed overnight against 40 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, concentrated to 5 ml by ultrafiltration using Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience, Sartorius group), and loaded onto a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column that had been washed with Tris-HCl buffer. The protein eluted at 1 ml/min was concentrated to 12 mg/ml and used for crystallization. To produce wild-type and variant mtPPase for functional studies, we employed a modified procedure for protein expression and isolation. E. coli C41(DE3) ril (16Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar) cells transformed with corresponding mtPPase-pET28a constructs were used for both plasmid production and protein expression. A single colony was used to inoculate 1 ml of 2× YT medium (15Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin (2× YT-kan). The cells were grown for 3 h at 37°C and transferred to 50 ml of 2× YT-kan. The cells were grown for another 4 h and then stored overnight at 4 °C. One liter of 2× YT-kan was inoculated with 50 ml of bacterial culture, and after 1.5 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h. The harvested cell pellets were kept frozen at –20 °C. After thawing on ice, 5 g of the cell paste were resuspended in 25 ml of ice-cold Tris/imidazole buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm imidazole-HCl, and 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) and homogenized twice in a French press (SLM Instruments) at 800 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Nickel-chelating chromatography was performed as described above but using Tris/imidazole buffer instead of phosphate imidazole buffer. Superdex 200 gel filtration was performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl. The purity of the eluted enzyme was checked by electrophoresis on 8–25% gradient polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.55% sodium dodecyl sulfate using the Phast System (Amersham Biosciences). Concentrations of mtPPase solutions were determined on the basis of a subunit molecular mass of 19.5 kDa and an extinction coefficient ϵ1%280 of 9.8 (as estimated from the amino acid composition using ProtParam). Metal ions were removed from the enzyme stocks as follows. The enzyme solution was diluted to 1–5 mg/ml with 83 mm TES/KOH buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2 mm EDTA and 17 mm KCl, incubated for 1 day at 4 °C, and subjected to two 40-fold concentration/dilution cycles in a Centricon YM-30 centrifugal filter device (Amicon) using 83 mm TES/KOH buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 μm EGTA and 17 mm KCl. Finally, the enzyme solutions were concentrated to ∼100 mg/ml and stored frozen at –70 °C. Expression and Purification of ecPPase—Wild-type ecPPase was overexpressed in MC1061 E. coli cells and purified as described previously (17Salminen T. Käpylä J. Heikinheimo P. Kankare J. Goldman A. Heinonen J. Baykov A.A. Cooperman B.S. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Crystallization of mtPPase and Structure Determination—Protein crystallization was performed at 20 °C using the hanging drop method. Precipitant and protein solutions (1 μl each) were mixed in 24-well Falcon plates equilibrated by vapor diffusion against 1 ml of precipitant. Crystals grew over 4 days from a solution of 1.7 m ammonium sulfate and 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) up to a dimension of ∼0.3 × 0.3 × 0.8 mm. A single crystal was soaked in 4 μl of a cryosolution containing 20% glycerol, 2 m ammonium sulfate, and 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0). The crystal was then collected with a cryoloop and transferred to the goniometer head in a stream of cold (120 K) nitrogen (Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream). Data to a maximum resolution of 1.8 Å were collected on a rotating anode source with CuKα radiation using a MAR345 image plate detector. The crystal was then stored in liquid nitrogen for further data collection at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data to a maximum resolution of 1.3 Å were collected at the ID14-1 beamline (TABLE ONE). Images were autoindexed and integrated with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38565) Google Scholar). The space group was determined to be P6322 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, giving a Matthews coefficient of 3.5 with 64.5% solvent content. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the PPase from Thermus thermophilus (ttPPase, Protein Data Bank code 2PRD) as a model and the program AmoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) as implemented in the CPP4 interface. The model was chosen because, based on a BLAST search against the PDB, it had the most similar sequence (51% sequence identity). Residues 1 to 13 were removed from the model because the mtPPase sequence starts at position 14 of the ttPPase sequence. The best solution after rigid body fitting had a correlation coefficient of 46.5 and an Rfactor of 49.4%. The solution from AMoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) was initially refined with REFMAC (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13865) Google Scholar) to an Rfactor and Rfree of 41.0 and 46.4%, respectively. The model was then automatically updated using Arp/wArp (21Morris R.J. Zwart P.H. Cohen S. Fernandez F.J. Kakaris M. Kirillova O. Vonrhein C. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) replacing the PDB 2PRD sequence with the mtPPase sequence. The Rfactor and Rfree dropped to 17.1 and 21.6%, respectively, with the model being almost completely autotraced. Model building was completed using the program COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23344) Google Scholar), and further cycles of refinement were carried out with REFMAC coupled with Arp/wArp to update the water molecules. Visual inspection of the waters was carried out with COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23344) Google Scholar). The model was then refined again without an automatic water update to a final Rfactor of 15.4% and Rfree of 16.9%.

The samples contained 10 μm enzyme and 1mm MgCl2. Before each run, the samples were incubated for 2 to 3 h at 2 °C. The sedimentation velocity was measured at 48,000 rpm, and the sedimentation coefficient, s20,w, was calculated as described by Chervenka (23Chervenka C.H. Methods for the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Spinco Division of Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1972: 23-33Google Scholar). Activity Measurements—Rates of PPi hydrolysis were determined from continuous recordings of Pi liberation using an automatic Pi analyzer (24Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by adding a suitable aliquot of enzyme solution and carried out for 3–4 min at 25 °C. Analysis of Kinetic Data—Equations 1 and 2 describe the equilibrium activity of a mixture of hexamer (with a specific activity AH) and its dissociated form (with a specific activity AD) as a function of the H+ concentration. Equation 2 was obtained by combining Equations 2 and 3 from Efimova et al. (25Efimova I.S. Salminen A. Pohjanjoki P. Lapinniemi J. Magretova N.N. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. J.

[E]t is total enzyme concentration, αH is the fraction of enzyme in hexameric form expressed in monomers, Kd′ is the pH-independent dissociation constant for the hexamer, Ka is the microscopic dissociation constant for H+ binding to the dissociated form, and m is the number of protons controlling hexamer stability. Equations 1 and 2 were fit to data simultaneously using SCIENTIST (MicroMath) as follows.A=AD+(AH-AD)αH(Eq. 1) 23[E]t(1-αH)2-Kd'(1+[H+]Ka)mαH=0(Eq. 2) Values of the catalytic constant, kcat, and the Michaelis constant, Km, were obtained from the dependence of the reaction rate on the concentration of dimagnesium pyrophosphate (Mg2PPi) measured at fixed Mg2+ concentrations. The dependence of kcat on pH were fit to Equation 3, where kcat,ind is the pH-independent catalytic constant, and Ka1 and Ka2 are the ionization constants for the essential basic and acidic groups, respectively. The dependence of kcat on metal cofactor concentration were fit to Equation 4, where [M] is the cofactor concentration, KM is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-metal complex, and kcat,lim is the limiting value of kcat at saturating [M] as shown in the following equations.kcat=kcat,ind/(1+[H+]/Ka1+Ka2/[H+])(Eq. 3) kcat=kcat,lim[M]/(KM+[M])(Eq. 4) Expression and Purification of mtPPase—SDS-PAGE analysis of crude extracts obtained from recombinant E. coli cells revealed an intense ∼20-kDa band that was absent in the same cells transformed with empty pET28a plasmid (data not shown). Based on these results, both the wild-type and variant mtPPases were estimated to represent 20–30% of the total protein, and the recombinant enzymes were easily purified to homogeneity. The His-tagged PPases eluted as a single peak from the nickel-affinity column as the imidazole concentration was increased to ∼200 mm. The pass-through fraction exhibited low but measurable PPase activity, presumably because of the chromosomal-encoded E-PPase that contains no His tag and, hence, does not bind to the nickel-affinity column. Finally, traces of contaminating proteins detected in the eluted mtPPase by SDS-PAGE were removed by Superdex 200 chromatography. This procedure yielded 60 to 120 mg of pure mtPPase per liter of cell culture (∼10 g of cell paste). Three-dimensional Structure of mtPPase—The quality of the data allowed the mtPPase (1SXV) polypeptide chain to be almost automatically traced into the electron density map. The mtPPase structure is composed of 162 amino acid residues of which only the last three (Gly160, Thr161, and His162) are not visible in the electron density map because they are disordered or in multiple conformations. Bound to the model are 1 sulfate ion, 3 molecules of glycerol (present in the cryoprotectant), and 238 molecules of water. Bound metal atoms were not found in the active site, as previously observed for other PPases crystallized in the absence of metal salts (e.g. 1JFD; Ref. 26Avaeva S. Kurilova S. Nazarova T. Rodina E. Vorobyeva N. Sklyankina V. Grigorjeva O. Harutyunyan E. Oganessyan V. Wilson K. Dauter Z. Huber R. Mather T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The overall fold of the mtPPase subunit closely resembles the structure of the five other bacterial PPase structures that have been reported, including PPases from E. coli (10Kankare J. Neal G.S.

Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3160) Google Scholar) at the EBI server reveals that the core structure of all PPases are very similar. The lowest root mean square deviation (r.m.s. deviation = 0.93 Å) was with E. coli 1OBW, followed by the PPase from P. furiosus (1TWL; r.m.s. deviation = 1.07 Å). The main difference is in the N-terminal region, where mtPPase is shorter than any other reported PPase structure. The active site of mtPPase contains the same 13 conserved polar residues found in other family I PPases (28Baykov A.A. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Lahti R. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 23: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These residues, which participate in cofactor and substrate binding and activation of nucleophilic water (4Heikinheimo P. Lehtonen J. Baykov A. Lahti R. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1491-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Salminen T. Käpylä J. Heikinheimo P.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1754-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), are arranged in a similar way in mtPPase and ecPPase (Fig. 1). However, a striking difference is that the mtPPase active site contains two additional His residues, His21 and His86, in place of Lys34 and Ala99 in ecPPase. His86 forms a hydrogen bond with a single bound sulfate ion, which mimics the product phosphate and occupies the same position as the sulfate in the ecPPase-sulfate complex (PDB code 1JFD; Ref. 26Avaeva S. Kurilova S. Nazarova T. Rodina E. Vorobyeva N. Sklyankina V. Grigorjeva O. Harutyunyan E. Oganessyan V. Wilson K. Dauter Z. Huber R. Mather T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The sulfate in mtPPase has an occupancy of 1, whereas the ecPPase sulfate has an occupancy of only 0.5, which may indicate stronger binding in mtPPase because of the bond with His86. Formation of this bond causes a shift of up to 3.9 Å in the main chain segment 85–91. Another difference between the two enzymes is that sulfate binding to mtPPase does not cause the molecular asymmetry observed in ecPPase (26Avaeva S. Kurilova S. Nazarova T. Rodina E. Vorobyeva N. Sklyankina V. Grigorjeva O. Harutyunyan E. Oganessyan V. Wilson K. Dauter Z. Huber R. Mather T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); the biological hexamer is formed by identical subunits in the sulfate complex of mtPPase. Superposition of the mtPPase biological hexamer and the ecPPase (1OBW) hexamer with SSM showed a very close match with a Q-score of 0.78 and a r.m.s. deviation of 1.13 Å. In contrast, the superposition with ttPPase, which has a different subunit packing (31Salminen T. Teplyakov A. Kankare J. Cooperman B.S. Lahti R. Goldman A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), gave a Q-score of only 0.56 with a r.m.s. deviation of 2.14 Å. The buried area is 1320 Å2 upon trimer formation and 850 Å2 upon further packing into hexamer as determined using AREAIMOL in the CCP4 version 5.0 suite (32Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5341) Google Scholar). The corresponding buried areas for ecPPase (1OBW) are 1480 and 870 Å2, respectively. The number of intratrimer hydrogen bonds, detected by the CONTACT program in the CCP4 suite, is greater in mtPPase than in ecPPase (24 versus 12 per subunit), whereas intertrimeric bonds occur less frequently in mtPPase than in ecPPase (4 and 8, respectively). This highlights the prevalence of hydrophobic contacts between trimers in mtPPase. Catalytic Character"
