https://openalex.org/W2134886125,"Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is the rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis. Stimulation of rat adipocytes with isoproterenol results in phosphorylation of HSL and a 50-fold increase in the rate of lipolysis. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping to show that phosphorylation sites other than the previously identified Ser-563 are phosphorylated in HSL in response to isoproterenol stimulation of32P-labeled rat adipocytes. Phosphorylation of HSL in adipocytes in response to isoproterenol and in vitrophosphorylation of HSL containing Ser → Ala mutations in residues 563 and 565 (S563A,S565A) with protein kinase A (PKA), followed by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping resulted in two tryptic phosphopeptides. These tryptic phosphopeptides co-migrated with the phosphopeptides released by the same treatment of F654HPRRSSQGVLHMPLYSSPIVK675phosphorylated with PKA. Analysis of the phosphorylation site mutants, S659A, S660A, and S659A,S660A disclosed that mutagenesis of both Ser-659 and Ser-660 was necessary to abolish the activation of HSL toward a triolein substrate after phosphorylation with PKA. Mutation of Ser-563 to alanine did not cause significant change of activation compared with wild-type HSL. Hence, our results demonstrate that in addition to the previously identified Ser-563, two other PKA phosphorylation sites, Ser-659 and Ser-660, are present in HSL and, furthermore, that Ser-659 and Ser-660 are the major activity controlling sites in vitro.

Free fatty acids stored as triacylglycerols in the adipocytes comprise the quantitatively most important energy substrate in mammals. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PKA, protein kinase A; TLE, thin layer electrophoresis; tPP, tryptic phosphopeptide; wt, wild-type. (EC 3.1.1.3) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the hydrolysis of stored triacylglycerols and is thereby a key enzyme in the mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (1Holm C. Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Fredrikson G. Nilsson S. Miller C.G. Shively J.E. Heinzmann C. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Lusis A.J. Belfrage P. Schotz M.C. Science. 1988; 241: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The hormonal and neural control of lipolysis is exerted by regulation of HSL activity, mediated by reversible phosphorylation (2Strålfors P. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15146-15152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Strålfors P. Björgell P. Belfrage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In response to catecholamines and other fast-acting lipolytic hormones, HSL is activated through the phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). The major antilipolytic hormone insulin prevents cAMP-mediated phosphorylation and activation of HSL (3Strålfors P. Björgell P. Belfrage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The antilipolytic effect of insulin is brought about mainly by activation of phosphodiesterase 3B (4Degerman E. Smith C.J. Tornqvist H. Vasta V. Manganiello V.C. Belfrage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). HSL has in intact rat adipocytes been reported to be phosphorylated at two sites (3Strålfors P. Björgell P. Belfrage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These sites were later identified as Ser-563 (5Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Ser-565 (6Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 129: 249-254Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In hormonally quiescent cells, only Ser-565 is phosphorylated (3Strålfors P. Björgell P. Belfrage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Stimulation with noradrenaline increases the phosphorylation extent of Ser-563 to that of Ser-565 (3Strålfors P. Björgell P. Belfrage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Ser-563 is also phosphorylated in vitro by PKA (5Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ser-565 has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by the 5′-AMP-activated kinase (6Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 129: 249-254Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This kinase, which phosphorylates and regulates the activity of other key enzymes in lipid metabolism (7Hardie D.G. Carling C. Sim A.T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (151) Google Scholar), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (fatty acid synthesis), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (cholesterol synthesis), has also been suggested to be the kinase phosphorylating Ser-565 in vivo (8Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-565 does not directly affect the activity of HSL (6Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 129: 249-254Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, Ser-563 has been anticipated to be the activity-controlling site, although direct evidence for this has not been reported. Phosphorylation of Ser-563 and phosphorylation of Ser-565 in HSL have been shown to be mutually exclusive (9Garton A.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of Ser-565 has been shown to inhibit subsequent phosphorylation and activation by PKA (6Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 129: 249-254Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Because of the negative interaction between phosphorylation of Ser-563 and Ser-565, phosphorylation of Ser-565 has been suggested to have an antilipolytic role (6Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 129: 249-254Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The mechanism behind activation of HSL upon phosphorylation by PKA is poorly understood, but it seems to involve translocation from the cytosol to the lipid droplet (10Hirsch A.H. Rosen O.M. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 665-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.-K. Wek S.A. Moos M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 89: 8537-8541Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and possibly conformational changes and change in specific activity. To establish the role of Ser-563 in phosphorylation and activation of HSL and to examine the interaction between the phosphorylation sites Ser-563 and Ser-565, we created a set of phosphorylation site mutants. Surprisingly, mutagenesis of Ser-563 did not abolish activation of HSL upon phosphorylation with PKA, indicating that a PKA phosphorylation site(s) in addition to Ser-563 exists in HSL. These results led us to perform two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of HSL phosphorylated in vitro with PKA or isolated from intact32P-labeled adipocytes. Consequently, we report here the identification of two novel regulatory phosphorylation sites in HSL that are phosphorylated in response to isoproterenol. Mutation of both of these phosphorylation sites (to alanines) abolished the activation of HSL upon phosphorylation with PKA in vitro. Hence, we provide evidence that other PKA phosphorylation sites in addition to the previously identified Ser-563 exist in HSL and that these novel phosphorylation sites govern the activation properties of HSL in vitro. The full-length rat HSL cDNA, subcloned into the expression vector pSVL (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), was as described previously (12Holm C. Davis R.C. Østerlund T. Schotz M.C. Fredrikson G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced using the overlap extension method (13Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson J. Directed Mutagenesis. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar) and high-fidelity Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), as described previously (12Holm C. Davis R.C. Østerlund T. Schotz M.C. Fredrikson G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The end primers used to generate fragments containing the mutation(s) were located at nucleotide positions 2133–2160 and 2905–2926, respectively, in the rat HSL cDNA sequence. The mutagenic primers were located at nucleotide positions 2290–2317 (encoding replacement of Ser-563 and/or Ser-565) and 2576–2602 (encoding replacement of Ser-659 and/or Ser-660). Standard polymerase chain reaction thermal cycling parameters and 20 cycles in each of the two polymerase chain reactions were used. A cassette approach was employed to replace fragments of wild-type HSL cDNA by equivalent polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments containing the desired mutations (14Richards J.H. McPherson J. Directed Mutagenesis. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 199-215Google Scholar). A 409-base pair cassette, obtained utilizing the unique sites for AflIII and BssHII, was used for fragments encoding replacement of Ser-563 and Ser-565, and a 716-base pair cassette, obtained utilizing the unique sites forAflIII and SstII, was used for fragments encoding replacement of Ser-659 and Ser-660. Constructs encoding replacements in Ser-563 and/or Ser-565 and in Ser-659 and/or Ser-660, were generated by exchanging 308-base pair cassettes (from BssHII toSstII) between the corresponding pSVL constructs. The identity of each mutant and the absence of undesired mutations were verified by polymerase chain reaction-based automated sequencing, usingTaq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) and a model 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Expression of HSL and HSL mutants in COS cells was performed as described using the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5 μg of DNA per 60-mm dish (12Holm C. Davis R.C. Østerlund T. Schotz M.C. Fredrikson G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Holm C. Davis R. Fredrikson G. Belfrage P. Schotz M.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in triplicates, and at least three independent experiments were performed for each construct. The full-length rat HSL cDNA, subcloned into the expression vector pVL1393 (Invitrogen), was as described previously (16Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). HSL mutants in pVL1393 were created by exchanging cassettes from the corresponding pSVL constructs using the unique restriction sites NheI and BssHII. Transfections were carried out as described in the Baculovirus Expression Vector system manual from Pharmingen using the Baculogold transfection kit (Pharmingen). Production of recombinant rat HSL in the Baculovirus/insect cell system and subsequent purification by anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia) was performed as described previously (16Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). HSL was routinely assayed using emulsified 1(3)-mono-[3H]oleoyl-2-O-mono-oleyl-glycerol (a diacylglycerol ether analogue) as substrate (16Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Tornqvist H. Björgell P. Krabisch L. Belfrage P. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 654-656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and activation of HSL with PKA was carried out by incubation with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (Sigma or Promega; 0.2 units/μl or 110 nm), 0.4 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 1 μm okadaic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. The concentration of HSL ranged from 2 to 40 nm in different experiments. Within this range, no difference in the phosphorylation state or degree of activation of the enzyme due to altered PKA:HSL ratios were observed. In controls, PKA was omitted or PKA and protein kinase inhibitor (1 μm) were added simultaneously. For determination of activation, the phosphorylation reaction was terminated by adding 10 mm EDTA and 2 mmdithioerythritol. Activated and control samples were assayed using a 0.5 mm trioleoyl glycerol substrate at pH 8.3 (2Strålfors P. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15146-15152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For phosphorylations of rat adipose and recombinant rat HSL for phosphopeptide mapping, [γ-32P]ATP was added to a specific activity of about 1000 cpm/pmol ATP. Adipocytes from Sprague-Dawley rats (33–35 days old) were prepared (18Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.S. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15122-15129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated with32Pi (0.5 mCi/ml) (4Degerman E. Smith C.J. Tornqvist H. Vasta V. Manganiello V.C. Belfrage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 20Smith C.J. Vasta V. Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13385-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After preparation of homogenates and ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C), the floating fat cake and infranatant were separated. Fat cakes were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer containing 20% SDS (typically 400 μl of buffer per 50 μl of fat cake) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Life Science, Inc.; 90 V for 4 h in 20% ethanol, 190 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris). Phosphorylated recombinant rat HSL and HSL purified from rat adipose tissue were precipitated with 20% TCA, washed with ether:ethanol (3:1), and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes. SDS-PAGE alone was sufficient to separate32P-HSL from other 32P-labeled proteins. Recombinant rat 32P-HSL was used as standard in the SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the band corresponding to32P-HSL after digital imaging of 32P (Fujix BAS 2000, Fuji Inc.). 32P-HSL was excised and digested with trypsin (modified sequencing grade; Promega) as described (22Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saavedra R.A. Hood L.E. Kent S.B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 23Rahn T. Rönnstrand L. Leroy M.-J. Wernstedt C. Tornqvist H. Manganiello V.C. Belfrage P. Degerman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One μg of trypsin in 200 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate was applied per piece of membrane and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. About 90% of the 32P radioactivity was released from the membranes. Eluates were vacuum centrifuged and oxidized with formic acid as described (23Rahn T. Rönnstrand L. Leroy M.-J. Wernstedt C. Tornqvist H. Manganiello V.C. Belfrage P. Degerman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The oxidized phosphopeptides were trypsinized for 12 h at 37 °C in 140 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid:glacial acetic acid:H20, 44:156:1800 (v/v/v)) was added, and the mixture was centrifuged (10,000 × gfor 10 min) and vacuum centrifuged. Finally, the phosphopeptides were dissolved in 10 μl of pH 1.9 buffer and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis using the Hunter thin layer electrophoresis apparatus (HTLE-7000, CBS Scientific). The first dimension was performed in pH 1.9 buffer for 23 min at 2000 V, and the second dimension of ascending TLC was performed in isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid:n-butanol:pyridine:glacial acetic acid:H20, 1250:38:96:58:558 (v/v/v/v/v)). In some experiments, after localization of 32P by digital imaging,32P-phosphopeptides were scraped from the TLC plates, eluted in pH 1.9 buffer, and lyophilized. The phosphopeptides were either rerun in the two-dimensional system to assess co-migration with other peptides or subjected to additional digestion with chymotrypsin. One μg of chymotrypsin (sequencing grade; Boehringer Mannheim) was added to the phosphopeptides in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2 (50 μl) and incubated for 12 h at 25 °C. Trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%; 400 μl) was added, and the digests were applied to C18 disposable minicolumns (Chromabond; Macherey-Nagel) (24Rascon A. Degerman E. Taira M. Meacci E. Smith C.J. Manganiello V.C. Belfrage P. Tornqvist H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11962-11966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluate was then subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. The peptide F654HPRRSSQGVLHMPLYSSPIVK675 was synthesized (Biomolecular Core Facilities, Lund University) on an Applied Biosystems model 430A using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) program and purified by preparative reversed phase chromatography (Kromasil C8 column). The purity of the peptide was checked by high performance liquid chromatography. The peptide was phosphorylated with PKA, subjected to chromatography on C18 disposable minicolumns, and vacuum centrifuged. The phosphopeptides were suspended in 50 μl of 50 mmammonium bicarbonate buffer, subjected to the trypsinization, and further treated as described above. Aliquots of COS cell homogenates, corresponding to 3 milliunits of HSL activity, were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by Western blot analysis using the ECL system (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) with polyclonal chicken anti-rat HSL and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-chicken IgG (Sigma). To establish the role of and study the interaction between the different phosphorylation sites in HSL, the mutants S563A, S565A, and S563A,S565A were constructed and expressed in COS cells. The expressed mutants all had basal activities toward di- and triglycerides substrates that were comparable to those of wtHSL (data not shown). For the purpose of determining the activation of these mutants uponin vitro phosphorylation with PKA, emulsified triolein was used as substrate instead of the diacylglycerol analogue that is routinely used for measuring HSL activity because triolein and cholesterol oleate are superior to diglyceride and monoglyceride substrates for discrimination between the activity of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated HSL (25Heller R.A. Steinberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 270: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Khoo J.C. Aquino A.A. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 53: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Khoo J.C. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 602-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cook K.G. Yeaman S.J. Strålfors P. Fredrikson G. Belfrage P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ser-563 has been reported to be the only site phosphorylated by PKAin vivo and in vitro. Therefore, we expected a complete abolishment of the activation of S563A. However, as shown in Fig. 1, the activation of S563A and S563A,S565A was comparable to that obtained for wtHSL, suggesting that PKA phosphorylation site(s) other than Ser-563 exist in HSL. The activation of S565A was increased relative to wtHSL (Fig. 1), as would be expected based on the observation that phosphorylation of Ser-565 inhibits subsequent phosphorylation and activation by PKA (6Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 129: 249-254Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and assuming a substantial phosphorylation of Ser-565 in COS cells. To obtain higher protein purity and to further characterize the phosphorylation site mutants, S563A, S565A, S563A,S565A, and wtHSL were overexpressed in Sf9 cells and purified to approximately 20% purity. Upon incubation of the purified proteins with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP, radioactivity was incorporated in all of the mutants. Furthermore, the activation pattern for these partially purified mutants was the same as for the crude COS cell-expressed mutants shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of wtHSL was about 1 mole of phosphate per mole of enzyme, in accordance with previous results (2Strålfors P. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15146-15152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The incorporation of [32P]phosphate in S563A,S565A was about 40% compared with wtHSL (data not shown), consistent with the existence of another phosphorylation site(s) in HSL. Because of our results indicating the presence of sites in HSL other than Ser-563 that are phosphorylated by PKA, we decided to investigate the phosphorylation pattern of HSL. Two-dimensional tryptic32P-phosphopeptide maps of recombinant wtHSL, HSL purified from rat adipose tissue, and S563A,S565A, phosphorylated in vitro with PKA are shown in Fig. 2,A–C. By comparison of the phosphopeptide maps in Fig. 2, the tryptic phosphopeptide (tPP) corresponding to Ser-563 (identified by Garton et al. (5Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)), could be tentatively assigned. This assignment was supported by subjecting the mutants S563A and S565A to phosphopeptide mapping analysis and also by radiosequencing, which showed that both tPP1 and tPP2 were monophosphorylated, with radioactivity released in cycle 3 for tPP1 and in cycle 1 for tPP2 (data not shown). This suggests that tPP1 and tPP2 are derived from different HSL molecules phosphorylated on either Ser-563 or Ser-565. Identical phosphopeptide maps were obtained from recombinant wtHSL and HSL purified from adipose tissue (Fig. 2), thus confirming our previous study showing that recombinant rat HSL exhibits enzymological properties identical to HSL purified from rat adipose tissue (16Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the tryptic phosphopeptide map of S563A,S565A, two tPPs, designated tPP3 and tPP4, were obtained. The extent of phosphorylation of tPP3 and tPP4compared with the tPP containing the phosphorylated Ser-563 was about 25% for each. To ascertain that phosphorylation of the additional phosphorylation site(s) observedin vitro was found in vivo, we compared tryptic32P-phosphopeptide maps of S563A,S565A phosphorylated by PKA, with those of HSL isolated from intact 32P-labeled, isoproterenol-stimulated adipocytes. Fig. 2, D and E, displays tryptic phosphopeptide maps of translocated HSL from the fat cake, isolated from quiescent and isoproterenol-stimulated32P-labeled adipocytes, respectively. The tPP3and tPP4 from the tryptic phosphopeptide map of S563A,S565A (Fig. 2 C) were eluted from the TLC plates, mixed with apparent equivalent HSL peptides isolated from the fat cake of isoproterenol-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 D), and rerun using two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. Both tPP3 and tPP4 co-migrated with the respective phosphopeptides obtained from HSL from isoproterenol-stimulated cells (Fig.3). To further verify that the two apparently equivalent tPPs from isoproterenol-stimulated cells migrated identically to tPP3 and tPP4 from S563A,S565A, the tryptic phosphopeptides in question were recleaved with chymotrypsin. The chymotrypsin treatment clearly generated new phosphopeptides (Fig. 4). The chymotryptic-treated tPP3 and tPP4 from isoproterenol-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 D) were shown to co-migrate with tPP3 and tPP4 from S563A,S565A (Fig. 2 C), which were also recleaved with chymotrypsin (Fig.4, A–F). Thus, tPP3 and tPP4 from PKA-phosphorylated S563A,S565A were identical to tPP3 and tPP4 from isoproterenol-stimulated cells. Hence, the additional phosphorylation site(s) in HSL (which give rise to tPP3 and tPP4) were assumed to be of physiological importance.Figure 4Comparison of chymotryptic-treated phosphopeptides from rat adipocyte HSL phosphorylated in cells with phosphopeptides from chymotryptic-treated S563A,S565A.tPP3 and tPP4 from rat adipocyte HSL phosphorylated in cells and from HSL mutant S563A,S565A phosphorylatedin vitro with PKA were eluted from the TLC plates, digested with chymotrypsin and rerun in two-dimensional TLE/TLC alone (A, B, D, and E) or mixed (C and F) as indicated. ctPP 3 and ctPP 4 denote chymotryptic-digested tPP3 and tPP4, respectively.

J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) are compared, there are, in addition to Ser-563, three potential PKA sites based on the consensus sequence R(R/K)SS. These sites are coded for by exon 1 (Ser-99 in rat HSL) and exon 8 (Ser-659 and Ser-660 in rat HSL). From sequence alignments with lipase 2 from MoraxellaTA144 (16Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and from a three-dimensional model of HSL based on similarity in organization of secondary structure elements of HSL and a superfamily of esterases and lipases (29Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that parts of exon 7 and exon 8 (which encode the previously identified phosphorylation sites) constitute a regulatory module that has been inserted in HSL during evolution. We therefore hypothesized that the identities of the novel phosphorylation sites were Ser-659 and Ser-660. The peptide F654HPRRSSQGVLHMPLYSSPIVK675 was synthesized. After phosphorylation of this synthetic peptide with PKA and subsequent two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, two tPPs that appeared to migrate similarly to tPP3 and tPP4 in the two-dimensional separation system were obtained. In mixing experiments, the tryptic phosphopeptides obtained from F654HPRRSSQGVLHMPLYSSPIVK675were shown to co-migrate with tPP3 and tPP4from HSL isolated from the fat cake from isoproterenol-stimulated cells (Fig. 5). Radiosequencing of tPP3 and tPP4 revealed that the peptides were di- and monophosphorylated, respectively (Fig.6). The radioactivity was released in cycle 3 in tPP4 and in cycles 2 and 3 in tPP3. Thus, Ser-659 and Ser-660 were found to be phosphorylated simultaneously in the same peptide. However, the rate of phosphorylation of the two sites probably differs. Based on kinetic measurements performed on peptides containing the motifs RRS and RRXS (data not shown), Ser-660 can be assumed to exhibit the higher rate constant. To examine the function of the phosphorylation sites in the activation of HSL, the mutants S659A, S660A, S659A,S660A and mutants involving various combinations of these sites and Ser-563 and Ser-565 were generated and expressed in COS cells. A Western blot analysis of the expressed HSL and HSL mutants is shown in Fig.7 A. The increase in HSL activity after incubation with PKA assayed against a triolein substrate is shown in Fig. 7 B. Mutating either Ser-659 or Ser-660 did not cause marked reduction of activation relative to wtHSL. Mutants involving Ser-659 generally displayed lower activation than mutants involving Ser-660. However, mutating both Ser-659 and Ser-660 resulted in complete abolishment of activation (Fig. 7 B). Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping analysis of the mutant S659A,S660A phosphorylated with PKA resulted in a disappearance of tPP3and tPP4 (data not shown). All of the mutants were expressed (Fig. 7 A) in an apparently stable and enzymatically active form. Interestingly, because equal amounts of HSL activity were loaded on the gel and the intensity of the bands representing S565A, S565E, and S563A,S565A is significantly lower than for the other mutants, it can be concluded that these mutant proteins exhibit higher specific activity than wtHSL and the other mutants. The significance of this is not known. Our results show that HSL in isoproterenol-stimulated adipocytes is phosphorylated at the novel sites Ser-659 and Ser-660, as well as at the previously identified Ser-563. Thus, HSL, like other metabolically important enzymes, such as glycogen synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, is subject to complex activity regulation involving multisite phosphorylation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the importance of the different phosphorylation sites in the activation of HSL upon phosphorylation with PKA was elucidated (Fig. 7 B). The results clearly show that the novel phosphorylation sites Ser-659 and Ser-660 are the critical activity controlling sites, whereas Ser-563 plays a minor role in direct activation of HSL. The fact that the mutants S659A and S660A were both activated to about the same extent as wtHSL indicates that PKA can phosphorylate either Ser-659 or Ser-660 and give conformational changes resulting in comparable activation of HSL. The corresponding sequence in human cardiac troponin I, RRSS, has been shown to involve ordered phosphorylation of the adjacent residues Ser-23 and Ser-24 by PKA (30Mittman K. Jaquet K. Hilmeyer L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Quirk P.G. Patchell V.B. Gao Y. Levine B.A. Perry S.V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Quirk et al. (31Quirk P.G. Patchell V.B. Gao Y. Levine B.A. Perry S.V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) used nmr spectroscopy to show that a diphosphorylation of the adjacent serines induced a more extensive conformational transition than monophosphorylation. This provided an explanation on a molecular basis for the results of Zhang et al. (32Zhang R. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30773-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) showing that phosphorylation of both of the adjacent serine residues in cardiac troponin I was required for its proper function. Furthermore, Quirket al. (31Quirk P.G. Patchell V.B. Gao Y. Levine B.A. Perry S.V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) found that the rate of phosphorylation was more rapid for Ser-24 than for Ser-23. Radiosequencing of tPP3and tPP4 (Fig. 6) from HSL from the fat cake of isoproterenol-stimulated cells disclosed that radioactivity was released in cycles 2 and 3 (tPP3) and in cycle 3 (tPP4). Thus, at maximal lipolysis, besides the diphosphorylated peptide, only the monophosphorylated form involving Ser-660 was found. Hence, the phosphorylation state of Ser-660 is presumably functionally more important in adipocytes at the conditions investigated, i.e. at maximal lipolysis. Furthermore, the activation experiments suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-659 and Ser-660 is not dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser-563. The exact activation mechanism of HSL is poorly understood, but it presumably involves both translocation of HSL (10Hirsch A.H. Rosen O.M. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 665-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.-K. Wek S.A. Moos M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 89: 8537-8541Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and conformational changes in the HSL molecule. It is possible that different phosphorylation sites in HSL play different roles in the process of translocation and increase of specific activity of HSL. Thein vitro system used in this study to measure HSL activity does not reflect the translocation of HSL that presumably occursin vivo. This, together with the difference in nature of the substrates utilized in vivo and in vitro, could be the explanation for the discrepancy in the fold activation obtained in the in vitro assay (2–3-fold) and the in vivoassay (50-fold), as has previously been discussed extensively in the literature (33Belfrage P. Fredrikson G. Strålfors P. Tornqvist H. Borgström B. Brockman H. Lipases. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1984: 365-416Google Scholar, 34Holm C. Langin D. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 45-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the activity of HSL in vivo is subject to more complex activity regulation involving several assets than given by the in vitro system. Hence, a detailed discussion of the relative values of activation for the different mutants (Fig. 7 B) does not seem relevant. The role of different phosphorylation sites in the translocation of HSL will have to be investigated in studies using approaches different from those provided in this report. Phosphorylation of Ser-565 has been reported to prevent phosphorylation of Ser-563 and to have an antilipolytic role (6Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 129: 249-254Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9Garton A.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although our results confirm that phosphorylation of Ser-563 and phosphorylation of Ser-565 are mutually exclusive, the significance of this is difficult to appreciate until the role of phosphorylation of Ser-563 has been clarified. The effect of prior phosphorylation of Ser-565 on the subsequent phosphorylation of Ser-659 and Ser-660 has not been investigated in this study. However, it is interesting to note that the mutant S565A showed considerably higher activation than wtHSL, whereas the mutant S565E (in which a negative charge mimics the effect of phosphorylation) displayed lower activation than S565A, corroborating previous results that reported a negative effect of phosphorylation of Ser-565 on activation of HSL. In conclusion, we describe the identification of two novel phosphorylation sites, Ser-659 and Ser-660, in rat HSL that are phosphorylated in response to isoproterenol stimulation of rat adipocytes and are also phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. These sites, in contrast to the previously identified Ser-563, are directly involved in the activity control of the enzyme in vitro. Future studies will have to address the activity controlling properties of the novel sites in vivo, as well as the role of the previously identified Ser-563 and the interaction between the different phosphorylation sites."

Ca2+influx channels may be formed of proteins homologous toDrosophila Trp. At least six non-allelic Trpgenes are present in the mouse genome. Full-length human, bovine, mouse, and rat cDNAs for Trp1, 3, 4, 6 have been cloned. Expression of these genes in various mammalian cells has provided evidence that Trp proteins form plasma membrane Ca2+-permeant channels that can be activated by an agonist that activates phospholipase C, by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and/or store depletion. We have stably expressed human Trp3 (hTrp3) in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells. Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in Fura2-loaded cells showed that cell lines expressing hTrp3 have significantly higher basal and agonist-stimulated influxes of Ca2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ than control cells. The increase in Ca2+ entry attributable to the expression of hTrp3 obtained upon store depletion by thapsigargin was much lower than that obtained by stimulation with agonists acting via a Gq-coupled receptor. Addition of agonists to thapsigargin-treated Trp3 cells resulted in a further increase in the entry of divalent cations. The increased cation entry in Trp3 cells was blocked by high concentrations of SKF 96365, verapamil, La3+, Ni2+, and Gd3+. The Trp3-mediated Ca2+ influx activated by agonists was inhibited by a phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122. We propose that expression of hTrp3 in these cells forms a non-selective cation channel that opens after the activation of phospholipase C but not after store depletion. In addition, a subpopulation of the expressed hTrp3 may form heteromultimeric channels with endogenous proteins that are sensitive to store depletion.

In addition, a subpopulation of the expressed hTrp3 may form heteromultimeric channels with endogenous proteins that are sensitive to store depletion. The activities of a large number of enzymes are regulated through changes of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i ). 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+] i, intracellular Ca2+ concentration; PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; CCE, capacitative Ca2+ entry; TG, thapsigargin; IP4, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; V1aR: vasopressin receptor type 1a; C1 and C2, control-1 and control-2 cells, respectively; ECS, extracellular solution; CCh, carbachol; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Under resting conditions, cells keep [Ca2+] i at approximately 100 nm. A rise of the cytosolic Ca2+ triggers a cascade of Ca2+-sensitive events that are both immediate, such as secretion, contraction, and mobilization of energy resources (e.g. glycogenolysis), and long term, such as changes in the transcription of many genes. Some of the Ca2+-responsive transcription processes are known to cause proliferation and programmed cell death (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 98: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). In both nonexcitable and excitable cells, Ca2+ signaling pathways can be activated by a ligand binding to cell surface receptors that activate phospholipase C (PLC). These include receptors that activate heterotrimeric G proteins and receptors signaling through activation of protein tyrosine kinases. The activation of PLC leads to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which binds to IP3receptors, a class of intracellular ligand-operated Ca2+release channels. The opening of IP3 receptors allows Ca2+ to exit from its internal storage pools, causing a rapid increase in [Ca2+] i. The increased cytosolic Ca2+ level is reduced quickly by Ca2+ pumps located on both the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane, causing [Ca2+] i to decrease. The Ca2+ signal is prolonged, however, by the opening of a set of plasma membrane Ca2+-permeant channels that allow Ca2+ to enter cells from the extracellular space, where the concentration of Ca2+ is in the millimolar range. In many, and possibly all cells, the entering Ca2+ is taken up rapidly by a storage compartment from which it is re-released in the continued presence of the triggering extracellular signal. This may, although not necessarily, be accompanied by periodic oscillations of the [Ca2+] i and allows for regulation of cytosolic as well as membrane-associated functions of the affected cells (for reviews, see Refs. 1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar and 4Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Putney (5Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar, 6Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar) coined the term capacitative Ca 2+ entry (CCE) for Ca2+ entry that is activated upon stimulation of cells with agonists that promote Ca2+release from internal stores. After the discovery that CCE can be stimulated by mere store depletion, as occurs after inhibition of sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-activated ATPases with thapsigargin (TG) (7Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3001) Google Scholar, 8Kwan C.Y. Takemura H. Obie J.F. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1006-C1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), channels that mediate this type of CCE have been referred to as store-operated channels. In most cells, Ca2+ entry after stimulation by agonists can be explained by activation of store-operated channels, but neither the mechanism of how the store depletion signal is transmitted to the plasma membrane nor the molecular nature of the plasma membrane channels mediating Ca2+ has been clearly identified. Moreover, although store-operated plasma membrane Ca2+-permeant channel activities have been found in many cell types (9Hoth M. Penner R.

Naumov A.P. Kuryshev Yu.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 124: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Luckhoff A. Clapham D.E.

The molecular basis of this diversity and the relation of store depletion-insensitive Ca2+-permeant channels to store depletion-sensitive Ca2+-permeant channels are unclear. However, it is likely that multiple Ca2+ influx channels are involved in Ca2+ entry initiated by the activation of PLC-linked receptors. In Drosophila eyes, the light-induced current is carried by channels formed from at least two related photoreceptor-specific proteins, Trp and Trpl (Trp-like). Trp was identified by molecular cloning as a protein missing from the transient receptor potential (trp) mutant (18Montell C. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Trpl was identified biochemically as a calmodulin-binding protein and was cloned by standard techniques revealing a structure that shares a high degree of homology with Trp (19Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 631-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Because the phototransduction pathway in insects resembles the PLC/IP3 signaling pathway in mammalian cells, it was speculated that mammalian homologs of Trp may exist and form Ca2+ influx channels. In support of this, expression of Trpl in Sf9 cells led to development of an agonist-stimulated non-selective Ca2+-permeable ion conductance, and that of Trp led to the development of a TG-stimulated ion conductance (20Hu Y.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C1501-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither Trp-formed channels nor Trpl-formed channels displayed the ion permeation properties of endogenous insect CCE channels and, while forming channels, Trpl was not activated by TG treatment. More recently, work from the laboratories of Minke (23Gillo B. Chorna I. Cohen H. Cook B. Manistersky I. Chorev M. Arnon A. Pollock J.A. Selinger Z. Minke B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Functional expression of human Trp1, Trp3, bovine Trp4, or mouse Trp6 in COS, Chinese hamster ovary, or human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells results in enhancement of either agonist-stimulated Ca2+ entry or of IP3- or TG-stimulated inward currents that are at least in part carried by Ca2+ (26Zhu X.

More importantly, agonist-stimulated Ca2+ influx in murine L cells was blocked by transfection of murine Trp cDNA fragments in the antisense direction (26Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R.

For the present work we developed stable HEK293 cell lines expressing human Trp3 (hTrp3) and studied their Ca2+ influx properties. We report that the expression of hTrp3 caused an increase of [Ca2+] i under basal and agonist-stimulated conditions. The influx pathway formed by hTrp3 permeates Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+equally well, whereas the pathways intrinsic to HEK293 cells seem to be more Ca2+ selective. The influx due to hTrp3 can be blocked by SKF 96365, a known CCE blocker, or by verapamil, a nonspecific blocker for L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Although treatment with TG caused a small increase of Ca2+influx over the basal in cell lines expressing hTrp3, a large portion of the influx pathway due to hTrp3 is not sensitive to store depletion and seems to depend primarily on the activation of PLC. SKF 96365 hydrochloric acid was purchased from Calbiochem. TG, U73122, (±) verapamil were from Research Biochemicals International. Carbachol, 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbozole tablets, deoxycholic acid, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, and Nonidet P-40 were purchased from Sigma.35S-Express protein labeling mix (10 Ci/liter) and N-[3H]methylscopolamine (82 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Peptide-N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H were from Boehringer Mannheim. Protein A-Sepharose (4 Fast Flow) was from Pharmacia Biotech. Fura2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura2/AM) and Pluronic F-127 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was from Babco (Berkeley, CA). All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. unless indicated otherwise. The wild type hTrp3 was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (26Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The insert, located in between the EcoRI and the XbaI site of the polylinker of pcDNA3, contains nucleotide −15 (A of the first ATG is nucleotide 1) to 3285 of hTrp3 cDNA which includes a poly(A) tail (n = 30) and is flanked by a 36-nucleotide sequence from the Marathon cDNA adaptor (CLONTECH) on each side. To introduce an epitope for hemagglutinin (HA) at the C terminus of hTrp3, oligonucleotide A, 5′-CCCAGCATGCTGTACCCGTACGATGTTCCTGATTACGCGAGATGTGAATGATGCAGCA-3′, which contains a sequence (underlined) encoding the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) in between codons for Leu-845 and Arg-846 at the C terminus of hTrp3 cDNA, was synthesized. A partialhTrp3 sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using hTrp3 in pcDNA3 as a template and oligonucleotide A and Sp6 as primers. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned back into the original plasmid by ligation of anEcoRI/SphI fragment generated fromhTrp3/pcDNA3, the SphI/XbaI fragment of the polymerase chain reaction product, and theEcoRI/XbaI fragment of pcDNA3. The presence of the HA epitope sequence in the hTrp3-HA/pcDNA3 plasmid was confirmed by sequencing. The rat V1aR/pcDNA3 expression vector was a gift from Dr. Mariel Birnbaumer. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. ThehTrp3-HA/pcDNA3 (100 ng) was transfected into the HEK cells, plated at 2.8 × 106 cells/10-cm tissue culture dish 20 h before transfection, by the calcium phosphate/glycerol shock method (33Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were harvested, diluted in medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418, and transferred to wells of 96-well plates at different dilutions. G418-resistant transformants were expanded into 12-well plates. To identify the clones expressing hTrp3-HA, cells were seeded in 96-well plates precoated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml). Immunocytochemical staining was performed as described by Vannier et al. (34Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Meduri G. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal HA antibody (12CA5) as the primary antibody, anti-mouse IgG conjugated with peroxidase (Amersham) as the secondary antibody, and 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbozole as the colorant. Positive cells were stained red and were visualized through a light microscope. Eleven cell lines expressing the HA epitope were further expanded and analyzed for the expression of HA-tagged hTrp3 by immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 as described below. All cell lines synthesized an immunoprecipitated protein of approximately 100 kDa when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which corresponds to the predicted size of hTrp3. Two cell lines, HEKTrp3-9 (T3-9) and HEKTrp3-65 (T3-65) were used for further analysis. Control cells were transfected withV1aR/pcDNA3 under the same conditions, two G418-resistant clones were randomly selected and designated as control-1 (C1) and control-2 (C2). The stable cell lines were diluted twice weekly and maintained in medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. Cells (2 × 106) were plated in 6-cm tissue culture dishes at least 16 h before the experiments. Cells were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then incubated in 1 ml of methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) containing 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 1 h. The medium was replaced by the same medium containing 50 μCi/ml 35S-express protein labeling mix containing [35S]Met and [35S]Cys for a desired time. When needed, the incorporated radioactivity was chased by replacing the labeling medium with 4 ml of regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and continuing incubation at 37 °C for the desired time period. At the end of the incubation, cells were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline solution without Ca2+and Mg2+, scraped off from the culture dish in 1 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min. Cells were then homogenized in 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) as described by Innamorati et al. (35Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). For glycosidase treatment, cell lysate was incubated with peptide-N-glycosidase F (2 units/ml) or endoglycosidase H (10 milliunits/ml) at room temperature for 1 h before antibody (12CA5) was added. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in 80 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer (1 × = 62.5 mmTris-HCl, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 9% acrylamide gels at 40 mA for 2 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the molecular markers, destained, and then dried for autoradiography. Changes of [Ca2+] i in individual cells were monitored after loading cells with Fura2 by fluorescence videoimaging microscopy using an Attofluor Digital Imaging and Photometry attachment of a Carl Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope as described before (26Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Changes of [Ca2+] i in cell populations were measured using an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments, Inc.). Briefly, cells grown to confluence in 15-cm dishes were trypsinized and collected in a 50-ml capped polypropylene tube. After a centrifugation for 5 min at 400 × g and removal of the supernatant, the cell pellets were resuspended at room temperature in an extracellular solution (ECS) composed of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated in ECS supplemented with 5 μm Fura2/AM and 0.05% Pluronic F-127 at 37 °C for 40 min. Cells were then washed once and resuspended in ECS at 2 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots of 2 ml were kept in the dark at room temperature until use. Before each measurement, cells were washed twice in ECS or twice in ECS to which no CaCl2 was added if a Ca2+-free/Ca2+ readdition protocol was used. 2 ml of cell suspension was transferred to a quartz cuvette and maintained at 32 °C under continuous stirring. Changes in intracellular Fura2 fluorescence intensity were measured by alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm at 3-s intervals and detecting emission at 510 nm. Autofluorescence of the cells at 340 and 380 nm was determined from unloaded cells of an equivalent cell density and subtracted from values obtained for the Fura2-loaded cells. Drugs were added by a small aliquot (<20 μl) of concentrated stocks (dissolved either in water or dimethyl sulfoxyide) to achieve the final concentrations. At the end of each recording, 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to the cells to determine the maximal fluorescence ratio (R max). This was followed by an addition of 20 mm EGTA to determine the minimal fluorescence ratio (R min). [Ca2+] i was calculated according to Grynkiewicz et al. (36Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In most experiments, Ca2+ entry under the basal or stimulated conditions was measured by a Ca2+-free/Ca2+ readdition protocol, in which cells were incubated in a nominally Ca2+-free ECS stimulated or not by the addition of an agonist or a store depletion drug. The stimulation normally caused a transient [Ca2+] i increase due to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores. After allowing the first [Ca2+] i peak to decrease to a steady-state level (normally 3–7 min), CaCl2 was added to give a final concentration of 1.8 mm. Typically, this led to a second [Ca2+] i increase. This extracellular Ca2+-dependent [Ca2+] i increase is assumed to be caused by Ca2+ influx. A Ca2+ free/cation addition protocol, analogous to the Ca2+-free/Ca2+readdition protocol in which Sr2+ or Ba2+ was added during the cation readdition phase, was used to study the entry of Sr2+ and Ba2+ into cells. The extent of influx of these divalent cations is expressed in the figures as changes in the ratio of 340 to 380 nm fluorescence without the estimation of their intracellular concentrations. In a similar manner, MnCl2 was added to a final concentration of 50 μm to cells incubated in a nominally Ca2+-free ECS under either unstimulated or stimulated conditions. Fluorescence quenching was studied using the Fura2 isosbestic excitation wavelength at 360 nm and recording emitted fluorescence at 510 nm. At the end of each recording, 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to cells to determine the maximal quenching of Fura2 by Mn2+. Results of fluorescence quenching are expressed (in percent) as the amount of fluorescence decreased from the initial value (before the addition of Mn2+) divided by the maximal loss after the addition of Triton X-100. We showed previously (26Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) that transient expression of hTrp3 in COS-M6 cells results in a 2-fold increase of Ca2+ influx in response to the activation of a coexpressed M5 muscarinic receptor. To study the function and biochemical properties of hTrp3 in more detail, we decided to develop stable cell lines expressing hTrp3 at high levels. To aid the identification of cell lines expressing hTrp3, we added an HA epitope at the C terminus of hTrp3 (hTrp3-HA). The resulting cDNA construct was first transfected to COS-M6 cells, and its function on Ca2+ influx was compared with the wild typehTrp3, which was transfected in parallel in the same experiment. Ca2+ influx induced by 20 μmcarbachol (CCh) was identical in cells transfected with the wild typehTrp3 or hTrp3-HA (Fig.1). We transfectedhTrp3-HA/pcDNA3 into HEK293 cells and selected 11 cell lines that expressed the HA-tagged hTrp3. Two cell lines, HEKTrp3-9 (T3-9) and HEKTrp3-65 (T3-65), expressed relatively high levels"

Because these domains are homologous to domains in proteins with established functions, ADAMs have been proposed as candidates for modulating proteolysis, cell adhesion, cell fusion, and signaling. The ADAMs have structural similarity and ∼30% sequence identity to snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs), which cause hemorrhage in snake bite victims (5Hite L.A. Jia L.G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W.

Evidence for a role in muscle cell fusion was provided by studies showing that transfection of mouse C2 cells with a minigene of adam 12 lacking the pro- and metalloprotease domains accelerated cell fusion, whereas antisense constructs blocked myoblast fusion.Here we describe the cloning of soluble and transmembrane forms of human ADAM 12 that arise by alternative splicing. We show the effects of the novel secreted form, designated ADAM 12-S, on recruitment and differentiation of ectopic muscle cells in a human tumor nude mouse model. These results may have potential applications in the development of a number of future muscle-directed gene and cell therapies.DISCUSSIONWe have cloned the human ADAM 12 full-length cDNAs and discovered an alternatively spliced form, designated ADAM 12-S. This form of ADAM 12 has no transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains but has instead a short 34-aa carboxyl terminus. The resulting polypeptide becomes secreted, and transfection experiments indicated that this form provokes myogenesis.Mouse ADAM 12 was first identified by Yagami-Hiromasa et al.(25Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and was called meltrin α. In the same study they also isolated, via RT-PCR, two partial sequences that they designated meltrin β and meltrin γ. Sequence comparison with other ADAM genes isolated since indicates that meltrin β is more likely to be the murine equivalent of Xenopus adam 13 (Refs. 14Shilling F.M. Kratzschmar J. Cai H. Weskamp G.

Biol. 1997; 182: 314-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar; not shown), whereas meltrin γ shows 100% identity to nt 1289–1738 of mouse adam 9 (40Weskamp G. Kratzschmar J. Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, we prefer to use the ADAM nomenclature and refer to meltrin α as ADAM 12.In the present study we demonstrated that human ADAM 12 has two alternatively spliced forms designated ADAM 12-L and ADAM 12-S. Multiple transcripts of a single ADAM have been observed in monkey, mouse, and human (18Katagiri T. Harada Y. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 68: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 44Perry A.C.F. Gichuhi P.M. Jones R. Hall L. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 45Perry A.C.F. Jones R. Hall L. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mouse ADAM 1αI and ADAM 1αII are identical from nucleotides 702–2492 and contain the same domain structure but have distinct although related 5′- and 3′-ends (44Perry A.C.F. Gichuhi P.M. Jones R. Hall L. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Monkey ADAM 6 has two isoforms, although these probably reflect two different genes (45Perry A.C.F. Jones R. Hall L. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The only previously confirmed alternative splicing is of the human ADAM 11 gene (18Katagiri T. Harada Y. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 68: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This candidate tumor suppressor gene for breast cancer is alternatively spliced to generate two different transcripts, MDC-769 and MDC-524. These transcripts differ at both the 5′- and 3′-ends. MDC-769 has full-length cysteine-rich, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains, whereas MDC-524 is a truncated protein that terminates in the cysteine-rich domain.Human ADAM 12 appears to be encoded by a single copy gene that we mapped to chromosome 10q26 by in situ hybridization. Data base searches revealed that an EST that matches the ADAM 12-L cDNA sequence was localized to the same region of chromosome 10 by radiation hybrid mapping. Within this region genes for acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, fibroblast growth factor receptor, uroporphyrinogen-III synthase, and ornithine aminotransferase have been identified. With the exception of the ornithine aminotransferase (deficiency of this enzyme causes the eye disease gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina), no disease loci have been mapped to this region. The ADAM 8 gene also maps to 10q26.3 (46Yoshiyama K. Higuchi Y. Kataoka M. Matsuura K. Yamamoto S. Genomics. 1997; 41: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that these two genes may be clustered. The other ADAMs (ADAMs 1, -2, -4, -5, and -11) that have been assigned locations on the human genome are dispersed throughout different chromosomes (47Cho C. Primakoff P. White J.M. Myles D.G. Genomics. 1996; 34: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 48Burkin H.R. Burkin D.J. Davey P.M. Griffin D.K. Affara N.A.

Dev. 1997; 46: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).By Northern blotting we observed three human ADAM 12 mRNAs of 3.5, 5.4, and 8.6 kb, whereas in the mouse only one transcript was reported (25Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The 3.5-kb band was specific for ADAM 12-S, and the 5.4- and 8.6-kb bands were specific for ADAM 12-L. The 3.5-kb transcript arises from alternative use of an exon that encodes an ADAM 12-S-specific carboxyl terminus, 3′-untranslated region, and polyadenylation site. The 5.4- and 8.6-kb transcripts appear to be derived by alternative use of polyadenylation sites in the ADAM 12-L-specific 3′-untranslated region. We have isolated the full-length cDNA representing the 5.4-kb transcript, but the 8.6-kb transcript that appears to contain a longer 3′-untranslated region has not been entirely isolated. The different 3′-untranslated regions of ADAM 12-L could affect the rates of translation or mRNA stability (50Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar).Analysis of the distribution patterns of the two ADAM 12 forms in normal human tissues revealed that the ADAM 12-S transcript was detected so far only in placenta, whereas the ADAM 12-L mRNAs were found in placenta and skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. Splicing of the ADAM 12-S exon may be regulated by cell type-specific factors. The human ADAM 12-L transcript appears to have a more widespread expression than the mouse mRNA (25Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both forms were detected in some tumor cell lines, indicating a possible association between ADAM 12-S and neoplasia.Until now only two ADAMs that lack a transmembrane domain, and thus are assumed to be secreted, have been reported. These are ADAM 11/MDC-524 (18Katagiri T. Harada Y. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 68: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and ADAMTS-1 (ADAM with thromobospondin motifs (12Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar)). To this list we now add ADAM 12-S, and we have shown that it becomes secreted. The candidate tumor suppressor MDC-524 splice form was isolated from human cerebellar cDNA library and is expressed at very low levels compared with the cell membrane anchored form MDC-769 (18Katagiri T. Harada Y. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 68: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ADAMTS-1, which is associated with cancer cachexia and inflammatory processes, lacks the cysteine-rich, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains, having instead a thrombospondin homologous domain and type I thrombospondin motifs (12Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Like ADAM 12-S, these cancer-related, secreted ADAMs appear to have very restricted, low levels of expression in normal tissue. The best characterized soluble ADAM-like proteins are the snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) (7Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The soluble ADAMs lacking the regulatory control of a transmembrane domain may be extremely potent like their SVMP counterparts. The highly restricted and low level of normal expression of these soluble ADAMs may reflect this potency, and continued comparison of ADAMs with SVMPs is warranted.Mouse ADAM 12 has been implicated in cell fusion during C2C12 differentiation in vitro (25Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that cells transfected with the shorter, secreted form of ADAM 12-S appear to be very potent in provoking myogenesis in vivo. We stably transfected the human embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cell line A204 with the ADAM 12-S minigene composed of the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains and the unique carboxyl terminus. Although a potential muscle precursor, the A204 rhabdomyosarcoma does not differentiate in vitro either spontaneously or after transfection with the ADAM 12-S minigene. However, nude mice tumors generated from these ADAM 12-S minigene transfected cells contained a striking pattern of ectopic muscle cell formation as compared with control tumors. A mixture of cells representing different stages of normal myogenesis was observed, including myoblasts and elongated multinucleated myotubes with cross-striation. These developing muscle cells were located in a disorganized pattern, as opposed to the normal adult skin muscle. Electron microscopy and immunostaining confirmed that these cells were in fact of the muscle cell lineage. Furthermore, based on combined immunostaining using mAbs specific for mouse and human antigens and RT-PCR using species-specific primers for myf-5, we conclude that these ectopic muscle cells are of an apparent murine origin rather than derived directly from the A204 human tumor cells.What is the cell of origin for this myogenesis? There are at least two possibilities; one is the satellite cells, which are normally located in intimate relationship with existing myofibers beneath the basement membrane. Satellite cells are ubiquitous in normal adult muscle and represent the muscle progenitor cells during muscle regeneration (24Bischoff R. Engel A.G. Frazini-Armstrong C. Myology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1994: 97-118Google Scholar). Another possible source is undifferentiated mesenchymal progenitor cells present in connective tissue. The mechanism by which ADAM 12-S may be involved in the recruitment and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells is not clear, and how it acts in the context of factors from the A204 rhabdomyosarcoma cells and/or the host stroma remains to be resolved.In conclusion, we have characterized a novel form of secreted human ADAM 12, designated ADAM 12-S, and presented evidence that it provokes myogenesis in a nude mouse tumor model.

They are about 800 amino acids long and have a unique domain organization, containing pro-, metalloprotease, disintegrin, cysteine-rich, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains (1Wolfsberg T.G.

Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Because these domains are homologous to domains in proteins with established functions, ADAMs have been proposed as candidates for modulating proteolysis, cell adhesion, cell fusion, and signaling. The ADAMs have structural similarity and ∼30% sequence identity to snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs), which cause hemorrhage in snake bite victims (5Hite L.A. Jia L.G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W.

Taylor and Francis Ltd., London1996: 47-81Google Scholar). ADAMs and SVMPs are both members of the reprolysin subfamily of metalloproteases (6Fox J.W. Bjarnason J.B. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteases in Health and Disease. Taylor and Francis Ltd., London1996: 47-81Google Scholar, 7Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Full-length SVMPs are processed to generate a metalloprotease, which is able to degrade proteins of the basement membrane such as type IV collagen and laminin (5Hite L.A. Jia L.G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and a disintegrin domain, which can inhibit the function of platelets by interacting with platelet integrin GPIIb-IIIa (8Paine M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2095541301,"The most frequently found alteration of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human tumors is a deletion of exons 2–7. This receptor, termed EGFRvIII, can transform NIH 3T3 cells, and the frequent expression of this variant implies that it confers a selective advantage upon tumor cells in vivo. Although EGFRvIII is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase, there is no increase in Ras·GTP levels and low levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in NIH 3T3 cells expressing this variant. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase was an effector in transformation by the EGFRvIII. High levels of PI 3-kinase activity were constitutively present in EGFRvIII-transformed cells and were dependent upon the kinase activity of the receptor. While mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was quickly down-regulated to basal levels after 12 h of continuous EGFR activation, there was a 3-fold increase in PI 3-kinase activity in cells expressing normal EGFR and an 8-fold increase in cells expressing EGFRvIII after 48 h. This increased activity may reflect enhanced binding to EGFRvIII and the presence of novel PI 3-kinase isoforms. Treatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 blocked both anchorage-independent growth and growth in low serum media and also resulted in morphological reversion of EGFRvIII-transformed cells.

Interestingly, there are two points in the signal transduction pathway at which MAP kinase activation is down-regulated. Overexpression of EGFRvIII leads to decreased levels of Shc and Grb2, which could reduce Ras activation, and there is an increase in MAP kinase phosphatase activity in these cells as well (15Moscatello D.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).The normal EGF receptor is capable of initiating a variety of signaling cascades upon ligand activation. One such effector whose importance in tumorigenesis is becoming increasingly apparent is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). PI 3-kinase was first shown to be important in transformation by the observations that it associates with polyoma virus middle T protein upon phosphorylation by c-Src, and that mutants of middle T which fail to recruit PI 3-kinase activity are impaired in their tumorigenic activity (22Hunter T.

In addition, PI 3-kinase activation has been shown to be essential for induction of DNA synthesis by EGF (25Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possible role played by this enzyme in transformation by the EGFRvIII, and we now report that PI 3-kinase is constitutively activated in EGFRvIII-transformed cells and is essential for transformation by this receptor variant.DISCUSSIONWork in this and other laboratories has demonstrated that expression of the EGFRvIII results in neoplastic transformation and enhanced tumorigenicity, which is due to its constitutive kinase activity (7Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Su Huang H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 12Batra S.K. Castelino-Prabhu S.

Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar). While activation of the normal EGF receptor results in activation of MAP kinase via Ras (15Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 18Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), our studies on EGFRvIII showed only a low level of activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, which was due to decreases in Shc and Grb2 levels and induction of a MAP kinase phosphatase (15Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 20Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of the MAP kinase pathway has also been observed in NIH 3T3 cells transformed by viral oncogenes such as v-src and v-ras, and the evidence supports a role for a MAP kinase phosphatase in these cells as well (35Stofega M.R. Yu C.-L. Wu J. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 113-119PubMed Google Scholar).Because PI 3-kinase is essential for DNA synthesis induced by EGF (25Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), we studied this enzyme in cells expressing EGFRvIII for its possible contribution to transformation. We found that EGFRvIII-transformed cells exhibited a high constitutive level of PI 3-kinase activity not shown by cells overexpressing normal EGF receptor. Analysis of the kinetics of PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase activation revealed an important difference in the regulation of these pathways by the EGFRvIII relative to the normal EGF receptor. While the EGF-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in CO12 20c2/b cells peaked quickly and declined to a moderate level by 12 h, the activity in HC2 20d2/c cells rose more slowly and did not decline throughout the period tested (Fig. 3 C). The slower rate of increase in PI 3-kinase activity in the EGFRvIII-expressing cells was most likely due to the gradual decline in tyrphostin activity, but the lack of subsequent down-regulation of PI 3-kinase activity cannot be so explained, because HC2 20d2/c cells which have never been exposed to the drug exhibit high PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 1). One possibility is that cells achieve down-regulation of EGF receptor-initiated PI 3-kinase activity primarily by down-regulation of the number of receptors. The EGFRvIII does not bind ligand and is not actively down-regulated despite its constitutive activation (15Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 16Huang H.-J.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Huang C.-M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and this may account for the lack of decrease in PI 3-kinase activity in HC2 20d2/c cells. In contrast, MAP kinase activity declines to barely above basal levels within about 12 h in both cell lines, indicating that regulation of this pathway primarily occurs downstream of the receptor. It further suggests that while prolonged, high level PI 3-kinase activation is compatible with continuous growth, the prolonged, high level activation of MAP kinase is not essential. Thus, our results are in agreement with the recent report that prolonged MAP kinase activation in NIH 3T3 cells results in growth arrest (36Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).While we found that p85 can associate with both normal EGF receptor and EGFRvIII, it is not clear that p85 can account for all PI 3-kinase activity associated with EGFRvIII. Although immunoprecipitation with anti-p85α/β antibody reduced the PI 3-kinase activity in anti-pTyr immunoprecipitates from CO12 20c2/b cells, it did not reduce the pTyr-associated activity in HC2 20d2/c cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we found elevated levels of p85α in HC2 20d2/c, as well as bands with molecular masses of 50 and 55 kDa which cross-reacted strongly with antibody to rat p85. This suggests that the constitutive activity of the EGFRvIII may influence the expression of PI 3-K adapter subunits. At least five forms of regulatory subunits have been cloned (33Carpenter C. Cantley L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar), including 50- and 55-kDa splice variants of p85α. Further studies are necessary to determine whether these molecules are involved in the PI 3-kinase activity detected in EGFRvIII transfectants.There are several mechanisms by which PI 3-kinase may contribute to tumorigenesis. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activation has been shown to block the EGF-dependent transformation of murine JB6 P+ cells (37Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6427-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We found that PI 3-kinase inhibitors inhibited both monolayer growth in low serum and anchorage-independent growth of cells expressing normal EGF receptor and EGFRvIII. These inhibitors also caused a partial reversion of the transformed morphology of HC2 20d2/c and blocked the EGF-induced transformed morphology of CO12 20c2/b. PI 3-kinase activity can influence cell morphology, as it has been shown to affect cytoskeletal organization (21Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 22Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 33Carpenter C. Cantley L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, PI 3-kinase interacts with Rac·GTP, a member of the Rho family of small G proteins which regulate the actin cytoskeleton (38Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Nagane et al. recently reported that EGFRvIII expression reduces apoptosis of glioblastoma cells bothin vitro and in vivo (10Nagane M. Coufal F. Lin H. Bögler O. Cavenee W.K. Su Huang H.-J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5079-5086PubMed Google Scholar). As activation of the Raf/MAP kinase pathway by Ras in the absence of PI 3-kinase activity was recently shown to promote apoptosis in fibroblasts (39Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), and PI 3-kinase activity has been shown to be essential for survival of a number of cell types (40Yao R. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar, 41Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), these data suggest another mechanism by which consitutive PI 3-kinase activity contributes to tumorigenesis. Thus, because PI 3-kinase can play a central role in growth, morphological transformation, and the inhibition of cell death by the both normal EGF receptor and EGFRvIII, it seems likely that enhancement of this activity provides an important selective advantage for EGFRvIII-expressing tumor cells in vivo.

Overexpression of EGFRvIII leads to decreased levels of Shc and Grb2, which could reduce Ras activation, and there is an increase in MAP kinase phosphatase activity in these cells as well (15Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 20Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The normal EGF receptor is capable of initiating a variety of signaling cascades upon ligand activation. One such effector whose importance in tumorigenesis is becoming increasingly apparent is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). PI 3-kinase was first shown to be important in transformation by the observations that it associates with polyoma virus middle T protein upon phosphorylation by c-Src, and that mutants of middle T which fail to recruit PI 3-kinase activity are impaired in their tumorigenic activity (22Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 23Talmadge D.A. Freund R. Young A.T. Dahl J. Dawe C.J. Benjamin T.L.

In addition, PI 3-kinase activation has been shown to be essential for induction of DNA synthesis by EGF (25Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possible role played by this enzyme in transformation by the EGFRvIII, and we now report that PI 3-kinase is constitutively activated in EGFRvIII-transformed cells and is essential for transformation by this receptor variant. DISCUSSIONWork in this and other laboratories has demonstrated that expression of the EGFRvIII results in neoplastic transformation and enhanced tumorigenicity, which is due to its constitutive kinase activity (7Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Su Huang H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 12Batra S.K. Castelino-Prabhu S.

Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar). While activation of the normal EGF receptor results in activation of MAP kinase via Ras (15Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 18Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), our studies on EGFRvIII showed only a low level of activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, which was due to decreases in Shc and Grb2 levels and induction of a MAP kinase phosphatase (15Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 20Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of the MAP kinase pathway has also been observed in NIH 3T3 cells transformed by viral oncogenes such as v-src and v-ras, and the evidence supports a role for a MAP kinase phosphatase in these cells as well (35Stofega M.R. Yu C.-L. Wu J. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 113-119PubMed Google Scholar).Because PI 3-kinase is essential for DNA synthesis induced by EGF (25Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), we studied this enzyme in cells expressing EGFRvIII for its possible contribution to transformation. We found that EGFRvIII-transformed cells exhibited a high constitutive level of PI 3-kinase activity not shown by cells overexpressing normal EGF receptor. Analysis of the kinetics of PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase activation revealed an important difference in the regulation of these pathways by the EGFRvIII relative to the normal EGF receptor. While the EGF-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in CO12 20c2/b cells peaked quickly and declined to a moderate level by 12 h, the activity in HC2 20d2/c cells rose more slowly and did not decline throughout the period tested (Fig. 3 C). The slower rate of increase in PI 3-kinase activity in the EGFRvIII-expressing cells was most likely due to the gradual decline in tyrphostin activity, but the lack of subsequent down-regulation of PI 3-kinase activity cannot be so explained, because HC2 20d2/c cells which have never been exposed to the drug exhibit high PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 1). One possibility is that cells achieve down-regulation of EGF receptor-initiated PI 3-kinase activity primarily by down-regulation of the number of receptors. The EGFRvIII does not bind ligand and is not actively down-regulated despite its constitutive activation (15Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 16Huang H.-J.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Huang C.-M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and this may account for the lack of decrease in PI 3-kinase activity in HC2 20d2/c cells. In contrast, MAP kinase activity declines to barely above basal levels within about 12 h in both cell lines, indicating that regulation of this pathway primarily occurs downstream of the receptor. It further suggests that while prolonged, high level PI 3-kinase activation is compatible with continuous growth, the prolonged, high level activation of MAP kinase is not essential. Thus, our results are in agreement with the recent report that prolonged MAP kinase activation in NIH 3T3 cells results in growth arrest (36Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).While we found that p85 can associate with both normal EGF receptor and EGFRvIII, it is not clear that p85 can account for all PI 3-kinase activity associated with EGFRvIII. Although immunoprecipitation with anti-p85α/β antibody reduced the PI 3-kinase activity in anti-pTyr immunoprecipitates from CO12 20c2/b cells, it did not reduce the pTyr-associated activity in HC2 20d2/c cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we found elevated levels of p85α in HC2 20d2/c, as well as bands with molecular masses of 50 and 55 kDa which cross-reacted strongly with antibody to rat p85. This suggests that the constitutive activity of the EGFRvIII may influence the expression of PI 3-K adapter subunits. At least five forms of regulatory subunits have been cloned (33Carpenter C. Cantley L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar), including 50- and 55-kDa splice variants of p85α. Further studies are necessary to determine whether these molecules are involved in the PI 3-kinase activity detected in EGFRvIII transfectants.There are several mechanisms by which PI 3-kinase may contribute to tumorigenesis. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activation has been shown to block the EGF-dependent transformation of murine JB6 P+ cells (37Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6427-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We found that PI 3-kinase inhibitors inhibited both monolayer growth in low serum and anchorage-independent growth of cells expressing normal EGF receptor and EGFRvIII. These inhibitors also caused a partial reversion of the transformed morphology of HC2 20d2/c and blocked the EGF-induced transformed morphology of CO12 20c2/b. PI 3-kinase activity can influence cell morphology, as it has been shown to affect cytoskeletal organization (21Kapeller R. Cantley L.C.

Cantley L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, PI 3-kinase interacts with Rac·GTP, a member of the Rho family of small G proteins which regulate the actin cytoskeleton (38Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Nagane et al. recently reported that EGFRvIII expression reduces apoptosis of glioblastoma cells bothin vitro and in vivo (10Nagane M. Coufal F. Lin H. Bögler O. Cavenee W.K. Su Huang H.-J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5079-5086PubMed Google Scholar). As activation of the Raf/MAP kinase pathway by Ras in the absence of PI 3-kinase activity was recently shown to promote apoptosis in fibroblasts (39Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), and PI 3-kinase activity has been shown to be essential for survival of a number of cell types (40Yao R. Cooper G.M.

Thus, because PI 3-kinase can play a central role in growth, morphological transformation, and the inhibition of cell death by the both normal EGF receptor and EGFRvIII, it seems likely that enhancement of this activity provides an important selective advantage for EGFRvIII-expressing tumor cells in vivo. Work in this and other laboratories has demonstrated that expression of the EGFRvIII results in neoplastic transformation and enhanced tumorigenicity, which is due to its constitutive kinase activity (7Nishikawa R.

Most of the mutants had unchanged apparent equilibrium androgen binding affinity and increased dissociation rates of [3H]methyltrienolone and required increased dihydrotestosterone concentrations for transcriptional activation. In a 2-hybrid protein interaction assay in mammalian cells, the steroid binding domain interacts with an NH2-terminal-DNA binding domain fragment and with the full-length androgen receptor at physiological androgen concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. However, mutations at Val-889 and Arg-752 disrupt the NH2-/carboxyl-terminal interaction when introduced into the steroid binding domain fragment but not when present in the full-length androgen receptor. The N-C bimolecular interaction reduces the dissociation rate of bound androgen and slows the degradation rate of the carboxyl-terminal steroid binding domain fragment. The results suggest that steroid binding domain residues Val-889 and Arg-752 are critical to the NH2-/carboxyl-terminal interaction and that an intermolecular N-C interaction occurs during receptor dimerization that results in an antiparallel arrangement of androgen receptor monomers.

Notides A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another report suggested dimerization occurs in a head-to-toe, antiparallel arrangement (25Thole H.H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In support of the antiparallel model, the glucocorticoid receptor NH2-terminal domain was implicated in dimerization (26Eriksson P. Wrange O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the thyroid hormone and vitamin D receptors, the DNA binding domain has rotational flexibility relative to the dimerization interface in the steroid binding domain, allowing a 180° change in conformation (27Kurokawa R. Yu V.C. Näär A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The vitamin D receptor may form a symmetrical, head-to-tail, antiparallel dimer through the DNA binding domain but is influenced by the steroid binding domain dimerization interface (28Towers T.L. Luisi B.F. Asianov A. Freedman L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6310-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence argue against a parallel dimer for androgen-activated AR. First, no interaction is observed between the AR steroid binding domains in the 2-hybrid protein interaction assay in the presence or absence of androgen (18Langley E. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Second, the N-C interaction is of sufficiently high affinity to promote a bimolecular interaction. Third, the steroid specificity of N-C-mediated dimerization parallels that of full-length AR. Fourth, antiparallel interactions between N-C regions of AR NH2- and carboxyl-terminal fragments promote high affinity DNA binding. In the present report, evidence for an intermolecular N-C interaction in an antiparallel AR dimer was obtained by the introduction of single base mutations into the AR steroid binding domain that cause partial or complete androgen insensitivity without altering the apparent equilibrium androgen binding constant and by examining the influence of the NH2-terminal domain on androgen dissociation rates and protein turnover. Eukaryotic expression vectors pGALO, containing the DNA binding domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 protein (amino acid residues 1–147), and pNLVP, coding for the transcriptional activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein (residues 411–456), were previously described (29Dang C.V.

Biol. 1991; 11: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Gordon Tomaselli, Johns Hopkins University. These vectors were used to construct the full-length AR vector pNLVP-hAR (designated here as pVPAR) and the carboxyl terminal AR fragment vector pGALD-H (containing AR amino acid residues 624–919) (18Langley E. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Androgen insensitivity mutations V889M and V866M were introduced into pGALD-H and pVPAR by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of pCMVhAR-V889M (30De Bellis A. Quigley C.A. Marschke K.B.

Amplified fragments were cloned into pGALO at NdeI/XbaI, in the case of the D-H fragment, or into VPAR using CspXI/XbaI. Bi-directional PCR mutagenesis was used to construct pGALD-H-R752Q, which was used to construct pCMVhAR-R752Q at the TthIII/XbaI restriction sites and pVPAR-R752Q at BstEII/XbaI. pCMVhAR-Y763C was constructed by PCR mutagenesis changing TAC codon 763 to TGC. PCR fragments were digested withHincII/XbaI, and a triple ligation reaction was performed with the NdeI/HincII fragment of pVPAR or pGALD-H. pCMVhAR-Y763C was constructed in theHindIII/XbaI fragment from pGALD-H-Y763C. The sequence of all PCR-amplified regions was verified. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in alpha minimum essential medium containing 10% bovine calf serum, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, penicillin, and streptomycin, plated at 4.5 × 105 cells/6-cm dish, and transfected with 1–2 μg of expression vector DNA and 5 μg of G5E1bLuc reporter vector using DEAE-dextran as described (18Langley E. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). After addition of increasing concentrations of DHT and incubation for 24 h, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity as described (18Langley E. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Apparent equilibrium binding affinity was determined in whole cell binding assays as described (33Yarbrough W.G. Quarmby V.E. Simental J.A. Joseph D.R. Sar M. Lubahn D.B. Olsen K.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8893-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monkey kidney COS-1 cells were plated at 3.5 × 105 cells/well of 6-well culture plates and transfected using DEAE-dextran with 3 μg of DNA for AR fragments containing the steroid binding domain and 1–2 μg for full-length AR. After 48 h, cells were incubated with 0.25–5 nm[3H]R1881 for 2 h at 37 °C. Dissociation rate constants were determined by labeling with 5 nm[3H]R1881 for 2 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of a 10,000 molar excess of unlabeled R1881. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 0.5 ml of 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8. Specific binding was determined from the difference in radioactivity in the presence and absence of a 100-fold molar excess unlabeled R1881 as described previously (31Zhou Z.X. Lane M.V. Kemppainen J.A. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein expression levels were compared by immunoblot analysis of wild-type and mutant full-length AR and partial AR fusion proteins expressed in COS-1 cells and analyzed in 9 or 12% acrylamide SDS gels using AR52 antipeptide antibody (34Tan J.A.

Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1276-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) or the GAL4 DNA binding domain antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibody was anti-rabbit IgG (Promega). Degradation rates were determined in COS-1 cells (1 × 106/10-cm dish) transiently transfected using DEAE-dextran with 4 μg of AR507–919 plus either 8 μg of parent expression plasmid pCMV5 or 8 μg of AR1–660. Cells were maintained in 10% serum and, after 48 h, were incubated in serum-free, methionine-free media as described previously (31Zhou Z.X. Lane M.V. Kemppainen J.A. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except with 100 μCi [35S]l-methionine/l-cysteine PRO-MIX in vitro cell labeling mix (1000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). After 30 min of labeling, cells were washed, placed in serum-free media with or without 100 nm DHT at 37 °C, and harvested at time intervals up to 7 h. Cells were harvested in RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and cell extracts were incubated with AR52 anti-peptide antibody and Pansorbin and processed for polyacrylamide gel analysis as described previously (31Zhou Z.X. Lane M.V. Kemppainen J.A. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polarity of AR dimerization was investigated by introducing naturally occurring mutations that cause partial or severe forms of androgen insensitivity. The mutations were constructed by mutagenesis of GALD-H, which contains human AR steroid binding domain residues 624–919 (coded by exons D-H) fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of GAL4 DNA binding domain residues 1–147, or into VPAR, which contains full-length human AR residues 1–919 fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of VP16 transactivation domain residues 411–456. AR mutations that result in partial or complete androgen insensitivity either do not significantly alter (V889M, R752Q, Y763C, Y763H) or decrease (V866M) the apparent equilibrium binding affinity for the synthetic androgen, [3H]R1881 (Table I). Equilibrium androgen binding affinities of the full-length AR mutants shift toward higher affinities when the NH2-terminal region is deleted in AR507–919 and in the GALD-H fusion proteins (Table I). However all of the full-length androgen insensitivity mutants have increased rates of [3H]R1881 dissociation (TableII) relative to wild-type AR, suggesting correspondingly increased association rates in mutants with equilibrium binding constants similar to that of wild-type AR. Deletion of the NH2-terminal domain results in increased dissociation rates of [3H]R1881 (Table II) for all mutants as previously reported for wild-type AR (18Langley E. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Expression levels of the wild-type and mutants are similar for the partial AR fusion proteins in GALD-H (Fig.1 A), for full-length ARs expressed as fusion proteins with the VP16 transactivation domain (Fig.1 B), or full-length AR (Fig. 1 C) as determined from immunoblots of extracts from transiently transfected COS-1 cells. However, protein expression from pCMV5 is at least 2-fold higher than from pVP16. When introduced into the mammalian expression vector pCMVhAR and assayed with the MMTV-luciferase reporter vector, most of the androgen insensitivity mutants require DHT concentrations above the physiological range to promote full transcriptional activation (Fig.2).Table IEquilibrium dissociation constant, K d (nm)Full-lengthAR507–919GALD-HAIS grade1-aAIS grades are as previously reported (35).Wildtype0.64 ± 0.320.25 ± 0.060.12 ± 0.04—V889M0.79 ± 0.350.41 ± 0.260.19 ± 0.066R752Q1.2 ± 0.321.0 ± 0.700.55 ± 0.117Y763C0.84 ± 0.340.54 ± 0.270.29 ± 0.302/31-bAIS grade 2/3 was associated with shortening of the Gln repeat in the NH2-terminal region to 12 residues (38) (wild-type 23 Gln ± 2).Y763H1.1 ± 0.450.23 ± 0.030.32 ± 0.137V866M2.9 ± 0.651.1 ± 0.500.35 ± 0.1061-a AIS grades are as previously reported (35Quigley C.A.

Luciferase activity of 3–16 fold becomes detectable at 0.01 nm DHT, with full activation between 22–31 fold at 1–10 nm DHT (Figs.3 A, 4 A,5 A, and 6 A, left). VP-full-length AR (VPAR) interacts with GALD-H in a similar concentration dependent manner with DHT, with up to an 11-fold increase in luciferase activity at 0.01 nm DHT and full activation of 12–34 fold at 1–5 nm DHT (Figs. 3 B, 4 B, 5 B, and 6 B, left). These results indicate that the N-C interaction occurs as a bimolecular reaction when one monomer is either full-length AR or the NH2-terminal and DNA binding regions and the other monomer contains only the AR steroid binding domain. The similar dose-dependent N-C interaction between the steroid binding domain and either full-length AR or the NH2-terminal fragment supports the antiparallel dimer model. Self dimerization of VPAR apparently does not interfere with its interaction with GALD-H.Figure 42-hybrid protein interaction assay of R752Q.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from the full-length mutant AR (TableII). The dissociation rate of [3H]R1881 increases about 4-fold further with deletion of the NH2-terminal region in AR507–919 (DNA and steroid binding domains) (Table II), suggesting that, at the high androgen concentration (50 μm unlabeled R1881) used in the dissociation experiment, the NH2-terminal region slows androgen dissociation from V889M to an extent similar to wild-type AR. The 5–10-fold faster androgen dissociation rate from AR507–919-V889M and GALD-H-V889M relative to these wild-type AR fragments suggests, in addition, that increased androgen dissociation is an inherent defect of the V889M mutation in the steroid binding domain (Table II). The interaction between GALD-H-V889M and VPAR1–660 occurs only at DHT concentrations of 5 nm or greater, about 500 times the concentration required for the wild-type GALD-H and VPAR1–660 interaction, and increases to only 12–16-fold, up to 1 μm DHT (Fig. 3 A, right). On the other hand, reactivity of VPAR-V889M with GALD-H was similar to wild-type VPAR (Fig. 3 B, middle), and little interaction is observed between VPAR and GALD-H-V889M except at high DHT concentrations (Fig. 3 B, right). The results support an intermolecular N-C interaction where GALD-H interacts with the NH2-terminal region of VPAR-V889M, which is unaffected by the V889M steroid binding mutation in VPAR-V889M. The similar dose response in interaction between GALD-H with VPAR or VPAR-V889M suggests that low physiological DHT concentrations are sufficient to promote this bimolecular reaction and may reflect the retained high androgen binding affinity of V889M (Table I). Androgen insensitivity in the testicular feminized (Tfm) rat results from a single base mutation CGG → CAG in exon E of the AR steroid binding domain changing Arg 734 to Gln (33Yarbrough W.G. Quarmby V.E. Simental J.A. Joseph D.R. Sar M. Lubahn D.B. Olsen K.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8893-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The Tfm rat AR mutation occurs in human AR (Arg 752 to Gln, CGA → CAA) in two unrelated families with complete androgen insensitivity; however, in these cases, androgen binding activity was not reported (36.Brown, T.

We have previously identified IQGAP1 from bovine brain cytosol as a target for Rac1 by an affinity purification method. By using the same method, we purified a specifically Rac1-associated protein with a molecular mass of about 140 kDa (p140) from bovine brain cytosol. This protein interacted with guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS)·glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Rac1 but not with the GDP·GST-Rac1, GTPγS·GST-Cdc42, or GTPγS·GST-RhoA. The amino acid sequences of this protein revealed that p140 is identified as a product of KIAA0068 gene. We denoted this protein as Sra-1 (SpecificallyRac1-associated protein). Recombinant Sra-1 interacted with GTPγS·GST-Rac1 and weakly with GDP·Rac1 but not with GST-Cdc42 or GST-RhoA. The N-terminal domain of Sra-1 (1–407 amino acids) was responsible for the interaction with Rac1. Myc-tagged Sra-1 and the deletion mutant capable of interacting with Rac1, but not the mutants unable to bind Rac1, were colocalized with dominant active Rac1Val-12 and cortical actin filament at the Rac1Val-12-induced membrane ruffling area in KB cells. Sra-1 was cosedimented with filamentous actin (F-actin), indicating that Sra-1 directly interacts with F-actin. These results suggest that Sra-1 is a novel and specific target for Rac1.

Among these targets, POR1 has been shown to specifically interact with Rac1 but not with Cdc42. POR1 has been shown to be involved in the Rac1-induced membrane ruffling formation (14Aelst L.V. Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, it still remains to be clarified how Rac1-specific function is achieved. Therefore, it is important to identify its novel targets. In the present study, we purified putative targets for Rac1 with molecular masses of 140 kDa and 120 kDa and identified them as a KIAA0068 gene product (Sra-1) (21Nomura N. Nagase T. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Seki N. Kawarabayasi Y. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and HEM-2 (22Baumgartner S. Martin D. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Sutton J. Desai A. Huang I. Kato K. Hromas R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), respectively. We found here that Sra-1 directly interacts with activated Rac1 and F-actin, suggesting that Sra-1 is a novel target for Rac1. The cDNA of human Sra-1 (KIAA0068) was identified as described (21Nomura N. Nagase T. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Seki N. Kawarabayasi Y. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KB cells were kindly provided from Dr. Y. Miyata (Kyoto University, Japan). Anti-Myc polyclonal antibody and anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) were purchased from Santa Cruz Co. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. Reticulocyte in vitro translation system kit was purchased from Promega Co. (Madison, WI). Other materials and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. Recombinant wild-type and mutant small GTPases were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified as described (20Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For expression in COS7 cells, pEF-BOS-HA-small GTPases were prepared as described (20Kuroda S.

To obtain pBluescript KS(−) full-length cDNA of Sra-1, cDNA of Sra-1 subcloned into EcoRV and NotI sites of pBluescript SK(−) was digested withSacII, blunted, and inserted into ClaI-digested and blunt-ended pBluescript KS(−). To produce pGEX4T-1 Sra-1 (1–407 aa), the cDNA fragment corresponding 1–407 aa was ligated intoEcoRI and SmaI sites of pGEX4T-1. For thein vitro translation, the cDNA fragments encoding Sra-1 N-1 (1–959 aa), Sra-1 N-2 (1–632 aa), Sra-1 N-3 (1–407 aa), and Sra-1 C-1 (659–1253 aa) were inserted into pBluescript SK (−). To produce pBluescript KS (−)-Myc-Sra-1, the full-length cDNA of Sra-1 was inserted into EcoRV and XhoI sites of pBluescript KS (−)-Myc (20Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To express the various mutants Myc-Sra-1 in mammalian cells, the respective cDNA fragments were inserted into XbaI site of pEF-BOS. To produce Myc-Sra-1 in insect cells, the cDNA of Myc-Sra-1 was inserted into XbaI sites of pAcYM1. The affinity purification was performed essentially as described (20Kuroda S. Fukata M.

Briefly, 30 ml of bovine brain cytosol (25 mg/ml protein) was passed through glutathione beads (1 ml) to remove endogenous GST. Then, the pass fraction was loaded on glutathione beads (1 ml) coated with GST-small GTPases preloaded with guanine nucleotides as described (20Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). After washing the columns, bound proteins were coeluted with GST-small GTPases by the addition of 5 ml of reduced glutathione. After p140 was resolved by SDS-PAGE, the protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to amino acid sequencing as described (24Iwamatsu A. Yoshida-Kubomura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The eluates (40 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-Sra-1 antibody. The insect cells overexpressing Myc-Sra-1 were homogenized with buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride on ice and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and purified from the supernatant by MonoQ column chromatography. Myc-Sra-1 (100 μg) was loaded on the affinity beads coated with GST-small GTPases (50 μg each) preloaded with guanine nucleotides as described (20Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). After washing the columns, elution was performed by the addition of 500 μl of reduced glutathione. Forty μl of the eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. In vitrotranslation was performed using reticulocyte lysate and T7 polymerase, and the fragments were labeled with [35S]Met. The indicated fragments of in vitro translated Sra-1 were mixed with affinity beads coated with the GST-small GTPases. After washing the beads, the bound proteins were coeluted with the small GTPases by the addition of glutathione. The eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radioactivities were detected using the bioimaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). KB cells were cultured and seeded onto a polylysine-coated dish (3Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Subconfluent KB cells (5 × 105/6-cm dish) were serum-starved for 36 h. Then, expression plasmids pEF-BOS-Myc-Sra-1 (0.1 mg/ml) with pEF-BOS-HA-Rac1Val-12 (0.02 mg/ml) were microinjected into nuclei of serum-starved KB cells. Four hours after the injections, cells were fixed and doubly stained with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody and with either anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) or rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. Cosedimentation assay was performed as described (25Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Myc-Sra-1 (260 nm) and F-actin (3 μm) were mixed and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture (50 μl) was loaded onto 20% (w/v) sucrose layer (100 μl) and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant and the pellet were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Sra-1 antibody, and the amounts of Sra-1 were quantified. Anti-Sra-1 polyclonal antibody was raised against GST-Sra-1 (1–407 aa) by standard procedures. To identify Rac1-interacting molecules, the bovine brain cytosol was loaded onto a GST-Rac1 affinity column as described (20Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The proteins bound to the affinity column were coeluted with GST-Rac1 by the addition of glutathione. Proteins with molecular masses of about 180 kDa (p180), 170 kDa (p170), 140 kDa (p140), 120 kDa (p120), 110 kDa (p110), and 90 kDa (p90) were detected in the glutathione eluate from the GTPγS·GST-Rac1 affinity column but not from the GST or GDP·GST-Rac1 affinity column (20Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). We have previously identified p170, p110, and p90 as IQGAP1, p110, and p85 subunits of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, respectively (20Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular identities of the p140 and p120, they were subjected to amino acid sequencing as described (24Iwamatsu A. Yoshida-Kubomura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Seven peptide sequences derived from p140 were determined (Fig. 1 B). The amino acid sequences of p140 revealed that p140 was identical to those of a putative protein encoded by a human cDNA, KIAA0068 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession number D38549), which was identified by the cDNA project (21Nomura N. Nagase T. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Seki N. Kawarabayasi Y. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the p120 are 1) AAEDLFVNIRGY, 2) ELATVLSDQPG, 3) ASLSLADHREL, and 4) RLSSVDSVLK, all of which are identical to the deduced amino acid sequence of rat HEM-2 (22Baumgartner S. Martin D. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Sutton J. Desai A. Huang I. Kato K. Hromas R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 2Detailed analysis of HEM-2 will be described elsewhere. We have also determined the amino acid sequence of p180 and found that p180 is a novel protein which is highly homologous to myosin heavy chain. 3Detailed analysis of p180 will be described elsewhere. The molecular weights of a KIAA0068 gene product and HEM-2 are calculated to be 145,180 and 128,250, respectively, which are almost the same as the apparent molecular masses of p140 and p120 estimated by SDS-PAGE. Moreover, anti-Sra-1 antibody recognized p140 in the eluate from GST-GTPγS·Rac1 affinity column (Fig.2 A). Therefore, we concluded that p140 and p120 were the bovine counterparts of a human KIAA0068 gene product and HEM-2, respectively. We also confirmed that p140 was detected specifically in the GST-Rac1-affinity eluate but not in the GST-Cdc42 nor GST-RhoA affinity eluates from bovine brain cytosol (20Kuroda S. Fukata M.

Since p140 specifically interacted with Rac1 as described below, we denoted this protein as Sra-1 (SpecificallyRac1-interacting protein) and hereafter refer to it as Sra-1.Figure 2Direct interaction of Sra-1 with Rac1. A, the bovine brain cytosol was loaded on the glutathione column coated with the indicated GST-small GTPases.

B, Myc-Sra-1 was loaded on the glutathione column coated with the indicated GST-small GTPases. Myc-Sra-1 was coeluted with GST-small GTPases by the addition of 500 μl of glutathione. Lanes are the same as those in the legend of Fig.2 A. Forty μl of the eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. The arrowhead denotes the position of Sra-1. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether recombinant Sra-1 interacts with GTPγS·Rac1, the affinity beads coated with GST-small GTPases were mixed with Myc-Sra-1 purified from overexpressing insect cells. After washing the affinity beads, GST-small GTPases were eluted by the addition of reduced glutathione. Myc-Sra-1 coeluted strongly with GTPγS·GST-Rac1 and weakly with GDP·GST-Rac1 (Fig. 2 B), indicating that Sra-1 directly interacts with GTPγS·GST-Rac1. Recombinant Sra-1 was not detected in the eluate of GST-RhoA, GST-Cdc42, or GST affinity beads. Rac1 and Cdc42 share their targets PAK (10Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and that for Cdc42 to be ACK (26Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Our result indicates that Sra-1 is categorized into a specific target for Rac1, such as POR1. The indicated mutants of Sra-1 were translated in vitro, and their interactions with GST-Rac1 were examined. The in vitrotranslated full-length Sra-1 interacted with GTPγS·GST-Rac1 and slightly with GDP·GST-Rac1 (Fig. 3). Sra-1 N-1 (1–959 aa) interacted with GTPγS·GST-Rac1, whereas Sra-1 C-1 (659–1253 aa) did not. The shorter fragments of Sra-1, N-2 (1–632 aa), and N-3 (1–407 aa) were also interacted with GTPγS·GST-Rac1. This result indicates that the N-terminal domain of Sra-1 (1–407 aa) is responsible for the interaction with Rac1. The consensus sequence of the Rac1-binding domain of the target proteins such as PAK and WASP has been determined, and it was designated as CRIB (13Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 27Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The shortest fragment Sra-1 N-3 did not contain the CRIB domain. Therefore, Sra-1 is categorized into the target group that does not have the CRIB domain. Rac1 has been shown to regulate membrane ruffling (2Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar, 3Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To explore whether Sra-1 is also involved in the Rac1-mediated regulation of actin cytoskeleton, we microinjected cDNAs of Myc-Sra-1 with HA-Rac1Val-12, structurally equivalent to RasVal-12 (9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar), into serum-starved KB cells. Membrane ruffling was observed in the injected cells as described (3Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). Sra-1 specifically accumulated at Rac1-induced membrane ruffling area and colocalized with Rac1Val-12 (Fig. 4, B and C). Myc-Sra-1 was also colocalized with cortical actin filaments (Fig. 4,E and F). We also attempted to examine whether Sra-1 interacts with Rac1 in COS7 cells overexpressing Sra-1 and Rac1Val-12, but we failed to do so (data not shown). When Sra-1 was coexpressed with Rac1, most Sra-1 was recovered in the membrane fraction and hardly extracted by detergents. However, colocalization of Sra-1 with Rac1 strongly suggests that these proteins interact in vivo. To explore further the interaction of Sra-1 with Rac1, we microinjected various deletion mutants of Sra-1 with Rac1Val-12 into serum-starved KB cells and analyzed their distributions. When the deletion mutants were microinjected with Rac1Val-12 into the cells, the membrane ruffling was elicited (Fig.5, A, D,G, and J), and Rac1Val-12 was accumulated at the membrane ruffling area (Fig. 5, C,F, I, and L). The deletion mutants capable of interacting with Rac1Val-12 were accumulated at the membrane ruffling area (Fig. 5, B, E, and H), whereas the mutant unable to interact with Rac1Val-12 was not (Fig. 5 K), suggesting that the interaction of Sra-1 with Rac1 is necessary for the accumulation of Sra-1 at the membrane ruffling area. This result is consistent with thein vitro interaction result and suggests that Rac1 may recruit Sra-1 to the membrane ruffling area. Activated Rac1 and Cdc42 induce distinct phenotypes, membrane ruffling, and filopodia formation, respectively (2Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar, 28Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 29Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). It is likely that the distinct phenotype elicited by Cdc42 and Rac1 reflects their specific target activities. POR1 enhances the Ha-RasVal-12-induced membrane ruffling, and truncated POR1 inhibited the Rac1-induced membrane ruffling (14Aelst L.V. Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although this suggests that POR1 is required for the membrane ruffling formation, it is possible that other targets are also required for the membrane ruffling formation elicited by Rac1. Our results suggest that Sra-1, in addition to POR1, is involved in the membrane ruffling formation. We explored the relationship between Sra-1 and actin filament. When Myc-Sra-1 was incubated with F-actin and centrifuged, Myc-Sra-1 was cosedimentated with F-actin (Fig. 6). Myc-Sra-1 was not cosedimentated in the absence of F-actin. This result indicates that Sra-1 directly interacts with F-actin. It is difficult to examine whether Rac1 affects the interaction of Sra-1 with F-actin, because Sra-1 was sedimentated even in the absence of F-actin when it was mixed with GST-Rac1 for an unknown reason. Taken together, it is likely that Sra-1 is involved in the regulation of membrane ruffling formation induced by Rac1 through the interaction with F-actin. Recently, it is reported that introduction of activated PAK, a common target for Rac1 and Cdc42, resulted in the formation of filopodia in Swiss 3T3 cells (30Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and induces the morphological change of HeLa cells (31Manser E. Huang H.-Y. Loo T.-H. Chen X.-Q. Dong J.-M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently found that IQGAP1, another common target for Rac1 and Cdc42, directly interacts with F-actin (32Fukata M. Kuroda S. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29579-29583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is likely that these targets may be required for alteration of actin filament necessary for both filopodia and membrane ruffling formation. Our results suggest that Sra-1 is the specific machinery necessary for the membrane ruffling formation. Taken together, it is plausible that Sra-1 can function in concert with other targets such as PAK, IQGAP1, and POR1, resulting in the formation of membrane ruffling."
https://openalex.org/W2027294838,"Recently, the cloning of a novel Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2(iPLA2) from Chinese hamster ovary cells as well as from mouse and rat sources containing a C-terminal lipase motif and eight N-terminal ankyrin repeats has been described. In this report we describe the cloning of the human iPLA2 cDNA and its expression in B-cells and show that the iPLA2 gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing generating multiple isoforms that contribute to a novel mechanism to control iPLA2activity. The full-length cDNA clone encodes a 806-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 88 kDa. The protein contains a lipase motif, GXSXG, and ankyrin repeats, as described for the hamster and rodent forms of the enzyme but has an additional 54-amino acid proline-rich insertion in the last of the eight ankyrin repeats (residues 395–449). Furthermore, at least three additional isoforms most likely due to alternative splicing were identified. One that is present as a partial cDNA in the expressed sequence tag data base is similar to iPLA2 but terminates just after the lipase active site, and two other isoforms contain only the iPLA2 ankyrin repeat sequence (ankyrin-iPLA2-1 and -2). Ankyrin repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions and because the purified iPLA2enzyme exists as a multimeric complex of 270–350 kDa, the expression of just the ankyrin-iPLA2 sequence suggested that these may also interact with the iPLA2 oligomeric complexes and perhaps modulate PLA2 activity. Transfection of the human iPLA2 cDNA into COS cells resulted in a substantial increase in calcium-independent PLA2 activity in cell lysate. No activity above background was observed following ankyrin-iPLA2-1 cDNA transfection. However, co-transfection of the ankyrin-iPLA2-1 and the iPLA2 cDNAs resulted in a 2-fold reduction in activity compared with iPLA2 alone. A similar co-transfection of ankyrin-iPLA2-1 cDNA with the cPLA2cDNA had no effect on PLA2 activity. These results suggest that the ankyrin-iPLA2 sequence can function as a negative regulator of iPLA2 activity and that the alternative splicing of the iPLA2 gene can have a direct effect on the attenuation of enzyme activity. Recently, the cloning of a novel Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2(iPLA2) from Chinese hamster ovary cells as well as from mouse and rat sources containing a C-terminal lipase motif and eight N-terminal ankyrin repeats has been described.

PLA2 enzymes can be subdivided into two classes, extracellular or intracellular, depending on the enzymes localization during catalysis (2Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The intracellular PLA2s can be further categorized into calcium-dependent, best exemplified by the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (3Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.L. J. Lipid Med. Cell. Sign. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and calcium-independent forms (iPLA2), which tend to be quite diverse and have until recently been less characterized at the molecular level. The calcium-independent PLA2s have a wide tissue distribution (4Ackermann E.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and have been purified from human myocardium (5Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15451-15457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). They all have distinct molecular masses, indicating the diversity of iPLA2s. Recently, an 85-kDa iPLA2 was purified and cloned from CHO cells (9Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and its sequence was found to be analogous to the 85-kDa iPLA2 from P388D1 cells (10Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Jones S.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8576-8580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) as well as the sequence for iPLA2 from rat pancreatic islet (11Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence indicated the presence of eight ankyrin repeats and the GXSXG conserved catalytic sequence, as found in other lipases. Although there were apparent differences in ATP sensitivity among the enzymes, the biochemical, immunological, and sequence data indicate that these three enzymes are likely to be species variants of the same protein. In both P388D1 cells and in rat pancreatic islets it is thought that iPLA2 has a function in membrane phospholipid remodeling (12Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the rat islet iPLA2 may be involved in arachidonic acid release leading to activation of β-cell ion channels (11Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Arachidonic acid is also the main precursor for important biological mediators such as leukotrienes (LT) (13Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar). The oxygenation of arachidonic acid catalyzed by 5-lipoxygenase is the first step in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and leads to the formation of LTA4, which can be further metabolized to LTB4and LTC4. In our ongoing studies of leukotriene synthesis and phospholipase activity in human B lymphocytes, we have demonstrated conversion of arachidonic acid to LTB4 and expression of 5-lipoxygenase in human B lymphocytes (14Jakobsson P.J. Odlander B. Steinhilber D. Rosen A. Claesson H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Jakobsson P.J. Steinhilber D. Odlander B. Radmark O. Claesson H.E. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3521-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although cellular homogenates of B lymphocytes can release arachidonic acid from phospholipids in vitro, exogenous arachidonic acid is a prerequisite for leukotriene synthesis in intact cells (16Jakobsson P.J. Shaskin P. Larsson P. Feltenmark S. Odlander B. Aguilarsantelises M. Jondal M. Biberfeld P. Claesson H.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To elucidate the expression of PLA2(s) in human B lymphocytes, we have examined in this report the expression of the different PLA2s at the transcriptional level and describe the cDNA cloning of the human 85-kDa iPLA2 and its various isoforms and their effect on enzyme activity.DISCUSSIONThe human iPLA2 sequence presented here contains the ankyrin and the GXSXG lipase motifs described for the hamster and rodent enzymes (9Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A major difference between the human enzyme and that of other species is the insertion of a 54-amino acid proline-rich sequence in the eighth ankyrin motif (residues 395–449). A recent report from Tang et al. (9Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which describes a partial human iPLA2 cDNA clone, found at the exact same position in their clone some sequence that was not present in the CHO iPLA2, which they attributed to potential unspliced intron sequences. The insertion described here for human iPLA2, which was detected in all sequenced iPLA2 clones, does not contain any splice junction consensus sequence, nor does it disrupt the reading frame. Whether the human gene contains an additional exon or this form is also present in the other species but has not yet been cloned remains to be determined. The possibility that iPLA2 expression could give rise to splice variants was suggested by finding two partial iPLA2cDNAs in the EST data base with different 5′ ends. The difference was found to be due to a 168-bp insertion in EST 30643. Both EST 30643 and iPLA2 cDNA sequences were easily detected by RT-PCR of B-cell RNA suggesting that both iPLA2 isoforms are expressed. Presently, we are trying to obtain a full-length EST 30643 clone to confirm that this truncated isoform of iPLA2 is catalytically active. Two additional iPLA2 splice variants were also detected, ankyrin-iPLA2-1 and -2, which contain only the ankyrin repeats and no lipase catalytic site.The existence of these truncated forms of iPLA2 is intriguing because the ankyrin motif has been shown to be involved in various types of protein-protein interactions (23Bork P. Proteins. 1993; 17: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 24Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 25Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 26Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The truncated forms could function as negative regulatory proteins by docking to iPLA2 binding sites in the cell and thereby prevent docking of the catalytically active enzyme. Alternatively, they may interfere with the formation of the quaternary structure of iPLA2 and in this way alter enzyme activity. An oligomeric form of the enzyme may indeed be the active state of the enzyme because removal of ankyrin repeats results in loss of enzyme activity (9Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The fact that ankyrin-iPLA2-1 can alter iPLA2 activity was shown by co-transfection of the iPLA2 and ankyrin-iPLA2-1 cDNAs into COS cells. The co-transfection of both constructs results in a 2-fold decrease in PLA2 enzyme activity compared with that observed for the co-transfection of iPLA2 cDNA and vector DNA. Co-transfection of ankyrin-iPLA2-1 cDNA with the cPLA2 cDNA had no effect on PLA2 enzyme activity. Thus the interaction of ankyrin-iPLA2-1 with iPLA2 results in a decrease in enzyme activity. The most likely explanation for this is a competition between ankyrin-iPLA2-1 and iPLA2 monomers to form the oligomeric species. In cells transfected with the iPLA2cDNA alone, the iPLA2 oligomer is most likely composed entirely of active iPLA2 monomers. Co-transfection of both iPLA2 and ankyrin-iPLA2 cDNAs could result in iPLA2 oligomers that contain various combinations of both iPLA2 and ankyrin-iPLA2-1 monomers. What is not known is the stoichiometry of the active iPLA2enzyme complex. Does it contain only iPLA2 monomers, or can it tolerate formations with ankyrin-iPLA2? The size of the iPLA2 complex, based on gel permeation chromatography, ranges from 270 to 350 kDa (7Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), suggesting that there are at most four iPLA2 monomers/complex. If this is the case and we assume that there is equal expression of both subunits in the transfected cells and binding affinity is not changed between the different subunits, then iPLA2-(ankyrin-iPLA2-1) complexes should be enzymatically active, because enzyme activity was only decreased 2-fold in the co-transfected cells. However, a more thorough investigation using purified subunits will have to be done to confirm this. Although we can show that ankyrin-iPLA2 can have an effect on iPLA2 activity, its in vivo role remains to be determined. The level of ankyrin-iPLA2-1 expression is at least 10-fold lower than that of iPLA2, 2P. K. A. Larsson, H.-E. Claesson, and B. P. Kennedy, unpublished results. suggesting that if it participates in the iPLA2 enzyme complex, it must have a much more subtle effect on enzyme activity in the cell. Nevertheless, what we have shown is that alternative splicing of the iPLA2 gene can have a direct effect on iPLA2 activity.In fact, alternative splicing of genes containing sequences that encode both an activity domain and some kind of protein binding domain appears to be a common mechanism to control activity. A similar situation to that of iPLA2 is the IκBγ inhibition of NF-κB activity. IκB proteins contain six or seven ankyrin-like repeats, which have been shown to be essential for retaining NF-κB in the cytoplasm and inhibit DNA binding by Rel/NF-κB (25Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 27Gilmore T. Morn P. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). IκBγ is derived by alternative splicing of the murine p105 gene, which is the precursor for the p50 component of the NF-κB, p50-p65 heterodimer (28Inoue J.-I. Kerr L.D. Kakizuka A. Verma I.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 1109-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of p105 contains p50, which is derived by proteolytic cleavage, whereas the C-terminal half has eight ankyrin repeats (29Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In addition, there are multiple isoforms of IκBγ, all derived by alternative splicing of the p105 gene and each with unique IκB activities (30Grumont R.J. Gerondakis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4367-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The two ankyrin-iPLA2 isoforms described here do have structural and sequence differences, but whether or not they have unique inhibitory activities remains to be determined. Additional examples of alternative splicing having positive and negative effects on activity are two genes involved in programmed cell death: ich-1 (Caspase-2) (31Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Shu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), which encodes a cysteine protease, and bcl-x, a bcl-2-related regulatory gene (32Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao S. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar). Again it is analogous to the iPLA2 situation described above in that both genes produce a long transcript that codes for a functional product that is inhibited by a truncated version encoded by a shorter alternatively spliced transcript (31Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Shu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 32Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A.

Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar).In the two B-cell lines tested, the iPLA2 cDNA sequence was easily amplified, whereas only a weak signal was obtained for the cPLA2 cDNA. The sPLA2 groups I, II, and V and the lipoprotein-associated PLA2 sequences were not detected. The weak PCR signal obtained for cPLA2 is consistent with previous findings that showed that cPLA2expression in B-cells was either very low or undetectable (20Feltenmark S. Runarsson G. Larsson P. Jakobsson P.J. Bjorkholm M. Claesson H.E. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Jakobsson P.J. Larsson P. Feltenmark S. Odlander B. Runarsson G. Bjorkholm M. Claesson H.E. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1995; 23: 293-298PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gilbert J.J. Stewart A. Courtney C.A. Fleming M.C. Reid P. Jackson C.G. Wise A. Wakelam M. Harnett M.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2054-2061PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this it would suggest that iPLA2 may be one of the more significant PLA2s in B-cells. In fact the partial human iPLA2 cDNA sequence recently described (9Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) was cloned from a B-cell line cDNA library. However, no physiological stimuli is at present known to induce leukotriene synthesis in human B lymphocytes; hence they are dependent on exogenous arachidonic acid for leukotriene synthesis. Perhaps, what is required is the correct stimulus to activate the iPLA2 enzyme. It has been demonstrated that the majority of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme in nonstimulated B lymphocytes is located at the nucleus (16Jakobsson P.J. Shaskin P. Larsson P. Feltenmark S. Odlander B. Aguilarsantelises M. Jondal M. Biberfeld P. Claesson H.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, which renders translocation of 5-lipoxygenase to the nucleus, might not be a prerequisite for leukotriene synthesis in B lymphocytes, because the 5-lipoxygenase already is located at the nucleus. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that some stimulus that activates the calcium-independent iPLA2 without increasing the intracellular calcium concentration may be sufficient for the induction of leukotriene synthesis in B lymphocytes. However, in a recent review, Balsinde and Dennis suggest that the major function of iPLA2 is in membrane remodeling and not in arachidonic acid release, although involvement in the latter cannot be completely ruled out (34Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Therefore, the function and the regulation of iPLA2 in B lymphocytes and its role in leukotriene synthesis remain to be determined.In conclusion, we describe in this report the cDNA sequence of the human iPLA2 and its various splice variants. We furthermore present data indicating that a splice variant of the iPLA2containing only the ankyrin motifs and not the active site specifically modulates iPLA2 activity when the proteins are co-expressed in COS-7 cells. These findings suggest that alternative splicing of the iPLA2 pre-mRNA can result in the production of regulatory subunits that can modify iPLA2 in vivo activity.

Recently, an 85-kDa iPLA2 was purified and cloned from CHO cells (9Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol.

The amino acid sequence indicated the presence of eight ankyrin repeats and the GXSXG conserved catalytic sequence, as found in other lipases. Although there were apparent differences in ATP sensitivity among the enzymes, the biochemical, immunological, and sequence data indicate that these three enzymes are likely to be species variants of the same protein. In both P388D1 cells and in rat pancreatic islets it is thought that iPLA2 has a function in membrane phospholipid remodeling (12Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the rat islet iPLA2 may be involved in arachidonic acid release leading to activation of β-cell ion channels (11Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid is also the main precursor for important biological mediators such as leukotrienes (LT) (13Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar). The oxygenation of arachidonic acid catalyzed by 5-lipoxygenase is the first step in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and leads to the formation of LTA4, which can be further metabolized to LTB4and LTC4. In our ongoing studies of leukotriene synthesis and phospholipase activity in human B lymphocytes, we have demonstrated conversion of arachidonic acid to LTB4 and expression of 5-lipoxygenase in human B lymphocytes (14Jakobsson P.J. Odlander B. Steinhilber D. Rosen A. Claesson H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Jakobsson P.J. Steinhilber D. Odlander B. Radmark O. Claesson H.E. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3521-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although cellular homogenates of B lymphocytes can release arachidonic acid from phospholipids in vitro, exogenous arachidonic acid is a prerequisite for leukotriene synthesis in intact cells (16Jakobsson P.J. Shaskin P. Larsson P. Feltenmark S. Odlander B. Aguilarsantelises M. Jondal M. Biberfeld P. Claesson H.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To elucidate the expression of PLA2(s) in human B lymphocytes, we have examined in this report the expression of the different PLA2s at the transcriptional level and describe the cDNA cloning of the human 85-kDa iPLA2 and its various isoforms and their effect on enzyme activity. DISCUSSIONThe human iPLA2 sequence presented here contains the ankyrin and the GXSXG lipase motifs described for the hamster and rodent enzymes (9Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A major difference between the human enzyme and that of other species is the insertion of a 54-amino acid proline-rich sequence in the eighth ankyrin motif (residues 395–449). A recent report from Tang et al. (9Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which describes a partial human iPLA2 cDNA clone, found at the exact same position in their clone some sequence that was not present in the CHO iPLA2, which they attributed to potential unspliced intron sequences. The insertion described here for human iPLA2, which was detected in all sequenced iPLA2 clones, does not contain any splice junction consensus sequence, nor does it disrupt the reading frame. Whether the human gene contains an additional exon or this form is also present in the other species but has not yet been cloned remains to be determined. The possibility that iPLA2 expression could give rise to splice variants was suggested by finding two partial iPLA2cDNAs in the EST data base with different 5′ ends. The difference was found to be due to a 168-bp insertion in EST 30643. Both EST 30643 and iPLA2 cDNA sequences were easily detected by RT-PCR of B-cell RNA suggesting that both iPLA2 isoforms are expressed. Presently, we are trying to obtain a full-length EST 30643 clone to confirm that this truncated isoform of iPLA2 is catalytically active. Two additional iPLA2 splice variants"

However, a role for AA in activation of the oxidase in intact cells has not been established, nor has the AA generating enzyme critical to this process been identified. The human myeloid cell line PLB-985 was transfected to express p85 cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) antisense mRNA and stable clones were selected that lack detectable cPLA2. cPLA2-deficient PLB-985 cells differentiate similarly to control PLB-985 cells in response to retinoic acid or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, indicating that cPLA2 is not involved in the differentiation process. Neither cPLA2 nor stimulated [3H]AA release were detectable in differentiated cPLA2-deficient PLB-985 cells, demonstrating that cPLA2 is the major type of PLA2 activated in phagocytic-like cells. Despite the normal synthesis of NADPH oxidase subunits during differentiation of cPLA2-deficient PLB-985 cells, these cells fail to activate NADPH oxidase in response to a variety of soluble and particulate stimuli, but the addition of exogenous AA fully restores oxidase activity. This establishes an essential requirement of cPLA2-generated AA for activation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase.

The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent transport chain that transfers electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen and generates superoxide, a precursor of microbicidal oxidants important to host defense. NADPH oxidase subunits include three cytoplasmic components, p47 phox, p67 phox, and Rac-2, and a membrane flavocytochrome b 558 composed of gp91 phox and p22 phox (1Nunoi H. Rotrosen D. Gallin J.I.

Until recently, generation of AA had been viewed as a modulating event leading to oxidase activation but not as critical to the process. Recently we and others have used PLA2 inhibitors to implicate generation of AA as important for activation of the NADPH oxidase activity in human neutrophils (17Dana R. Malech L.H. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,18Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that AA increases the affinity of the assembled oxidase for NADPH (19Rubinek T. Levy R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, studies using inhibitors may not delineate the specific enzyme of a related group whose inhibition is responsible for the observed effect, and the inhibition seen may result from action on more than one enzyme. In the last decade, several secreted and cytosolic mammalian PLA2 isozymes have been described (20Seilhamer J.J. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Plant S. Miller J.A. Kloss J. Johnson L.K. J. Biol.

In the present study, we used the RNA antisense technique to create in the human phagocyte myeloid cell line, PLB-985, a p85 cPLA2-deficient model cell line to demonstrate the role of this enzyme in NADPH oxidase activation. PLB-985 cells (31Tucker K.A. Lilly M.B. Heck L. Rado T.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 372-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in stationary suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. Logan, UT), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 12.5 units/ml nystatin (Biological Industries, Beth Haemek, Israel) at 37 °C in a humidified of 5% CO2atmosphere. Cell number and viability were determined by trypan blue exclusion. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined as described earlier (32Liu Y. Levy R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Human cPLA2cDNA (in a PMT2 vector) was generously provided by Dr. J. L. Knopf (Genetic Institute, Cambridge, MA). cPLA2 cDNA (1–530) was excised from its PMT2 vector with the restriction enzymesSalI and XbaI. The ends were filled in with Klenow fragment and ligated in the antisense direction into theXhoI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), which was also filled in with Klenow to form the plasmid cPLA2(1–530)-pcDNA3. The antisense orientation of this insert was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. PLB-985 cells (1 × 107) in logarithmic growth were transfected in 0.3 ml of culture medium with 20 μg of plasmid DNA (antisense or vector alone) by electroporation at 250 V and 960 microfarad in a Gene pulser Unit (Bio-Rad, Melville, NY) and selected in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) (33Zhen L. King A.A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). At 48 h. posttransfection, the living cells were separated on a Ficoll gradient (typically 30–50% of starting number), diluted to 5 × 104 cells/ml, and plated in 96-well plates in the presence of the appropriate antibiotic for selection of clones (G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) 0.8 mg/ml). Clones resistant to the neomycin analogue, G418, were screened by Western blot to select those that were cPLA2 protein-deficient. For immunoblot detection of cPLA2, cells were centrifuged and sonicated in the presence of 5 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 3 mmNaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm PMSF, and 100 μm leupeptin, and membrane and cytosol fractions were separated as described (34Levy R. Rotrosen D. Nagauker O. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions whole cell cPLA2 protein and activity were found entirely in the cytosol fraction as shown earlier (35Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cell lysates were prepared using 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm PMSF, and 100 μm leupeptin. 100 μg of protein from cell cytosol were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide SDS gels and blotted to nitrocellulose. The detection of cPLA2 protein was performed using rabbit antibodies raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion with cPLA2 as described earlier (35Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This antiserum detects three protein bands in neutrophil and PLB-985 cell cytosol, only one of which co-migrates with recombinant cPLA2 and cross-reacts specifically with other cPLA2 antibodies (provided by Dr. J. Knopf, Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, MA) (35Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 2R. Dana and R. Levy, unpublished data. The other (larger and smaller) bands are nonspecific proteins also detected by preimmunized serum from this rabbit. Immunoblot detection of NADPH oxidase components was performed as described earlier (34Levy R. Rotrosen D. Nagauker O. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar). The relative changes of the proteins was quantitated using densitometry in a reflectance mode (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). PLB-985 cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) in HBSS buffer were stimulated for 2 min at 37 °C by 1 mg/ml OZ or 50 ng/ml PMA. The reaction was stopped by 10-fold dilution with cold HBSS and immediate centrifugation at 4 °C. Membrane and cytosol fractions were separated as described earlier (35Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PLA2 activity was determined in the cytosols using sonicated dispersions of 1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl phosphatidyl choline (30 μm, 50,000 dpm/assay) and sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (molar ratio, 2:1) in an assay mixture containing 5 mm DTT (36Clark J.D.

Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar) with some modifications as described earlier (35Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mixture contained the phospholipid substrate in 80 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μg of cytosolic protein (within the linear protein range of the assay) and incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 10 min. Assays of incorporation and release of radiolabeled arachidonic acid ([3H]AA) were performed as previously reported (35Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PLB-985 cells (108cells/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free PBS containing 1 μCi of [3H]AA. After appropriate washes, PLB-985 cells (107 cells/ml) were stimulated, and the release of [3H]AA was determined in the linear range of the reaction. Conditions for dose- and time-dependent responses to induction were explored to determine which conditions resulted in the highest superoxide production and expression of differentiation markers after 5 days of differentiation without reducing cell viability below 95%. Optimal concentration of 5 × 10−8m1,25(OH)2D3 or 10−6mRA were added to 2 × 105 cells/ml PLB-985 cells at their logarithm growth phase. 1,25(OH)2D3 was kindly provided by Dr. Uskokovich from Hoffmann La-Roche Inc. (Nutley, NJ). Mac-1 antigen determination was detected by indirect immunofluorescence as described earlier (38Hazav P. Shany S. Moran A. Levy R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 72-75PubMed Google Scholar). The production of superoxide anion (O·̄2) by intact cells was measured as the superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c (34Levy R. Rotrosen D. Nagauker O. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were suspended (5 × 105 cells/well) in 100 μl of HBSS containing 150 μm ferricytochrome cand activated by the addition of the appropriate stimulus. The reduction of ferricytochrome c was followed by a change of absorbance at 550 nm every 2 min over a 20-min time course using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The maximal rates of superoxide generation were determined using a extinction coefficient E 550 = 21 mm−1 cm−1. OZ was prepared as follows: 20 mg zymosan was incubated with 1 ml of pooled human serum (lipopolysaccharide-free) for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times with HBSS. PLB-985 cells were transfected with human cPLA2cDNA engineered in the antisense orientation in the pcDNA3 expression vector, which also contains a neomycin resistance element. Cell cytosolic fractions from clones resistant to the neomycin analogue, G418, were screened by Western blot to select those that were cPLA2 protein-deficient. Three pcDNA3-cPLA2antisense transfected clones were completely deficient of cPLA2 protein (PLB-D) (Fig.1 A). Several other clones were shown to be partially deficient, containing residual amounts of cPLA2 protein (PLB-R). Both the parent PLB-985 line (PLB) and a G418-resistant clone transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector (PLB-V) were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 1 A, PLB-V produced high levels of cPLA2 protein, and this amount was indistinguishable from that present in the parent PLB cells. Cytosol fractions of the various PLB-derived cell lines were examined for the presence of DTT-resistant enzymatic activity characteristic of p85 cPLA2 using 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 1 B, basal cPLA2activity resistant to inhibition by 5 mm DTT detected in unactivated PLB-V cytosol was similar to that seen in the parent PLB cells (1.25 ± 0.2 and 1.46 ± 0.3 pmol/mg protein/min, respectively). By contrast PLB-D cells that lack cPLA2protein had no detectable DTT-resistant cPLA2 activity, and PLB-R that express reduced levels of cPLA2 protein demonstrated reduced levels of cPLA2 activity in cytosol (0.71 ± 0.4 pmol/mg protein/min). In other experiments (not shown), the cPLA2 activity and protein detected in Triton-extracted cell lysates were identical to that observed in the cytosol fractions shown in Fig. 1. An important characteristic of the PLB cell line is that it can be induced to differentiate toward a mature phagocyte phenotype in response to a variety of differentiating agents (31Tucker K.A. Lilly M.B. Heck L. Rado T.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 372-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, 10−6m RA was used to induce maturation to a granulocyte-like phenotype, whereas 5 × 10−8m 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3) was used to induce maturation to a monocyte-like phenotype (34Levy R. Rotrosen D. Nagauker O. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar). Of importance for the current study is that common features of the differentiated phenotype acquired during differentiation with both induction regimens included expression of CD11b (Mac-1 antigen) at the cell surface and expression of subunits required for assembly of active NADPH oxidase. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the percentage of parent PLB cells expressing Mac-1 antigen at the cell surface measured by indirect immunofluorescence was less than 8% in undifferentiated cells but increased to over 70% by day 5 with either RA or D3. Of note is that the pattern of Mac-1 antigen expression by PLB-V cells or PLB-D cells during induction of differentiation was indistinguishable from that seen with PLB cells. Similarly, the patterns of expression of the subunit components of NADPH oxidase during differentiation of PLB-V, PLB-D, or PLB cells in response to RA or D3 were indistinguishable, as shown by the Western blots in Fig. 2 (B and C). Rac-2 was detected in all the PLB-derived cell lines and did not change during differentiation (not shown). Because cPLA2 could be important for cell growth, we examined DNA synthesis and proliferation using [3H]thymidine incorporation and serial cell counts, respectively. We found that parent PLB, PLB-V, and PLB-D had similar [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell doubling times in the uninduced state and following differentiation showed a similar decline in these measures as maturation occurred (not shown). These analyses of phenotype changes during differentiation indicate that neither the presence of plasmid sequence (PLB-V) nor loss of cPLA2 (PLB-D) had any effect on proliferation or differentiation-associated expression of Mac-1 antigen or NADPH oxidase components. Differentiation was not associated with any change in the constitutive level of cPLA2 protein (Fig.3 A) or enzymatic activity in cytosol fractions (Fig. 3 B) during maturation of parent PLB or PLB-V cells. These results are expected because a recent report (39Xing M. Wilkins P.L. Mcconnell B.K. Mattera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3117-3124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that constitutive expression of cPLA2 does not change during differentiation of HL60 cells, a human promyelocytic cell line. PLB-D remained devoid of measurable cPLA2 protein or activity following differentiation (Fig. 3). As shown in Table I, we compared activation of the NADPH oxidase in differentiated PLB, PLB-V, PLB-R, and PLB-D in response to both soluble and particulate stimuli. PLB and PLB-V show similar levels of superoxide generation when similar differentiation conditions and stimulants are compared. The differentiated PLB-R, which expresses some cPLA2 but less than that seen in differentiated PLB or PLB-V, generated superoxide at levels 50–60% of that seen for differentiated PLB or PLB-V for each stimulus. Differentiated PLB-D did not generate superoxide in response to any of the stimuli tested despite the fact that there were normal levels of expression of the NADPH oxidase components. Thus, the level of cPLA2 expression appeared to have a profound effect on NADPH oxidase generation of superoxide.Table ISuperoxide production in differentiated PLB-985 cellsCell type and stimulationSuperoxide productionD3RAnmol/106 cells/minPLB PMA19.7 ± 0.68.4 ± 1.2 OZ9.1 ± 0.91.8 ± 0.2 FMLP3.5 ± 0.70.5 ± 0.2PLB-V PMA17.9 ± 1.57.7 ± 1.5 OZ10.5 ± 1.21.5 ± 0.4 FMLP3.4 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.3PLB-R PMA12.3 ± 0.34.8 ± 0.7 OZ5.2 ± 0.81.1 ± 0.4 FMLP1.8 ± 0.40.4 ± 0.3PLB-D PMA0.3 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.15 OZ0.05 ± 0.030.03 ± 0.02 FMLP0.03 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab Because cPLA2 would most likely mediate its action on superoxide production by the NADPH oxidase in stimulated cells by release of AA, its role in the liberation of AA was studied. We prelabeled undifferentiated and 5 day D3-differentiated PLB with [3H]AA and then measured release of [3H]AA following stimulation with PMA or OZ (Fig.4 A). D3-differentiated PLB and PLB-V showed a 10-fold increase in [3H]AA release in response to PMA or OZ relative to that seen with the similarly stimulated undifferentiated cells. The differentiated PLB-D showed a striking difference in that the level of stimulated [3H]AA release remained at the same low level as that seen in undifferentiated cells. This suggests that in differentiated phagocytes the major portion of the pulse of AA release associated with PMA or OZ stimulation is mediated by cPLA2. It also suggests that the failure of differentiated PLB-D to produce superoxide is related to a failure to produce this large pulse of AA release following stimulation. We tested this latter hypothesis by providing exogenous free AA to D3-differentiated PLB-D at the time of stimulation of the oxidase by PMA as analyzed in the kinetic assay of superoxide generation shown in Fig. 4 B. Addition of 25 μmAA to the differentiated PLB-D fully restored the superoxide generating capacity to these cells relative to rates of superoxide generation by parent PLB cells stimulated with PMA. Not shown is that addition of free AA alone in the range of 10–25 μm without PMA did not induce any superoxide production. Furthermore, the effect of AA was shown to be specific, because the addition of linoleic or oleic acids (up to 100 μm) to PMA-stimulated PLB-D cells did not restore oxidase activity. This demonstrates that it is the AA generated by cPLA2 that is essential to superoxide generation by the activated NADPH oxidase. NADPH oxidase activation requires translocation of the cytosolic subunits to the cell membrane following stimulation (1Nunoi H. Rotrosen D. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L.

Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). As shown in the Western blot in Fig. 4 C, stimulation of differentiated PLB-D resulted in plasma membrane association by the three cytoplasmic components of the NADPH oxidase that was indistinguishable from that seen in differentiated PLB-V cells. It is of note that addition of AA to differentiated PLB-D at the time of PMA stimulation did not augment the normal levels of cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunits associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 C, last two lanes). This suggests that AA is acting in some final step on the assembled oxidase to promote or maintain the enzyme in an active state rather than acting to induce assembly of the oxidase. Such a model is consistent with previous observations showing that PLA2inhibitors do not affect p47 phox membrane translocation or phosphorylation (17Dana R. Malech L.H. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and that PLA2 inhibitors work even when added after oxidase activation (18Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our studies are the first to delineate the effects of complete and specific inhibition of p85 cPLA2 protein expression and strongly implicates the p85 cPLA2 as the PLA2isozyme responsible for the majority of the pulsed release of AA following stimulation of phagocytes. It also provides the first unequivocal demonstration that AA release is an absolute requirement for superoxide generation by the NADPH oxidase regardless of the stimulus. A number of previous studies have suggested that AA release in stimulated neutrophils or monocytes is mediated by p85 cPLA2 and that this AA release is important for a variety of functional responses. Specifically, it has been shown that the decreased expression of cPLA2 in monocytes treated with antisense cPLA2 oligonucleotide resulted in significant inhibition of [3H]AA release induced by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (40Locati M. Lamorte G. Luini W. Introna M. Bernasconi S. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of human monocytes with bacterial lipopolysaccharide caused an increase in the 85-kDa PLA2 protein and activity that coincided with increased release of PGE2 (41Roshak A. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This increase in PGE2formation could be prevented by treatment of the monocytes with an antisense oligonucleotide directed at the 85-kDa PLA2mRNA, which decreased cPLA2 levels. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide primes human neutrophils for enhanced release of AA and causes phosphorylation of cPLA2 (42Doerfler M.E. Weiss J. Clark J.D. Elsbach P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In monocytes a correlation has been demonstrated between monocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced phosphorylation events, increased expression of 85-kDa PLA2, and increased PGE2 release (43Nakamura T. Lin L.L. Kharbanda S. Knopf J. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4917-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It was recently suggested (44Brauldy S.A. Wooten R.E. Bass D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that cPLA2 is the enzyme that induces the release of AA in a permeabilized neutrophil model. In conclusion, the development of differentiated PLB-D cell lines that lack any cPLA2 expression demonstrates that this protein is not required for proliferation or differentiation processes but that its enzymatic production of AA is an essential requirement for activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Although AA has been used extensively to activate the NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system (34Levy R. Rotrosen D. Nagauker O. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar), it was not known whether its effect in vitro had a correlate in the intact cell. Because our previous studies suggest that AA markedly enhances the affinity of the NADPH oxidase for the NADPH substrate (19Rubinek T. Levy R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), our current observations are most consistent with a model in which cPLA2-generated AA might be a co-factor acting in the intact phagocytic cell to enhance the affinity of the assembled NADPH oxidase for NADPH. We thank Dr. J. L. Knopf for providing us with cPLA2 cDNA and antibody against cPLA2. We also thank M. C. Dinauer and S. J. Chanock for providing the PLB-985 cells and for advice on the transfection procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2050274505,"Hepatitis B virus is a causative agent of hepatocellular carcinoma, and in the course of tumorigenesis, the X-gene product (HBx) is known to play important roles. Here, we investigated the transforming potential of HBx by conventional focus formation assay in NIH3T3 cells. Cells were cotransfected with the HBx expression plasmid along with other oncogenes including Ha-ras, v-src, v-myc, v-fos, and E1a. Unexpectedly, the introduction of HBx completely abrogated the focus-forming ability of all five tested oncogenes. In addition, the cotransfection of Bcl-2, an apoptosis inhibitor, reversed the HBx-mediated inhibition of focus formation, suggesting that the observed repression of focus formation by HBx is through the induction of apoptosis. Next, to test unequivocally whether HBx induces apoptosis in liver cells, we established stable Chang liver cell lines expressing HBx under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Induction of HBx in these cells in the presence of 1% calf serum resulted in typical apoptosis phenomena such as DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation. Based on these results, we propose that HBx sensitizes liver cells to apoptosis upon hepatitis B virus infection, contributing to the development of hepatitis and the subsequent generation of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Hepatitis B virus is a small DNA virus with a 3.2-kilobase partially double-stranded DNA genome and is a causative agent of acute and chronic hepatitis (1Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Through epidemiological studies, chronic hepatitis B virus infection has been linked to the high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 1The abbreviations used are: HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. generation (2Beasly R.P. Lin C.-C. Hwang L.Y. Chen C.-S. Lancet. 1981; ii: 1129-1133Abstract Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Among the four proteins translated from the hepatitis B virus genome, the X-gene product (HBx) has drawn much attention for its role as a transacting factor for exploitation of the host cell machinery. Up to now, several significant discoveries have been made regarding the functions of HBx, and from these studies, HBx was established as essential in viral replication, HCC, and the activation of certain signal transduction pathways (3Rossner M.T. J. Med. Virol. 1992; 36: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 4Cromlish J.A. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 270-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although there is a controversy about the role of HBx in viral replication, the X-gene product was shown to be required for the replication of woodchuck hepatitis virus in animal studies, which are considered to reflect the in vivo phenomenon more precisely (5Chen H.S. Kaneko S. Girones R. Anderson R.W. Hornbuckle W.E. Tennant B.C. Cote P.J. Gerin J.L. Purcell R.H. Miller R.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1218-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zoulim F. Saputelli J. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was drawn by us in a transfection-based replication assay (7Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31405-31412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Generally, it is believed that HBx contributes to the generation of hepatocellular carcinoma. HBx was reported to induce transformation of NIH3T3 cells (8Shirakata Y. Kawada M. Fujiki Y. Sano H. Oda M. Yaginuma K. Kobayashi M. Koike K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1989; 80: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the development of HCC was observed in HBx transgenic liver (9Kim C.-M. Koike K. Saito I. Miyamura T. Jay G. Nature. 1991; 351: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism of HBx-mediated HCC is the disruption of p53 function as a tumor suppressor. There are several reports describing the direct association between HBx and p53 (7Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31405-31412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,10Feitelson M.A. Zhu M. Duan L.-X. London W.T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1109-1117PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.-R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Such interaction presumably suppresses p53 function in G1 cell cycle arrest. The other possible mechanism is based on the ability of HBx to activate cellular signal transduction pathways. HBx stimulates theras/raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, leading to the activation of AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation (13Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 14Natoli G. Avantaggiati M.L. Chirillo P. Costanzo A. Artini M. Balsano C. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (15Benn J. Su F. Doria M. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4978-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NF-κB (16Su F. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4558-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chirillo P. Falco M. Puri P.L. Artini M. Balsano C. Levrero M. Natoli G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 641-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were shown to be activated by HBx. Probably, through the combined actions of the mechanisms listed above, HBx contributes to tumorigenesis. In fact, HBx has been shown to deregulate the cell cycle check point controls through the activation of ras (18Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11215-11219Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It seems that most animal viruses have evolved strategies to block and/or induce apoptosis depending on the cellular environment (19Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1739-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The representative examples of the viral transactivators inducing apoptosis include E1a of adenovirus (20Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 21Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus (22Yamada T. Yamaoka S. Goto T. Nakai M. Tsujimoto Y. Hatanaka M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3374-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Tat of human immunodeficiency virus (23Li C.J. Friedman D.J. Wang C. Metelew V. Pardel A.B. Science. 1995; 268: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). On the other hand, other viral transactivators such as E1b of adenovirus (21Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 24Rao L. Debbas M. Sabbatini P. Hockenbery D. Korsmeyer S. White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and IE1 and IE2 of cytomegalovirus (25Zhu H. Shen Y. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7960-7970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were shown to have the ability to block apoptosis. As for hepatitis B virus, HBx was shown to block the apoptosis induced by the overexpression of p53 (26Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermeulen W. Yeh H. Forrester K. Stüzbecher H.-W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6012-6016PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, as exemplified by E1a/E1b of adenovirus (20Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 21Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 25Zhu H. Shen Y. Shenk T. J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28McCarthy S.A. Symonds H.S. Dyke T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3979-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), viral gene products from the same virus may either block or induce apoptosis. During the study of the HBx-mediated transformation process, we found that HBx sensitizes/induces apoptosis in liver cells. This observation may provide a pathogenic mechanism of hepatitis B virus-related hepatitis and subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma generation. The expression plasmid of HBx and internal deletion mutants pcDNA-X, Xdel-1, and Xdel-2 were described previously (7Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31405-31412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The plasmids employed for transformation assay, pMT13S (29Zerler B. Moran B. Maruyama K. Moomaw J. Grodzicker T. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), pEJ (30Newbold R.F. Overell R.W. Nature. 1983; 304: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), pMC29 (31Heaney M.L. Pierce J. Parsons J.T. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 167-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pFBJ/R (32Miller A.D. Verma I.M. Curran T. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 521-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pcDNAv-src, encode the E1a 13 S gene product, Ha-ras, v-myc, v-fos, and v-src, respectively, and have been described. The human Bcl-2 expression plasmid has been described (33Borzillo G.V. Endo K. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 869-876PubMed Google Scholar). The parental plamids for the construction of the tetracycline-inducible cassette, pUHD10-3 and pUHD172-1, were developed by Gossen et al. (34Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müler G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). pTet-X was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG as a 5′-primer and GCTCAGAATTCTTAGCTAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTATTCGGCAGAGGTGAAAAAGTTG as a 3′-primer with pcDNA-X as a template. The underlined sequences denote the EcoRI site introduced for the facilitation of subcloning and the sequence encoding the hemagglutinin tag, respectively. After HindIII/EcoRI digestion, the polymerase chain reaction product obtained was inserted into pcDNA1 (Invitrogen), yielding the plasmid pcDNA-HBx-HA. Subsequently, a KpnI/XbaI fragment from pcDNA-HBx-HA was subcloned into pUC18, yielding the plasmid pUC18-HBx-HA, followed by the transfer of an EcoRI fragment into the pUHD10-3 plasmid. NIH3T3 cells were plated in DMEM containing 10% calf serum at a density of 3 × 105cells/35-mm plate. Sixteen h later, the cells were transfected using the lipofection technique with 1 μg of each of the indicated expression plasmids along with 0.4 μg of pSV2neo. A total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant using the pUC19 plasmid DNA as a carrier. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were split at a 2:1 ratio and cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. After the indicated days in selective medium, the cells were fixed in a PBS solution containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% formaldehyde for 10 min on ice and stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 10 min at room temperature, and the number of foci was counted. The experiments were performed in duplicate and at least twice. Chang liver cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (passage 259), and all experiments were performed using cells of <15 passages from the original stock. Chang liver cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% calf serum and cotransfected with pTet-X and pUHD172-1 using the lipofection technique. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were split at a 10:1 ratio and cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. After 21 days in selective medium, individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated. For the detection of HBx protein, polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 144–154 of HBx that was previously shown to be immunogenic (35Morianity A.M. Alexander H. Lerner R.A. Science. 1985; 227: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The sequence of the peptide was SPAPCNFFTSA, and the peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for immunization. The polyclonal anti-p53 antiserum was raised against glutathione S-transferase-p53 protein purified from Escherichia coli and has been described (7Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31405-31412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For p21 wafI/cipI, a monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was employed. Western blot analysis was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) based on the manufacturer's protocol. Cells (3 × 104) were plated in DMEM containing 10% calf serum in 35-mm dishes. Twenty-four h later, 0, 2, or 5 μg/ml doxycycline was added to each dish containing DMEM supplemented with 1% calf serum. After an additional incubation for 72 h, the cells were harvested and washed once with PBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100), vortexed, and incubated for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, DNA was precipitated from the supernatants by the addition of 0.1 volume of 5.0m NaCl and 0.5 volume of isopropyl alcohol. Following storage at −20 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of Tris/EDTA buffer containing proteinase K (300 μg/ml) and RNase A (100 μg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 50 °C. The samples were electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Chang liver and HBx-expressing stable Chang liver cells (3 × 102) were plated in DMEM containing 10% calf serum in a 7-mm chamber slide. Twenty-four h later, 0, 2, 5, or 7 μg/ml doxycycline was added to each chamber containing DMEM supplemented with 1% calf serum. After an additional incubation for 48 h, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde for 10 min on ice, and permeated by 100% methanol treatment at room temperature. Subsequently, the slides were stained with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h, washed with PBS, and visualized under a fluorescent UV microscope. Chang liver or HepG2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum or 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. For induction of p53 and p21, the cells were treated with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin at a concentration of 0.4 or 1.0 μg/ml. After the indicated times, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western analysis. To investigate the transforming potential of HBx, the HBx expression plasmid pcDNA-X was transfected into NIH3T3 cells alone or together with the Ha-ras expression plasmid pEJ (TableI, part A). No foci were observed upon expression of HBx alone, whereas the expected focus formation was detected upon expression of Ha-ras. Unexpectedly, the coexpression of HBx and Ha-ras resulted in the abrogation of Ha-ras-induced focus formation, suggesting that HBx somehow interfered with the transforming potential of Ha-ras. The observed effect was specific for wild-type HBx, as two deletion mutants of HBx (Xdel-1 and Xdel-2) were not able to disrupt focus formation (Table I, part B). As a control, we cotransfected the adenovirus E1a 13 S expression plasmid (pMT13S) along with pEJ. E1a and Ha-rasacted cooperatively as expected, and an increased number of foci were observed, confirming that the abrogation of the Ha-ras-induced foci by HBx is a specific nature of HBx.Table IFocus formation assay after transfection of NIH3T3 cells with hbx ± Ha-ras expression plasmidsTransfected genesNumber of foci9 days1-aDays after selection with G418.12 days16 days19 daysA. neo0014 hbx + neo0013 Ha-ras + neo442030 hbx + Ha-ras +neo0037 E1a + Ha-ras + neo9304751Transfected genesNumber of foci11 days14 daysB. neo00 Ha-ras + neo1925 hbx + Ha-ras +neo13 Xdel1 + Ha-ras + neo713 Xdel2 + Ha-ras +neo19211-a Days after selection with G418.

We cotransfected pcDNA-X along with five different expression plasmids, pMC29, pFBJ/R, pcDNAv-src, pMT13S, and pEJ, each encoding v-myc, v-fos, v-src, E1a, and Ha-ras, respectively (Fig. 1). Each of these oncogenes induced a fair number of foci, and the coexpression of HBx resulted in the abrogation of focus formation by all five tested oncogenes (Fig. 1 and TableII). Therefore, the ability of HBx to mediate disruption of focus formation seems to be a general property of HBx regardless of the type of partner oncogenes tested.Table IIFocus formation assay after transfection of NIH3T3 cells with hbx plus five different oncogenes including Ha-ras, v-fos, v-src, v-myc, and E1aTransfected gene selectionNumber of foci11 days2-aDays after selection with G418.13 daysneo00v-fos +neo1632hbx + v-fos +neo04v-src +neo712hbx + v-src +neo02Ha-ras +neo2636hbx + Ha-ras +neo01E1a + neo918hbx + E1a + neo14v-myc + neo48hbx + v-myc + neo02E1a + Ha-ras+ neo36632-a Days after selection with G418. Open table in a new tab Insomuch as many viral transactivators were reported to induce apoptosis depending on the environment (20Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 22Yamada T. Yamaoka S. Goto T. Nakai M. Tsujimoto Y. Hatanaka M. J.

Science. 1995; 268: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), we tested whether the observed inhibition of focus formation by HBx was mediated through the induction of apoptosis. For this purpose, we employed the Bcl-2 protein with an established anti-apoptotic property (22Yamada T. Yamaoka S. Goto T. Nakai M. Tsujimoto Y. Hatanaka M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3374-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rao L. Debbas M. Sabbatini P. Hockenbery D. Korsmeyer S. White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). When Bcl-2 was coexpressed with HBx and Ha-ras, we observed the partial rescue of focus formation (TableIII). Specifically, 13 days after selection with G418 (400 μg/ml), the coexpression of Bcl-2 with HBx plus Ha-ras resulted in the rescue of 12 foci, compared with 22 foci when Ha-ras was expressed alone. Therefore, more than half of the foci were rescued upon coexpression of Bcl-2. These results suggest that the HBx-induced abrogation of focus formation is probably mediated through the induction of apoptosis.Table IIIEffect of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) on the HBx-mediated inhibition of focus formationTransfected genesNumber of foci11 days3-aDays after selection with G418.13 daysneo00Ha-ras +neo1822bcl-2 +neo11hbx + Ha-ras +neo23hbx + Ha-ras +bcl-2 + neo512E1a + Ha-ras + neo21323-a Days after selection with G418. Open table in a new tab Next, to confirm the possibility that HBx possesses an ability to induce apoptosis, we established cell lines expressing HBx in a tetracycline-inducible manner. For this purpose, we constructed an HBx expression plasmid named pTet-X employing the system developed by Gossen et al. (34Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müler G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). In pTet-X, the expression of HBx was under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter, and HBx was tagged with hemagglutinin at the carboxyl terminus. pTet-X was transfected into Chang liver cells along with pUHD172-1, which encodes a mutated tetracycline repressor and a G418-resistant marker (34Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müler G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). After selection of the G418-resistant colonies, the inducible expression of HBx was confirmed by Western analysis using the antiserum raised against the synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 144–154 of HBx. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the treatment of two established cell lines (CLX1 and CLX2) with 5 μg/ml doxycycline resulted in the induction of HBx bands in Western analysis. Therefore, these two cell lines were routinely employed for the rest of the apoptosis experiments. Of note is the fact that the expression level of HBx in these cell lines decreased rapidly, and after passage 15, HBx expression was barely detectable by Western analysis (data not shown). This observation suggests that even with the tetracycline-inducible promoter, a leaky low level of HBx expression is sustained, which imparts enough toxicity to select out the HBx-expressing cells in a long-term culture. Therefore, the subsequently described apoptosis assays were performed with CLX1 and CLX2 cells of <10 passages. To test whether HBx really induces apoptosis, DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation were assayed upon HBx expression. To assay for DNA fragmentation, the parental Chang liver cells and two HBx-expressing stable clones were employed. In DMEM supplemented with 1% calf serum, 0, 2, or 5 μg/ml doxycycline was added to induce HBx expression. Seventy-two h later, DNA was extracted from the harvested cells and run on an agarose gel (Fig. 3). No sign of DNA fragmentation was observed with control Chang liver cells, whereas typical DNA ladders were detected with CLX1 and CLX2 when 2 and 5 μg/ml doxycycline were added to the medium. The amount of fragmented DNA increased in a doxycycline dose-dependent manner. Next, the effects of HBx on nuclear condensation were assayed. Forty-eight h after doxycycline treatment, the cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33258 (Fig. 4). Again, no signs of nuclear condensation were observed with control Chang liver cells at any concentration of doxycycline, whereas with CLX1, nuclear condensation was evident at 2 μg/ml doxycycline. The same result was observed with CLX2 (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that HBx possesses the ability to induce apoptosis.Figure 4Nuclear condensation and fragmentation are observed upon induction of HBx in stable Chang liver cells.Control Chang liver cells (left panels) and HBx-expressing stable cells (CLX1) (right panels) were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 1% calf serum in the presence of 0, 2, 5, or 7 μg/ml doxycycline.

Upon doxorubicin treatment, wild-type p53 is known to accumulate and participate in the cellular response to DNA damage (36Puisieux A. Ji J. Guillot C. Legros Y. Soussi T. Isselbacher K. Ozturk M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As a control, the HepG2 cell line was employed since p53 in this cell line was reported as a wild type (36Puisieux A. Ji J. Guillot C. Legros Y. Soussi T. Isselbacher K. Ozturk M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, the basal p53 level was low, and upon treatment with doxorubicin, p53 began to accumulate and reached the maximal level after 24 h in both cell lines. Accompanying the accumulation of p53, the induction of p21 wafI/cipI was observed upon doxorubicin treatment (Fig.5 B). These results suggest that p53 is a wild type in Chang liver cells. In this report, we have shown that HBx possesses an ability to induce apoptosis using two different criteria. First, HBx disrupted focus formation by other oncogenes in NIH3T3 cells, which is blocked by the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Second, the induction of HBx in Chang liver cells in the presence of 1% serum resulted in typical apoptosis phenomena such as DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation. The experimental results reported here differ from the previous ones in two aspects. The first point of discrepancy is observed in the ability of HBx to transform NIH3T3 cells. Previously, Shirakata et al. (8Shirakata Y. Kawada M. Fujiki Y. Sano H. Oda M. Yaginuma K. Kobayashi M. Koike K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1989; 80: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) reported that the expression of HBx led to the stimulation of growth of drug-resistant colonies and tumor formation in nude mice. In our case, even though the assay was different, HBx alone did not induce any focus formation, but rather abrogated focus formation by other oncogenes. The reason for the difference is not clear at this stage. Perhaps, the expression of HBx alone is sufficient for the stimulation of cell growth, but is not a strong enough stimulus for the formation of foci, and the cell cycle perturbation caused by the coexpression of other oncogenes revealed the otherwise latent apoptosis-inducing ability of HBx. At any rate, disruption of focus formation is a unique property of HBx in that the coexpression of E1a with Ha-ras resulted in cooperative focus formation in the same experiment. With regard to the second point of discrepancy, in contrast to our finding, Wang et al. (26Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermeulen W. Yeh H. Forrester K. Stüzbecher H.-W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6012-6016PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the microinjection of an HBx expression plasmid blocks the apoptosis induced by the overexpression of p53 in primary fibroblasts. Possibly, the discrepancy originated from a different cellular environment in which the apoptosis was assayed since the induction of apoptosis is determined by the combined effects of external stimulus and the physiology of the cell. Recent reports suggest that the normal physiological level of p53 displays an anti-apoptotic activity, whereas a high dose of p53 induces apoptosis (37Lassus P. Ferlin M. Piette J. Hibner U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4566-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Considering that HBx binds to p53 and blocks the p53 function, HBx may have induced apoptosis by antagonizing the anti-apoptotic function of the normal level of p53 in Chang liver cells as observed in our case, but, on the other hand, HBx may have an ability to block apoptosis when the apoptosis-inducing stimulus is the overexpression of p53, as reported previously (26Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermeulen W. Yeh H. Forrester K. Stüzbecher H.-W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6012-6016PubMed Google Scholar). There are several other known functions of HBx that may also serve as the mechanism of apoptosis. The HBx-mediated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway (15Benn J. Su F. Doria M. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4978-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may be responsible since the abnormal regulation of this pathway was shown to lead to apoptosis (39Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HBx may work through the induction of transforming growth factor β insomuch as HBx induces transforming growth factor β expression, which is a well established apoptosis stimulus for liver cells (40Oberhammer F.A. Pavelka M. Sharma S. Tiefenbacher R. Purchio A.F. Bursch W. Hermann R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5408-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), and HBx is colocalized with transforming growth factor β in transgenic liver (41Yoo Y.D. Ueda H. Park K. Flanders K.C. Lee Y.I. Jay G. Kim S.-J. J. Clin Invest. 1996; 97: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, HBx was shown to bind damaged DNA and to sensitize liver cells to cell death by ultraviolet irradiation (42Capovilla A. Carmona S. Arbuthnot P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Further study is required to clarify which of the mechanisms listed above is responsible for HBx-mediated apoptosis. At this stage, the precise role of HBx-mediated apoptosis during natural infection is not clear, but there are reported correlations of apoptosis with hepatitis or HCC. For example, apoptosis in the liver has been observed during hepatitis B viral infection (43Galle P.R. J. Hepatol. (Amst.). 1997; 27: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 44Patel T. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1725-1741PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptotic bodies and “piecemeal necrosis” are frequently detected in viral hepatitis and are likely to occur from apoptosis of individual infected cells rather than focal lysis of hepatocytes, as they are often observed in the absence of adjacent inflammation and features of necrosis. Furthermore, in hepatocarcinogenesis, preneoplastic and neoplastic cell populations show an increased rate of apoptosis as well as enhanced cell proliferation (45Bursch W. Grasl-Kraupp B. Ellinger A. Torok L. Kienzl H. Mullauer L. Schulte-Hermann R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

We report here new findings, which are relevant to the mechanisms by which the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120-gp41 mediates fusion of biological membranes. The HIV-1 fusion reaction proceeds along a series of multiple steps before the final event occurs, which results in delivery of the nucleocapsid into the cell (11Blumenthal R. Dimitrov D.S. Hoffman J.F. Jamieson J.C. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 569-604Google Scholar). In previous studies with influenza hemagglutinin (HA), we have used quantitative fluorescence video microscopy to dissect the process and analyze the molecular interactions taking place in these intermediate steps (12Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. Durell S. Howard D.E. Morris S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,13Blumenthal R. Schoch C. Puri A. Clague M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 635: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These include conformational changes in the viral envelope glycoprotein, assembly of envelope glycoproteins into prefusion pore aggregates, insertion of the fusion peptide into target membranes, destabilization of the target membrane, and formation and expansion of the fusion pore.The first step in the HIV-1 fusion cascade is the triggering of conformational changes in gp120-gp41 (14Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1993; 342: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have measured the kinetics of conformational changes of cell surface-expressed gp120-gp41 triggered by interaction with target cell CD4 and co-receptor. The changes in conformation were revealed using the fluorescent probe 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS), which displays little fluorescence in aqueous solution but lights up when bound to hydrophobic groups (15Rosen C.G. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 16Korte T. Herrmann A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We used a fluorescence video microscopy set-up equipped with an intensified CCD camera to detect and quantify the changes in fluorescence upon interaction of gp120-gp41-expressing cells and appropriate target cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time conformational changes in gp120-gp41 have been monitored in live cells in situ. We have also examined the effect of appropriate co-receptor on the next step in the fusion cascade, fusion pore formation and dilation.RESULTSIt is known that T cell-tropic gp120-gp41 mediates fusion with T cell lines, but not with macrophages, and that macrophage-tropic gp120-gp41 mediates fusion with macrophages, but not with T cell lines (17Broder C.C. Berger E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9004-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We used fluorescence microscopy to investigate the stage of the viral fusion process at which tropism-dependent block of fusion occurs (Fig. 1). Recombinant vaccinia was used to express viral envelope proteins of a T cell-tropic strain, LAI, a macrophage-tropic strain, Ba-L, and an uncleaved gp160 LAI control in BJAB cells, a B lymphocyte cell line. We loaded the envelope-expressing cells with a lipid dye, DiI, and the target cells, SupT1 or macrophages, with the aqueous dye, calcein. Following incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, images of calcein emission, DiI emission, and brightfield microscopy were recorded using an intensified CCD camera. Cell membrane fusion was measured as the percent of target cells that had taken up DiI out of envelope-expressing BJAB cells that were touching target cells, and pore widening as the percent of BJAB cells in contact with target cells that had received the cytosolic dye (18Puri A. Morris S.J. Jones P. Ryan M. Blumenthal R. Virology. 1996; 219: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The results, presented in Fig. 1, show that about 50% of cells expressing T-tropic envelope fuse to cell membranes and form large fusion pores with the T cell lines. Little dye transfer was obtained with the M-tropic strain or with the uncleaved T-tropic strain. By contrast, in macrophages, there was about 20% dye transfer with M-tropic envelope-expressing cells but no effect with either the uncleaved or the T-tropic strains. Control BJAB cells infected with vaccinia wild type WR strain produced less than 1% dye transfer of either calcein or DiI with both SupT1 cells and macrophages. Clearly, cells with mismatched tropism are not capable of either large fusion pore formation or membrane mixing, indicating that the mechanisms of tropism must occur at earlier stages of the fusion process.According to current models of HIV-1 fusion, CD4 induces conformational changes in the HIV envelope, resulting in exposure of the hydrophobic fusion domain of gp41 (14Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1993; 342: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Matthews T.J. Wild C. Chen C.H. Bolognesi D.P. Greenberg M.L. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 140: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the case of influenza HA, it has been shown that a low pH-triggered conformational change of HA resulting in an exposure of hydrophobic binding sites could be followed by a significant increase in fluorescence intensity of the fluorophore bis-ANS (16Korte T. Herrmann A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Using analytical and quantitative video microscopy, we have been able to monitor CD4-triggered conformational changes in situ in gp120-gp41 expressed on cells. HeLa cells expressing HIV-1LAI (Fig. 2,A–D) and HIV-1Ba-L (Fig. 2, E–H) were incubated in the presence of bis-ANS without target cells (Fig. 2,A, C, E, and G) and 20 min after addition of SupT1 cells (Fig. 2, B, D,F, and H). When no SupT1 cells were added, little bis-ANS fluorescence was seen (Fig. 2 A). However, there was a marked increase in intensity of bis-ANS fluorescence in HeLa cells expressing HIV-1LAI gp120-gp41 when SupT1 cells were added, and only those in physical contact with SupT1 cells appeared bright (Fig. 2 B). The highest fluorescence intensity was seen at the areas of contact between gp120-gp41-expressing cells and target cells. By contrast, HIV-1Ba-L-expressing cells did not noticeably light up when exposed to SupT1 cells as compared with controls without SupT1 cells (Fig. 2, E and F). In the brightfield images, we can distinguish between the original gp120-gp41-expressing cells and the added SupT1 (Fig. 2, C,D, G, and H). Little fluorescence intensity change was seen in the SupT1 cells, indicating that presumed gp120-gp41-induced conformational changes in cell surface CD4 do not result in increased hydrophobicity of the CD4 molecule.Figure 2Bis-ANS fluorescence of HIV envelope-expressing HeLa cells before and after addition of SupT1 cells expressing CD4.

E–H, by contrast, there is little or no change in fluorescence of HeLa cells expressing M-tropic envelope in response to SupT1 cells.

The amount of surface expression of gp120-gp41 between the different strains was within 5%, as measured by quantitative video microscopy following staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled, anti-gp41 monoclonal antibody. Fig. 3 Ashows that SupT1 cells induce rapid conformational changes in the T-tropic envelope with little or no lag time (less than 1 min). The M-tropic envelope produced a considerably smaller and less rapid increase of bis-ANS fluorescence. Addition of macrophages to HeLa cells expressing the M-tropic strain of HIV-1 produced rapid conformational changes, but with a slightly longer lag time (about 4 min) compared with the T-tropic strain with T cells (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, there is no significant difference in the curves of the T-tropic wild type or uncleaved T-tropic strains and the vaccinia WR strain that does not express HIV envelope. Fig. 3 C shows that when Mink-CD4 cells, which do not express human accessory molecules, were used as target cells, neither M-tropic or T-tropic strains showed increased bis-ANS fluorescence above that obtained by vaccinia WR strain or the uncleaved strain. This shows that molecules in addition to CD4 are required for the rapid conformational change to be induced by membrane-anchored CD4.Figure 3Kinetics of exposure of hydrophobic binding sites measured by bis-ANS emission intensity upon addition of CD4-expressing supT1 cells.

Hart T.K. Jonak Z.L. Bugelski P.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3818-3825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The integrated fluorescence from individual TF228 cells was monitored at different temperatures as a function of time following addition of sCD4 (Fig. 4). There is a considerably longer lag time than obtained for membrane-bound CD4 on SupT1 cells. Soluble CD4 also induced conformational changes in HeLa cells expressing T-tropic and M-tropic envelope with similar lag times as seen with TF228 cells. HeLa cells infected with vaccinia WR strain did not show any significant fluorescence increase within 50 min of incubation at 37 °C. Although it is difficult to compare the effective concentrations of CD4 in soluble and membrane-bound form, even concentrations of sCD4 as high as 10 μg/ml did not reduce the lag times to those seen with CD4+ cells bearing appropriate co-receptors. At reduced temperatures (16 and 25 °C), the lag times of the conformational change increased and the rates decreased, but the conformational change could still be observed (Fig. 4). Since there is no gp120-gp41-induced fusion at the lower temperature (20Fu Y.K. Hart T.K. Jonak Z.L. Bugelski P.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3818-3825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we surmise that the CD4-induced conformational change can occur in the absence of fusion. However, at these temperatures, we do not see marked changes in bis-ANS fluorescence when cells expressing both membrane-anchored CD4 and the appropriate co-receptor are added to cells expressing the matched envelope glycoprotein.Figure 4Kinetics of exposure of hydrophobic binding sites measured by bis-ANS emission intensity upon addition of soluble CD4 to T-tropic gp120-gp41-expressing cells (TF228).

At 37 °C, there is a rapid conformational change following a lag time of about 900 s. At lower temperatures, the lag time is increased and the rate of fluorescence increase is decreased. No significant differences in lag time or fluorescence increase were detected for an incubation at pH 7.4 and 8.4, 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have performed additional measurements of average fluorescenceversus [bis-ANS] before and after adding sCD4. The results shown in Table I indicate that, at [bis-ANS] > 8 μg/ml, no increase of fluorescence is seen upon addition of sCD4, whereas the background still increases. This indicates that the newly exposed binding sites become saturated beyond this concentration. However, our experiments have been carried out at 2 μg/ml [bis-ANS], at which concentration the background fluorescence is low and the major portion of the fluorescence appears as a result of the triggering of conformational changes in gp120-gp41.Table IRelative fluorescence of TF228 cells in the presence of bis-ANS[bis-ANS]Fluorescence1-aAt the higher relative fluorescence intensities, the gain of the Hamamatsu intensifier was changed and a neutral density filter was used.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONWe have measured the kinetics of a crucial first step in the HIV-1 fusion reaction, namely the triggering of a conformational change in gp120-gp41 by the combination of host cell surface CD4 and co-receptors. We have demonstrated for the first time that fusion mediated by T-tropic or M-tropic gp120-gp41 is blocked at this early stage of the fusion cascade if the appropriate co-receptor is not present on the target cell membrane. Membrane-bound CD4 in the absence of the appropriate co-receptor did not produce the conformational changes in the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. A CD4− cell line expressing CCR5 did not induce conformational changes in M-tropic gp120-gp41 (data not shown). Previous studies with conformation-sensitive antibodies indicate that certain epitopes on gp41 are exposed upon treatment with sCD4 (21Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Membrane-anchored CD4 expressed on a T cell line that is susceptible to fusion mediated by the T-tropic gp120-gp41 also induced conformational changes in gp120-gp41 detected by those antibodies (14Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1993; 342: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The most striking observation in this study is that the membrane-anchored CD4 is only able to induce rapid conformational changes in gp120-gp41 if the appropriate co-receptor is expressed on the target cell.Previously, Korte and Herrmann (16Korte T. Herrmann A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) had shown that the conformational change of influenza HA induced by low pH results in strongly enhanced binding of bis-ANS to influenza virus. The binding is accompanied by a significant increase in fluorescence intensity associated with exposing hydrophobic binding sites. Experiments with influenza virus from which HA ectodomain was removed by digestion with bromelain and with liposomes indicates that the increase of bis-ANS fluorescence of intact virus at low pH is mainly attributable to binding of fluorophore to the influenza HA and that the low fluorescence at pH 7.4 in the presence of intact virus could be assigned to a significant extent to binding to lipid sites (16Korte T. Herrmann A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similarly, in our measurements, the low background fluorescence in the absence of appropriate target cells or sCD4 could be assigned to lipid sites as well as to cell surface proteins containing hydrophobic pockets. Our interpretation of the relatively low background in the absence of a conformational change is that bis-ANS does not have much access to these sites as the cells are covered by carbohydrates (glycocalyx), preventing access of bis-ANS to the membrane.There are several hydrophobic regions on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein to which bis-ANS could conceivably bind. These include the amino-terminal fusion domain, a leucine zipper domain, and contact regions between gp41 and gp120 (14Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1993; 342: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Matthews T.J. Wild C. Chen C.H. Bolognesi D.P. Greenberg M.L. Immunol.

Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). In our assay, it is clear that there is a dramatic increase in exposure of hydrophobic groups after the CD4-induced conformational change occurs (at least a 10-fold increase in fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS). The time course of the conformational change provides no evidence of any biphasic, or multiple phasic effects; instead, it suggests a concerted conformational change leading to exposure of hydrophobic groups. HIV-1LAI is among the laboratory-adapted strains of HIV-1 whose interaction with sCD4 leads to shedding of gp120 (24Groenink M. Moore J.P. Broersen S. Schuitemaker H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work with gp120-gp41 (LAI) had identified conditions of high pH (8.4) or low temperature (16 °C) at which shedding of gp120 does not take place (20Fu Y.K. Hart T.K. Jonak Z.L. Bugelski P.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3818-3825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that under both of these conditions soluble CD4 can induce conformational changes in the envelope, indicating that the bis-ANS changes are not due to shedding (Fig. 4). There is a relatively long lag period in the bis-ANS response with sCD4 as compared with the rapid conformational changes seen with membrane-bound CD4 and appropriate co-receptors. Using an assay based on flow cytometry, Dimitrov et al. (25Dimitrov D.S. Hillman K. Manischewitz J. Blumenthal R. Golding H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 132-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dimitrov D.S. Hillman K. Manischewitz J. Blumenthal R. Golding H. AIDS. 1992; 60: 249-256Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) measuredt½ = 3.5 min for binding of sCD4 to gp120-gp41-expressing cells at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and 37 °C. In our bis-ANS experiments, the t½ for reaching maximum conformational change is 33 min at 37 °C and 1 μg/ml sCD4 (see Fig. 4). We do not think that the difference is due to bis-ANS binding, since Korte and Herrmann (16Korte T. Herrmann A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown that 80% of the fluorescence change due to binding of bis-ANS to low pH-treated influenza virus occurs within 1 min. Moreover, in the case of addition of SupT1 cells to the gp120-gp41 (LAI)-expressing cells, fluorescence changes were seen within 1 min of cell contact. Therefore, we conclude that binding of sCD4 takes place well before the conformational change occurs. This makes the rapid conformational changes we observed in the presence of sCD4 and co-receptor all the more striking.The rapidity of the conformational change, which in both macrophages and SupT1 cells peaked within 20 min, compared with the time required for the start of lipid mixing, which takes about 30 min to start, 2P. L. St. J. Jones, unpublished observations. shows that there must be a substantial barrier to lipid mixing after the conformational change occurs. Our measurements on influenza HA-expressing cells indicate that fusion pore widening occurs soon after lipid mixing commences (12Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. Durell S. Howard D.E. Morris S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Since sCD4 by itself can produce the conformational changes in gp120-gp41, why does membrane-anchored CD4 require the appropriate co-receptor to produce this effect? Obviously, sCD4 has little restriction upon the orientation it is able to adopt and can reach any exposed cell surface gp120-gp41. The diagrams in Fig.5 illustrate how binding of sCD4 to cell surface gp120-gp41 might lead to conformational changes in the envelope glycoprotein. Membrane-anchored CD4, on the other hand, does not have similar accessibility to cell surface gp120-gp41. Fig. 5 Billustrates that membrane-anchored CD4 on cells lacking the appropriate co-receptor might attach at a few contact sites leading to stable association between cells. This association might lead to conformational changes in very few gp120-gp41 molecules not detected by current techniques. However, when the appropriate co-receptor is present on the surface of CD4+ cells, cooperative interaction between CD4, gp120-gp41, and co-receptor in forming tertiary complexes in the contact area will result in massive recruitment of the complexes and conformational transitions in a large number of gp120-gp41 molecules. Lapham et al. (27Lapham C.K. Ouyang J. Chandrasekhar B. Nguyen N.Y. Dimitrov D.S. Golding H. Science. 1996; 274: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) have provided convincing evidence for associations between cell surface CXCR4 and CD4, which are enhanced by adding recombinant T-tropic gp120. Similar results were obtained on the association between CCR5, CD4, and the M-tropic gp120 (28Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Cardoso A.A. Desjardin E. Newman W.

As a proteoglycan, CD44 is also implicated in growth factor and chemokine binding and presentation. The extracellular region of CD44 is variably spliced, giving rise to multiple CD44 isoforms. All isoforms contain an amino-terminal domain, which is homologous to cartilage link proteins. The cartilage link protein-like domain of CD44 is important for hyaluronan binding. The structure of the link protein domain of TSG-6 has been determined by NMR. Based on this structure, a molecular model of the link-homologous region of CD44 was constructed. This model was used to select residues for site-specific mutagenesis in an effort to identify residues important for ligand binding and to outline the hyaluronan binding site. Twenty-four point mutants were generated and characterized, and eight residues were identified as critical for binding or to support the interaction. In the model, these residues form a coherent surface the location of which approximately corresponds to the carbohydrate binding sites in two functionally unrelated calcium-dependent lectins, mannose-binding protein and E-selectin (CD62E).

CD44 is a type I transmembrane protein encoded by a gene containing 19 exons (1Jackson D.G. Buckley J. Bell J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4732-4739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Ten of these exons are variably spliced (V1–V10), giving rise to multiple CD44 isoforms. All CD44 isoforms contain at their amino terminus a domain of ∼100 residues, which is homologous to cartilage link protein domains (3Stamenkovic I. Amiot M. Pesando J.M. Seed B.

In different CD44 isoforms, polypeptides encoded by the variably spliced exons are inserted following exon E5. The functional relevance of different CD44 isoforms is still under investigation, but the following observations have been made. (a) Inclusion of exon V3 results in the modification of CD44 with heparan sulfate (HS) added to an SGSG site contained in this exon (7Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Dickinson R. Timans J. Shields J. Whittle N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Bennett K.L. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). These CD44 isoforms can interact with HS-binding growth factors and chemokines. (b) Inclusion of exon V6 renders tumor cells expressing this CD44 isoform aggressively metastatic (9Günthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S. Zöller M. Haußmann I. Matzku S. Wenzel A. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1991; 65: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, 10Arch R. Wirth K. Hofmann M. Ponta H. Matzku S. Herrlich P. Zoller M. Science. 1992; 257: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). (c) Inclusion of variably spliced exons results in a increase in the number ofO-linked carbohydrates in CD44 (11Bennett K.L. Modrell B. Greenfield B. Bartolazzi A. Stamenkovic I. Peach R. Jackson D.G. Spring F. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This change in glycosylation has been proposed to modulate the ability of CD44 to bind HA and is consistent with the finding that N-linked glycosylation can also modulate HA binding (12Lesley J. English N. Perschl A. Gregoroff J. Hyman R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 13Katoh S. Zheng Z. Oritani K. Shimozato T. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The variably spliced region of CD44 is followed by a stalk encoded by exons E15 and E16, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain that can engage in intracellular signaling pathways (2Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). CD44 is expressed by a large number of different cell types. Leukocytes predominantly express the standard form of CD44 (CD44H). This isoform contains no variably spliced exons and binds HA on activated leukocytes (3Stamenkovic I. Amiot M. Pesando J.M. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 56: 1057-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 5Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhilll C.B. Seed B.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This interaction has been shown to play an important role in leukocyte adhesion and migration at sites of inflammation (14DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Picker L.J. Siegelman M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Activated macrophages and dendritic cells express CD44 isoforms containing exon V3 (8Bennett K.L. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, CD44 is modified with HS and can bind and present HS-binding growth factors and chemokines. This allows these antigen-presenting cells to more efficiently amplify an ongoing immune response. Although the three-dimensional structure of the ligand binding domain(s) of CD44 is currently unknown, attempts have been made previously to map the HA binding site. In an initial mutagenesis study on CD44, only one residue in the link homology domain, Arg-41, could be identified as critical for the interaction with HA (15Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Recently, the solution structure of TSG-6 link domain was determined and found to be similar to the calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin fold (16Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) which was first determined for rat mannose-binding protein (MBP) (17Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar,18Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). TSG-6 provides a prototypic fold for the link protein superfamily to which CD44 belongs and allowed the generation of a comparative molecular model of CD44. This model was used to support a more extensive analysis of the CD44 ligand binding site. Here, we report the generation of the CD44 model and its application in a mutagenesis analysis of the HA binding site. Twenty-four site-specific mutant proteins were generated, and eight residues were identified as important for HA binding. Together with the previously identified Arg-41, residues Tyr-42, Arg-78, and Tyr-79 form a cluster of residues critical for HA binding. In the model, these residues form a coherent surface with additional residues that support binding. The HA binding surface is extensive, consistent with the size of the ligand, and its location approximately corresponds to the carbohydrate binding sites in MBP and E-selectin. The CD44 model was built using the energy-minimized average TSG-6 NMR coordinates (16Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) as template and based on a structure-oriented sequence alignment of several link proteins and CD44 (16Kohda D.

Model building, computer graphics analysis, and energy minimization calculations were carried out with InsightII/Discover (MSI, San Diego, CA). The major secondary structure elements of TSG-6 and conserved residues were included in the model. Conservative residue replacements were carried out in similar conformations, and non-conservative substitutions were modeled using a rotamer search procedure (19Bajorath J. Fine R.M. Immunomethods. 1992; 1: 137-146Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Regions including deletions in CD44 relative to TSG-6 (residues 37–40, 82–84, and 104–107) were modeled based on suitable backbone fragments extracted from the Brookhaven Protein Databank (20Jones T.A.

J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8178) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry at splice points was regularized manually. Other regions considered to be conformationally variable (55–58, 63–66, 98–102, and 109–112) were modeled by conformational search with CONGEN (22Bruccoleri R.E. Mol. Simulat. 1993; 10: 151-174Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conformations with lowest solvent-accessible surface within 3 kcal/mol of the energy minimum conformation were selected and included in the model. The stereochemistry and intramolecular contacts of the initially assembled model were refined by energy minimization with Discover until the maximum derivative of the energy function was ∼4 kcal/Å. In these calculations, AMBER force field parameters (23Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar), a distance-dependent dielectric constant, and a cutoff distance of 9.5 Å for non-bonded interactions were used. The stereochemistry and the sequence-structure compatibility of the model were assessed with PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.S. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and ProsaII (25Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), respectively. ProsaII energy profiles were generated using a 50-residue window for energy averaging. Energy profiles were also calculated to assess intermediate models (e.g. after modeling of a deletion). Modeled segments were rejected if a notable increase in average residue interaction energies was observed. Molecular surfaces were calculated and displayed using GRASP (26Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). Superpositions of structures were generated with ALIGN (27Satow Y. Cohen g.H. Padlan E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Using ALIGN, the α carbon atoms of 90 of the 92 residues included in the final CD44 model superimposed on corresponding residues in TSG-6 with a root mean square deviation of 1.48 Å. The desired mutations were introduced by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction as described (28Bajorath J. Chalupny N.J. Marken J.S. Siadak A.W. Skonier J. Gordon M. Hollenbaugh D. Noelle R.J. Ochs H.D. Aruffo A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1833-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding full-length human CD44H was cloned into the mammalian expression vector PD19, which contains the hinge and constant regions of human IgG2a. Oligonucleotides complementary to both strands of CD44 cDNA were synthesized, including the desired mutation. These primers were then used in polymerase chain reactions with the CD44 construct as template using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were verified by cDNA sequencing. Wild type and mutant CD44-Ig (immunoglobulin) fusion proteins were produced from transiently transfected COS cells. The binding assays described below were designed for use of COS cell supernatants containing CD44-Ig wild type and mutant proteins and do not require highly purified proteins (11Bennett K.L. Modrell B. Greenfield B. Bartolazzi A. Stamenkovic I. Peach R. Jackson D.G. Spring F. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To concentrate soluble Ig fusion proteins, partial purification from the COS cell supernatants was carried out by protein A column chromatography as described previously (15Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The proteins were eluted from the column with 4.0 mimidazole (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm magnesium and calcium chloride, then dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). As reported previously, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of CD44-Ig fusion proteins after this purification step shows an essentially homogeneous fusion protein preparation (11Bennett K.L. Modrell B. Greenfield B. Bartolazzi A. Stamenkovic I. Peach R. Jackson D.G. Spring F. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The Ig fusion protein concentrations were determined using an Ig constant region capture assay (28Bajorath J. Chalupny N.J. Marken J.S. Siadak A.W. Skonier J. Gordon M. Hollenbaugh D. Noelle R.J. Ochs H.D. Aruffo A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1833-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The immunoreactivity of the Ig fusion proteins with three anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The wells of 96-well plates (Immunon-2, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with goat anti-human IgG constant region antibody (1:1000; Cappell) at 4 °C overnight, blocked with 1 × specimen diluent (Genetic Systems, Redmond, WA), then washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The wells were then incubated with dilutions of wild-type or mutant CD44-Ig fusion proteins at concentrations of 16 ng/ml to 2 μg/ml, and washed again. Wells were incubated with the following anti-CD44 mAbs: BU75 (1 μg/ml; Ancell, Bayport, MN), MEM-85 (1:1000, Monosan), or A3D8 (1 μg/ml; Sigma). The wells were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-murine Ig (γ and light) (1:5000, Biosource, Camarillo, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, then developed in chromogenic substrate (chromogen diluted 1:100 in citrate-buffered substrate, Genetic Systems). The absorbency was measured on an ELISA reader at dual wavelengths, 450 and 630 nm). BU75 and MEM-85 are conformationally sensitive, as they do not show reactivity in Western blots. The A3D8 is a blotting mAb and was used to monitor protein expression. The ability of the wild type and mutant CD44-Ig fusion proteins to bind to HA was also assayed by ELISA. Immunon-2 plates (Dynatech) were coated with HA (10 μg/ml) overnight at room temperature in 50 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, then blocked with 1 × specimen diluent (Genetic Systems) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were incubated with dilutions of wild type or mutant CD44-Ig fusion proteins at concentrations of 10–50 μg/ml for 45 min at room temperature. The wells were washed three times, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated Fab goat anti-human Ig gamma chain (1:5000; Biosource) for 45 min at room temperature. After washing, bound HRP-conjugated antibody was assayed using chromagen in buffered substrate (Genetic Systems) as described above. CD44 modeling was based on the alignment of TSG-6 and CD44 sequences shown in Fig.1 A. Taking conservative mutations into account, the sequence similarity between CD44 and TSG-6 in the modeled region is 50%. Significant departures from the TSG-6 structure are predicted for regions including deletions and for loop conformations (Fig. 1 B). Energy profiles were calculated for the CD44 model and the TSG-6 structure (Fig. 1 C). The negative average energy values of the energy profiles and their shape similarity suggest that the sequence-structure compatibility of the model is comparable to TSG-6 and that significant errors in the core region of the model are absent. Thus, the CD44 model was indicated to be sufficiently accurate to guide mutagenesis experiments and to analyze the HA binding site. In the model, residue Arg-41, which was identified previously as critical for HA binding (15Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), maps to a fully exposed position in an extended loop connecting the first β-strand and α-helix. With the predicted location of Arg-41 as a starting point, 17 CD44 residues were selected in an effort to screen the surface of the CD44 link homology domain for residues important for HA binding. A total of 24 CD44 point mutant proteins were generated, including conservative and non-conservative changes at several positions. Twenty-one mutant proteins were expressed in quantities sufficient for further characterization. These mutant proteins were first tested for their ability to bind to two conformationally sensitive anti-CD44 mAbs. This was done to assess the gross structural integrity of the mutant proteins. Then, the HA binding activity of the mutant proteins was assayed. The results of all mutagenesis and binding experiments are summarized in Table I. Representative mAb binding profiles are shown in Fig. 2. In general, we found that mAb MEM-85, which effectively blocks HA binding to CD44, mirrors the HA binding properties (see below) of mutant proteins. Some, but not all, mutations that abolished HA binding also abolished MEM-85 binding. These findings indicated that the MEM-85 epitope and the HA binding site in CD44 closely overlap. However, this correlation was not observed for mAb BU75, suggesting that its epitope is either more distant from the HA binding site or that its binding is not affected by these mutations. For example, mutant protein R41A, which bound to mAb BU75 at wild type levels, did not bind to either mAb MEM-85 or HA. The mAb binding characteristics of mutants outside the putative MEM-85 epitope region strictly correlated. Any mutant protein that bound mAb MEM-85 also bound mAb BU75. Therefore, mutant proteins were considered structurally perturbed, if the binding to both mAbs was at least partially affected (e.g. Q65S). The mAb binding experiments suggested that 17 of 21 tested mutant proteins were conformationally sound (Table I). Fig. 2 shows that mutant S112R (which does not affect HA binding, see below) binds slightly better to mAb MEM-85 than wild type CD44. The effect is subtle, but the mutation S112R may slightly increase the avidity of the CD44-mAb interaction.Table IBinding of CD44 mutant proteins to conformationally sensitive mAbs (BU75 and MEM-85) and HAMutantBU75MEM-85HAWild type+++F34A−−−F34Y+++K38R+−+/−K38SProtein not expressedR41A+−−Y42F+/−−−Y42S+−−R46S+++E48SProtein not expressedK54S+++Q65S+/−+/−−K68S+++/−R78KProtein not expressedR78S++−Y79F++−N100A+++/−N100R+++/−N101S+++/−Y105F+++Y105S+++/−S112R+++Y114F+++F119A+/−−−F119Y+++ Open table in a new tab Representative HA binding experiments are shown in Fig. 3. The HA binding activity of different mutant proteins could be classified as either comparable to wild type, reduced (intermediate), or undetectable. All binding experiments are summarized in Table I. Residue Asn-100 is one of four possible N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-57, Asn-101, Asn-110, and Asn-120) in the link homology domain of CD44. Drastic mutations of Asn-100 to alanine or arginine affected HA binding but not mAb binding. It is not known whether Asn-100 is glycosylated or not, but the results suggest that Asn-100 contributes, directly or indirectly, to HA binding. The comparison of conservative and non-conservative mutations helped to better understand the role of some of the mutated residues for HA binding. For example, both Phe-34 and Phe-119, which are partially buried in the model, bound mAbs and HA at wild type levels when conservatively mutated to tyrosine but displayed reduced or abolished binding to both mAbs and HA when mutated to alanine. This suggests that these two residues are important for structural integrity and that the mutations indirectly affect HA binding. Conservative mutation of Tyr-105 to phenylalanine retained both mAb and HA binding, while mutation to serine abolished only HA but not mAb binding. This suggests that Tyr-105 is important for HA binding and that the aromatic ring is required for the interaction. In contrast, the conservative mutation of Tyr-79 to phenylalanine abolished HA binding, while mAb binding was not affected. This indicates that Tyr-79 is critical for HA binding and that the absence of the hydroxyl group is sufficient to severely compromise the CD44-HA interaction. Similarly, the conservative mutation of Lys-38 to arginine was sufficient to significantly reduce the binding to both mAb MEM-85 and HA, while the mutant protein bound like wild type to mAb BU75. Thus, Lys-38 is thought to be important for both MEM-85 and HA binding, but not for overall structural integrity. The conclusions drawn from the characterization of mutant proteins are summarized in Table II, which shows a classification of the mutated residues according to their importance for either structural integrity or HA binding. This classification was based on the mAb and HA binding characteristics of the 21 expressed mutant proteins. Eight new residues (Lys-38, Tyr-42, Lys-78, Arg-78, Tyr-79, Asn-100, Asn-101, and Tyr-105) were identified as important for the CD44-HA interaction. Three of these residues (Tyr-42, Arg-78, and Tyr-79) were considered critical, as their mutation completely abolished HA binding. The binding characteristics of these mutant proteins were equivalent to the previously characterized R41A mutant (15Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), which was also tested for comparison. Three residues (Phe-34, Gln-65, and Phe-119) contribute to the structural integrity of CD44, while four residues (Arg-46, Lys-54, Ser-112, and Tyr-114) were, on the basis of our experiments, not important for structure or HA binding.Table IIClassification of CD44 residues according to their importance for ligand binding or structural integrityResidueHA bindingThree-dimensional structureNot importantPhe-34XLys-38XAng-41XTyr-42XXArg-46XLys-54XGln-65XLys-68XArg-78XXTyr-79XXAsn-100XAsn-101XTyr-105XSer-112XTyr-114XPhe-119XBased on the mutagenesis data, residues are considered important for ligand binding (X), if their mutation resulted in reduced HA binding but did not significantly affect the binding to at least mAb BU75.

Open table in a new tab Based on the mutagenesis data, residues are considered important for ligand binding (X), if their mutation resulted in reduced HA binding but did not significantly affect the binding to at least mAb BU75. Residues are considered critical for binding (XX) if their mutation completely abolished HA binding. For Tyr-114, only the conservative mutation Tyr → Phe was carried out. The mutated residues were mapped on the CD44 model (Fig. 4 A). Residues important for structural integrity map to the same region close to the carboxy terminus of the link homology domain. Mutation of these residues may affect the structure of the link domain directly and/or compromise the association of the polypeptide encoded by CD44 exon E5, at least part of which is required for overall stability and ligand binding (15Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Residues Tyr-42, Arg-78, and Tyr-79 closely map to Arg-41 and form a cluster of residues in CD44 that is critical for both HA and mAb MEM-85 binding. This is consistent with finding that MEM-85 effectively blocks HA binding. Residues that substantially contribute to HA binding extend the HA binding site beyond the cluster of critical residues. Two residues not important for binding and three potentialN-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-57, Asn-110, and Asn-120) map to positions distant from the binding site. The accuracy of model-based mutagenesis and residue mapping is not sufficient to provide a detailed picture of the carbohydrate binding site in CD44. However, the consistency of the results obtained in this study suggests that an outline of the binding site can be generated. Fig. 4 B shows that residues important for the CD44-HA interaction form a coherent HA binding surface in the CD44 model. Critical residues (Arg-41, Tyr-42, Arg-78, and Tyr-79) form the center of the HA binding site, which, in the model, runs along a ridge on the protein surface. The putative binding surface is extensive. In the model, Lys-78 is approximately 25 Å away from the center of the binding site. This is consistent with the minimal size of the HA ligand, a hexasaccharide (29Underhill C.B. Chi-Rosso G. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8086-8091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The location of the binding surface in CD44 approximately corresponds to the binding site proposed for TSG-6 (16Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, there are some significant differences. Of the residues identified as important in our study, only Tyr-42 is conserved in TSG-6. Arg-41 in CD44 corresponds to Lys-11 in TSG-6. Similarly, residue Lys-38 in CD44 corresponds to an arginine in TSG-6 and the K38R mutation in CD44 affects HA binding (Table I). None of the other CD44 residues important for HA binding are conserved in TSG-6; critical residues Arg-78 and Tyr-79 both correspond to alanines in TSG-6 (Fig. 1 A). It follows that the details of the protein-carbohydrate interaction may substantially differ in these proteins, despite corresponding binding site locations. The predicted location of the HA binding site in CD44 was compared with the carbohydrate binding sites in MBP and E-selectin. MBP is a serum protein that binds mannose expressed on the surface of pathogens and plays a major role in primitive innate immune responses in mammals (30Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The selectins are a family of type I transmembrane proteins that includes three members, E-, P-, and L-selectin (31Lasky L.A. Science. 1992; 258: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 32Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5852) Google Scholar). The selectins are predominantly expressed on endothelial cells (E- and P-selectins) or leukocytes (L-selectin) and recognize sialylated Lewis X (-like) tetrasaccharide structures via their amino-terminal extracellular C-type lectin domains (31Lasky L.A. Science. 1992; 258: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 32Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5852) Google Scholar). Selectin-ligand interactions play a critical role in triggering the initial interaction between leukocytes and vascular endothelium in the course of an inflammatory reaction (31Lasky L.A. Science. 1992; 258: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of the C-type lectin domains of MBP (17Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and E-selectin (33Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) display a high degree of structural similarity and contain a conserved calcium binding site that is critical for carbohydrate binding. We have superimposed the CD44 model on the E-selectin structure and compared the locations of residues in CD44 and E-selectin (33Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S.

Fig.5 A shows that the binding sites overlap, suggesting that these proteins utilize corresponding regions for the recognition of diverse carbohydrate structures. The locations of tyrosine residues in CD44 (Tyr-79 and Tyr-105) and E-selectin (Tyr-48 and Tyr-94), which are critical for carbohydrate binding, correspond closely. Fig. 5 B shows a side-by-side comparison of the carbohydrate binding sites in MBP (18Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), E-selectin, and CD44. Despite sharing the C-type lectin fold, MBP and E-selectin are functionally distinct. The structures of link proteins are more distantly related to the C-type lectins. Nevertheless, the binding sites map to equivalent regions in these proteins. The binding surfaces increase with the size of the recognized ligands from mannose (MBP) to sialylated Lewis X (E-selectin) to HA (CD44). In MBP, protein-carbohydrate interactions are essentially limited to the conserved calcium coordination sphere (18Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), while surface residues in the vicinity of the conserved calcium are critical for ligand binding to the selectins. In contrast to MBP and E-selectin, carbohydrate binding to CD44 is not calcium-dependent and involves a larger surface area. The functional role of MBP in primitive immune responses implies that it is an ancient molecule. Thus, link protein domains may have diverged from the C-type lectin fold. A combined modeling and mutagenesis study has identified CD44 residues important for HA binding and has made it possible, despite the inherent limitations, to generate a three-dimensional outline of the CD44 ligand binding site. Although TSG-6 and CD44 share similar structures and common ligands, the majority of residues important for HA binding to CD44 are not conserved in TSG-6, suggesting the presence of specific interactions. The putative HA binding surface in CD44 is extensive and in part corresponds to the carbohydrate binding site in E-selectin. Comparison of the binding sites in MBP, E-selectin, and CD44 is thought to provide an example for the evolution of carbohydrate-binding protein surfaces."

However, the signaling cascade utilized by the urokinase receptor is only incompletely understood. We investigated intracellular uPA/uPAR signaling in human aortic VSMC from the cell membrane to the nucleus. uPA binding to VSMC induced a rapid and pronounced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins with molecular masses of 53–60, 85–90, and 130–140 kDa. By using co-immunoprecipitation techniques and in vitro kinase assays, the uPAR-associated proteins were identified as Janus (Jak) and Src non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK) Jak1, Tyk2, and p59 fyn, p53/56 lyn, p53/59 hck, and p55 fgr. Furthermore, uPA induced a time-dependent reversible translocation of the Stat1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) protein to the VSMC nuclei, as shown by confocal microscopy studies. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we then demonstrated that Stat1 is rapidly activated in response to stimulation with uPA and specifically binds to the DNA regulatory elements GAS (interferon-γ activation site) and ISRE (interferon-stimulated response element).

Under the same conditions, Jak2, Jak3, and the Src-PTKs remained randomly distributed over the entire body of the cells.

In response to vascular injury such as balloon angioplasty, or in chronic pathological processes such as atherosclerosis, the differentiated VSMC dedifferentiate.

Furthermore, beyond merely facilitating extracellular proteolysis, the binding of uPA to its receptor also induces an intracellular signal (7Gyetko M.R. Todd III, R.F. Wilkinson C.C. Sitrin R.G. J.

Moreover, intracellular signals were also induced by stimulation with the NH2-terminal fragment of uPA, which retains receptor binding properties, but is devoid of enzymatic activity (12Resnati M.

However, because of the receptor's special topology in the cell membrane implying the extracellular localization of uPAR and its membrane attachment via a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, the mechanisms responsible for extra-/intracellular signaling via uPAR still remain unclear (13Roldan A.L.

Masur S.K. Lazega D. Waxman S. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), Src-PTKs are not the only kinases that may be utilized in uPAR-mediated signaling. Furthermore, uPAR-related changes in diacylglycerol formation (18Del Rosso M. Anichini E. Pedersen N. Blasi F. Fibbi G. Pucci M. Ruggiero M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the activation of the c--fos gene (19Dumler I. Petri T. Schleuning W.-D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) via an unknown signaling pathway have also been demonstrated. The important question as to whether the different functions of uPAR are mediated through different signaling mechanisms and/or by kinases in addition to Src, has not yet been addressed. One potential candidate for alternative uPAR-related signaling is the Jak/Stat pathway, a system that has recently been demonstrated to be involved in the signaling induced by a variety of growth factors, cytokines, and interferons (20Briscoe J.

Crow M. Cheung L. Lakatta E. Kinsella J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) after injury.We here report data which suggest that, in human aortic VSMC, the uPAR-signaling complex in addition to its close association with Src-PTK directly activates the Jak/Stat signaling cascade. uPA induces Jak1 and Tyk2 activation and causes a rapid translocation of Stat1 to the nucleus, where Stat1 selectively binds to the interferon-γ activation site/interferon-stimulated response element (GAS/ISRE) DNA transcription elements. In addition, we demonstrate that in migrating VSMC uPAR is localized to the leading edge of the cells where it is colocalized with the Jak, but not with the Src kinases. These observations suggest the involvement of Jak1 and Tyk2 in the regulation of cell migration.DISCUSSIONWe here demonstrate that uPAR can directly activate the Jak/Stat signaling pathway in human aortic VSMC. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed the association of uPAR with two Janus kinases: Jak1 and Tyk2, and uPA-dependent activation of these two Jak kinases was demonstrated by in vitro kinase assay. In addition, we demonstrate that uPA induces rapid translocation of Stat1 to the nucleus, where it selectively binds to the GAS/ISRE DNA transcriptional elements. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first evidence that uPA activates a definite chain of signal transduction from the cell membrane to the nuclear transcriptional machinery.Since in human monocytes (16Bohuslav J. Horejsi V. Hansmann C. Stöckl J. Weidle U.H. Majdic O. Bartke I. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and monocytic THP-1 cells (12Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), the PTK of the Src family coprecipitate with uPAR, recent research on uPA/uPAR signal transduction was focused on these PTK. These earlier findings are confirmed by our study in VSMC. Using co-immunoprecipitation, a standard technique for the characterization of molecular interactions with GPI proteins, and an in vitro kinase assay, we were able to demonstrate close association of uPAR and the four members of the Src-PTK family p59 fyn, p53/56 lyn, p55 fgr, and p55/59 hck in VSMC. However, information concerning the distal components of this signaling cascade is still lacking. uPA-induced c-fos gene expression has been demonstrated in previous studies (19Dumler I. Petri T. Schleuning W.-D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggests c-fos as a downstream component of Src-PTK phosphorylation in response to uPA stimulation. Nonetheless, the possibility that the stimulation of c-fosexpression was a result of uPA-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases cannot be excluded, and the question of whether or not the 38–42 kDa proteins, which we also found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to uPA actually are mitogen-activated protein kinases, needs further study.The recently identified Jak/Stat signal transduction pathway is utilized by cytokines and growth factors in the regulation of accelerated gene expression (20Briscoe J. Guschin D. Müller M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1033-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 336-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). With this background, we hypothesized uPA/uPAR-associated signaling via the Jak/Stat cascade. In VSMC, uPA treatment induced a specific time-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of 85–90- and 130–140-kDa proteins. These proteins are of similar molecular mass as the Jak family of protein-tyrosine kinases and the Stat family of transcription factors. The latter are known to be substrates for Jak kinases in a number of cytokine receptor systems (21Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Actually, immunoprecipitation experiments, combined with in vitro kinase assays, allowed us to identify two members of Janus kinases, namely Jak1 and Tyk2, to be associated with uPAR in one signal transducing complex.The activation of Jak by cytokines or growth factors leads to the rapid phosphorylation of Stat proteins on tyrosine residues. The phosphorylated Stat proteins translocate immediately to the nucleus and bind to specific DNA sequences such as GAS, ISRE, or Sis-inducible element, and hence activate specific gene expression (20Briscoe J. Guschin D. Müller M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1033-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F.

Cell Res. 1996; 222: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To confirm that uPA via uPAR does induce Jak/Stat signaling, we further examined uPA-induced translocation of Stat1 to the nuclei of VSMC and its binding to the DNA sequences GAS/ISRE. Stat1 was selected because of its previously shown functional importance for VSMC (23Yamamoto H. Crow M. Cheung L. Lakatta E. Kinsella J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies allowed us to demonstrate that uPA activation actually leads to the rapid reversible translocation of Stat1 to the nucleus. Gel shifts of VSMC nuclear fractions were performed using the GAS/ISRE consensus binding sequence for interferon-γ activation factor. They showed the specific formation of protein-DNA complexes in response to stimulation with uPA. In addition, the kinetics of uPA-induced DNA binding activity in the cell nuclear extracts was rapid and time-dependent and had a rather transient character correlating with the kinetics of uPA-dependent Stat1 translocation into the nucleus. In electrophoretic mobility supershift experiments, anti-Stat1 antibody abolished the protein-DNA complex, thus demonstrating that these complexes did indeed contain Stat1 protein. These results suggest a novel mechanism for uPAR-dependent signal transduction and provide further evidence that links uPAR to a dynamic intracellular event. These findings are in accordance with other studies showing that the signaling machinery induced by cytokines and growth factors may involve two or more interacting pathways, the activation of Jak/Stat system and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src-PTK (29Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 30Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Schieffer B. Ling B.N. Bernstein K.E. Cell.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).To further explore the probable functions of both these signaling pathways, VSMC migration experiments were performed using a wound assay. In this assay, a highly asymmetric distribution of uPAR was found in response to wounding, localizing uPAR to the leading edge of the cells. This finding is in agreement with the observation that uPAR polarization occurs upon injury in human umbilical vein VSMC (9Okada S.S. Tomaszewski J.E. Barnathan E.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and in endothelial cells (8Pepper M.S. Sappino A.-P. Stöcklin R. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, similar polarization of uPAR has been observed in human monocytes in response to chemotactic gradients (6Estriecher A. Mühlhauser J. Carpentier J.-L. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 7Gyetko M.R. Todd III, R.F. Wilkinson C.C. Sitrin R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Our experiments also demonstrated pronounced redistribution of both uPAR-associated Janus kinases, Jak1 and Tyk2, to the leading edge of migrating cells, where they colocalized with uPAR. Under the same experimental conditions, Jak2, Jak3, and the members of the Src family remained randomly distributed over the entire body of the cell.Redistribution of the molecules participating in the regulation of cell migration to the leading edge, as compared with a random distribution, is of advantage for the migrating cell. Focal concentration of the molecules potentially increases the information content of the signal and thus accelerates its transduction. Induced proximity therefore may be regarded as a very important event in intracellular signaling (32Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Redistribution of the molecules responsible for cell migration may thus be a highly conserved mechanism for maximizing signal transduction. Our data on the redistribution and colocalization of Jak1 and Tyk2 with uPAR to the leading edge of migrating cells indicate that the Jak/Stat pathway does play in important role in the uPAR-related regulation of cell migration. This notion is well in agreement with recent findings on the requirement of Jak1 kinase for cell migration and anterior specification in zebra fish embryos (33Conway G. Margoliath A. Wong-Madden S. Roberts R.J. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This work also implies that, in addition to its role in signal transduction of cytokines in adult tissues, Jak1 has a role in early embryonic development and tissue remodeling. The involvement of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway in uPAR signaling thus strongly suggests a mechanism that optimizes gene induction during cell migration. Further research that targets to the identification of Stat1 transcriptionally regulated genes should therefore be able to define their potential roles in VSMC functional responses to uPA. The functional role of the Src kinases in uPAR-related signaling as well as the nature of the mechanism providing extra-/intracellular conduction of the uPAR-related signal also remains to be established. The later may include adapter molecules, co-receptor functions, and other more indirect interactions (34Dumler I. Hucho F. Gulba D.C.

In response to vascular injury such as balloon angioplasty, or in chronic pathological processes such as atherosclerosis, the differentiated VSMC dedifferentiate. The associated functional changes allow medial VSMC to migrate from the media into the intima where they proliferate and contribute to neointima formation and restenosis. To date, a number of factors which contribute to the regulation of VSMC migration and/or proliferation have been identified, including numerous growth factors and cytokines (1Casscells W. Circulation. 1992; 86: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 2Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9931) Google Scholar). In addition to these mechanisms, a substantial body of evidence implicates regulatory proteases, such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), to play a decisive role in cell migration and tissue remodeling (3Blasi F.

In VSMC, uPA treatment induced a specific time-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of 85–90- and 130–140-kDa proteins. These proteins are of similar molecular mass as the Jak family of protein-tyrosine kinases and the Stat family of transcription factors. The latter are known to be substrates for Jak kinases in a number of cytokine receptor systems (21Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Actually, immunoprecipitation experiments, combined with in vitro kinase assays, allowed us to identify two members of Janus kinases, namely Jak1 and Tyk2, to be associated with uPAR in one signal transducing complex.The activation of Jak by cytokines or growth factors leads to the rapid phosphorylation of Stat proteins on tyrosine residues. The phosphorylated Stat proteins translocate immediately to the nucleus and bind to specific DNA sequences such as GAS, ISRE, or Sis-inducible element, and hence activate specific gene expression (20Briscoe J.

Cell Res. 1996; 222: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To confirm that uPA via uPAR does induce Jak/Stat signaling, we further examined uPA-induced translocation of Stat1 to the nuclei of VSMC and its binding to the DNA sequences GAS/ISRE. Stat1 was selected because of its previously shown functional importance for VSMC (23Yamamoto H. Crow M. Cheung L. Lakatta E. Kinsella J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies allowed us to demonstrate that uPA activation actually leads to the rapid reversible translocation of Stat1 to the nucleus. Gel shifts of VSMC nuclear fractions were performed using the GAS/ISRE consensus binding sequence for interferon-γ activation factor. They showed the specific formation of protein-DNA complexes in response to stimulation with uPA. In addition, the kinetics of uPA-induced DNA binding activity in the cell nuclear extracts was rapid and time-dependent and had a rather transient character correlating with the kinetics of uPA-dependent Stat1 translocation into the nucleus. In electrophoretic mobility supershift experiments, anti-Stat1 antibody abolished the protein-DNA complex, thus demonstrating that these complexes did indeed contain Stat1 protein. These results suggest a novel mechanism for uPAR-dependent signal transduction and provide further evidence that links uPAR to a dynamic intracellular event. These findings are in accordance with other studies showing that the signaling machinery induced by cytokines and growth factors may involve two or more interacting pathways, the activation of Jak/Stat system and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src-PTK (29Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 30Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Schieffer B. Ling B.N. Bernstein K.E. Cell.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).To further explore the probable functions of both these signaling pathways, VSMC migration experiments were performed using a wound assay. In this assay, a highly asymmetric distribution of uPAR was found in response to wounding, localizing uPAR to the leading edge of the cells. This finding is in agreement with the observation that uPAR polarization occurs upon injury in human umbilical vein VSMC (9Okada S.S. Tomaszewski J.E. Barnathan E.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and in endothelial cells (8Pepper M.S. Sappino A.-P. Stöcklin R. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, similar polarization of uPAR has been observed in human monocytes in response to chemotactic gradients (6Estriecher A. Mühlhauser J. Carpentier J.-L. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 7Gyetko M.R. Todd III, R.F. Wilkinson C.C. Sitrin R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Our experiments also demonstrated pronounced redistribution of both uPAR-associated Janus kinases, Jak1 and Tyk2, to the leading edge of migrating cells, where they colocalized with uPAR. Under the same experimental conditions, Jak2, Jak3, and the members of the Src family remained randomly distributed over the entire body of the cell.Redistribution of the molecules participating in the regulation of cell migration to the leading edge, as compared with a random distribution, is of advantage for the migrating cell. Focal concentration of the molecules potentially increases the information content of the signal and thus accelerates its transduction. Induced proximity therefore may be regarded as a very important event in intracellular signaling (32Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Redistribution of the molecules responsible for cell migration may thus be a highly conserved mechanism for maximizing signal transduction. Our data on the redistribution and colocalization of Jak1 and Tyk2 with uPAR to the leading edge of migrating cells indicate that the Jak/Stat pathway does play in important role in the uPAR-related regulation of cell migration. This notion is well in agreement with recent findings on the requirement of Jak1 kinase for cell migration and anterior specification in zebra fish embryos (33Conway G. Margoliath A. Wong-Madden S. Roberts R.J. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This work also implies that, in addition to its role in signal transduction of cytokines in adult tissues, Jak1 has a role in early embryonic development and tissue remodeling. The involvement of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway in uPAR signaling thus strongly suggests a mechanism that optimizes gene induction during cell migration. Further research that targets to the identification of Stat1 transcriptionally regulated genes should therefore be able to define their potential roles in VSMC functional responses to uPA. The functional role of the Src kinases in uPAR-related signaling as well as the nature of the mechanism providing extra-/intracellular conduction of the uPAR-related signal also remains to be established. The later may include adapter molecules, co-receptor functions, and other more indirect interactions (34Dumler I. Hucho F. Gulba D.C. Fibrinolysis & Proteolysis. 1997; 11: 165-170Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We here demonstrate that uPAR can directly activate the Jak/Stat signaling pathway in human aortic VSMC. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed the association of uPAR with two Janus kinases: Jak1 and Tyk2, and uPA-dependent activation of these two Jak kinases was demonstrated by in vitro kinase assay. In addition, we demonstrate that uPA induces rapid translocation of Stat1 to the nucleus, where it selectively binds to the GAS/ISRE DNA transcriptional elements. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first evidence that uPA activates a definite chain of signal transduction from the cell membrane to the nuclear transcriptional machinery. Since in human monocytes (16Bohuslav J. Horejsi V. Hansmann C. Stöckl J. Weidle U.H. Majdic O. Bartke I. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and monocytic THP-1 cells (12Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), the PTK of the Src family coprecipitate with uPAR, recent research on uPA/uPAR signal transduction was focused on these PTK. These earlier findings are confirmed by our study in VSMC. Using co-immunoprecipitation, a standard technique for the characterization of molecular interactions with GPI proteins, and an in vitro kinase assay, we were able to demonstrate close association of uPAR and the four members of the Src-PTK family p59 fyn, p53/56 lyn, p55 fgr, and p55/59 hck in VSMC. However, information concerning the distal components of this signaling cascade is still lacking. uPA-induced c-fos gene expression has been demonstrated in previous studies (19Dumler I. Petri T. Schleuning W.-D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggests c-fos as a downstream component of Src-PTK phosphorylation in response to uPA stimulation. Nonetheless, the possibility that the stimulation of c-fosexpression was a result of uPA-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases cannot be excluded, and the question of whether or not the 38–42 kDa proteins, which we also found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to uPA actually are mitogen-activated protein kinases, needs further study. The recently identified Jak/Stat signal transduction pathway is utilized by cytokines and growth factors in the regulation of accelerated gene expression (20Briscoe J. Guschin D. Müller M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1033-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F.

https://openalex.org/W2155691564,"Using a chemokine receptor model based on known receptor sequences, we identified several members of the seven transmembrane domain G-protein superfamily as potential chemokine receptors. The orphan receptor ChemR1, which has recently been shown to be a receptor for the CC chemokine I-309, scored very high in our model. We have confirmed that I-309, but not a number of other chemokines, can induce a transient Ca2+ flux in cells expressing CCR8. In addition, the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 responded chemotactically in a dose-responsive manner to this chemokine. Since several chemokine receptors have been shown to be required as coreceptors for HIV-1 infection, we asked whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) could efficiently utilize CCR8. Here we show that the CCR8 receptor can serve as a coreceptor for diverse T-cell tropic, dual-tropic, and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains and that I-309 was a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus infection. Furthermore, we show by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry that antibodies generated against the CCR8 receptor amino-terminal peptide cross-reacted with U-87 MG cells stably expressing CCR8, THP-1 cells, HL-60 cells, and human monocytes, a target cell for HIV-1 infectivity in vivo.

The chemokines are a diverse group of proteins that play an important role in host defense (1Baggiolini M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 351: 1-11Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). They are classified into two major groups, CC and CXC, based on the position of the first two of their four invariant cysteines (2Schall T. Thompson A. The Cytokine Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 419-460Google Scholar). Given their role in host defense, it is no surprise that chemokines and their receptors have been subjected to intense attack by pathogenic organisms. Some viruses have been shown to express viral chemokines and/or chemokine receptors (3Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol.

These findings provide new opportunities not only to study HIV-1 pathogenesis but also to develop new anti-viral strategies.

Using this approach, we identified a recently described orphan seven transmembrane domain receptor that has been known by several names, including ChemR1, TER-1, GPR-CY6, and CKRL1 (20Samson M. Stordeur P. Labbé O. Soularue P. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 3021-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Napolitano M. Zingoni A. Bernardini G. Spinetti G.

Commun. 1996; 227: 846-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), as a prime candidate for a chemokine receptor. Recently ChemR1 has been shown to be a ligand for the CC chemokine I-309 and is now designated CCR8 (23Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,24Roos R.S. Loetscher M. Legler D.F. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17251-17254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that I-309 but not a number of other chemokines can induce a transient Ca2+ flux in cells expressing CCR8. In addition, the human erythroleukemic cell line K562-expressed message for CCR8 was able to bind radiolabeled I-309 and responded chemotactically in a dose-responsive manner to this chemokine. We show here that CCR8 is a coreceptor for HIV-1 and that I-309 potently inhibited both HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus infection of cells expressing CD4 and CCR8. Furthermore, we show that antibodies generated against the CCR8 receptor amino-terminal peptide detected CCR8 receptors in U-87 MG cells stably expressing CCR8 in addition to THP-1 and HL-60 cell lines and in human primary monocytes. Unlabeled chemokines were from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ) or from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).125I-labeled chemokines were obtained from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA). Polyclonal antisera to CCR8 was raised in New Zealand White rabbits by subcutaneous and intramuscular injection with the corresponding amino-terminal domain for CCR8 conjugated to KLH. Following primary immunization and six challenges with peptide, CCR8 antiserum from several pooled bleeds was collected and purified over a peptide affinity column. Purified antibody was analyzed by peptide ELISA with a titer of 30,000. Tissue culture media was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Normal human thymus RNA (CLONTECH) was used as a template for reverse transcription followed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Based on published sequences, two oligonucleotides, Oligo I (GGAGTGAATGTGTTTTATGTG) and Oligo II (ATTTAGTCTTCATTGATCCTCAC), were synthesized and used to derive an 1135-base pair RT-PCR product corresponding to the open reading frame. The RT-PCR product was cloned into pT7Blue (Novagen) and confirmed by complete DNA sequence analysis. For stable transfectants, the RT-PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3 (Stratagene) expression vector containing G418 selection marker. Human U87 MG cells expressing CCR8 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum with 300 μg/ml of G418. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and the Japanese quail fibrosarcoma line QT6-C5 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated bovine serum. The human erythroleukemic cell line K562, monocytic cell line THP-1, promyelocytic cell line HL-60 clone 15, and the T-cell line Jurkat were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Differentiated HL-60 clone 15 cells were generated by treating cells with 0.5 μm butyric acid (Sigma) and 10 ng/ml IL-5 (R&D Systems) as described (23Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The murine embryo fibroblast cell line PA317T4 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-10 with CD4 expression selected for by the addition of 0.6 mg/ml G418. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Human monocytes were purified from peripheral blood of healthy donors. Human buffy coats were obtained from Peninsula Blood Bank (Burlingame, CA), and peripheral blood monocytes were separated using Ficoll-Hypaque as described (25Miller M.D. Hata S. De Waal-Malefyt R. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2907-2916PubMed Google Scholar) and two rounds of adherence to plastic in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human U-87 MG cells were transfected with the pcDNA3 plasmid that encodes CCR8 as described above. Stable cells were selected with G418. Purified CCR8 polyclonal antisera was incubated with cells expressing the receptors (antibody and cells were diluted 1:750 in PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+; for blocking experiments, antibody and amino-terminal CCR8 peptide were incubated together for 30 min on ice prior to addition to cells). Cells were placed on ice for 30–60 min. Cells were pelleted with the supernatant removed, placed back in PBS, and washed twice. Cells were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit-FITC-conjugated antibody (diluted 1:1000 in PBS) on ice in the dark for 30 min. Cells were pelleted and washed as above. Controls for indirect labeling were (a) no primary, secondary-FITC only, (b) pre-immune serum with secondary, (c) non-transfected cell staining, (d) specific blocking with amino-terminal peptide, and (e) cross-reactivity with CXCR1, CXCR2, CCR1, and CCR5 stably expressing cell lines. Cultured cells were grown on 8-well, plastic (ThermanoxTM) chamber slides and stained as described previously (26Hesselgesser J. Halks-Miller M. DelVecchio V. Peiper S.C. Hoxie J. Kolson D.L. Taub D. Horuk R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 112-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), with the exception of adding Triton X-100 to buffers to maintain membrane integrity. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axioskop and photographed with an attached Fuji HC-2000, three-chip CCD digital camera. Images were first edited in Adobe Photoshop 3.0 to enhance contrast and white balance and then printed on a Fuji Pictrography 3000 digital printer. We used the MACAW (Multiple Alignment Construction and Analysis Workbench) computer program running on a Macintosh platform to generate a chemokine receptor model based on the nine primary amino acid sequences for CCR1–5 and CXCR1–4 to detect blocks of similarity. Two blocks corresponding to positions 70–80 (SIYLLNLAISDLLFLFTLPFW) and 286–308 (TEVIAYTHCCVNPVIYAFVGERF) of CCR1 were found, and similar blocks were located at comparable sites in each of the chemokine receptors. This model was then used to search the TREMBL data base to find potential chemokine receptors. QT6 and HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the CCR8 receptor by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (8Doranz B.J. Rucker J. Yi Y.J. Smyth R.J. Samson M. Peiper S.C. Parmentier M. Collman R.G. Doms R.W. Cell. 1996; 85: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). After overnight expression, cells were removed from the plate with 1 mm EDTA, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS for binding and biologic studies. For binding assays cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated in PBS (0.2 nm) and varying concentrations of unlabeled ligands at room temperature for 30 min. The incubation was terminated by removing aliquots from the cell suspension and separating cells from buffer by centrifugation through a silicone/paraffin oil mixture as described previously (27Robb R.J. Greene W.C. Rusk C.M. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1126-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled ligand. CCR8 was expressed in HEK293 cells by transient transfection. Cells were loaded with 2.5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h, allowed to efflux for 15 min in PBS, resuspended in PBS with Ca2+/Mg2+, and warmed at 37 °C for 10 min before measurement of ligand response. Ca2+mobilization was measured in an Aminco-Bowman Luminescence Spectrometer in a constantly stirring cuvette in a volume of 1.5 ml. Thrombin activating peptide-4 was kindly provided by Lawrence Brass (University of Pennsylvania) and was used at a final concentration of 27 μm. K562 cell migration was examined using a 48-well microchemotaxis assay as described previously (28Taub D.D. Key M.L. Clark D. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The results were expressed as the number of migrating cells per three high power fields (± S.E.). Cell-cell fusion was monitored by a luciferase-based gene reporter assay (10Dragic T. Litwin V. Allaway G.P. Martin S.R. Huang Y.X. Nagashima K.A. Cayanan C. Maddon P.J. Koup R.A. Moore J.P. Paxton W.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar, 29Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PA317T4 cells that stably express human CD4 were transfected with luciferase-T7 and the desired coreceptor. T7 RNA polymerase and envelope proteins were introduced into effector HeLa cells by recombinant vaccinia viruses (29Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To initiate fusion, target and effector cells were mixed in 24-well plates at 37 °C. To assess the ability of I-309 to inhibit cell-cell fusion, target cells were incubated with I-309 for 30 min at 37 °C prior to mixing with effector cells. After 8 h, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. Viral stocks were prepared by transfecting HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding the desired envelope and the NL4–3 luciferase virus backbone (pNL-Luc-E-R-) (10Dragic T. Litwin V. Allaway G.P. Martin S.R. Huang Y.X. Nagashima K.A. Cayanan C. Maddon P.J. Koup R.A. Moore J.P. Paxton W.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar). For infection, U87-MG cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with pT4 and the desired coreceptor. The medium was changed after 6 h, and cells were allowed to express overnight. Cells were infected the next day with 500 μl of viral supernatant. Media was changed the following day, and 0.5 ml of additional media was added 1 day prior to harvest of cells. Cells were lysed at 4 days post-infection by resuspension in 150 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40/PBS, and 50 μl of the resulting lysate was assayed for luciferase activity. Chemokine receptors belong to a superfamily of seven transmembrane domain proteins that signal through coupled heterotrimeric G proteins (30Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). At the latest count, well over 600 members of this superfamily have been identified and classified into families (31Watson S. Arkinstall S. The G-protein Linked Receptor Facts Book. Academic Press, San Diego1994Google Scholar). However, a number of cloned serpentine receptors exist for which no endogenous ligands have been identified. To determine whether we could assign any of the orphan receptors in the TREMBL data base to the chemokine receptor family, we looked for regions of local similarity (blocks) based on the protein sequences of the receptors for CC and CXC chemokines, CCR1 through CCR5 and CXCR1 through CXCR4, using a Gibbs sampling strategy (MACAW) (32Lawrence C.E. Altschul S.F. Boguski M.S. Liu J.S. Neuwald A.F. Wootton J.C. Science. 1993; 262: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). We located two significant blocks corresponding to the second and third transmembrane segments (Fig.1). We then used the program BLAST (33Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72097) Google Scholar) to identify sequences matching the 21 amino acid block near the second transmembrane segment and the 22 amino acid block near the third transmembrane segment. In addition to the known chemokine receptors, the highest scoring sequences represented orphan receptors. The orphan receptor that scored the highest was a protein known as ChemR1 where 23/23 amino acids (285–307) matched the block (Fig. 1). Although BLAST queries using the entire amino acid sequence of a particular chemokine receptor sequence (e.g. CCR1) also identified orphan receptors, we noted that known chemokine receptors (e.g.CCR5) scored worse than members of other families (e.g.angiotensin receptors) using this approach, and therefore, we considered its predictive value to be low. ChemR1 was the highest scoring orphan receptor in our analysis. It was recently identified as a receptor for the CC chemokine I-309 (23Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Roos R.S. Loetscher M. Legler D.F. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17251-17254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and is now designated CCR8. To confirm the ligand specificity of CCR8, we tested the ability of a number of CXC and CC chemokines including RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, Eotaxin, IL-8, MGSA, IP10, MCP-1, MCP-3, and I-309 to elicit an increase in Ca2+ flux in HEK293 cells transiently expressing the CCR8 receptor. As expected, only I-309 gave a transient calcium response (Fig.2 A). The EC50 for calcium mobilization by I-309 was approximately 1 ng/ml (Fig.2 B). I-309 is a CC chemokine that was originally identified by subtractive hybridization of a cDNA library from an IL-2-dependent T-cell line (25Miller M.D. Hata S. De Waal-Malefyt R. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2907-2916PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, I-309 has been shown to protect murine T cell lymphomas against dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (34Van Snick J. Houssiau F. Proost P. Van Damme J. Renauld J.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). Beyond these few reports, little is known regarding the real physiological role of I-309. It was originally described as a factor secreted by activated T cells that was able to stimulate the migration of human monocytes (35Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of I-309 to induce chemotaxis in a number of cell lines. We found that K562, which we and others have shown expresses CCR8 (20Samson M. Stordeur P. Labbé O. Soularue P. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 3021-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and several human neuroblastoma cell lines 2D. Taub, unpublished data. stimulated with I-309, demonstrated a significant dose-dependent chemotactic response in vitro (Fig.3). These cell lines exhibited typical bell-shaped dose-response curves in their migration, and the optimal I-309 concentration was between 10–100 ng/ml. Based on the finding that K562 cells expressed transcripts for CCR8 and responded chemotactically to I-309, we tested the ability of these cells to bind radiolabeled I-309. Although K562 cells incubated with125I-labeled I-309 specifically bound the radiolabeled chemokine, the total binding was low (4200 cpm/106 cells), and the nonspecific binding ranged from 50 to 60% of the total. Recently, members of the chemokine receptor family have been shown to serve as coreceptors for HIV-1. Macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 use mainly CCR5 (7Alkhatib G. Combadiere C. Broder C.C.

Virology. 1997; 231: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, to target chemokine receptors therapeutically with small molecule antagonists, it will be important to define the range of chemokine receptors that can be utilized by HIV-1 as coreceptors for invasion. We wanted to determine whether CCR8 could serve as a coreceptor for HIV-1 and whether I-309 could inhibit this. Thus, we used a cell-cell fusion assay in which HeLa cells expressing the desired HIV-1 envelope protein and T7 polymerase are mixed with target cells expressing CD4, a coreceptor, and luciferase under control of the T7 promoter(8). If cell-cell fusion occurs, luciferase is produced as a consequence of cytoplasmic mixing. To determine if I-309 could inhibit HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion, cells expressing the ADA (macropohage-tropic) or BK132 (T-cell tropic) envelope proteins were mixed with cells expressing CD4 and CCR8. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the ADA and BK132 envelope proteins mediated fusion with cells expressing CD4 and CCR8. Fusion was strongly inhibited by I-309 in a dose-dependent manner, providing further evidence that I-309 is a CCR8 ligand (Fig. 4 A). I-309 did not block fusion when either CCR5 or CXCR4 were used as coreceptors (data not shown). To determine if I-309 could also inhibit virus infection, cells expressing CD4 and CCR8 were incubated with I-309 prior to infection with HIV-1 ADA, which uses both CCR5 and CCR8 as coreceptors. As shown in Fig. 4 B, I-309 strongly inhibited infection by HIV-1 when cells expressed CCR8 but not when CCR5 was expressed. Thus, I-309 inhibits CCR8-dependent envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus infection. Since we have shown that CCR8 is a coreceptor for HIV-1, it will be important to establish the relevance of this receptor in the pathogenesis of AIDS by (a) identifying cells that express the receptor, (b) ascertaining if they are targets of the virus, and (c) determining the regulation of the receptor in these cell types. In addition, it will be interesting to examine cells and tissues of AIDS patients to determine whether CCR8 plays a real role in HIV-1 transmission. To answer these and other important questions will require immunological approaches using CCR8 receptor antibodies. Since antibodies to a number of chemokine receptors have been successfully raised using amino-terminal peptides as immunogens (26Hesselgesser J. Halks-Miller M. DelVecchio V. Peiper S.C. Hoxie J. Kolson D.L. Taub D. Horuk R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 112-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), we generated antibodies to CCR8 using a similar approach. The purified anti-CCR8 polyvalent antisera were used to stain transfectants expressing CCR8 receptors. The indirect immunofluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 5, the polyvalent CCR8 receptor antibodies bound to the native receptor expressed by these transfectants. This binding was specific since it was inhibited by the addition of the CCR8 amino-terminal peptide, and pre-immune serum did not stain these cells (Fig. 5 A). The antibodies were specific for CCR8 since the antibodies did not recognize CXCR1-, CXCR2-, CCR1-, or CCR5-transfected cells or untransfected U87-MG parental cells (data not shown). To further investigate the ability of our CCR8 antisera to recognize other cell types that may express the receptor, we carried out FACS analysis of three human cell lines, THP-1, HL-60, and Jurkat, and also examined human monocytes. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 has been reported to respond chemotactically to the murine homolog of I-309, TCA3, (38Luo Y. Laning J. Devi S. Mak J. Schall T.J. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4616-4624PubMed Google Scholar) while I-309 has been shown to induce an increase in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in human HL-60 cells induced with IL-5 and butyric acid (23Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Human Jurkat cells were recently shown to be negative for CCR8 mRNA (21Napolitano M. Zingoni A. Bernardini G. Spinetti G. Nista A. Storlazzi C.T. Rocchi M. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2759-2763PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, FACS analysis of these cell lines revealed CCR8 expression on THP-1 and HL-60 cells while Jurkat cells showed no staining (Fig. 5, B-E). The staining was specific since it was blocked by the CCR8 amino-terminal peptide. Interestingly, we find that unstimulated HL-60 cells cross-react with the CCR8 antibodies (Fig. 5 D), consistent with this they also bind 125I-labeled I-309. 3J. Hesselgesser, unpublished data. Tiffany et al. (23Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have shown that only the differentiated HL-60 cells respond to I-309, which may be due to up-regulation and expression of intracellular proteins that allow CCR8 to transduce signals upon binding of ligand. Since human monocytes have clearly been shown to respond to I-309 by chemotaxis and by induction of cell migration (35Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we examined these cells with the CCR8 antibodies. As seen in Fig.5 F, monocytes stained strongly with the antibodies. To further test for chemokine receptor expression, human U-87 MG cells stably expressing CCR8 were immunohistochemically stained using antibodies to the CCR8 receptor. The cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides and stained as described previously (26Hesselgesser J. Halks-Miller M. DelVecchio V. Peiper S.C. Hoxie J. Kolson D.L. Taub D. Horuk R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 112-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 6 A, the U-87 MG cells stained strongly with the CCR8 antisera. However, not all of the cells stained with the antisera, which is consistent with the partial shift observed by indirect FACS analysis (Fig. 5 A). The specificity of the CCR8 receptor staining was established by demonstrating that peptides specific for the antibodies could appropriately block antibody staining (Fig. 6 B) and that specific staining was not observed with irrelevant monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (data not shown). Our findings that CCR8 functions as a coreceptor for diverse HIV-1 strains makes this molecule potentially relevant for viral pathogenesis. The ability of I-309 to inhibit CCR8-dependent virus infection should make it possible to determine if HIV-1 strains utilize this chemokine receptor for infection of relevant target cells in vivo. Indeed, we have clearly shown that CCR8 is expressed in human monocytes as a major target cell of HIV-1. The availability of antibodies to immunologically detect and characterize CCR8 should also make it possible to determine the relevance of this coreceptor in HIV-1 transmission. We thank Dr. H. Daniel Perez for constant encouragement, helpful suggestions, and support for the work described in this manuscript and Virginia DelVecchio for help with immunohistochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2018764741,"We have previously used <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> as a fungal model for human phenylalanine catabolism. This model was crucial for our characterization of the human gene involved in alcaptonuria. We use here an identical approach to characterize at the cDNA level the human gene for maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI, EC 5.2.1.2), the only as yet unidentified structural gene of the phenylalanine catabolic pathway. We report here the first characterization of a gene encoding a MAAI enzyme from any organism, the <i>A. nidulans maiA</i> gene.<i>maiA</i> disruption prevents growth on phenylalanine (Phe) and phenylacetate and results in the absence of MAAI activity <i>in vitro</i> and Phe toxicity. The MaiA protein shows strong amino acid sequence identity to glutathione <i>S</i>-transferases and has MAAI activity when expressed in <i>Escherichia coli. maiA</i> is clustered with <i>fahA</i> and <i>hmgA</i>, the genes encoding the two other enzymes of the common part of the Phe/phenylacetate pathways. Based on the high amino acid sequence conservation existing between other homologous <i>A. nidulans</i> and human enzymes of this pathway, we used the MaiA sequence in data base searches to identify human expressed sequence tags encoding its putative homologues. Four such cDNAs were sequenced and shown to be encoded by the same gene. They encode a protein with 45% sequence identity to MaiA, which showed MAAI activity when expressed in <i>E. coli.</i> Human MAAI deficiency would presumably cause tyrosinemia that would be characterized by the absence of succinylacetone, the diagnostic compound resulting from fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficiency in humans and fungi. Culture supernatants of an <i>A. nidulans</i>strain disrupted for <i>maiA</i> are succinylacetone-negative but specifically contain <i>cis</i> and/or <i>trans</i> isomers of 2,4-dioxohept-2-enoic acid. We suggest that this compound(s) might be diagnostic for human MAAI deficiency."

The development of a β2AR conjugated with green fluorescent protein (β2AR-GFP) provides the opportunity for a more extensive optical analysis of β2AR sequestration, down-regulation, and recycling in cells. Here we demonstrate that stable expression of β2AR-GFP in HeLa cells enables a detailed temporal and spatial analysis of these events. Time-dependent colocalization of β2AR-GFP with rhodamine-labeled transferrin and rhodamine-labeled dextran following agonist exposure demonstrates receptor distribution to early endosomes (sequestration) and lysosomes (down-regulation), respectively. The observed temporal distribution of β2AR-GFP was consistent with measures of receptor sequestration and down-regulation generated by radioligand-receptor binding assays. Cells stimulated with different β-agonists revealed time courses of β2AR-GFP redistribution reflective of the intrinsic activity of each agonist.

RANTES-induced T cell activation is apparently mediated via two distinct signal transduction cascades: one linked to recruitment of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and the other linked to protein-tyrosine kinase activation. In this report, we identified that the transcription factors Stat1 and Stat3 (for signal transducers and activators of transcription) are rapidly activated in T cells in response to RANTES and MIP-1α.

Many cytokines and growth factors mediate their effects via activation of a common signal transduction pathway, the STAT pathway. Binding of the ligand to its specific transmembrane receptor results in receptor aggregation, which may involve single or multiple receptor chains. Receptor aggregation leads to the catalytic activation of receptor-associated cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases, termed janus kinases (JAK) and phosphorylation-activation of latent monomericsignal transducers and activators oftranscription, Stat proteins. Six Stat proteins have been identified to date. Receptor-associated phosphorylated Stats then dimerize via SH2-phosphotyrosyl interactions and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to specific promoter sequences, thereby regulating gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 29Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). All Stat proteins, with the possible exception of Stat2, differentially bind to more than ten related DNA elements, which fit the consensus TTNNNNNAA (consensus STAT recognition element). Conserved structural motifs within the cytoplasmic domains among the cytokine receptors have been implicated as Jak and STAT recognition sites (30Tanner J.W. Chen W. Young R.L. Longmore G.D.

Although Jak-STAT signaling is likely a common feature of all cytokines, recent reports suggest that STAT activation is not necessarily exclusively mediated via Jak association with the cytoplasmic domains of receptors that constitute the cytokine receptor superfamily. Angiotensin II binding to its cognate seven transmembrane, G-protein-coupled receptor, activates Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3 (32Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol.

Apart from their potent chemotactic activities, there is accumulating evidence that CC chemokines are also capable of stimulating T cellsin vitro (35Bacon K.B. Premack B.A. Gardner P. Schall T.J.

At μm concentrations, RANTES-induced signaling in T cells is mediated by at least two distinct signaling cascades: one associated with recruitment of G proteins and the other to protein-tyrosine kinase activation (35Bacon K.B. Premack B.A. Gardner P. Schall T.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). This RANTES-induced tyrosine kinase activation has been functionally linked to T cell proliferation, up-regulation of the IL-2 receptor, and the production of cytokines. At these micromolar doses, RANTES will induce the tyrosine kinase activity of the zeta-associated protein (ZAP)-70 and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pp125FAK (36Bacon K.B. Szabo M.C. Yssel H.

This chemokine enhancement of T cell activation, in combination with T cell receptor-mediated signals, is also associated with proliferation and IL-2 production (37Taub D.D. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. Key M.L. Longo D.L. Murphy W.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2095-2103PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the potential involvement of Stat proteins in chemokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells. In a similar manner to angiotensin II, RANTES and MIP-1α can activate chemokine receptor (CCR)-mediated STAT signaling in T cells. Our data indicate that both chemokines, at nanomolar doses, induce the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat1 and Stat3. In addition, at nanomolar concentrations, both chemokines induce the gene expression of the Stat-inducible proto-oncogene c-fos. MOLT-4 human leukemic and Jurkat T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were concentrated to 2 × 107 and treated with the appropriate chemokine for the indicated time. Osteosarcoma cells stably expressing CCR4 (HOS-CCR4) or CCR5 (HOS-CCR5) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Promyelocytic leukemic HL 60 cells expressing CCR1 were obtained from ATCC. Recombinant RANTES (0.4 mg/ml) and MIP-1α (1.0 mg/ml) were a generous gift of Dr. T. J. Schall (DNAX Research Inst., CA). Recombinant human interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-Con1 (specific activity 3 × 109 units/mg of protein), was kindly provided by Amgen Inc., CA. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (38Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline that contained 1 mmNa3VO4 and 5 mm NaF and once with hypotonic buffer. Following incubation for 10 min in hypotonic buffer at 108 cells/ml, supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100, cells were disrupted by repeated passage through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 s. The pellet was incubated in high salt buffer at 2.5 × 108cells/ml for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant was supplemented with 0.05% Triton X-100. Nuclear fractions that yielded 4.5–6.7 μg of protein/106 cells, based on the Bradford method for protein determination (Bio-Rad Labs., CA.) were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Hypotonic buffer contained 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.6 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mm NaF, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mg/ml pepstatin A. The buffer that contained 300 mm KCl and 20% glycerol constituted high salt buffer. Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides, representing the sis-inducing element (SIE) of the c-fospromoter and a mutant IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), were synthesized. The sequences are: SIE, 5′-ATTTCCCGTAAATCCC-3′, and mutant ISRE, 5′-CCTTCTGAGGCCACTAGAGCA-3′. These oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized with SalI-compatible linkers at the 5′ terminus (TCGAC). Gel-purified oligonucleotides were mixed with their respective complements, heated to 65 ° for 15 min, and annealed at room temperature for 18 h. Double-stranded elements were used directly in competition experiments. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to reverse transcribe and PCR amplify human CCR1, CCR4, and CCR5 from 1 ng of poly(A)+ RNA. CCR primer sets were: CCR1, sense primer 5′-ATCCTCTCTGGGTTTTATTACACA-3′, antisense primer 5′-GATGATCATGATGACAAAAATCAA-3′; CCR4, sense primer 5′-AAATGAAACCCACGGATATAGCAG-3′, antisense primer 5′-CCATGGTGGACTGCGTGAAG-3′; and CCR5, sense primer 5′-GCTGTGTTTGCTTTAAAAGCC-3′, antisense primer 5′-TTAGCCTCACAGCCCTATG-3′. The reverse transcription-PCR conditions have been previously described (39Wong M. Silverman E.D. Fish E.N. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 1179-1185PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA from promyelocytic HL60 leukemic cells and osteosarcoma cells (HOS) transfected with cDNA for CCR4 (HOS-CCR4) and CCR5 (HOS-CCR5), were used as positive controls for CCR1, CCR4, and CCR5, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies against Stat1 and Stat3 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, KY. Anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) monoclonal antibody, clone 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., NY. For supershift studies, polyclonal antisera against Stat1 and Stat2 were a gift from C. Schindler (Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, NY) and Stat3 antiserum was a gift from D. Levy (NYU School of Medicine). Polyclonal antisera against CCR1 was a gift from R. Horuk, Berlex Biosciences, CA. Preimmune rabbit IgG (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., CA.) was used as a control for immunoprecipitation. GDAC has been previously described (40Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 50 mg of nuclear extract were incubated for 20 min with 25 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in binding buffer. Where indicated, 600 ng of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were added. This mixture (200 ml) was incubated for 2 h with 100 ml of bovine genomic DNA-cellulose (Sigma) that was equilibrated in binding buffer. The DNA-cellulose was then washed 3 times with 3 ml of wash buffer, and DNA-binding proteins were eluted by incubation for 30 min in 200 μl of elution buffer. Following centrifugation, the supernatant (high salt eluate) was concentrated using Amicon-30 microconcentrators (Amicon, Inc., MA), boiled with reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed in Western blotting experiments. Wash buffer contained 12% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.6 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mm NaF, 250 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The buffer that contained 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mg/ml pepstatin A constituted binding buffer. The buffer that contained 360 mm KCl without bovine serum albumin constituted elution buffer. 10 μg of nuclear extract from untreated or chemokine-treated cells were analyzed using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), by a modification of the procedure described previously (41Ghislain J. Lingwood C.A. Fish E.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3655-3663PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts were incubated with or without double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the c-fos SIE or a mutant SIE, in the presence of 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), in EMSA buffer for 30 min at room temperature (final volume 30 ml). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel using 0.5 × Tris-borate-EDTA as running buffer. For supershift experiments, 1.0 μl of polyclonal antisera to Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), or preimmune sera were incubated with protein extracts for 30 min at 4 ° prior to the addition of DNA. EMSA buffer contained 13 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 65 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.06 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% Ficoll. Poly(A)+ RNA extraction and Northern hybridization procedures have been described elsewhere (42Eilers A. Baccarini M. Horn F. Hipskind R.A. Schindler C. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1364-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A 1.3 kbp v-fos cDNA insert in plasmid pFBH-1 was used. RANTES and MIP-1α both bind to the CC chemokine receptors designated CCR1, CCR4, and CCR5. Target T cells for study were chosen initially based on CCR1 expression determined by flow cytometric analysis of anti-CCR1 antibody binding to native CCR1 on cells (Fig. 1). The lack of availability of specific antibodies for the shared receptors CCR4 and CCR5 precluded identification of their cell surface expression. Our analyses revealed that both the MOLT-4 and Jurkat T cell lines express CCR1. Subsequently, we undertook studies to examine whether, in a similar manner to angiotensin II, RANTES can activate Stats in MOLT-4 cells. We employed a procedure that we have developed, GDAC, to assay for chemokine-inducible Stat activation (40Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GDAC does not require prior knowledge of target DNA elements. Briefly, nuclear extracts from RANTES-treated cells were mixed with genomic DNA bound to cellulose. The mixture was allowed to equilibrate, following which DNA-binding complexes were eluted in high salt buffer. Eluted fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Stat proteins were detected using anti-Stat immunoblots. Using this procedure, we identified that RANTES induces Stat1- and Stat3-containing DNA-binding complexes in MOLT-4 cells within 30 min (Fig. 2). Stat2, Stat5, and Stat6 were not detected in the DNA-binding complexes. Since both RANTES and MIP-1α bind to CCR1 (and CCR4 and CCR5), we reasoned that MIP-1α might also invoke Stat1 and Stat3 activation in MOLT-4 cells. All combinations of homo- and heterodimers of Stat1 and Stat3 will bind to the high affinity c-fos SIE recognition element, m67 (38Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the kinetics of activation of both RANTES- and possibly MIP-1α-inducible Stat1- and Stat3-containing complexes in a standard mobility shift assay. MOLT-4 cells were treated with MIP-1α for varying times (15 min to 2 h), then nuclear extracts were analyzed in a gel mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 3, MIP-1α rapidly induced SIE-binding activities in MOLT-4 cells, within 15 min, that were no longer detectable 2 h after treatment. Similarly, RANTES and MIP-1α rapidly induced SIE-binding activities in Jurkat cells, by 15 min, that were likewise no longer detectable after 2 h (Fig.3). The apparent contradiction in kinetics of chemokine-induced Stat activation observed using the two different approaches, GDAC and gel mobility shift assay, may be attributable to the differences in DNA recognition elements employed in the two procedures. Specifically, GDAC allows for detection of STAT complexes that bind with relatively high affinity to any number of different target genomic DNA elements. Moreover, GDAC allows for DNA recognition by STAT complexes in the context of any potential accessory factors that are also present in the nuclear extract and that may be involved in DNA-binding. By contrast, gel mobility shift assays invoke the use of a specified DNA target element, in this case the SIE, thereby restricting the scope of STAT complex binding. The delay in chemokine-induced Stat activation observed by GDAC compared with the gel shift assay, may reflect both the low abundance of activated STAT complexes in the cell extracts and the low abundance of SIE-like recognition elements in the genomic DNA used for GDAC. With increased time, chemokine-induced STAT complexes will accumulate, enhancing the likelihood of detection by GDAC. GDAC identification of DNA-binding Stat-containing complexes in 2-h-induced nuclear extracts may reflect STAT complexes that are induced with slower kinetics and that recognize DNA elements distinct from the SIE element employed in the gel shift assay. Moreover, these Stat-containing complexes may be associated with DNA-binding adapter proteins. We confirmed the specificity of RANTES- and MIP-1α-induced SIE-binding activities using unlabeled competitor SIE DNA and a nonspecific oligonucleotide element (a mutant interferon-stimulated response element) in the gel shift assays (Fig.4). Specifically, both RANTES and MIP-1α-inducible specific SIE-binding activities are present in nuclear extracts from both MOLT-4 and Jurkat cells. Using anti-Stat antibodies in a gel mobility supershift assay, we observed that anti-Stat1 antibodies recognized both SIE-binding complexes in chemokine-treated nuclear extracts (Fig.5, A and B), whereas anti-Stat3 antibodies only recognized one complex (Fig.5 A). We infer that the chemokine-induced SIE binding activities correspond to the STAT complexes Stat1:1 and Stat1:3. The mobilities of antibody-supershifted STAT-SIE complexes vary according to the charge and size of the resultant complexes. Inclusion of antisera to Stat2 resulted in the appearance of a slow migrating band in both untreated (data not shown) and chemokine-treated cells. The mobilities of the chemokine-induced STAT-DNA complexes were, however, unaffected by anti-Stat2 antisera. We infer that Stat2 is not a constituent of the chemokine-induced STAT complexes and that there are constituents in the anti-Stat2 antisera that interact with DNA-binding factors in cells to invoke a non-Stat-specific SIE-containing complex. Additionally, the Stat1:1 and Stat1:3 complexes may be supershifted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10, confirming that, in common with other cytokine-induced STAT complexes, the chemokine-induced STAT complexes are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Fig.5 C).Figure 5RANTES and MIP-1α activate Stat1:1 and Stat1:3 STAT complexes in T cells. MOLT-4 (A) or Jurkat (B) cells were either untreated or treated with RANTES (6 nm) or MIP-1α (2 nm) for 15 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared, incubated with antisera to Stat1, Stat2, Stat3 or preimmune sera, and reacted with labeled SIE, and then the resultant complexes were resolved by native gel electrophoresis. For details refer to Fig. 3. Non-supershifted protein-DNA complexes are identified as Stat1:1 and Stat1:3 by arrows. C, nuclear extracts from RANTES-treated Jurkat cells were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antisera (4G10) or nonspecific antisera (anti-interferon receptor (IFNAR1) antibody, designatedantiIFNα/β Rc), followed by addition of labeled SIE.FP, free probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the biological consequence of chemokine-inducible Stat activation, we examined whether chemokine treatment leads to the transcriptional regulation of a Stat-inducible gene. The promoter of the proto-oncogene c-fos contains a Stat binding DNA element (43Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Indeed, a modified version of the SIE of the c-fos promoter was used as the recognition element for Stat1- and Stat3-containing STAT complexes in our gel shift assays. Chemokine receptor expression is tightly regulated; we have observed that both Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells transiently express chemokine receptors. We have shown that PMA treatment for 16–18 h induces the gene expression of chemokine receptors (data not shown), without affecting Stat activation. Accordingly, PMA-treated Jurkat cells were exposed to RANTES or MIP-1α in time course studies, then poly(A)+ RNA extracted and probed for c-fos gene expression by Northern hybridization. Our results, shown in Fig.6 A, reveal that both RANTES and MIP-1α induce c-fos gene expression within 2 h, which is absent by 6 h. The kinetics of c-fos induction are consistent with the kinetics of chemokine-inducible Stat activation. Interestingly, cyclohexamide treatment of cells 1 h prior to chemokine treatment lead to a superinduction of c-fos gene expression at 6 h. These data imply that c-fos gene expression is under the control of a protein synthesis-dependent pathway. RANTES and MIP-1α mediate their effects by shared receptors: CCR1, CCR4, and CCR5. We conducted experiments to determine the concordance between chemokine-induced c-fos gene induction and expression of specific species of CCRs. The data in Fig. 6 Bshow a correlation between CCR4 and CCR5 gene expression and chemokine-inducible c-fos gene expression. Examination of the intracellular loops of CCR1 reveals a putative Stat3 recognition sequence, YRLQ (residues 311–314) (31Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Close examination of this conserved region within the carboxyl-terminal intracellular loop of the different CCRs reveals a similar Stat recognition motif in CCR4 (YILQ), as well as conserved tyrosine residues in the other receptors. Moreover, a highly conserved motif in the second intracellular loop of the eight CCRs contains a tyrosine residue in all but CCR7: DRYI/LAI/VVH/Q. Interestingly, this tyrosine-containing motif is present in the angiotensin II receptor that is associated with ligand-induced Stat activation. Furthermore, angiotensin II induces similar Stat complexes as RANTES and MIP-1α (33Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Viewed together, these data suggest that chemokine-induced signal transduction may be mediated, in part, via ligand activation of intracellular domains of the CCR associated with Stat activation. Antigen-independent activation of T cells by cytokines may be important for recruiting effector T cells at the site of an immune response and in maintaining the clonal size of memory T cells in the absence of antigenic stimulation (28Unutmaz D. Pileri P. Abrignani S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence to suggest that RANTES and MIP-1α can costimulate T cell activation at nanomolar doses (37Taub D.D. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. Key M.L. Longo D.L. Murphy W.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2095-2103PubMed Google Scholar), the evidence to date for antigen-independent CC chemokine-induced signaling in T cells, mediated by protein-tyrosine kinase activation, is restricted to RANTES (35Bacon K.B. Premack B.A. Gardner P. Schall T.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In this study, micromolar concentrations of RANTES induced T cell activation, characterized by the up-regulation of the IL-2 receptor α chain, IL-2 and IL-5, and T cell proliferation. Our data indicate that, at nanomolar concentrations, RANTES and MIP-1α will trigger protein-tyrosine kinase activation, which in this instance is associated with Stat activation. The biological consequence of this Stat activation in terms of T cell functions remains to be elucidated. It is likely that the protein-tyrosine kinases associated with RANTES-induced T cell proliferation are distinct from those associated with RANTES- and MIP-1α-induced Stat activation. Additionally, subtle structural differences among the receptors that mediate chemokine-induced protein-tyrosine kinase activation may define which kinases are activated and hence which signaling pathways are invoked. The existence of multiple signaling pathways associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated intermediates suggests a complexity related to regulation of T cell functions. This report represents original findings with regard to chemokine activation of Stat signaling pathways. Based on our GDAC studies, it is intriguing to speculate that chemokine-induced Stat1- and Stat3-containing DNA-binding complexes may accumulate in T cells and bind to DNA elements that are distinct from the consensus STAT recognition element, TTNNNNNAA. Such novel promoter elements might provide the basis for grouping gene families, thereby identifying potential gene targets of chemokine action. The immediate challenge, however, is to determine the kinases that mediate Stat phosphorylation-activation in this system and the role of G-proteins in Stat activation. These studies are currently in progress."

The present study demonstrates that interleukin (IL)-10 is expressed by HSC upon activation in vitro or in vivo and that autocrine effects of this cytokine include inhibition of collagen production. Culture activation of HSC caused a distinct increase in IL-10 mRNA level compared with freshly isolated quiescent HSC. Treatment of cultured HSC with tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, or lipopolysaccharide further increased IL-10 mRNA by 2-fold and resulted in the release of IL-10 protein into the medium. HSC isolated from rats after bile duct ligation (BDL) showed prominent increases in IL-10 mRNA (× 100) and protein (× 30) levels at 7 days after BDL, but such induction disappeared in advanced liver fibrosis (19 days after BDL). IL-10 expression correlated positively with mRNA expression of interstitial collagenase and inversely with that of α1(I) collagen. Addition of anti-IL-10 IgG to cultured HSC caused enhanced collagen production under a basal or stimulated condition with TGF-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, or lipopolysaccharide. These effects were associated with increased α1(I) collagen mRNA and reciprocally reduced collagenase mRNA levels. Co-transfection of HSC with an IL-10 expression vector and collagen reporter genes showed a 40% inhibition of α1(I) collagen promoter activity. These results demonstrate that activation of HSC causes enhanced autocrine expression of IL-10 which possesses a negative autoregulatory effect on HSC collagen production mediated at least in part by α1(I) collagen transcriptional inhibition and stimulation of collagenase expression. These findings, along with the demonstrated early induction of HSC IL-10 expression and its late disappearance during biliary liver fibrosis, suggest itsin vivo role in matrix remodeling and a possibility that failure for HSC to sustain IL-10 expression underlies pathologic progression to liver cirrhosis.

These cells participate in matrix remodeling and wound healing of the liver via their myofibroblastic activation (see Ref. 1Friedman S.L. Boyer J.L. Ocker R.K. Progress in Liver Diseases. 14. W. B.

Progress in Liver Diseases. 14. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 101-130Google Scholar). One such mechanism involves soluble factors such as cytokines and inflammatory mediators, which seem to induce different aspects of the cellular activation. Fox example, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-1, TNF-α, TGF-α are all mitogenic to HSC (2Pinzani M. Gesualdo L. Sabbah G.M. Abboud H.E. J. Clin.

Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It also seems important to recognize that one of the primary activities of many of these cytokines resides in their modulation of inflammation and immune responses. As integral part of wound repair processes, monocytes, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts are recruited to the injury site by platelet-derived growth factor (16Deuel T.F. Huang J.S. J. Clin.

Thus, HSC may also actively participate in regulation of inflammation in the liver. IL-10 is a cross-regulatory cytokine produced by Th2 cells, macrophages, mast cells, and B cells. It mediates several key functions of multiple cell types. IL-10 inhibits functions of Th1 cells and their expression of IL-2 and γ-interferon (23Fiorentino D.F. Bond M.W. Mosmann T.R. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar), suppresses macrophages, including antigen presentation to Th1 cells, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activities (24De Waal Malefyt R. Hannen J. Spits H. Roncarolo M.G. Te Velde A. Figdor C. Johnson K. Kastelein R. Yssel H. De Vries J.E. J. Exp.

Med. 1991; 174: 1209-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-10 stimulates mast cells (26Thompson-Snipes L. Dhar V. Bond M.W. Mosmann T.R. Moore K.W. Rennick D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and B cells (27Rousset F. Garcia E. Defrance T. Peronne C. Vezzio N. Hsu D.H. Kastelein R. Moore K.W. Banchereau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-10 has been shown recently to down-regulate type I collagen gene expression and to increase matrix metalloprotease-1 (interstitial collagenase) and matrix metalloprotease-3 (stromelysin-1) (MMP-1 and -3) expression in cultured skin fibroblasts, suggesting a role of IL-10 in the breakdown and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (28Reitamo S. Remitz A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2489-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast, exogenous IL-10 inhibits synthesis of MMP-9 (92-kDa gelatinase) and blocks LPS-stimulated MMP-1 expression by human macrophages while it stimulates their TIMP-1 production (29Lacraz S. Nicod L.P. Chicheportiche R. Welgus H.G. Dayer J.-M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings suggest fibrogenic effects of IL-10 on macrophages, which seem to oppose the aforementioned effects on fibroblasts. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time, induced expression of IL-10 by rat HSC upon activation in vitro by culturing on plastic dish and in vivo by cholestatic liver injury. IL-10 expression by HSC is up-regulated by TNF-α and TGF-β1 in vitro and induced conspicuously during the early phase of cholestatic injury followed by a disappearance of the induction at the late fibrogenic phase. In vitro neutralization experiments demonstrate autocrine stimulation of interstitial collagenase expression and inhibition of α1(I) collagen expression by IL-10 in HSC, suggesting its role in initiation of matrix remodeling. Cholestatic liver injury was induced in male Wistar rats weighing 500–600 g by aseptic ligation and transection of the common bile duct (BDL) as described previously (30Tramas E.G. Symeonidis A. Am. J. Pathol. 1957; 33: 13-27PubMed Google Scholar). Another group of the rats was sham-operated to serve as controls (Sham). The animal protocol described in this study was approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee of the University of Southern California. HSC were isolated from normal male Wistar rats, BDL, and Sham animals by in situ digestion of the liver and arabinogalactan gradient ultracentrifugation as reported previously (31Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ohata M. Lin M. Satre M. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G589-G596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purity and the viability of the cells from all animals exceeded 98 and 97%, respectively. The cells from normal rats were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum in 24-well plates for 5–6 days after isolation. For experiments testing effects of TNF-α (0.1–10 ng/ml), TGF-β (0.1–10 ng/ml), LPS (1–100 μg/ml), and anti-IL-10 IgG (20 μg/ml), the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and incubated with serum-free RPMI and test substances for 42 h. TNF-α, TGF-β, and goat anti-mouse IL-10 IgG were purchased from R & D System (Minneapolis, MN), and LPS and non-immune goat IgG were from Sigma. Total RNA was extracted from freshly isolated and cultured cells by a method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, total RNA was reverse-transcribed using 600 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) at 37 °C for 60 min. The synthesized cDNA for IL-10, interstitial collagenase, α1(I) collagen, and β-actin were amplified using specific sets of primers designed from published cDNA sequences (34Goodman R.E. Oblak J. Bell R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6210-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) as follow: IL-10, CTGGCTCAGCACTGCTAT and ATTCATGGCCTTGTAGACAC; rat interstitial collagenase, CGAACACTCAAATGGTCCCA and TCCACATGGTTGGGAAGTTC; collagen α1(I), ACAGCACGCTTGTGGAT and GTCTTCAAGCAAGAGGACCA; β-actin, GAGCTATGAGCTGCCTGACG and AGCACTTGCGGTCCACGATG. A competitive template containing the specific primer sequences for IL-10 was constructed using a PCR MIMIC™ (CLONTECH). For competitive PCR, sample cDNA was amplified in the presence of the increasing amount of the competitor (5 × 10−21 to 1.6 × 10−19 mol). The mRNA quantity was assessed by calculating the amount of the competitor added to achieve an equimolar amount of the PCR products of the competitor and IL-10. The 475-bp IL-10 cDNA fragment generated by PCR was isolated from 1.5% agarose gel with an elution buffer (0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0). The eluted cDNA was ligated into a PCR™ vector from a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). After a large scale plasmid preparation, the sequence of the cDNA was determined by the chain termination method (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A partialEcoRI fragment (326 bp) of the cDNA insert was purified from agarose gel as described above and used as a probe for Northern blot hybridization. For Northern blot analysis for IL-10, 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to nylon filter (Micron Separations, Westboro, MA) as described (31Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar). The 326-bp IL-10 cDNA fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Prehybridization, hybridization, washing, and autoradiography were performed as described previously (31Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalent RNA loading was confirmed by rehybridization of the filter for 18 S rRNA. For determination of the IL-10 concentration in the HSC culture medium, the media from three wells were combined, dialyzed, lyophilized, and analyzed for IL-10 using a mouse IL-10 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Quantikine™, R & D Systems). To detect IL-10 in HSC, Western blot analysis was performed. Freshly isolated HSC were subjected to protein extraction using a 2 × lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol). Samples (100 μg of protein per each sample) were separated by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad). The filters were first treated with 10% non-fat milk in 20 mmTris base, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated with goat polyclonal anti-mouse IL-10 antibodies (R & D Systems) at 1:300 dilution in TBST with 1% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies (1:2000) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The immobilized IL-10-antibody complex was detected by chemiluminescence using ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). To examine whether neutralization of IL-10 produced by HSC affects collagen production, the cultured cells were incubated for 48 h with serum-free RPMI with ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) and β-aminopropionitrile fumarate (50 μg/ml) in the presence of anti-IL-10 IgG or nonimmune IgG (20 μg/ml) and incubated with [2,3,4,5-3H]proline (10 μCi/ml) for the last 18 h to radiolabel newly synthesized collagen (3Matsuoka M. Pham N.-T. Tsukamoto H. Liver. 1989; 9: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The cell and media proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Collagen production was determined by a collagenase digestion method (37Peterkofsky B. Diegelmann R. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). To examine whether IL-10 has any effects on collagen gene promoter activity, cultured HSC after the first passage were transiently co-transfected with a collagen reporter gene plasmid (pGLCO2 or pGLCO3) (38Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar) and a murine sense or antisense IL-10 expression vector (39Feng L. Tang W.W. Chang J.C.C. Wilson C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. Lili Feng at the Scripps Research Institute. The collagen reporter gene, pGLCO2, contains 2200 bp of the murine α1(I) collagen gene 5′-flanking region linked to the luciferase reporter gene, while pGLCOL3 contains 220 bp of α1(I) collagen gene 5′-flanking region. Liposomes were prepared using 3 μg of a reporter gene plasmid and 5 μg of the expression vector along with 32 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were incubated with the liposomes for 8 h, the liposome mixture removed, and fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum added. The cells were incubated for additional 36 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for luciferase assay as described previously (38Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar). All data are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance for the difference between the groups was assessed using standard t test. For quantification of competitive RT-PCR data, a linear regression analysis was performed between the concentration of the competitive template used in the assay and the ratio of densitometric results for the competitor product over than of the target gene product. RT-PCR analysis of RNA from freshly isolated HSC from normal rats showed no detectable product for IL-10 using 35 cycles of amplification (first lane, Fig.1 (upper panel)). However, HSC cultured on plastic wells for 7 days showed an increase in IL-10 mRNA as indicated by a detectable PCR product (second lane, Fig. 1 (upper panel)). Furthermore, incubation of HSC with TNF-α or TGF-β, cytokines known to stimulate HSC (3Matsuoka M. Pham N.-T. Tsukamoto H. Liver. 1989; 9: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), caused further increases in IL-10 mRNA (lane 3–8, Fig.1 (upper panel)). Semiquantitative analyses of the RT-PCR results were performed by scanning densitometry of the IL-10 PCR product and standardization with β-actin results (Fig. 1, lower panel). These analyses show 2-fold increases in IL-10 mRNA expression by TGF-β (10 ng/ml) or TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and a 50% increase by LPS (10 μg/ml). To assess the levels of IL-10 released by cultured HSC following treatment with several agonists, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed on the medium samples (Table I). No detectable IL-10 was measured in the medium from untreated HSC. However, TNF-α, TGF-β, and LPS all stimulated IL-10 release by HSC.Table IIL-10 released by cultured HSC in response to agonistsConditionIL-10ExperimentMean ± S.E.1234pg/wellpg/wellTNF-α (10 ng/ml)16.5633.9528.2228.7726.88 ± 3.671-ap < 0.05.TGF-β (10 ng/ml)17.311.4613.2314.5614.14 ± 1.231-ap < 0.05.LPS (10 μg/ml)4.6ND1-bND, not determined.13.8918.7312.41 ± 4.151-cp = 0.09.ControlUD1-dUD, undetected.UDUDUDUD1-a p < 0.05.1-b ND, not determined.1-c p = 0.09.1-d UD, undetected. Open table in a new tab To determine whether IL-10 is expressed by HSC during the course of cholestatic liver injury, HSC were isolated from rats at 2, 7, and 19 days after bile duct ligation or sham operation, and RT-PCR was performed on HSC RNA samples for detection of IL-10 mRNA (Fig.2). Sham HSC show undetectable or minimal IL-10 mRNA levels at each time point. In contrast, HSC from BDL show a distinct increase in IL-10 mRNA at 2 days, which was further accentuated at 7 days. Interestingly, this induction of IL-10 mRNA expression was completely abrogated at 19 days. To quantitatively assess the induction at 7 days, competitive PCR was performed using a specifically constructed competitive template. As shown in theupper panel of Fig.3 A, addition of an increasing amount of the competitor (from right to left) resulted in a progressive reduction in the level of IL-10 PCR product from the Sham sample while reciprocally raising the level of the competitor product. For the BDL samples, which are expected to have much lower levels, 40 cycles of amplification was used. Even though the level of IL-10 product was still lower, the similarly effective competition by the competitor was shown but with the amounts of the competitor that were approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than those used for Sham. Linear regression analysis was performed for three pairs of competitive PCR data (Fig. 3 B). As predicted, the level of IL-10 mRNA in 7-day BDL HSC was 100-fold higher than that in Sham HSC.Figure 3A, representative data for IL-10 competitive PCR for HSC from rats at 7 days after bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham operation (Sham). As shown in this example, addition of an IL-10 competitor concentration-dependently suppressed the level of IL-10 PCR product while it increased the level of the competitor product in both samples from Sham and BDL animals. However, the BDL sample required higher concentrations of the competitor to suppress generation of IL-10 product than the Sham sample, indicating the higher IL-10 mRNA level in the BDL sample. B, data from three sets of competitive PCR were plotted and a linear regression analysis was performed. Arrows indicate the estimated levels of IL-10 mRNA as determined by the concentration of the competitor, which achieved generation of the equal amount of IL-10 and competitor products (the ratio of IL-10 over competitor product = 1). Note the estimated increase in IL-10 mRNA in BDL HSC is 100-fold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify that the PCR product detected was truly a IL-10 cDNA fragment, we subcloned the product into a TA vector and sequenced a partialEcoRI fragment (326 bp) following a large scale plasmid preparation and cDNA purification. The sequence of the fragment showed a perfect match with the published nucleotide sequence of rat IL-10 cDNA (34Goodman R.E. Oblak J. Bell R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), demonstrating that our PCR indeed detected IL-10 mRNA in HSC. Furthermore, we have utilized the purified 326-bp IL-10 cDNA fragment as a probe to perform Northern blot analysis on HSC RNA samples. Northern blot analysis clearly confirmed prominent induction of IL-10 mRNA expression in HSC from 7-day BDL as compared with corresponding Sham (Fig.4). Western blot analysis was performed to examine whether IL-10 protein level is coordinately increased in HSC from 7-day BDL (Fig.5). The analysis detected an immunoreactive band with a distinct increased intensity in BDL (last two lanes), which corresponded to the molecular size (17 kDa) of authentic recombinant mouse IL-10 standard (first lane). As an internal control, desmin was immunoblotted using the same samples, which showed the relatively similar immunoreactivity between the two groups of the samples (bottom panel). We were very intrigued by the time-dependent induction of IL-10 in HSC at 7 days in BDL animals. Since recent studies suggested regulation of collagen and collagenase genes by IL-10 in other cell types (28Reitamo S. Remitz A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2489-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 29Lacraz S. Nicod L.P. Chicheportiche R. Welgus H.G. Dayer J.-M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), we examined α1(I) collagen and interstitial collagenase mRNA expression in the same HSC RNA samples used for IL-10 RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2,lower two panels). Induction of interstitial collagenase mRNA expression was shown to coincide with that of IL-10 at 7 days as was the disappearance of induction of both genes at 19 days. On the contrary, marked induction of α1(I) collagen expression occurred when IL-10 expression ceased at 19 days. The above results suggested a possible link between IL-10 expression by activated HSC and matrix homeostasis. To examine this possibility, collagen production was assessed by incorporation of [3H]proline with cultured HSC exposed to TGF-β (10 ng/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), and LPS (10 μg/ml) in the presence of anti-IL-10 IgG or nonimmune IgG (Fig. 6). The addition of anti-IL-10 IgG alone caused a 50% increase in basal collagen production. TGF-β-mediated stimulation of collagen production was doubled by the addition of the antibodies. Even though TNF-α or LPS alone did not increase collagen production, concomitant IL-10 neutralization resulted in significant enhancements in collagen synthesis. These results clearly demonstrate an inhibitory autocrine effect of IL-10 on collagen synthesis by culture-activated HSC. To investigate mechanisms underlying the observed inhibitory role of IL-10 in HSC collagen production, we have examined effects of IL-10 neutralization on mRNA expression of α1(I) collagen and interstitial collagenase by cultured HSC. Exposure of HSC to TNF-α (10 ng/ml) or LPS (10 μg/ml) stimulated mRNA expression of collagenase (Fig. 7,upper left panel). However, addition of anti-IL-10 IgG clearly suppressed these stimulatory effects (Fig. 7, upper right panel). TGF-β (10 ng/ml) stimulated α1(I) collagen mRNA expression in cultured HSC and LPS marginally showed the effect (Fig.7, upper panel). Addition of anti-IL-10 antibodies further promoted the increases in α1(I) collagen mRNA levels in TGF-β- or LPS-stimulated HSC (Fig. 7, upper panel). Densitometric data from at least three sets of experiments were standardized with β-actin results and statistically compared between the different treatments (Fig. 7, lower panel). Addition of anti-IL-10 antibodies slightly, but significantly, reduced basal interstitial collagenase mRNA expression. Furthermore, it suppressed an increase in interstitial collagenase mRNA levels induced by TNF-α and LPS (Fig. 7, lower left panel). On the contrary, IL-10 neutralization significantly enhanced by 2-fold the increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by HSC exposed to TGF-β and LPS (Fig. 7,lower right panel). These results suggested that IL-10 secreted by culture-activated HSC not only induces basal expression of collagenase but also mediates up-regulation of collagenase expression caused by TNF-α and LPS. At the same time, IL-10 expression induced by TGF-β and LPS appears to exert an inhibitory effect on α1(I) collagen expression. To examine whether the observed inhibitory effect of IL-10 on collagen expression is mediated via its effect at transcriptional level, transient co-transfections were performed using an IL-10 expression vector (sense or antisense) with an α1(I) collagen promoter-luciferase construct (pGLCO2 or pGLCO3). As compared with transfection with the antisense IL-10 expression vector, collagen promoter activity was inhibited 40% with the sense IL-10 expression vector (Fig.8). This suggests that IL-10's negative autoregulatory effects on HSC collagen expression is mediated at least in part via its transcriptonal inhibition of collagen gene. The present study is the first to demonstrate that HSC express IL-10 upon their activation in vivo and in vitro. HSC are considered as pericytes in the liver (40Pinzani M. Pailli P. Ruocco C. Casini A. Milani S. Baldi E. Giotti A. Gentilini P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 193-203Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which are also known to serve as principal cells to participate in liver fibrogenesis via their myofibroblastic activation (1Friedman S.L. Boyer J.L. Ocker R.K. Progress in Liver Diseases. 14. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 101-130Google Scholar). A recent report demonstrated expression of IL-10 by mesangial cells, the pericytes in the glomerulus, which are incriminated as the major source of fibroproliferative responses in glomerulonephritis (41Fuoqueray B. Boutard V. Philippe C. Kornreich A. Marcharnt A. Perez J. Goldman M. Baud L. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 176-182PubMed Google Scholar). Since HSC and mesangial cells are considered analogous due to their similar functionality and pathophysiologic roles, we hypothesized that HSC may express IL-10. Our results demonstrate IL-10 is expressed by HSC upon activation in culture and during the early stage of biliary liver injury. Our RT-PCR specificity was verified by sequencing of the IL-10 PCR product, with which we further confirmed induced mRNA expression via Northern blot analysis. Western blot analysis of HSC protein extracts revealed a prominently expressed 17-kDa IL-10 protein at 7 days after BDL, and the cultured HSC were shown to express and release IL-10 in response to TNF-α, TGF-β, and LPS. Our previous work showed enhanced expression of TNF-α by hepatic macrophages at 1 and 2 weeks after BDL but an almost complete disappearance of such induction at 3 weeks (42Lin M. Rippe R.A. Niemela O. Brittenham G. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1355-G1364PubMed Google Scholar). Since our in vitro experiment demonstrates induction of IL-10 in HSC by TNF-α, it may be assumed that macrophage-derived TNF-α in the liver might have induced IL-10 expression by HSC in the time-dependent manner in the BDL model. However, the concomitant induction (7 days) and repression (19 days) of macrophage TNF-α and HSC IL-10 expression in this in vivo model also suggest IL-10 derived from HSC may not function as an anti-inflammatory cytokine toward hepatic macrophages. This assumption led us to think of other biological significance that HSC-derived IL-10 may possesses in the liver. To this end, we were intrigued by recent studies that showed IL-10-mediated regulation of the genes involved in matrix remodeling and homeostasis such as MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and α1(I) collagen in skin fibroblasts (28Reitamo S. Remitz A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2489-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and macrophages (29Lacraz S. Nicod L.P. Chicheportiche R. Welgus H.G. Dayer J.-M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Indeed, our culture study clearly demonstrates IL-10 released by HSC suppresses their collagen production and this effect is mediated at least in part by transcriptional inhibition of collagen gene and enhanced expression of interstitial collagenase. These findings suggest a negative autoregulatory role of IL-10 in HSC collagen production in matrix remodeling. In support of this view, our in vivo data reveals concomitant induction of IL-10 and interstitial collagenase in HSC during the early stage of cholestatic liver fibrosis (7 days after BDL) and the lack of HSC IL-10 expression in association with marked α1(I) collagen induction in advanced liver fibrosis at 19 days. This raises an intriguing secondary hypothesis that the failure of HSC to continue their expression of IL-10 may underlie progressive fibrogenesis leading to liver cirrhosis. Interplay between soluble factors of paracrine and autocrine sources is complex in regulation of HSC biology. Among several cytokines implicated in activation of HSC, TGF-β is considered a potent fibrogenic cytokine that seems capable of conferring HSC most aspects of cellular activation (3Matsuoka M. Pham N.-T. Tsukamoto H. Liver. 1989; 9: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Davis B.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Bachem M.G.

Cell Res. 1997; 231 (326): 328Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This cytokine can be released by hepatic macrophages (9Matsuoka M. Tsukamoto H. Hepatology. 1990; 11: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) or HSC by themselves (15Bachem M.G. Meyer D. Melchio R. Sell K.M. Gressner A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and the paracrine and autocrine interaction can be established via its ability to autoinduce its expression (15Bachem M.G. Meyer D. Melchio R. Sell K.M. Gressner A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In our in vitro study, TGF-β induced IL-10 in cultured HSC. However, IL-10 induction was abolished in HSC at 19 days after BDL despite HSC (43Ohata M. Lin M. Satre M. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G589-G596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hepatic macrophages 2S. C. Wang, M. Ohata, M. Lin, and H. Tsukamoto, unpublished observation. continue to express TGF-β1 at this time point in this model. Thus, unlike the close in vivo association between IL-10 and TNF-α expression in the BDL model, this dissociation of IL-10 and TGF-β expression suggests complex regulation of IL-10 expression by TGF-β. Another discrepancy noted in the present study was the continued induction of IL-10 expression by culture-activated HSC as compared with the time-dependent induction seen in vivo. This obviously suggests cellular or molecular differences in in vitro and in vivo activated HSC or reflects the absence of other in vivo factors that may cause the time-dependent expression in the culture system. It is attractive to speculate that these factors may be derived from other cell types in the liver including hepatic macrophages. Additional studies are obviously needed to test this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2144372083,"The reversible oxidative inactivation of transcription factors has been proposed to be important in cellular responses to oxidant stress and in several signal transduction pathways. The nuclear factor I (NFI) family of transcription factors is sensitive to oxidative inactivation due to the presence of a conserved, oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue within the NFI DNA-binding domain. Here we show that restoration of the DNA-binding activity of oxidized NFI-C can be catalyzed in vitro by the cellular enzyme thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) coupled to GSH and GSSG reductase. To test whether GSH-dependent pathways play a role in the maintenance of NFI activity in vivo, we used buthionine sulfoximine, an agent that inhibits GSH synthesis, and N-acetylcysteine, an agent that can replenish intracellular GSH. Pretreatment of HeLa cells with buthionine sulfoximine greatly potentiated the inactivation of NFI by the oxidizing agent diamide. Inclusion of N-acetylcysteine in the culture medium during the recovery period following diamide treatment increased the extent of restoration of NFI activity. These results suggest that maintenance of the DNA-binding activity of NFI proteins during oxidant stress in vivo requires a GSH-dependent pathway, likely involving thioltransferase-catalyzed reduction of the oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue on NFI. The reversible oxidative inactivation of transcription factors has been proposed to be important in cellular responses to oxidant stress and in several signal transduction pathways. The nuclear factor I (NFI) family of transcription factors is sensitive to oxidative inactivation due to the presence of a conserved, oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue within the NFI DNA-binding domain. Here we show that restoration of the DNA-binding activity of oxidized NFI-C can be catalyzed in vitro by the cellular enzyme thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) coupled to GSH and GSSG reductase. To test whether GSH-dependent pathways play a role in the maintenance of NFI activity in vivo, we used buthionine sulfoximine, an agent that inhibits GSH synthesis, and N-acetylcysteine, an agent that can replenish intracellular GSH. Pretreatment of HeLa cells with buthionine sulfoximine greatly potentiated the inactivation of NFI by the oxidizing agent diamide. Inclusion of N-acetylcysteine in the culture medium during the recovery period following diamide treatment increased the extent of restoration of NFI activity. These results suggest that maintenance of the DNA-binding activity of NFI proteins during oxidant stress in vivo requires a GSH-dependent pathway, likely involving thioltransferase-catalyzed reduction of the oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue on NFI. Modulation of DNA-binding activity by oxidation and reduction reactions (redox regulation) has been demonstrated for a number of transcription factors, including NF-κB/Rel proteins, Fos and Jun proteins, and others (1Abate C.

A. 1992; 89: 7531-7535Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mechanism of oxidative inactivation of DNA binding is through the oxidation of specific cysteine residues close to or within the DNA-binding domains of these proteins. This modulation of the DNA-binding activity of transcription factors by redox state has been proposed to be important both in cellular response to oxidant stress and in a number of signal transduction pathways including those mediated by tumor necrosis factor α (7Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar, 8Kalebic T. Kinter A. Poli G. Anderson M.E. Meister A. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). While the process of oxidative inactivation of DNA binding has been studied extensively in vitro, the biochemical pathways that mediate the reversible oxidation of oxidation-sensitive cysteine residues are only poorly understood. We are using the NFI 1The abbreviations used are: NFI, nuclear factor I; TTase, thioltransferase; GMSA, gel mobility shift assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine. family of transcription factors as a model system to characterize the pathways for reversible oxidative inactivation of DNA-binding proteins in vitro and in vivo. The NFI family of site-specific DNA-binding proteins is required both for adenovirus DNA replication and for the expression of a large number of cellular and viral genes (9Nagata K. Guggenheimer R. Enomoto T. Lichy J. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6438-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Leegwater P.A.J. van Driel W. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, this family of proteins is encoded by four distinct genes (NFI-A, NFI-B, NFI-C, and NFI-X), and the expression patterns of the four genes are regulated during cell differentiation and development (12Kulkarni S. Gronostajski R.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 501-510PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We had shown previously that the DNA-binding activity of the NFI family of transcription factors was inactivated by oxidation in vitro(14Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sensitivity to oxidation requires the presence of a single oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue that is conserved within the DNA-binding domains of all NFI proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. Mutation of this oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue creates NFI proteins with apparently normal DNA-binding activity, but the DNA binding of the mutant proteins is not sensitive to oxidative inactivation in vitro. The dispensability of this residue for DNA binding, together with its phylogenetic conservation in the DNA-binding domain of all NFI proteins, suggests a potential regulatory function for this oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue. An analogous situation for regulation by cysteine modification exists for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease, which has two highly conserved cysteine residues that are not required for basal activity; however, modification of these cysteines, e.g. by glutathionylation, alters the activity of the protease in a reversible fashion (15Davis D.A.

If the modulation of DNA-binding activity by redox state is a regulated physiological process, we would anticipate that specific cellular proteins would mediate the oxidation and reduction of oxidation-sensitive cysteine residues on DNA-binding proteins. Indeed, there are two classes of proteins in mammalian cells that have been shown to mediate the reduction of oxidation-sensitive cysteine residues on DNA-binding proteins in vitro. Studies from several laboratories have demonstrated that the bifunctional HAP1/Ref-1 protein can reactivate oxidized Fos/Jun proteins in vitro (17Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 18Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Black E. Gillespie D. Hickson I.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5370-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This redox activity is present in the N-terminal domain of HAP1/Ref-1 and is separate from the C-terminal domain of HAP1/Ref-1 that mediates repair of DNA damage (19Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Also, the cellular reducing protein thioredoxin has been shown to reactivate oxidized NF-κB in vitro (2Matthews J. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.-L. Yodoi J. Hay R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 3Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thioredoxin was first discovered as the protein that provided reducing equivalents to ribonucleotide reductase and has been shown to mediate the reduction of a number of intracellular proteins (20Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) has also been shown to catalyze the reactivation of many oxidatively modified proteins. In particular, we found that thioltransferase (TTase) is specific for protein-glutathione mixed disulfides (protein-SSG) (21Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar), and the catalytic intermediate TTase-SSG is selectively recycled to the reduced enzyme by GSH (23Srinivasan U. Mieyal P.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), with formation of GSSG and regeneration of GSH by coupling with NADPH and GSSG reductase. These characteristic interactions of thioltransferase with glutathione distinguish it from thioredoxin, which favors intramolecular disulfide substrates and is turned over by NADPH and thioredoxin reductase, independently of glutathione. Since oxidation of the single cysteine residue on NFI in the presence of GSH likely forms NFI-SSG in vitro or in vivo, we tested the ability of thioltransferase to restore the DNA-binding activity of NFI that was oxidized by diamide in the presence of GSH. Here we report that thioltransferase can reactivate oxidized NFI protein in vitro in a GSH-dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrate that treatment with buthionine sulfoximine, a known inhibitor of GSH synthesis (24Chang M. Naik S. Johanning G.L. Ho L. Patel M.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4263-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), potentiates the oxidative inactivation of NFI in cultured HeLa cells and that inclusion ofN-acetylcysteine (precursor of intracellular GSH) in the culture medium during the recovery period following diamide treatment increases the extent of restoration of the DNA-binding activity of NFI. These findings suggest an important role for thioltransferase and intracellular GSH in the reduction of oxidation-sensitive cysteine residues in the NFI family of transcription factors and potentially other site-specific DNA-binding proteins. Construction of the pET220 vectors that express the NH2-terminal 220 amino acids of wild-type or mutant human NFI-C from a T7 promoter was described previously (25Novak A. Goyal N. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12986-12990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the NFI proteins expressed contain a hexahistidine tag fused to the N terminus of the human NFI-C protein. Expression of wild-type and mutant NFI proteins in Escherichia coli cells and preparation of bacterial extracts were as described (14Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NFI proteins were purified by absorption to phosphocellulose equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes, 10% sucrose, 350 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm DTT and eluted with the same buffer containing 1.0–1.5 m NaCl. The final purification step was achieved by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography as described previously (14Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Protein preparations were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, determined to be >90% pure by silver staining (Bio-Rad), and quantified using bovine serum albumin as a standard. NFI DNA-binding activity was determined by GMSAs with purified recombinant proteins or extracts of nuclei using the 32P-labeled FIB-2.6 oligonucleotide or a control mutant oligonucleotide (FIB-2.6C2) as described (25Novak A. Goyal N. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12986-12990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FIB-2.6 oligonucleotide contains a well characterized NFI-binding site cloned previously from human genomic DNA, whereas the FIB-2.6C2 oligonucleotide has a single point mutation that reduces NFI binding >100-fold in vitro. The inactivation of NFI DNA-binding activity by the oxidizing agent diamide and the reactivation by reducing agents or the TTase-reducing system were performed as indicated in the figure legends. NFI·DNA complexes were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Model 400 PhosphorImager. Thioltransferase was purified from human red blood cells as described (27Mieyal J.J. Starke D.W. Gravina S.A. Dothey C. Chung J.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6088-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and recombinant human thioltransferase was purified from E. coli (28Chrestensen C.A. Eckman C.B. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); both sources of the enzyme display the same catalytic characteristics (28Chrestensen C.A. Eckman C.B. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and are used interchangeably. One unit of thioltransferase is defined as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the glutathione-dependent reduction of 1 μmol of cysteinylglutathione disulfide/min under standard assay conditions in which GSSG formation is coupled to NADPH oxidation by GSSG reductase (21Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 28Chrestensen C.A. Eckman C.B. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reactivation of the DNA-binding activity of oxidized NFI was demonstrated with purified human thioltransferase isolated in both ways. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 10–12.5% gels as described previously (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). For immunodetection, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.) and probed with an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the amino-terminal NFI-C220 peptide acetyl-DEFHPFIEALLC. The NFI proteins were detected by chemiluminescence as described (14Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To induce oxidative stress, cells were treated with 10 mm diamide at 37 °C for 15–30 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline as described in the figure legends. Subsequent recovery of the cells was performed for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (25 μg/ml). To deplete the cells of glutathione, cells were incubated with 100 μm buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) for 48 h. BSO blocks the synthesis of glutathione by inhibiting the enzyme γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (24Chang M. Naik S. Johanning G.L. Ho L. Patel M.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4263-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). More than 90% of the cells were viable under this condition. Cells were treated with diamide as described above and allowed to recover from oxidant stress in the presence and absence of 25 mm N-acetylcysteine. For the preparation of nuclear extracts, the cells were scraped into cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. The cells were lysed, and nuclear extracts were prepared in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 0.35 m NaCl as described previously (30Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our earlier study showed that Cys-3 present in the DNA-binding domain of all NFI proteins was sensitive to oxidation and chemical modification in vitro (14Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation inactivates the DNA-binding activity of NFI, and subsequent treatment with the nonphysiological reducing agent DTT restores the binding activity. Since GSH is a major intracellular redox buffer and is believed to play a role in the maintenance of reduced sulfhydryl groups on proteinsin vivo (31Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9397-9400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether reduced GSH alone could restore the DNA-binding activity of the oxidized NFI-C220 proteinin vitro in comparison with the nonphysiological reducing agents DTT and β-mercaptoethanol. As shown previously, purified NFI-C220 binds specifically to the FIB-2.6 oligonucleotide, which contains a consensus NFI-binding site (Fig.1, lane 2). Treatment of NFI-C220 in vitro with 1 mm diamide abolished the DNA-binding activity (Fig. 1, lane 3). As expected, this inactivation was reversed when the oxidized NFI protein was further incubated with a 5-fold molar excess of the nonphysiological reducing agent DTT (Fig. 1, lane 4) or β-mercaptoethanol (lane 5). However, a 5-fold molar excess of GSH failed to reactivate oxidized NFI under these conditions (Fig. 1, lane 6), and GSSG also had no effect, as expected (lane 7). The lack of an effect of GSH alone in reactivating oxidized NFI-C220 is similar to observations with other sulfhydryl proteins whose activities are inhibited by oxidation and not restored by GSH alone. For example, oxidatively inactivated phosphofructokinase and glutathioneS-transferase are not reactivated by GSH unless thioltransferase is also present (22Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar), indicating that rapid reactivation requires enzyme catalysis. Thioltransferases have long been implicated in the maintenance of sensitive intracellular thiols and the reduction of protein disulfides (22Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar). To determine whether TTase can regenerate the DNA-binding activity of oxidized NFI, NFI protein was treated with diamide, diluted in the presence of GSH to quench the diamide, and then incubated in the absence or presence of thioltransferase. As shown previously, the DNA-binding activity was abolished when NFI was oxidized with diamide (Fig. 2, lane 3 versus lane 1). With subsequent incubation in the presence of a 4-fold molar excess of GSH alone or GSH plus NADPH and GSSG reductase, a low level of binding activity was restored (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 7, respectively). This limited reactivation by GSH at 30 °C was not observed when the incubation was performed at 4 °C (Fig. 1, lane 6). A much greater restoration of DNA-binding activity was seen when oxidized NFI was incubated with thioltransferase in the presence of GSH and the GSH-regenerating system (Fig. 2,lane 6). This increased reactivation required both TTase and the regenerating system since incubation with either component alone produced levels of DNA-binding activity similar to that seen with GSH alone (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). The extent of NFI reactivation by TTase was only slightly less than that obtained with the nonphysiological reducing agent DTT (Fig. 2, lane 5). In the absence of oxidation, GSH had no effect on the binding activity of NFI (Fig. 2, lane 2), and as expected TTase, did not affect the DNA-binding activity of either the non-oxidized wild type or the oxidation-resistant Cys-3 mutants of NFI (data not shown). These data indicate that TTase, in the presence of GSH and a GSH-regenerating system, can effectively reactivate the DNA-binding activity of diamide-oxidized NFI. On a molar basis, thioltransferase (0.7 μm) is at least 3000-fold more efficient than GSH alone (2 mm) and 1200-fold better than DTT (1 mm) in effecting NFI reactivation under the same conditions. For a more detailed analysis of TTase-mediated reactivation of oxidized NFI, we measured the time course and TTase concentration dependence of NFI reactivation (Fig. 3). TTase greatly accelerated the rate of reactivation of oxidized NFI, reaching an apparent plateau within 5 min, whereas the reactivation of NFI by GSH either alone or with a GSH-regenerating system was much slower and was incomplete even after 30 min (Fig. 3 and data not shown). During a brief 5-min incubation, increasing the amount of TTase increased the extent of NFI reactivation (Fig. 3, inset). These results indicate that TTase, in the presence of GSH and a GSH-regenerating system, increases the rate of reactivation of oxidized NFI compared with GSH either alone or with a GSH-regenerating system. Previously, we had shown that the DNA-binding activity of NFI is inactivated by oxidation in vitro (14Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the DNA-binding activity of NFI is sensitive to oxidative inactivation in intact cells, we measured NFI DNA-binding activity in extracts of HeLa cells treated with diamide (Fig. 4). HeLa cells (<50% confluent) were cultured in the presence of 10 mm diamide and harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown previously (30Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), nuclear extracts from untreated HeLa cells yielded multiple specific NFI·DNA complexes (Fig. 4, lane 4). NFI DNA-binding activity was reduced by >75% after diamide treatment of HeLa cells for 30 min (Fig. 4, lane 5). When the diamide-treated HeLa cells were washed and cultured for a further 2-h recovery period in the absence of diamide, there was an ∼2-fold increase in NFI DNA-binding activity (Fig. 4, lane 6), but the level of binding activity remained below that seen in control cells. This partial restoration of NFI DNA-binding activity appears to be independent of protein synthesis since incubation of HeLa cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide during the recovery period had little or no effect (Fig. 4, lane 7). As expected, incubation of HeLa cells with cycloheximide in the absence of diamide had little or no effect on NFI DNA-binding activity (Fig. 4,lane 8). Since intracellular glutathione is a major redox buffer in cells and a known substrate for thioltransferase (21Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar, 23Srinivasan U. Mieyal P.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and may protect proteins from oxidative inactivation (31Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9397-9400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the potential role of glutathione in the oxidative inactivation and subsequent recovery of NFI DNA-binding activity. HeLa cells were cultured with two agents known to affect the levels of intracellular glutathione, BSO and N-acetylcysteine. BSO reduces intracellular GSH levels by inhibition of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, whereasN-acetylcysteine can increase GSH levels by providing a high intracellular concentration of cysteine, a precursor of GSH (24Chang M. Naik S. Johanning G.L. Ho L. Patel M.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4263-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in the presence and absence of BSO orN-acetylcysteine as described under “Materials and Methods.” BSO treatment alone had no affect on the level of NFI DNA-binding activity present in the nuclear extracts from HeLa cells (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 5). However, upon treatment with diamide, cells cultured in the presence of BSO had a greatly potentiated inactivation of NFI DNA-binding activity compared with control cells (Fig. 5, lane 6 versus lane 2). As shown previously, a partial restoration of NFI DNA-binding activity occurred in the BSO- and diamide-treated cells during a subsequent 2-h recovery period (Fig. 5, lane 7). This partial restoration of NFI DNA-binding activity was more pronounced when N-acetylcysteine was present in the culture medium during the recovery period (Fig. 5, lane 8). In this experiment, diamide treatment of the control HeLa cells caused only a 40% reduction in NFI DNA-binding activity, which showed little or no recovery during subsequent incubation in the presence or absence ofN-acetylcysteine (Fig. 5, lanes 2–4). We have observed that the extent of NFI inactivation by diamide and the subsequent recovery of activity appear to be cell density-dependent and that little or no reactivation of binding occurs unless >70% inactivation of NFI is achieved during the initial diamide treatment (data not shown). This apparent cell density dependence may be due to previously observed differences in GSH levels in low versus high density cells in actively growing cultures (33Mertens K. Rogiers V. Sonck W. Vercruysse A. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 565: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Shaw J.P. Chou I.N. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 129: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These results indicate that intracellular GSH levels may affect both the sensitivity of NFI to oxidative inactivation and the subsequent recovery of NFI DNA-binding activity after oxidant stress. While our previous study showed the existence of a highly conserved, oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue in the NFI family of transcription factors (14Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the physiological significance of the residue remained unclear. Here we demonstrate both that the in vitro oxidative inactivation of NFI-C can be reversed by treatment with the cellular enzyme thioltransferase (Figs. 2 and 3) and that NFI DNA-binding activity is subject to oxidative inactivation and reactivation in intact cells (Figs. 4 and 5). The inefficiency of GSH alone in reactivating oxidized NFI (Figs. 2 and 3), together with the potentiation of the oxidative inactivation of NFI in intact cells by treatment with an agent shown to deplete intracellular GSH (BSO) (Fig.5), suggests that GSH may be necessary for the protection and/or restoration of NFI DNA-binding activity in vivo, but it is probably not sufficient. Hence, the ability of TTase to catalyze GSH-dependent reactivation of NFI DNA-binding activityin vitro suggests that TTase may play an important role in the regulation of NFI function in vivo. Although the physiological functions of thioltransferase are not established, its catalytic activity implicates its involvement in homeostatic maintenance of intracellular thiols and regulation of receptors and enzymes (22Mieyal J.J.

In this context, pyruvate kinase, hemoglobin, phosphofructokinase, and glutathione S-transferase are examples of proteins that are inactivated under oxidizing conditions and reactivated by TTase in conjunction with GSH and GSSG reductase. We are uncertain of the nature of the oxidized cysteine residue on NFI that prevents DNA binding. Our previous study demonstrated that while the oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue could be replaced by a number of amino acid residues (Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, Leu, Ile, Val, and His) with retention of DNA-binding activity, replacement with the larger residues tryptophan and arginine abolished binding (14Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that either the addition of a large adduct due to mixed-disulfide formation with GSH or the formation of an intramolecular disulfide with one of the other essential cysteine residues on NFI could impair DNA binding. Since TTase has been shown to be highly selective for GSH-dependent reduction of protein-SSG substrates (21Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar), its catalytic effectiveness in reducing oxidized NFI in the presence of GSH is consistent with NFI-SSG being the actual substrate for TTase. This interpretation is based on extensive studies of TTase catalysis of GSH-dependent reduction of model protein mixed disulfides, including cysteinyl, cysteaminyl, and glutathionyl mixed disulfides of hemoglobin, papain, and bovine serum albumin (21Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar). In addition to the generation of mixed and intramolecular disulfides, the formation of stable sulfenic, sulfinic, or sulfonic acids by monothiol oxidation has also been proposed as a mechanism for the oxidative inactivation of a number of proteins (1Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J.I. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 17Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T.

In this context, in vitro treatments of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with H2O2 and tetrathionate and of phosphofructokinase with GSSG were designed to give glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-S-OH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-S-SO3−, and phosphofructokinase-SSG as the corresponding inactivated forms of the enzymes (39Yoshitake S. Nanri H. Fernando M.R. Minakami S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Comparison of equimolar amounts of TTase and thioredoxin near their physiological concentrations indicated that TTase was much more effective than thioredoxin for reactivating phosphofructokinase-SSG, as would be predicted from the substrate selectivity of TTase that we delineated (21Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar). Thioredoxin, however, was better for reactivating the two types (sulfenate and thiosulfate) of modified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (39Yoshitake S. Nanri H. Fernando M.R. Minakami S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By analogy to this comparison, it appears less likely that monothiol oxygenation plays a role in the oxidative inactivation of NFI. In other studies in which monothiol oxygenation has been proposed as a means of inactivation, the redox proteins thioredoxin (2Matthews J. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.-L. Yodoi J. Hay R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 3Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HAP1/Ref-1 (16Davis D.A. Newcomb F.M. Starke D.W. Ott D.E. Mieyal J.J. Yarchoan R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5370-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) were reported to effectively reactivate the oxidized proteins. In preliminary experiments, we did not observe reactivation of diamide-oxidized NFI with typical concentrations of the reduced form of either HAP1 or thioredoxin; however, broader studies are necessary to define the relative effectiveness of TTase and these other redox proteins (data not shown; proteins generously provided by Drs. I. Hickson and A. Gronenborn, respectively). The apparent differences in the protein requirements for the reductive reactivation of different intracellular proteins may reflect distinct biochemical pathways used to prevent or recover from oxidative stress. For example, E. coli encodes at least three different proteins capable of donating reducing equivalents to ribonucleotide reductase, each of which may also function in the reduction of oxidized intracellular proteins (40Aslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It will be necessary in the future to selectively deplete each of the known potential redox regulators in eukaryotic cells to assess their different functions and their potential for synergism in vivo. Our data demonstrate that NFI DNA-binding activity is sensitivein vivo to oxidative inactivation particularly under conditions of glutathione depletion (Fig. 5). However, it remains to be determined how glutathione participates in this process. Besides reacting directly with diamide or other oxidative mediators, GSH is likely to be incorporated into NFI molecules during oxidative stress to form NFI-SSG, and then the GSH would be removed by dethiolation by TTase. In fact, we have observed incorporation of [35S]GSH into NFI in the presence of diamide (data not shown). This observation is consistent with the fact that oxidant treatment of a broad variety of cells (hepatocytes, neutrophils, gastric mucosal cells, etc.) generally has produced35S-glutathionylated proteins (41Schuppe-Koistinen I.

Thomas J.A. Hendrich S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that S-thiolation during oxidative stress might protect particular proteins from irreversible damage (46Rokutan K. Johnston Jr., R.B. Kawai K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar, 47Lii C.K. Chai Y.C. Zhao W. Thomas J.A. Hendrich S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The oxidative inactivation of the DNA-binding activity of NFI in intact cells and the effects of the GSH modulators BSO and N-acetylcysteine (Figs. 4 and 5) suggest that inactivation of NFI can occur during oxidative stress in vivo, and the extent and duration of the changes in NFI activity would be dependent on the intracellular GSH status. For example, oxidative stress occurs in various physiological and pathological states, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, where it is believed to be the result of chronic exposure of the infected cells to inflammatory cytokines (48Roederer M. Ela S.W. Staal F.J. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The oxidative situation associated with the infection may fosterS-glutathionylation and concomitant modulation of the activity of viral proteins like the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease. In this regard, thioltransferase has been shown to display site selectivity in deglutathionylation of Cys-95 and Cys-67 of the protease (16Davis D.A. Newcomb F.M. Starke D.W. Ott D.E. Mieyal J.J. Yarchoan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25935-25940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Whether analogous conditions of oxidative stress can lead to the inactivation of NFI DNA-binding activity in situis under investigation. In addition, it would be of interest to see whether the oxidative inactivation of NFI family members occurs early in apoptosis since oxidative stress is believed to be an important event during apoptotic cell death (49Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar, 50Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B.

Future experiments involving expression of transfected cDNA for TTase may provide more direct evidence for a role of this enzyme in regenerating oxidatively damaged proteins in situ, including NFI and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease."
https://openalex.org/W2009342621,"We have demonstrated by affinity chromatography that hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) binds strongly to dermatan sulfate (DS), with a similar ionic strength dependence to that previously seen with heparan sulfate (HS). Analysis of binding kinetics on a biosensor yields an equilibrium dissociation constant,K D, of 19.7 nm. This corresponds to a 10–100-fold weaker interaction than that with HS, primarily due to a faster dissociation rate of the complex. The smallest DS oligosaccharide with significant affinity for HGF/SF by affinity chromatography appears to be an octasaccharide. A sequence comprising unsulfated iduronate residues in combination with 4-O-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine is sufficient for high affinity binding. The presence of 2-O-sulfation on the iduronate residues does not appear to be inhibitory. These observations concur with our previous suggestions, from analyses of HS binding (Lyon, M., Deakin, J.

Nakamura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). It acts in a paracrine manner, with the major secretors being fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, nonparenchymal liver cells, etc., whereas those cells that possess the requisite tyrosine kinase receptor (Met) are primarily epithelial and endothelial cells. Recent evidence suggests that multipotent and erythroid hemopoietic progenitor cells are also responsive to HGF/SF. The HGF/SF-Met system appears to operate primarily during the morphogenetic and differentiation events occurring in organogenesis, as well as in the repair of organ damage in the adult (reviewed in Ref.1Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of HGF/SF and/or Met has been strongly implicated in tumor progression, particularly in the acquisition of an invasive malignant phenotype (2Di Renzo M.F. Olivero M. Ferro S.

This presumably results from its ability to directly stimulate the growth and motility of tumor cells, as well as increasing the secretion of matrix-degrading proteases (6Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), thereby facilitating invasion of the surrounding stroma. Additionally, its potent angiogenic action (7Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M. Bochietto E. Olivero M. Naldini L. Gaudino G. Tamagnone L. Coffer A. Comoglio P.M. J.

In addition to Met, HGF/SF also interacts in vitro with the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (9Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter probably constitute the more abundant, but relatively lower affinity, HGF/SF-binding sites present on most cells (10Tajima H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The interaction of HGF/SF with cell surface HSPGs may facilitate its binding to Met and the subsequent activation of its tyrosine kinase activity (11Naka D. Ishii T. Shimomura T. Hishida T. Hara H.

The HGF/SF-binding site is present within the iduronate- and sulfate-rich domains of HS, and its structure has been partially elucidated (9Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J.

Additionally, the affinity of the HGF/SF-HS interaction is known to be high with a K D of 0.2–3 nm. 2H. Rahmoune, P. S. Rudland, J. T. Gallagher, and D. G. Fernig, submitted for publication. 2H. Rahmoune, P. S. Rudland, J. T. Gallagher, and D. G. Fernig, submitted for publication. Dermatan sulfate (DS), although biosynthetically unrelated and compositionally distinct from HS, nevertheless does possess some similar organizational features (for a review, see Ref. 17$$Google Scholar). DS contains N-acetylgalactosamine rather thanN-acetylglucosamine, and the glycosidic linkages are alternating α/β1→3 and β1→4, rather than all α/β1→4. However, both glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) possess iduronate-rich domains of variable length, formed by epimerization of glucuronates to iduronates, although in DS the adjacent hexosamines areN-acetylated rather than being specificallyN-sulfated (a prerequisite for epimerization in HS). Whereas, in DS, the iduronate-linked hexosamines are relatively uniformly O-sulfated on C-4, in HS, they can become 6-O-sulfated, but to a lesser extent. In both GAGs, additional sulfation can also occur at C-2 on the iduronates, although generally less frequently in DS. Overall, DS experiences much less additional sulfation within the iduronate-rich domains, compared with the glucuronate-rich sequences, than does HS, in which the great majority of the overall chain sulfation is concentrated in such domains. The parallel occurrence of contiguous sequences of iduronate and adjacent sulfated hexosamines in both types of GAG may help to explain why DS, unlike the iduronate-lacking chondroitin sulfates (CS), often interacts relatively weakly with many HS/heparin-binding proteins,e.g. basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (18Turnbull J.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14705-14710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only in the specific case of heparin cofactor II has a comparable high affinity interaction with DS been demonstrated, and this is dependent upon the presence of a specific, highly sulfated DS oligosaccharide sequence (23Maimone M.M. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mascellani G. Liverani L. Bianchini P. Parma B. Torri G. Bisio A. Guerrini M. Casu B. Biochem.

This gives further insight into the specific structural requirements for oligosaccharide binding to HGF/SF. The existence of this interaction is likely to have significant implications for the biological activity of this paracrine-acting, mesenchymal factor. Recombinant human HGF/SF was purified as described by Nakamura et al. (25Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugiura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S.

HGF/SF affinity columns were prepared by coupling recombinant human HGF/SF to Affi-Gel 10, in the presence of an excess of heparin to protect the GAG-binding site, as described by Lyon et al. (9Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled poly- or oligosaccharides were applied to the HGF/SF column in an ionic strength of ≤0.15 m at room temperature, and then recirculated at least 10 times to maximize binding. After washing with PBS, the column was eluted with an increasing stepwise gradient of NaCl in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Fractions were collected and monitored for radioactivity. In a competition experiment, the binding of 3H-labeled DS tetradecasaccharides (2 × 105 cpm) to a small HGF/SF column was compared in the presence and absence of 1 μg of low molecular weight heparin (average M r of 3000; approximately 6-fold molar excess relative to HGF/SF). The sample was circulated through the column 20 times in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, washed with an excess of 0.2m NaCl, 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, and the bound oligosaccharides were step-eluted with 0.6 m NaCl, 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0. Confluent cultures of either FS8 fibroblasts or Balb/c 3T3 cells, grown in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated donor calf serum (Life Technologies Inc., Paisley, UK), were metabolically radiolabeled with 5 μCi/mld-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2in air. The culture medium was removed, and the cell layers were extracted with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h. The cellular extract was recombined with the culture medium, and Pronase was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. After digestion at 37 °C for 2 h, the sample was heat-inactivated, filtered, and then applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The column was washed with 0.2m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–1.5m NaCl in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The late-eluting peak, corresponding primarily to CS/DS chains, was recovered, dialyzed against distilled water, and concentrated to approximately 1 ml. The sample was treated with pH 1.5 nitrous acid (28Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to degrade any contaminating HS, neutralized, and purified by chromatography on a Sepharose CL6B column (1.5 × 95 cm) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. The high molecular weight CS/DS chains were collected and freeze-dried. The heterogeneity of the major oligosaccharide fractions was further analyzed by electrophoresis on a 25–35% (w/v) gradient polyacrylamide gel, with a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel, followed by semidry electrotransfer to a positively charged nylon membrane and then fluorographic detection. Purified 3H-labeled CS/DS chains were dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, and digested with a mixture of 0.1 units/ml each of chondroitin ACI and ACII lyases at 37 °C for 24 h. A further addition of enzymes was made and the incubation continued for 4 h. The digest was then chromatographed on a Bio-Gel P-10 (fine grade) column (1 × 133 cm) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and aliquots were counted for radioactivity. Peaks corresponding to individual size fractions of enzyme-resistant oligosaccharides were individually collected, exhaustively freeze-dried, and then redissolved in distilled water. Samples of each size fraction, from hexa- to dodecasaccharides, were then applied to a ProPac PA1 (Dionex; 0.4 × 25 cm) strong anion-exchange HPLC column equilibrated with distilled water adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl. After a wash with pH 3.5 water, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and aliquots counted for radioactivity. Fractions corresponding to individual oligosaccharide peaks were concentrated by centrifugal vacuum evaporation, desalted on PD-10 columns eluted with distilled water, and then freeze-dried. Oligosaccharide species were completely digested to disaccharides using a mixture of 40 mIU/ml each of chondroitin ABC and chondroitin B lyases in 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 24 h. The digests were then resolved by chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-2 (superfine) column (1 × 47 cm) eluted with 0.1 mNH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 4 ml/h. Fractions corresponding to the disaccharide peaks were collected, freeze-dried, and then redissolved in 1 ml of distilled water adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl. Samples were applied either to a ProPac PA1 (0.4 × 25 cm; Dionex) or a 5 μm Spherisorb (0.46 × 25 cm; Technicol, Stockport, UK) strong anion-exchange HPLC column equilibrated in pH 3.5 water. After a wash with pH 3.5 water, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and counted for radioactivity. Disaccharide peaks were identified by comparison with the elution positions of known CS/DS disaccharide standards (Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). MDCK cells were seeded into the wells of a 96-well plate at a density of 104 cells/well in minimum Eagle's medium containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. After 20 h, the culture medium was removed and the confluent cell layer was washed with medium containing 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. The cells were then incubated with 0.2 ml/well of the above solution containing 5 ng/ml125I-HGF/SF (prepared as described by Lyon et al. in Ref. 9Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of a range of concentrations (0–100 μg/ml) of heparin, HS, DS, or CS. After incubation at 4 °C for 4 h, the cells were washed five times with cold binding solution (no HGF/SF or GAG). Cells were then solubilized in 1m NaOH, and the released 125I radioactivity was measured in a γ counter. Bovine skin decorin (250 μg of decorin in 100 μl of distilled water) was biotinylated on its core protein by addition of three 10-μl aliquots of a 50 mm solution of succinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce & Warriner, Chester, UK) in dimethyl sulfoxide over a 24-h period. Biotinylated decorin was separated from unreacted biotin reagent, by passage over a PD-10 desalting column eluted with distilled water, and then lyophilized. Binding reactions were performed in an IAsys resonant mirror biosensor (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK) using three-dimensional carboxymethyldextran surfaces. The surfaces were derivatized with streptavidin, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then loaded with the biotinylated decorin proteoglycan. All HGF/SF binding reactions were performed in PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 at 20 °C, and data were collected three times a second. HGF/SF, at a known concentration, was introduced into the cuvette in 100 μl of binding solution and its association to the immobilized decorin was monitored until a plateau was reached. The cuvette was then rapidly washed twice with PBS, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.2, and the dissociation of HGF/SF from the immobilized decorin was followed. The decorin surface was regenerated by washing twice with 200 μl of 2m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, followed by re-equilibration with PBS, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.2. Three independent sets of binding reactions at five different HGF/SF concentrations were carried out. The association and dissociation rate constants, k a and k d, respectively, were calculated from each set of association and dissociation curves, using the nonlinear curve-fitting FastFit software (Affinity Sensors) supplied with the instrument. The individual values of k a and k d, together with their associated errors, were then combined. HGF/SF did not itself bind to streptavidin-derivatized carboxymethyldextran surfaces.2 3H-Labeled CS/DS chains purified from cultures of FS8 fetal human skin fibroblasts bound to an HGF/SF affinity column, but not a control column, at physiological pH and ionic strength. The bound CS/DS fraction was eluted over the range of 0.4–1.0 m NaCl with the majority being released by 0.8m NaCl (Fig. 1). This is very similar behavior to that reported previously for the HS chains derived from the same cell line (9Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CS/DS chains prepared from cultures of Balb/c 3T3 cells also bound and eluted with similar characteristics (data not shown). In light of the previously determined requirements for iduronate residues, in combination with a specific pattern ofO-sulfation, for the binding of HS to HGF/SF (9Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), together with the lack of affinity for pure CS (9Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was considered likely that interaction of HGF/SF with CS/DS would also occur specifically within the iduronate-containing sequences of these polysaccharides. Thus, a large scale preparation of3H-labeled CS/DS chains purified from Balb/c 3T3 cells (disaccharide composition: 6.0% nonsulfated, 79.7% mono-4-O-sulfated, 10.2% mono-6-O-sulfated, 1.5% di-2,4-O-sulfated, 1.4% di-2,6-O-sulfated, and 1.2% di-4,6-O-sulfated disaccharides) was exhaustively digested with a combination of chondroitin ACI and ACII lyases, to degrade specifically within the glucuronate-containing regions and thereby excise intact iduronate-rich sequences. A combination of enzymes was employed as chondroitin ACII lyase is more efficient at cleaving adjacent to any oversulfated glucuronate-containing disaccharides, whereas the more endolytic action of chondroitin ACI lyase results in better cleavage at isolated internal glucuronate residues (29Yoshida K. Arai M. Kohno Y. Maeyama K.-I. Miyazono H. Kikuchi H. Morikawa K. Tawada A. Suzuki S. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulfate Proteoglycans: Chemistry, Biology, Chemical Pathology. Portland Press, London1993: 55-70Google Scholar). Bio-Gel P-10 gel filtration chromatography of the resulting digest (Fig. 2) revealed a predominant disaccharide peak, together with a series of discrete, well resolved peaks corresponding to tetra- to dodecasaccharides A population of larger, but poorly resolved fragments, extending into the void volume of the column, were also present. The proportion of resistant glycosidic linkages, as calculated from the relative content of differently sized oligosaccharide products (Fig. 2), suggests an iduronate content of at least 33%. The series of oligosaccharides larger than disaccharides should predominantly correspond to the general structure, ΔHexA-GalNAc(OSO3)-[HexA(±2-OSO3)-GalNAc(OSO3)] n ≥1, where the ΔHexA would have derived from an original GlcA residue, the internal HexA residues should be predominantly, if not exclusively, IdoA (a proportion of which could be 2-O-sulfated), and the GalNAc residues would be sulfated predominantly at the C-4 position. Because of uncertainty as to the ability of the combined chondroitinases ACI and ACII to cleave at all GlcA linkages, it is possible that a minor proportion of the HexA residues may be GlcA. Aliquots of the individual oligosaccharide peaks corresponding to di- to dodecasaccharides, as well as a combined pool of those oligosaccharides larger than dodecasaccharides, were assayed for binding to the HGF/SF column. Di- and tetrasaccharides did not bind, and only a very small proportion (2.1%) of hexasaccharides bound (data not shown). However, a minor fraction (6.6%) of octasaccharides bound to the HGF/SF column, requiring 0.4 m NaCl for elution (Fig. 3 A). As oligosaccharide size increased further, that proportion of material which bound progressively increased (i.e. the majority of dp12 and nearly all the dp > 12), as did the NaCl concentration required for elution of the bound components (Figs. 3, B–D). Although the majority of the largest oligosaccharides required 0.6m NaCl for elution (Fig. 3 D), this was still lower than the 0.8 m NaCl required to elute intact CS/DS chains (compare Fig. 1). In a competition experiment, the presence of 1 μg of low molecular weight heparin (average length of dp 10–12) was able to inhibit by 67% the binding of 2 × 105 cpm of a DS tetradecasaccharide to a small HGF/SF affinity column. This suggests that both DS and HS oligosaccharides are likely to be binding to the same site on the HGF/SF molecule. The individual hexa-, octa-, deca-, and dodecasaccharide fractions in Fig. 2 were further resolved by preparative strong anion-exchange HPLC into molecular species with differing sulfation patterns. Comparisons of both their disaccharide compositions and their respective HGF/SF affinities, as determined by the concentration of NaCl required to elute them from a HGF/SF column, may help to elucidate the minimum specific structural requirements for this interaction. All four oligosaccharide size populations yielded surprisingly similar profiles upon strong anion-exchange HPLC. A single major species (labeled peak B in all cases), comprising 70–83% of the total population, was always present, together with a substantially less abundant (13–19%), later-eluting species (labeled peak C) (Fig.4 and TableI). A minor, earlier-eluting species (labeled peak A) was also present in all four size populations, and the content of this species appeared to generally increase with oligosaccharide size (Table I). A fourth, highly charged, minor species (labeled peak D) was found only in the dodecasaccharide population (Fig. 4).Table IDisaccharide compositions of DS oligosaccharidesOligosaccharide species1-aThe number refers to the oligosaccharide size (dp) and the letter to the HPLC peak designation (see Fig. 4).Content (% of specific size population)Disaccharide composition (%)1-bA dash indicates that the specific disaccharide species was not detected.HGF bindingNonsulfatedMono-4-sulfatedMono-6-sulfatedDi-2,4-sulfatedDi-2,6-sulfatedTri-2,4,6-sulfated6A1.9ND1-cND, not determined.NDNDNDNDND—6B83.42.595.12.4————6C14.729.921.0—22.526.6——8A3.716.783.3————−/+1-dThe HGF-binding properties of these specific oligosaccharides are uncertain due to the low amount available.8B83.21.396.62.1———+8C13.19.969.04.67.09.5—+10A7.519.580.5————−/+1-dThe HGF-binding properties of these specific oligosaccharides are uncertain due to the low amount available.10B76.09.672.26.75.06.5—+10C16.510.360.14.211.513.9—+12A1-eThe accuracy of determination of the composition, particularly the nonsulphated disaccharide, was low due to the limited quantity available for analysis.6.65.490.34.3———+12B70.14.491.64.0———+12C19.15.681.83.84.44.3—+12D4.2—41.5———58.5+1-a The number refers to the oligosaccharide size (dp) and the letter to the HPLC peak designation (see Fig. 4).1-b A dash indicates that the specific disaccharide species was not detected.1-c ND, not determined.1-d The HGF-binding properties of these specific oligosaccharides are uncertain due to the low amount available.1-e The accuracy of determination of the composition, particularly the nonsulphated disaccharide, was low due to the limited quantity available for analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2036251477,"CD20 is a B cell integral membrane protein capable of initiating growth-modulating signals in human B lymphocytes upon its engagement with monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies. In this report, we demonstrate that treatment of B cells with CD20 antibodies induces rapid redistribution of CD20 into a detergent-insoluble membrane compartment. Redistribution is detected as early as 15 s, following antibody addition, and involves up to 95% of CD20 molecules, depending on the antibody used. All of the detergent-insoluble CD20 was found in the low density fractions of sucrose density gradients, indicating that CD20 redistributes to glycolipid-rich membrane domains, analogous to caveolae in some cell types. As CD20 has previously been shown to associate with Src family tyrosine kinases, their co-existence in these compartments suggests a link to the role of CD20 in signal transduction. This study provides insight into the mechanism by which CD20 commmunicates signals to the cell interior and indicates that the search for membrane-proximal intracellular signaling partners should be directed to the Triton-insoluble fraction.

The plasma membrane provides both a barrier and an interface to the extracellular microenvironment and supports many cell surface proteins responsible for transmitting extracellular signals to the cell interior. Increasing evidence supports the notion that, for some receptors, signal integration involves the nonrandom distribution of signaling proteins into subcompartments in the plasma membrane (1Anderson R.G.

Local variation in lipid content provides one mechanism for the organization of microdomains in the plasma membrane and permits their biochemical isolation on the basis of detergent insolubility and buoyancy on sucrose density gradients (3Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, it has been established that glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. proteins and Src family kinases are enriched in these detergent-insoluble microdomains (4Parton R.G.

Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD20 is a 33–35-kDa nonglycosylated integral membrane protein expressed on all B lymphocytes from the late pre-B cell stage until it is lost just prior to terminal differentiation into plasma cells. The cDNA sequence of CD20 predicts that it spans the plasma membrane four times, with an intracellular location for both amino and carboxyl tails and a short extracellular loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains (7Tedder T.F.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against extracellular epitopes of CD20 can modulate B cell growth and differentiation, indicating the ability of CD20 to transduce extracellular signals (10Smeland E.

A signaling role for CD20 is further supported by the activation of tyrosine kinase activity in B cells after their exposure to CD20 mAbs (16Deans J.P. Schieven G.L. Shu G.L. Valentine M.A. Gilliland L.A. Aruffo A. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4494-4504PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, evidence suggests that CD20 may also be involved in the control of intracellular free calcium concentration by regulating both calcium influx (17Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D.

Valentine M.A. Gilliland L.A. Aruffo A. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4494-4504PubMed Google Scholar). CD20 is tightly associated with Src family kinases and with an unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 75–80 kDa (p75/80) (20Deans J.P. Kalt L. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Bolen J.B. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22632-22638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying the ability of CD20 to transmit signals regulating B cell activation has not been further elucidated. To explore the molecular basis for differing effects of CD20 mAbs on B cell activation, the ability of three of these antibodies to co-precipitate CD20, kinase activity, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was compared. The results of this study uncovered the remarkable ability of CD20 to redistribute to a Triton-insoluble, low density membrane compartment upon binding to anti-CD20 mAb. In many cell types, this compartment has been equated with caveolae, defined morphologically as microinvaginations in the plasma membrane, and more recently, by the presence of caveolin, a resident caveolar protein (21Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, the apparent absence of both caveolin and morphologically defined caveolae leaves their designation provisional in this cell type (22Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, biochemically similar structures, sometimes referred to as “rafts” or DIGS (detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched structures) (4Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387 (572): 589Crossref Scopus (8154) Google Scholar), have been isolated from lymphocytes, and we propose that active relocalization of CD20 to these microdomains is a necessary event in the initiation of CD20 signaling. In support of this, an activating anti-CD20 mAb was found to uniquely induce the appearance in the same compartment of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of ∼50 kDa. Raji B cells were maintained by culture in RPMI 1640 medium, 5% fetal bovine serum. The CD20-specific mAbs, 2H7 and 1F5, were provided by Dr. J. Ledbetter (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA). The CD20 mAb B1 was purchased from Coulter Corp. (Hialeah, FL). Rabbit antiserum to CD20 was generated using a peptide corresponding to amino acids 25–41 of human CD20 conjugated to ovalbumin. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Raji cells were warmed to 37 °C before incubation with 2H7, 1F5, B1 or isotype-matched control mAbs (1 μg/106 cells) and then pelleted and lysed in ice-cold 0.5% Triton X-100 (Pierce) containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm EDTA. In time course experiments requiring very short exposure to antibody, cells were not pelleted but were lysed in 2 × (1%) Triton X-100 detergent buffer. After 15 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to separate out the insoluble material. The insoluble pellets were washed 4 times in lysis buffer before addition of 2 × SDS sample buffer and then subjected to 2 cycles of heating to 100 °C for 5 min, vortexing, and freezing. For immunoprecipitation, post-nuclear lysates were transferred to clean tubes and mixed with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Repligen Corp., Cambridge, MA) for 2 h. Forin vitro phosphorylation, immune complexes precipitated from cell lysates with protein A-Sepharose beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, twice in kinase buffer (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 5 mmMgCl2), and resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). Reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 15 min and then were stopped by the addition of 3 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Samples were washed with lysis buffer, heated to 100 °C for 5 min in 2 × SDS sample buffer, run on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore). Bands were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak X-OMAT film. Membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin, incubated with 1/2000 dilution of CD20 antiserum or 4G10 mAb, and washed, and then bound antibody was detected using protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) and developed by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Pre-stained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad or NEB) were run on each gel. Bands were visualized using Kodak X-OMAT film (Eastman Kodak Co.) Cells (2 × 105) were suspended and incubated in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum for 15 min at 37 °C with 2H7, 1F5, B1, or isotype-matched control mAb, washed once, and resuspended for 15 min with 100 μl of 1/100 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). Experiments as represented in Fig. 5 were performed with modifications to incubation times as described in the figure legend. After washing, cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline/0.01% azide and analyzed on a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Raji cells (1 × 107 per gradient) were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in MES-buffered saline (MBS; 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), mixed with sucrose to a final concentration of 40%, overlayered with a 5–30% sucrose density gradient as described (3Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 23Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell.

Fractions corresponding to 12–20% sucrose on the gradient were collected, diluted in MBS such that the final concentration of sucrose was less than 5%, and pelleted by centrifugation at 37,000 rpm for 1 h, and the Triton X-100 insoluble pellets were then solublized in SDS sample buffer. Binding of anti-CD20 mAb to B cells has been shown to induce tyrosine kinase activation, tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ, and mobilization of intracellular calcium (16Deans J.P.

Further, CD20 mAbs co-precipitate Src family kinases and an unidentified 75–80-kDa phosphoprotein (20Deans J.P. Kalt L. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Bolen J.B. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22632-22638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanism for signal transduction through CD20-associated tyrosine kinase activation. There appear to be at least two distinct epitopes in the small extracellular loop of CD20, one recognized by the antibody 1F5 and another, possibly overlapping epitope, recognized by other CD20 mAbs (24Tedder T.F. Penta A. Knapp Leukocyte Typing IV. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1989: 48-50Google Scholar). The 1F5 antibody is unique in its ability to induce c-myc transcription and entry of resting B cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas all CD20 mAb, including 1F5, inhibit mitogen-induced antibody production by activated B cells (10Smeland E.

To explore the molecular basis for the unique activating property of the 1F5 anti-CD20 mAb, its ability to co-precipitate kinase activity and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was compared with two other CD20 mAbs, 2H7 and B1. Indirect surface immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that all three of these antibodies bind well to Raji cells (Fig.1). However, there were marked differences in their ability to co-precipitate p75/80 and kinase activity. CD20 complexes precipitated by mAb 2H7 contained more p75/80, as detected by anti-phosphotyrosine, and more kinase activity, as measured by in vitro phosphorylation, than CD20 complexes precipitated by either 1F5 or B1 (Fig.2). The increased amounts of CD20-associated proteins precipitated by 2H7 might have been partially accounted for by the slightly higher level of binding of 2H7 to the cells (Fig. 1). However, the amount of CD20 precipitated by the 3 mAb was estimated by blotting the same membranes with a CD20 antiserum, and surprisingly, there was significantly less CD20 precipitated by 2H7 than by either 1F5 or B1 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Inverse correlation among CD20 mAbs between precipitation of CD20 and co-precipitation of associated proteins.Raji B cells (107) were incubated with control mAb (CT) or CD20 mAb (1F5, 2H7, B1) for 15 min before lysis. CD20 and associated proteins were precipitated by addition of protein A-Sepharose. Associated proteins were detected by anti-phosphotyrosine blot (upper left) or in vitro kinase assay (upper right). The same membranes were then probed for CD20 (bottom). Note that CD20 migrates as a 33/35-kDa doublet due to differential serine/threonine phosphorylation (41Tedder T.F. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10009-10015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Valentine M.A. Meier K.E. Rossie S. Clark E.A. J. Biol.

The lower band is predominant and, at limiting amounts, is the only one detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reduced amount of CD20 precipitated by 2H7 mAb was at odds with both the high level of surface staining (Fig. 1) and the higher amounts of CD20-co-precipitated proteins relative to 1F5 and B1 (Fig. 2). These data suggested to us that CD20 may have changed its solubility properties following 2H7 mAb binding, resulting in translocation of CD20 from the Triton-soluble fraction to an insoluble fraction. To test this, Triton-soluble lysates prepared from cells treated with either control or CD20 mAbs were tested for the presence of CD20 by immunoblotting. A significant reduction in the amount of CD20 was detected in lysates prepared from cells pretreated with 2H7 mAbs (Fig.3, upper panel). The proportion of CD20 that was translocated was estimated to be 80–95% when the cells were exposed to 2H7 for 15 min. In the same time frame, approximately 40–60% and 5–10% of CD20 was lost following exposure to 1F5 and B1 mAbs, respectively. The Triton-insoluble material obtained after centrifugation of the lysates was solubilized in SDS sample buffer and similarly analyzed for the presence of CD20 (Fig. 3,lower panel). When Raji cells were lysed without prior incubation with CD20 mAb, there was no CD20 detectable in the Triton-insoluble fraction. However, addition of either 1F5 or 2H7 CD20 antibody to the cells 15 min prior to lysis resulted in translocation of a significant fraction of CD20 to the insoluble compartment. A much smaller amount of CD20 was translocated in response to B1. The amount of insoluble CD20 varied with the antibody used, in inverse proportion to the amount of soluble CD20 precipitated by the same antibodies. Thus, the 2H7 antibody, which precipitated less soluble CD20 (Fig. 2), was the most effective in inducing CD20 to become insoluble. In contrast, the B1 mAb precipitated the most CD20 from the soluble fraction and was least effective at inducing CD20 insolubility. The ability of 2H7 to induce CD20 translocation depended on adding the antibody to viable cells prior to lysis; addition of 2H7 to cell-free lysates failed to induce CD20 translocation (Fig.4, upper panel). 2H7 is capable of binding to CD20 in lysates as shown by its ability to precipitate CD20 from lysates (Fig. 4, lower panel). CD20 translocation into the Triton-insoluble fraction was detected at the earliest time point tested following 2H7 addition, i.e.15 s, becoming maximal by 15 min and remaining stable for at least 1 h (Fig. 5 A). FACScan analysis demonstrated that CD20 molecules which were bound to 2H7 during the initial 15 min incubation remained on the cell surface for at least 1 h (Fig. 5 B). Insolubility of non-nuclear proteins in Triton X-100 has been attributed to either cytoskeletal attachment or to localization to lipid-rich membrane compartments. To distinguish between these two possibilities, cell lysates were analyzed by centrifugation on sucrose density gradients. Both the insoluble pellet, in which cytoskeletal proteins are found, and the insoluble buoyant fractions pooled from 12–20% sucrose were tested for the presence of CD20 (Fig. 6). All of the insoluble CD20 material was detected in the 12–20% region of the gradient, consistent with localization to a lipid-rich membrane compartment (3Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar,25Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Since CD20 is associated with Src family tyrosine kinases, primarily Lyn, and with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, p75/80, the Triton-insoluble membrane fraction in which CD20 was detected was probed by Western blot using anti-lyn and anti-phosphotyrosine. Lyn is one of several Src family kinases enriched in Triton-insoluble membrane compartments (6Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2S. Robbins, N. Quintrell, and J. M. Bishop, unpublished observations. and no change in the abundance of Lyn in this compartment was detected upon CD20 translocation (data not shown). Three major bands of approximately 75, 60, and 55 kDa were detected by anti-phosphotyrosine blot in all samples at similar intensity (Fig. 7). The identity of these proteins is not known, but bands in the 55–60-kDa region are likely to include Src family kinases. Of particular interest is that an additional phosphoprotein, migrating at approximately 50 kDa, was uniquely and reproducibly observed in samples pretreated with the activating 1F5 mAb, but not with either 2H7 or B1 (Fig. 7). This report describes the active relocalization of the cell surface protein CD20 into a low density detergent-insoluble membrane compartment upon exposure of Raji B cells to CD20 mAb. Despite the relatively hydrophobic nature of CD20, it is not intrinsically resistant to detergent lysis. All detectable CD20 is found in the Triton-soluble fraction of unstimulated cells and is only induced to become insoluble by the addition to viable cells of mAb against extracellular CD20 epitopes. This phenomenon is not unique to Raji cells since it was observed in several unrelated B cell lines as well as in freshly isolated tonsillar B cells (data not shown). The reason for differences in the degree of insolubility induced by various CD20 mAbs is unclear at present. It is not likely to be due simply to differences in the numbers of CD20 molecules engaged since the B1 mAb binds to CD20 at least as well as 1F5 (Fig. 1), and yet approximately 5-fold more CD20 protein is redistributed by 1F5. It is possible that differences in either affinity or fine specificity account for the observed effects. Antibody binding to CD20 may induce a conformational and/or post-translational modification that causes the molecule to translocate to an insoluble compartment or to become insoluble in situ, perhaps by oligomerization. Alternatively, CD20 may be associated with, or be induced to associate with, a GPI-linked protein or other molecule with a predisposition toward localization to the insoluble fraction. GPI-linked proteins are enriched in detergent-insoluble low density compartments (6Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Draberova L. Draber P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3611-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27Cinek T.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Under electron microscopy, low density detergent-insoluble fractions can be seen to contain vesicles similar to those formed by caveolae following membrane disruption in Triton X-100 (6Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and are enriched in many of the same proteins found in caveolae (see below). Nevertheless, resolution of the issue of whether there are distinct non-caveolar detergent-insoluble microdomains awaits the characterization of additional components in these compartments. Data is accumulating to implicate these membrane microdomains in the integration of extracellular signals within the plasma membrane (1Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 2Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Kubler E. Koleske A.J. Sargiacomo M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition to being enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, glycosphingolipids, and GPI-linked proteins, they contain a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction, including Src family tyrosine kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors, calcium channels, and ATPases (28Chang W.J. Ying Y.S. Rothberg K.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Gambliel H.A. De Gunzburg J. Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 31Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and in this context, it is interesting to note that CD20 appears to be capable of forming calcium channels (17Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J.

Further evidence for a role of caveolae or analogous membrane microdomains in signal transduction stems from recent observations that growth factor receptors reside and initiate signaling in these compartments (32Liu P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, there are only a few reports describing redistribution of cell surface signaling molecules into these domains. For example, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is reversibly translocated into caveolae in response to agonists (35Raposo G. Dunia I. Marullo S. Andre C. Guillet J.G. Strosberg A.D. Benedetti E.L. Hoebeke J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 60: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GPI-linked proteins, which have also been implicated in signaling, become enriched in caveolae upon antibody cross-linking (36Mayor S. Rothberg K.G. Maxfield F.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1948-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 37Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In addition, the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI), when aggregated, redistributes to detergent-resistant membrane domains (38Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar,39Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). CD20 shares significant sequence homology with the β subunit of the FcεRI complex, particularly in regions corresponding to the putative membrane domains (40Kuster H. Zhang L. Brini A.T. MacGlashan D.W.J. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12782-12787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to activated CD20, which remains insoluble in 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 5), localization of FcεRI to membrane domains is extremely sensitive to detergent concentration and is released from the domains in concentrations of Triton X-100 greater than 0.05% (39Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, the specific membrane compartment, and/or the mechanisms underlying CD20 and FcεRI translocation are likely to be different. Furthermore, detergent-insoluble CD20 clearly remains membrane-associated, as assessed by FACScan analysis (Fig.5 B), and by confocal microscopy 3P. van den Elzen and J. Deans, unpublished observations. whereas the FcεRI complex becomes internalized (39Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first description of a lymphocyte cell surface molecule that appears to be completely excluded from detergent-insoluble domains in unstimulated cells but can be induced to translocate to that compartment. The molecular composition of the compartment to which CD20 translocates is presently unknown, but a focus on its components may allow us to identify key downstream elements for CD20-mediated signaling and function. The physiological relevance of CD20 redistribution is suggested by the selective alteration in the profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates in the corresponding compartment induced by the activating mAb 1F5 even though the extent of CD20 redistribution induced by 1F5 is lower than that of 2H7. The activating properties of the 1F5 mAb are thus, for the first time, correlated with an early intracellular signaling event, indicating that the Triton-insoluble membrane fraction is the relevant signaling compartment to investigate to characterize CD20-initiated signal transduction pathway. The ∼50-kDa protein may be constitutively resident in the insoluble compartment, becoming tyrosine phosphorylated in response to 1F5 ligation, or it may itself become translocated with CD20. We anticipate that the signal transduction pathways initiated by 1F5 engagement, leading to cell cycle progression, will now become amenable to analysis. CD20 co-precipitates with the Src family kinase Lyn (20Deans J.P. Kalt L. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Bolen J.B. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22632-22638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a resident protein in the Triton-insoluble fraction in lymphocytes (6Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).3 The amount of Lyn in the corresponding fractions did not change upon CD20 translocation (data not shown), however, we have not assessed whether its specific activity is altered. A physiological stimulus for CD20 redistribution has not yet been identified. Given the profound effect of antibodies against the extracellular region of CD20 on the state of B cell activation, we speculate that either a putative CD20 ligand or an interacting protein may mediate redistribution and that the consequences of CD20 redistribution will relate to its roles in signal transduction and/or calcium control.

We have previously identified a region rich in basic amino acids within the PH domain critical for ligand binding (Yagisawa, H., Hirata, M., Kanematsu, T., Watanabe, Y., Ozaki, S., Sakuma, K., Tanaka, H., Yabuta, N., Kamata, H., Hirata, H., and Nojima, H.

To investigate the role of these basic residues, we have performed site-directed mutagenesis replacing each of the basic amino acid in the N-terminal 60 residues of PLC-delta1 (Lys24, Lys30, Lys32, Arg37, Arg38, Arg40, Lys43, Lys49, Arg56, Lys57, and Arg60) with a neutral or an acidic amino acid. The effects of these mutations on the PH domain ligand binding properties and their consequence for substrate hydrolysis and membrane interactions of PLC-delta1 were analyzed using several assay systems. Analysis of [3H]-Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding, measurement of the binding affinities, and measurements of phospholipase activity using PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing phospholipid vesicles, demonstrated that residues Lys30, Lys32, Arg37, Arg38, Arg40, and Lys57 were required for these PLC-delta1 functions; in comparison, other mutations resulted in a moderate reduction. A subset of selected mutations was further analyzed for the enzyme activity toward substrate present in cellular membranes of permeabilized cells and for interaction with the plasma membrane after microinjection. These experiments demonstrated that mutations affecting ligand binding and PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis in phospholipid vesicles also resulted in reduction in the hydrolysis of cellular polyphosphoinositides and loss of membrane attachment. All residues (with the exception of the K43E substitution) found to be critical for the analyzed PLC-delta1 functions are present at the surface of the PH domain shown to contain the Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding pocket."

However, the amino-terminal region of PKD contains a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich, zinc finger-like motifs that bind phorbol esters with high affinity (8Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with 92% homology to PKD (extending to 98% homology in the catalytic domain) is also stimulated by phorbol esters and phospholipids (12Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Bottinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These in vitro results indicate that PKD/PKCμ is a novel phorbol ester/diacylglycerol-stimulated protein kinase. Recently a new mechanism of PKD activation has been identified (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Specifically, exposure of intact cells to biologically active phorbol esters and membrane-permeant diacylglycerol induces phosphorylation-dependent PKD activation via a PKC-dependent pathway (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, PKD can function either in parallel to or downstream of PKCs in signal transduction.The amino-terminal region of PKD also contains a PH domain which is not found in any of the PKCs. PH domains are molecular structures of approximately 120 amino acids with limited identity in sequence but similar three-dimensional structure (14Rawlings D.J. Saffran D.C. Tsukada S.

It has been suggested that PH domains mediate intermolecular and/or intramolecular interactions like src homology domain 2 and 3, but their function and binding partners remain unclear. In some cases PH domains have been shown to bind phosphoinositides and their head groups or proteins such as the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (19Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J.

These considerations prompted us to examine the function of the PH domain in the regulation of PKD activity.In the present study we demonstrate that a PKD mutant lacking the entire PH domain exhibits high basal kinase activity. This active form of PKD binds phorbol esters as well as the wild type protein but is only slightly further activated by treatment with PDB in vivo. PKD mutants lacking part of the PH domain or with single amino acid substitutions within the PH domain also show high basal kinase activity. Our results indicate that the PH domain of PKD plays a negative role in the regulation of PKD kinase activity.DISCUSSIONAlthough the tertiary structure of several PH domains, some bound to ligands, has been determined, the function of this domain remains incompletely understood (18Gibson T.J.

Most studies have shown that the integrity of the PH domain is necessary for enzyme activation.The newly identified PKD contains a PH domain inserted between the second cysteine-rich motif and the kinase catalytic domain (9Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The presence of the PH domain distinguishes PKD from all known members of the PKC family. In the present study, we have deleted or mutated the PH domain of PKD and analyzed the regulatory properties of the resulting PKD mutants.In striking contrast to most previous studies showing that functional PH domains are necessary for enzyme activation, our results demonstrate that partial or complete deletions of the PH domain of PKD (see Fig. 5) resulted in PKD mutants that exhibit a high level of basal kinase activity. Single amino acid substitutions (e.g. R447C and W538A) within the PH domain also promoted an activated state of PKD. The R447C mutation was tested because a comparable mutation (R28C) in the PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is responsible for the induction of X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency in CBA/N mice (14Rawlings D.J.

Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). The W538A mutation alters the only invariant amino acid in the carboxyl-terminal α-helix and is conserved in all known PH domains (18Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 20Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the W538A mutation was as effective as partial or complete deletions of the PH domain in promoting an active state of PKD.Recent results demonstrated that treatment of intact cells with PDB, cell-permeant diacylglycerols, or bryostatin induces rapid PKD activation that was maintained during cell disruption and immunoprecipitation (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 44Matthews S.A. Pettit G.R. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20245-20250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence including the use of PKC inhibitors and cotransfection of PKD with constitutively activated mutants of PKCε and -η (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) indicate that PKD can be activated by phosphorylation in intact cells through a PKC-dependent signal transduction pathway. Our results demonstrate that PKD carrying deletions of the PH domain or the single amino acid substitution W538A within the α-helix of the PH domain were only slightly stimulated further by treatment of the cells with PDB, implying that PKD rendered active by PH domain mutation is already fully activated. We conclude that the integrity of the PH domain is critical for maintaining unstimulated PKD in a state of low catalytic kinase activity.The low basal activity of many protein kinases is maintained by the interaction between an autoinhibitory domain located within the enzyme with its catalytic site, thereby preventing the binding of substrates (45Smith M.K. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1837-1840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, all members of the PKC family from yeast to human PKCs possess an autoinhibitory motif that is located upstream of the first cysteine-rich domain (46Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, PKD does not contain a pseudosubstrate region in a comparable position (9Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although it is conceivable that PKD is also regulated by autoinhibition, as many other regulated protein kinases, the putative autoinhibitory region has not been identified yet. In view of our results, it is tempting to speculate that the PH domain of PKD has an inactivating function by functioning as an autoinhibitory domain. This suggests a novel role of PH domains in enzyme regulation. In the context of this model, partial or complete deletions of the PH domain of PKD or single amino acid substitutions within this domain should stabilize an active conformation of PKD as, in fact, it is shown by the mutational analysis presented here. Alternatively, our results cannot exclude the possibility that the PH domain of PKD could bind an inhibitory ligand(s) that is released by allosteric stimulation or by phosphorylation-dependent activation induced by treatment of intact cells with PDB. However, PH domain ligands such as phosphoinositides and βγ subunits of G proteins promote correct subcellular localization and enzyme activation rather than inhibition of enzyme activity (18Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J.

Future studies should attempt to distinguish between these alternative models. Regardless of the precise mechanism(s), our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the PH domain of PKD plays a negative role in the regulation of PKD kinase activity.

The newly identified PKD is a mouse serine/threonine protein kinase with distinct structural and enzymological properties (8Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of PKD is distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases and shows little similarity to the highly conserved regions of the kinase subdomains of the PKC family (9Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, PKD does not phosphorylate a variety of substrates utilized by PKCs indicating that PKD is a protein kinase with distinct substrate specificity (8Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 10Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the amino-terminal region of PKD contains a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich, zinc finger-like motifs that bind phorbol esters with high affinity (8Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar,10Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Immunopurified PKD is markedly stimulated by PDB or diacylglycerol in the presence of phosphatidylserine (10Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with 92% homology to PKD (extending to 98% homology in the catalytic domain) is also stimulated by phorbol esters and phospholipids (12Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Bottinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These in vitro results indicate that PKD/PKCμ is a novel phorbol ester/diacylglycerol-stimulated protein kinase. Recently a new mechanism of PKD activation has been identified (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Specifically, exposure of intact cells to biologically active phorbol esters and membrane-permeant diacylglycerol induces phosphorylation-dependent PKD activation via a PKC-dependent pathway (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, PKD can function either in parallel to or downstream of PKCs in signal transduction. The amino-terminal region of PKD also contains a PH domain which is not found in any of the PKCs. PH domains are molecular structures of approximately 120 amino acids with limited identity in sequence but similar three-dimensional structure (14Rawlings D.J. Saffran D.C. Tsukada S.

It has been suggested that PH domains mediate intermolecular and/or intramolecular interactions like src homology domain 2 and 3, but their function and binding partners remain unclear.

These considerations prompted us to examine the function of the PH domain in the regulation of PKD activity. In the present study we demonstrate that a PKD mutant lacking the entire PH domain exhibits high basal kinase activity. This active form of PKD binds phorbol esters as well as the wild type protein but is only slightly further activated by treatment with PDB in vivo. PKD mutants lacking part of the PH domain or with single amino acid substitutions within the PH domain also show high basal kinase activity. Our results indicate that the PH domain of PKD plays a negative role in the regulation of PKD kinase activity. DISCUSSIONAlthough the tertiary structure of several PH domains, some bound to ligands, has been determined, the function of this domain remains incompletely understood (18Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M.

Most studies have shown that the integrity of the PH domain is necessary for enzyme activation.The newly identified PKD contains a PH domain inserted between the second cysteine-rich motif and the kinase catalytic domain (9Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The presence of the PH domain distinguishes PKD from all known members of the PKC family. In the present study, we have deleted or mutated the PH domain of PKD and analyzed the regulatory properties of the resulting PKD mutants.In striking contrast to most previous studies showing that functional PH domains are necessary for enzyme activation, our results demonstrate that partial or complete deletions of the PH domain of PKD (see Fig. 5) resulted in PKD mutants that exhibit a high level of basal kinase activity. Single amino acid substitutions (e.g. R447C and W538A) within the PH domain also promoted an activated state of PKD. The R447C mutation was tested because a comparable mutation (R28C) in the PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is responsible for the induction of X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency in CBA/N mice (14Rawlings D.J.

Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). The W538A mutation alters the only invariant amino acid in the carboxyl-terminal α-helix and is conserved in all known PH domains (18Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 20Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the W538A mutation was as effective as partial or complete deletions of the PH domain in promoting an active state of PKD.Recent results demonstrated that treatment of intact cells with PDB, cell-permeant diacylglycerols, or bryostatin induces rapid PKD activation that was maintained during cell disruption and immunoprecipitation (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 44Matthews S.A. Pettit G.R. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20245-20250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence including the use of PKC inhibitors and cotransfection of PKD with constitutively activated mutants of PKCε and -η (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) indicate that PKD can be activated by phosphorylation in intact cells through a PKC-dependent signal transduction pathway. Our results demonstrate that PKD carrying deletions of the PH domain or the single amino acid substitution W538A within the α-helix of the PH domain were only slightly stimulated further by treatment of the cells with PDB, implying that PKD rendered active by PH domain mutation is already fully activated. We conclude that the integrity of the PH domain is critical for maintaining unstimulated PKD in a state of low catalytic kinase activity.The low basal activity of many protein kinases is maintained by the interaction between an autoinhibitory domain located within the enzyme with its catalytic site, thereby preventing the binding of substrates (45Smith M.K. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1837-1840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, all members of the PKC family from yeast to human PKCs possess an autoinhibitory motif that is located upstream of the first cysteine-rich domain (46Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, PKD does not contain a pseudosubstrate region in a comparable position (9Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Lint J.V. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although it is conceivable that PKD is also regulated by autoinhibition, as many other regulated protein kinases, the putative autoinhibitory region has not been identified yet. In view of our results, it is tempting to speculate that the PH domain of PKD has an inactivating function by functioning as an autoinhibitory domain. This suggests a novel role of PH domains in enzyme regulation. In the context of this model, partial or complete deletions of the PH domain of PKD or single amino acid substitutions within this domain should stabilize an active conformation of PKD as, in fact, it is shown by the mutational analysis presented here. Alternatively, our results cannot exclude the possibility that the PH domain of PKD could bind an inhibitory ligand(s) that is released by allosteric stimulation or by phosphorylation-dependent activation induced by treatment of intact cells with PDB. However, PH domain ligands such as phosphoinositides and βγ subunits of G proteins promote correct subcellular localization and enzyme activation rather than inhibition of enzyme activity (18Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J.

Future studies should attempt to distinguish between these alternative models.

https://openalex.org/W2011444716,"The co-stimulatory antigen CD28 has been shown to bind to several intracellular proteins including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), and ITK. Paradoxically, Grb2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding has been mapped to a similar pYMNM motif within the CD28 cytoplasmic tail. Given the importance of CD28 co-signaling to T cell function, questions exist regarding the mechanism by which Grb2 binds to CD28, and whether the interaction plays a role in co-stimulation. To biochemically characterize Grb2/CD28 binding, we initially utilized glutathioneS-transferase-Grb2 fusion proteins carrying inactivating mutations within the SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2, and assessed their ability to bind to CD28. In vitro binding experiments indicated that the Grb2 SH2 domain is critical for the association, while the SH3 domain plays an additional role in facilitating optimal binding. Enhanced binding via the SH3 domains was not observed when the C-terminal PXXP motif within CD28 was disrupted, thereby indicating that both SH2 and SH3 domains contribute to CD28 binding. Mutations that alter Grb2 binding were found to block the CD28-dependent interleukin-2 production. Further, tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and the costimulation-dependent activation of Jun N-terminal kinase was blocked in cells defective in CD28/Grb2 binding. These results provide evidence for an alternate CD28-mediated signaling process involving Grb2 binding to the co-receptor.

Although extensively studied, the manner by which CD28 generates co-signals remains to be fully understood. CD28 ligation leads to phosphorylation of the nonenzymatic cytoplasmic domain on tyrosine residues (8August A. Dupont B. Int.

Bierer B.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), Ras-MAPK/Erk signaling pathway (19Nunes J.A. Collette Y. Truneh A. Olive D. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp.

Further, stimulation of CD28 in the presence of T cell receptor ligation was shown to cause the activation of JNK/stress-activated protein kinase (22Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kullunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, Vav was found, when tyrosine phosphorylated, to function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac and result in the activation of JNK (23Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 24Han J. Das B. Wei W. Aelst L.V. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus the mechanism of CD28-dependent JNK activation may involve the phosphorylation of Vav and subsequent activation of Rac. Grb2 is an adapter protein, composed of two SH3 domains and an intervening SH2 domain (25Clark S.G. Stern M.J. Horvitz H.R.

Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). This protein plays a key role in the regulation of p21 ras activation by recruiting SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, to growth factor receptors (26Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G.

Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). In this case, specificity is determined by SH2 domain binding to a phosphorylated tyrosine residues within the motif pYXNX (28Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chandhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1665-1669PubMed Google Scholar). In certain of these instances such as with Grb2/Vav binding, the SH3 domain of Grb2 binds to the proline based motif PXXP (37Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the case of Grb2 binding to receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase α, tandem SH2/SH3 domain binding has been reported, although the SH3 domain appears to bind indirectly (38den Hertog J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Given this background, Grb2 binding to CD28 could connect this co-receptor to a number of downstream signaling events (15Schneider H. Cai Y.-C. Prasad K.V.S. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A potential difficulty with the interaction concerns the fact that Grb2 shows some constitutive binding to CD28, and the SH2 domain binds to the pYMNM motif, but with some 10–100-fold lower affinity than PI 3-kinase (15Schneider H. Cai Y.-C. Prasad K.V.S. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Despite this difference, the binding affinity of Grb2 for CD28 is comparable to other biologically relevant interactions such as between Grb2 and Shc (15Schneider H. Cai Y.-C. Prasad K.V.S. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have further characterized the molecular basis of Grb2/CD28 binding by providing data that Grb2 uses both its SH2 and SH3 domains in binding to CD28 at pYMNM (residues 191–194) and PXXPXR (residues 208–213), respectively. Moreover, the potential importance of Grb2 binding is underlined by the blocking effect of the N193Q mutation on CD28-induced enhancement of IL-2 production. The same mutation was also found to abolish tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and activation of JNK, raising the possibility that the requirement of Grb2 binding is linked to activation of Vav and JNK in costimulatory activation in some T-cells.

Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21), the murine T cell hybridoma DC27.10, CHO, and CHO-CD86 (stable transfectant of murine CD86) cells were maintained as described previously (39Cai Y.-C. Cefai D.

GST-Grb2 mutant constructs GST-Grb2-mSH2 (containing a R-to-K substitution at residue 86 in its SH2 domain), GST-Grb2-mSH3 (containing P-to-L mutations at residues 49 and 206 in SH3 domains), and GST-Grb2-mSH2/3 were kindly provided by Drs.

The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose. GST-phospholipase Cγ-NSH2 was a kind gift of Dr. K. Tachibana (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Overexpression of CD28 and Lck was achieved in Sf21 cells as described previously (40Raab M. Yamamoto M. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2862-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Production of baculoviruses harboring CD28-Phe191, Lck, and Grb2 was described elsewhere (39Cai Y.-C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). CD28-Ala211Ala212baculovirus was similarly generated. Sf21 cells were harvested 40–64-h postinfection, lysed in the Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 40 mmTris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatants were incubated with either GST fusion protein (1 μg) or anti-CD28 (4B10) and rabbit anti-mouse for 1 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose was added and rocked for another hour at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed five times with the lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies as described (41Kim H.-H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitates were subjected to kinase reaction as described (40Raab M. Yamamoto M. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2862-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The band corresponding to CD28 was excised from the membrane and resolved in 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. 900 μl of the Triton lysis buffer were added, and vigorous vortexing was followed. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g and incubated with GST fusion proteins for reprecipitation. The reprecipitated pellet was washed three times in the lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. For Fig.1 E, Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) replaced the in vitro labeling. 25 × 106 cells were electroporated with 40 μg of pEBG-JNK1 at 260 V and 960 μF (Bio-Rad). 20–40 h after transfection, cells were stimulated and disrupted in the Triton lysis buffer. Cleared lysates were then precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The precipitates were washed five times in the lysis buffer and subjected to kinase reaction with 3–5 μg of purified GST-c-Jun as a substrate for 20 min at RT. Phosphorylation of c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography. Flow cytometry and IL-2 bioassay were carried out as described previously (39Cai Y.-C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For cytometric analyses, anti-hCD28 (4B10), anti-mCD28 (37.51), and anti-CD3 (2C11) were used. The primary antibody was omitted in negative controls. We have previously reported that CD28 associates with Grb2 in human T cells (15Schneider H. Cai Y.-C. Prasad K.V.S. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Further analysis using various CD28 mutants identified the Tyr191 residue within the YMNM motif as crucial to this interaction (15Schneider H. Cai Y.-C. Prasad K.V.S. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 39Cai Y.-C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, in reconstitution studies, substitution of Tyr191 did not completely abolished Grb2 binding, suggesting that mechanism(s) other than SH2 domain binding may facilitate the interaction (39Cai Y.-C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In an effort to investigate this issue further, GST-Grb2 fusion proteins containing single residue mutations in the SH2 (GST-Grb2-mSH2; R86K), SH3 (GST-Grb2-mSH3; P49L and P206L), or both domains (GST-Grb2-mSH2/3; R86K, P49L, and P206L) were used in precipitation studies. Lysates from insect cells co-infected with baculoviruses carrying the human CD28 and the Lck cDNAs were precipitated and examined for a CD28 association with Grb2. We previously showed that p56 lck can phosphorylate CD28 at pYMNM and induce binding to PI 3-kinase (11Raab M. Cai Y.-C. Bunnell S.C. Heyeck S.D. Berg L.J. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8891-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, wild-type GST-Grb2 precipitated a broad ∼33 kDa band, as detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, which co-migrated with a polypeptide precipitated by anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (Fig.1 A, lanes 5 and 6). Western blotting with anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody confirmed the identity of this ∼33-kDa protein as CD28 (Fig.1 B). As expected, Grb2-WT was considerably more efficient in precipitating CD28 than GST-Grb2-mSH2 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 5). Nevertheless, the SH2 domain mutant did show some precipitation of Grb2 (lane 2), and mutations within the SH3 domains significantly decreased the precipitation of CD28 (lanes 3 and 5). Each of the GST preparations were routinely monitored for degradation, and equivalent amounts of protein was used in each precipitation. Densitometric analysis showed that CD28 recognition was reduced by 2.0- and 9.0-fold by inactivating the Grb2-SH3 and Grb2-SH2 domains, respectively (lower histogram). Neither GST nor GST-Grb2-mSH2/3 bound CD28 (lanes 1 and 4). As an additional negative control, neither Lck nor wild type baculovirus infection of cells allowed for precipitation of CD28 (lane 7 and data not shown). The ability of mutations in both the SH2 and SH3 domains to reduce precipitation efficacy suggested that both domains might play a role in recognizing CD28. It was possible that the CD28/Grb2 association was mediated by a third molecule endogenous to insect cells. To exclude this latter possibility, and as a further control for the specificity of Grb2 recognition, [γ-32P]ATP-labeled CD28 was eluted from the nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to reprecipitation. Under these conditions, GST-Grb2 reprecipitated CD28 (Fig.1 C, lane 5), and moreover, differential binding efficiency of the various Grb2 proteins was preserved (Fig.1 C, lanes 2–5, upper and lower panels). This result indicates that the Grb2 can bind directly to CD28, and that the full-length Grb2 protein binds more efficiently than the SH2 domain alone. To verify the specificity of the Grb2 SH2 domain for CD28 binding, SH2 domains from other signaling molecules were added to the analysis. The Grb2 SH2 domain (Grb2-mSH3) showed greater binding than the SH2 domains of phospholipase Cγ N-terminal, Fyn, and Lck (Fig. 1 D). By contrast, the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85 bound CD28 more efficiently than Grb2, which is consistent with the results of our previous peptide binding studies (14Prasad K.V.S. Cai Y.-C. Raab M. Duckworth B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2834-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 15Schneider H. Cai Y.-C. Prasad K.V.S. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The direct binding of Grb2 to CD28 was also examined using in vivo tyrosine phosphorylated CD28. For this assay, anti-CD28 precipitates from CD28/Lck infected cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the CD28 band was eluted and reprecipitated with GST-Grb2. Lane 1 in Fig. 1 E shows a portion of the eluted CD28. Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine revealed reprecipitation of CD28 under these conditions (Fig. 1 E,lane 3). Reprobing the membrane with anti-CD28 confirmed the identity of the reprecipitate as CD28 (data not shown). These data indicate that the Grb2 SH2 could recognize in vivophosphorylated CD28 in a direct and specific manner. The greater binding of wild type Grb2 relative to Grb2 with mutated SH3 domains suggested an involvement of the SH3 domain(s) in the Grb2/CD28 association. In this context, analysis of the CD28 cytoplasmic tail revealed two PXXP motifs (residues 196–199 and 208–211), the minimal consensus sequence for SH3 domain binding (Fig.2 A). As the first PXXP motif is not conserved in rat CD28 and the conserved second PXXP motif resembles more closely one of the two classes of proline-rich motifs (PXXPXR) (37Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that the second PXXP motif of CD28 interacts with the Grb2 SH3 domain. For this, alanine residues were substituted for prolines at residues 211 and 212 (CD28-Ala211Ala212). Binding of CD28-P211A/P212A to the various GST-Grb2 fusion proteins was then compared with that of CD28-WT. As shown in Fig. 2 B, binding of Grb2-WT to the CD28-P211A/P212A mutant was greatly reduced relative to wild type CD28 (lanes 5 versus 10). This indicated that the second PXXP motif contributed to the efficacy of Grb2/CD28 binding. Consistent with this, the SH2 domain mutant showed similar binding levels for both CD28-WT and CD28-Ala211Ala212 proteins (lanes 3and 8). Hence, the differential binding observed between Grb2-WT and Grb2-mSH3 for wild type CD28 was abolished when CD28 was mutated at the two proline residues (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 5 versus 8 and 10). This difference was not due to a difference in the levels of protein expression, or in the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation between the wild type and mutant CD28, as shown by immunoblotting with anti-CD28 and anti-Tyr(P) (Fig. 2 B, top right panel). Furthermore, the binding of the Grb2 SH3 domain (Grb2-mSH2) to CD28-WT was again detected in the absence of the SH2 domain-mediated binding (Fig. 2 B, lane 2, and Fig. 1 A,lane 2). Under the same experimental conditions, CD28-Ala211Ala212 was not precipitated by GST-Grb2-mSH2 (Fig. 2 B, lane 7). This difference in SH3 domain recognition was also observed using anti-CD28 in blotting (Fig. 2 B, lower right panel). These data indicate that there is an involvement of the PXXP motif/SH3 domain interaction in the CD28/Grb2 association. To examine the in vivo association of CD28 and Grb2, various CD28 mutants were expressed in the Sf21 cells. The expression levels of the wild type, Phe191, Cys194, and Ala211Ala212 were similar whereas Gln193 had a lower level of expression (Fig. 3 A, left panel). Tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Cys194 and Ala211Ala212 were a little higher than the wild type (Fig. 3 A, lanes 9 and 10 versus 6), suggesting that these two mutants might serve as better substrates for Lck in this system. The efficiency of tyrosine phosphorylation of Gln193 appeared similar to that of the wild type as the relative intensities of the wild type and Gln193 signals on the α-CD28 and α-Tyr(P) blots (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and 6 versus lanes 3 and 8) were similar when analyzed by densitometry (data not shown). As expected, substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine at 191 (CD28-Phe191) abrogated phosphorylation (Fig.3 A, lane 7). Loss of tyrosine in the YXNM motif of CD28 (CD28-Phe191) resulted in a great reduction of Grb2 binding (Fig. 3 B, lane 9 versus 8), although, as expected, residual Grb2 binding was still observed. Grb2 binding was also substantially decreased when the asparagine residue (Gln193) was altered (Fig. 3 B, lane 10). The apparent weaker signal of Gln193 relative to Phe191 in the Grb2 blot (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9 and 10) was due to the lower expression level of Gln193 compared with other CD28 constructs (Fig.3 A, left panel) as densitometric analyses showed similar intensities of Gln193 relative to WT in the CD28 (26%) and Grb2 (33%) blots. Significantly, mutation in the PXXP motif (CD28-Ala211Ala212) also diminished Grb2 binding (Fig. 3 B, lane 8 versus 12, 32% reduction indicated by densitometry) even though the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Ala211Ala212 was similar to or greater than the wild type (Fig. 3 A, right panel). These observations indicate that Grb2 SH3 domain recognition of the PXXPXR motif (residues 208–213) within CD28 occurred in vivo, and further that this recognition occurs independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, mutation of Met194 of the YMNM motif, the residue specifically required for the p85 SH2 but not for the Grb2 SH2 domain, did not affect Grb2 binding (Fig. 3 B, lane 11). Similar expression levels of Grb2 was found among the cells with a exception of Gln193 cells that had a little lower level of expression (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–6). The capability of the wild type and the mutants of CD28 to bind p85 was also compared. As expected, mutations of the residues critical for the p85 SH2 domain binding (Phe191 and Cys194) almost completely eliminated the p85 association (Fig. 3 C,lanes 8 and 10). The CD28-Ala211Ala212 mutant bound p85 as efficiently as the wild type (Fig. 3 C, lanes 7and 11). Binding of Gln193 was similar to wild type when the difference in the CD28 expression level was taken account (Fig. 3 C, lanes 7 and 9; Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and 3). The fact that the Ala211Ala212 and Gln193 mutants could bind p85 as efficiently as the wild type indicates that these mutants were not nonspecifically defective in an ability to bind intracellular proteins. Given our evidence for the binding of SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 to CD28, we studied the role of this interaction in CD28-mediated co-stimulation of IL-2 production. Stable DC27.10 cell lines transfected with mutant human CD28 cDNAs carrying substitutions in the YXNX motif were generated as described (39Cai Y.-C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analyses showed that the surface expression levels of CD3 and the endogenous mCD28 proteins were similar among the CD28 transfectants and that hCD28 was expressed in the Gln193clones at a higher level (Fig.4 A). Further, the level of hCD28 was severalfold higher than that of mCD28 (Fig. 4 A). Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and either CHO or CHO cells ectopically expressing CD86 (B7-2, the ligand for CD28), and the culture medium was assayed for IL-2. As previously reported (39Cai Y.-C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), co-stimulation of the wild type CD28 transfectants with CD86 in combination with a suboptimal anti-CD3 concentration enhanced IL-2 production (Fig. 4 B). Further, mutation of the Tyr191 reduced IL-2 production by 50–80%. Significantly, mutation of the N193Q in the YXNX motif also greatly reduced this co-stimulatory activity (Fig. 4 B). Two separate transfectants showed the same phenotype with inhibition of 50–70%. These observations implicate the residues needed for Grb2 binding in the generation of co-signals needed for IL-2 production. In the course of examining the signaling capacity of the wild type- and Gln193-CD28 in T cells, we observed a distinct 95-kDa protein that was prominently phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The phosphorylation of this protein was strongly enhanced upon stimulation of the wild type cells with B7-2, whereas stimulation of Gln193 did not lead to any increase of phosphorylation of this band (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1–4). Stripping and reprobing with an anti-Vav antibody identified the protein as Vav (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–8). Recently, tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav was reported to function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac, an upstream activator of JNK/stress-activated protein kinase (23Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 24Han J. Das B. Wei W. Aelst L.V. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the activation of JNK in the wild type and Gln193 cells. For JNK activity assay, JNK was precipitated from the wild type and Gln193 cells transiently transfected with JNK expression plasmid and subjected to in vitro kinase assay with GST-Jun as a substrate. In wild type-CD28 cells, some JNK activation was detected upon CD3 ligation with antibody and this activation was further enhanced by co-ligation of CD28 (Fig.5 B, lanes 1–4); a result consistent with a previous report (22Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kullunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The activation of JNK was also present in CD3-ligated Gln193 cells, however, importantly, further activation by the co-ligation of CD28 was not observed (Fig.5 B, lanes 5–8). These results implicate Grb2 binding to CD28 in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and consequently in the activation of JNK in T cells. To rule out the possibility that the Gln193 mutant cells lacked signaling capacity in general, we examined the CD28/p85 binding in these cells. Upon stimulation of wild type, Phe191, and Gln193cells with B7-2, comparable binding of p85 to the Gln193mutant and wild type CD28 was detected whereas Phe191 did not bind p85 (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that the lack of co-stimulation of the Gln193 cells in IL-2 production was not due to the inability of Gln193-CD28 to be phosphorylated on the site necessary for recruiting the PI 3-kinase signaling component and support that specific transduction pathway(s) involved in CD28 signaling was blocked in the Gln193 mutant cells rather than the cells were aberrantly defective in signaling. In summary, our observations provide strong evidence in support of Grb2 SH2 and SH3 domain binding to CD28. In several experiments, the Grb2 SH3 domain precipitated small, but reproducible amounts of CD28 in the absence of an intact SH2 domain (Figs. 1 and 2). Further, the CD28 molecule with a Phe191 mutation (a mutation that blocks SH2 domain binding) consistently co-precipitated Grb2 (Fig. 3). Taken together, the results indicate that the Grb2 SH3 domain(s) can directly recognize CD28 independent of SH2 domain binding. As shown with the use of the CD28-Ala211Ala212 mutant, the SH3 recognition required the intact PXXPXR site (residues 208–213). A similar PXXPXR site is recognized within dynamin and SOS (27Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 42Miki H. Miura K. Matuoka K. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5489-5492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Grb2 SH3/CD28 binding could account for the low level of constitutive Grb2/CD28 binding observed in resting T cells (15Schneider H. Cai Y.-C. Prasad K.V.S. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The Grb2 SH2 domain mutation reduced CD28 binding about 40–60% compared with the wild type Grb2 (Fig. 1 A). This contribution of the SH3 domain was abolished when the PXXPXR site was disrupted in CD28 (Fig.2 B) and was greater than the amount of CD28 precipitated directly by the Grb2 SH3 domain alone (Figs. 1 A and2 B). This result suggests that the SH2 and SH3 domains work cooperatively in recognition of CD28. Cooperative binding could occur upon activation and the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation, when residual SH3 domain binding is supplemented by additional SH2 domain binding. Alternatively, de novo supplemental SH3 domain binding could occur following the initiation of the SH2 domain binding. Together, the cooperative binding could enhance the avidity of Grb2 in binding to CD28 under circumstances where it may compete with PI 3-kinase recognition of the same YMNM site. Further structural studies should provide more detailed information on the nature of the SH2/SH3 binding to CD28. A potential role for the Grb2 SH2 binding in CD28-mediated co-stimulation was shown by the inhibitory effect of the asparagine-193 mutation on IL-2 production induced by anti-CD3 plus CD86 stimulation (Fig. 4). Although we can not exclude the possibility that another protein may also require the presence of asparagine residue, or that the mutation caused an indirect conformation effect, no effect on p85 binding was observed (Fig. 3). Under the conditions, IL-2 production was reduced by some 50–80% (Fig. 4). Unfortunately, transfection with the CD28-Ala211Ala212 failed to show a stable phenotype (data not shown). Therefore, in addition to PI 3-kinase (9Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar,39Cai Y.-C.

Immunol. 1996; 80: 1609-1616Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), mutations that alter Grb2 binding also influence IL-2 production. The C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 can bind to the Vav protein through the PXXP motif (36Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Schweighoffer F. Bismuth G. Camonis J. Tortolero M. Fischer S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1665-1669PubMed Google Scholar). Upon CD28 ligation, Vav in a complex with Grb2 may be recruited to the proximity of CD28 and its associated protein tyrosine kinase, and become tyrosine phosphorylated by the CD28-associated kinase. The phosphorylated Vav may then activate the downstream target molecule Rac that in turn engages the JNK activation cascade. As the activation of JNK has been shown to be essential for CD28 co-stimulation dependent IL-2 production (22Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kullunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), it can be postulated that the effect of Gln193mutation of CD28 on IL-2 production is due to the defect in tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and subsequent activation of the JNK pathway (Fig. 5, A and B). We thank Drs. T. Trub and S. E. Shoelson for providing the GST-Grb2 mutant constructs, Dr. L. Zon for JNK and c-Jun constructs, and Dr. K. Tachibana for GST-phospholipase Cγ-NSH2 fusion protein.

Lymph node adhesion is mediated by an interaction between the tumor cell integrin αvβ3 and lymph node vitronectin. In this study, we explored the relationship between adhesion and proteolysis by examining the direct effect of vitronectin receptor ligation on matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) production by B16F1 and B16F10 melanoma cells. We report a dose-dependent increase in secretion of both MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) in response to vitronectin. Cellular invasiveness was also enhanced by vitronectin, as shown by the increased ability of vitronectin-treated cells to invade a synthetic basement membrane (Matrigel). Both the vitronectin-induced MMP-2 production and vitronectin-enhanced invasion were blocked by the peptide ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS). Furthermore, neither plasmin-degraded vitronectin nor the peptide ligand RGDS stimulated MMP-2 secretion or invasiveness, indicating that a multivalent ligand-receptor interaction rather than simple receptor occupancy was required for MMP-2 induction. MMP-2 and MMP-2/TIMP-2 interaction with the plasma membrane of melanoma cells resulted in enhanced catalytic activity against 14C-labeled gelatin, suggesting that membrane association may function in posttranslational regulation of MMP-2 activity. This is supported by data showing increased cellular invasion by cells containing membrane-bound MMP-2. Binding of proMMP-2 and proMMP-2/TIMP-2 to melanoma cells was not inhibited by RGDS, and melanoma cell adhesion to vitronectin was unaffected by pro- or active MMP-2, indicating that MMP-2 did not interact with the murine vitronectin receptor. Together, these data provide evidence for a functional link between adhesion and proteolysis and suggest a potential mechanism whereby adhesion of an invasive cell to the extracellular matrix regulates subsequent invasive behavior.

Adhesion of tumor cells to specific extracellular matrix macromolecules is an initial component of the metastatic process (reviewed in Refs. 1Ruoslahti E. Giancotti F.G.

In metastatic melanoma, tumor cell adhesion to the regional lymph nodes, which correlates with poor prognosis, is mediated via interaction of specific integrins on the melanoma cell surface with lymph node vitronectin (3Nip J. Shibata H.R. Loskutoff D.J. Cheresh D.A. Brodt P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1406-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Previous data have demonstrated a relationship between elevated levels of vitronectin-binding integrins and increased melanoma cell invasiveness (4Albelda S.M. Mette S.A. Elder D.E. Stewart R. Damjanovich L. Herlyn M. Buck C.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6757-6764PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sanders L.C. Felding-Habermann B. Mueller B.M. Cheresh D.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Furthermore, ligation of the αvβ3 integrin on melanoma cells by anti-αvβ3 antibodies enhances secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2, gelatinase A, 72-kDa type IV collagenase), resulting in increased cellular invasiveness (7Seftor R.E.B. Seftor E.A. Gehlsen K.R. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Ruoslahti E. Hendrix M.J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that integrin-mediated binding of tumor cells to a specific matrix-associated protein, such as vitronectin, can promote tumor cell invasion by increasing the levels of a matrix-degrading proteinase. The majority of integrins recognize multiple extracellular matrix ligands (1Ruoslahti E. Giancotti F.G. Cancer Cells. 1989; 1: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9011) Google Scholar), and precise biologic responses may be regulated by differential integrin ligation with distinct extracellular matrix proteins. In this study, we have explored the direct effect of the matrix-associated ligand vitronectin on production of MMP-2 by melanoma cells. We report a dose-dependent increase in secretion of both MMP-2 1The abbreviations used are: MMP-2, matrix metalloproteinases-2; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; APMA, amino-phenylmercuric acetate. and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), as well as enhanced cellular invasiveness, in response to vitronectin. Intact vitronectin is required for MMP-2 induction because neither plasmin-treated vitronectin nor a peptide ligand (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS)) alters MMP-2 secretion, indicating the requirement for a multivalent ligand-receptor interaction. Furthermore, MMP-2 interacts with the plasma membranes of melanoma cells, exhibits enhanced catalytic activity relative to the solution phase enzyme, and increases cellular invasive activity. Membrane binding of MMP-2 is unaffected by RGDS, and melanoma cell adhesion to vitronectin is not inhibited by MMP-2, indicating that MMP-2 does not bind the vitronectin receptor on murine melanoma cells. These data suggest a potential physiologic mechanism whereby the relative integrity of the adhesive substratum may differentially regulate secretion and activity of a matrix-degrading proteinase and subsequent cellular invasive behavior. The murine B16F10 and B16F1 melanoma cell lines were obtained from Dr. I. J. Fidler (The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Hospital) and were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, l-glutamine, and vitamins. Prior to each experiment, cells were washed with calcium and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 2 min at 25 °C with 1 mm EDTA in serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium to release cells from the culture flask. Cells were seeded in 1 ml of serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated 18 h at 37 °C in the presence of vitronectin, peptide, or both as described below. In some experiments, colchicine (0.2 μm) was included for inhibition of secretion. Conditioned media were removed and concentrated 4-fold at 4 °C using a Centricon 10 (Amicon) concentrator and analyzed immediately as described below. Native vitronectin was purified from pooled human plasma according to the procedure of Dahlback and Podack (8Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, pooled plasma was subjected to salt fractionation followed by ion exchange, dye affinity, and gel filtration chromatography. Presence and purity of vitronectin in each fraction was assessed by both dot blot and electrophoretic analysis on 5–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. ProMMP-2 and proMMP-2/TIMP-2 complex were purified as described previously (9Young T.N. Rodriguez G.C. Moser T.L. Bast Jr., R.C. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1994; 170: 1285-1296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Plasminogen was purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography onl-lysine-Sepharose and separated into isoforms 1 and 2 as described previously (11Gonzalez-Gronow M. Robbins K.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Plasmin was generated by incubating 100 μg of plasminogen with 100 μl of urinary-plasminogen activator-Sepharose (Calbiochem) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, at 25 °C for 12 h followed by centrifugation to remove the resin. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an A 1 cm1 % value of 16.8 and molecular masses of 92 and 81 kDa for plasminogen and plasmin, respectively. Endoproteinase Glu-C from Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 (endoproteinase V8) and soybean trypsin inhibitor were purchased from Sigma and were coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The synthetic peptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), which blocks αvβ3 and αvβ5-mediated adhesion to vitronectin (12Felding-Habermann B. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and the noninhibitory control peptide Gly-Asp-Glu-Ser (RGES) were purchased from Sigma. Latent MMPs in concentrated conditioned medium were activated by incubation at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence of 1.0 mmamino-phenylmercuric acetate (APMA). Zymographic analysis of secreted MMPs was performed using 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing co-polymerized gelatin as described previously (13Stack M.S. Gray R.D. Pizzo S.V. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1998-2004PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse zymography for detection of TIMPs was performed using 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing co-polymerized gelatin and reagents purchased from University Technologies International (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Inactivation of the TIMP(s) in conditioned medium by reductive carboxymethylation was carried out as described by Salvesen and Nagase (14Salvesen G.S. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned medium was treated with 2 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with iodoacetamide (5 mm) for 15 min at 37 °C. In vitro invasive activity was assessed by determining the ability of cells to invade a synthetic basement membrane (Matrigel, Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). Polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size, Becton Dickinson) were coated with Matrigel (11 μg/filter) and placed in modified Boyden chambers. Cells (1 × 105) were added to the top of the chamber in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of vitronectin, plasmin-treated vitronectin, RGDS, or RGES. Following incubation for 8–24 h, noninvading cells were removed from the top surface of the membrane filter with a cotton swab, and filters were removed and stained with Diff-Quik (Fisher). Cells on the lower surface of the filter were enumerated using an ocular micrometer and counting a minimum of six high-powered fields. In some experiments, untreated cells (1 × 105) were preincubated for 90 min with MMP-2 (50 nm) in serum-free culture medium containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were pelleted, washed twice with PBS to remove unbound MMP-2, and enumerated, and invasiveness was assayed as described above. Limited plasmin proteolysis of vitronectin was carried out by incubating vitronectin and plasmin in a 20:1 (w/w) vitronectin:plasmin ratio for various time periods from 10 min to 3 h at 37 °C. After incubation, plasmin was removed from the reaction by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose, followed by centrifugation to remove the plasmin-soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose complex. Complete removal of plasmin was confirmed by addition of the synthetic plasmin substrated-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) and monitoring absorbance at 405 nm. Limited proteolysis of vitronectin by endoproteinase V8 was performed by incubating vitronectin (200 μg) with 200 μl of endoproteinase V8-Sepharose for various time periods from 30 min to 18 h at 25 °C, followed by centrifugation to remove the proteinase resin. Cleavage of vitronectin by MMP-2 was assessed by incubating vitronectin with activated MMP-2 in a 20:1 vitronectin:MMP-2 (w/w) ratio in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6 at 37 °C for 18 h. Intact vitronectin and vitronectin treated with plasmin, endoproteinase V8, or MMP-2 were analyzed by electrophoresis on 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Vitronectin was passively adsorbed to 24-well culture plates as described previously (15Moser T.L. Pizzo S.V. Bafetti L.M. Fishman D.A. Stack M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), blocked by incubating with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 25 °C, and utilized for cell attachment assays as described by Pierschbacher and Ruoslahti (16Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5985-5988Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a constant of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml in a total volume of 0.5 ml and incubated for 30–60 min on vitronectin-coated plates. After incubation, plates were washed twice with PBS, and bound cells were enumerated using an ocular micrometer and counting six high-powered fields. The effect of RGDS, RGES, proMMP-2, and active MMP-2 on adhesion to vitronectin was determined by addition of cells in the presence of various concentrations of peptide or proteinase to vitronectin-coated wells. To analyze binding of proMMP-2 or proMMP-2/TIMP-2 to intact melanoma cells, proteins were labeled with 125I using Iodogen (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Labeled protein (100 nm in minimal essential medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was added to B16F10 cells (5 × 104) for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations of RGDS or RGES peptide (0–1000 μg/ml). Cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and cell associated radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. To assess the interaction of proMMP-2 or proMMP-2/TIMP-2 with isolated melanoma cell membranes, melanoma cells were cultured overnight in serum-free medium, released from the flask with EDTA, and washed three times with PBS. The plasma membrane fractions of B16F1 (2 × 108) and B16F10 (4 × 108) cells were isolated using nitrogen cavitation (350 p.s.i., 20 min) and differential centrifugation as described previously (17Young T.N. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 999-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were treated with soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml), leupeptin (25 μg/ml), elastatinal (25 μg/ml), 3,4 dichloroisocoumarin (0.05 mm), and trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64, 0.01 mm) to prevent proteolysis of membrane proteins. B16F1 and B16F10 plasma membranes were incubated (2 h, 37 °C) with purified proMMP-2/TIMP-2 or proMMP-2 (100 nm) in 20 mm Tris, 5 mmCaCl2, 25 mm sucrose, pH 7.4 (Tris-Ca-sucrose). Control samples contained buffer alone. The membranes were recovered by centrifugation (50,000 × g for 30 min), supernatants were discarded, and pellets were washed twice in Tris-Ca-sucrose. Membrane extracts were prepared by incubating aliquots of membrane fractions with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 16 h followed by clarification by centrifugation (50,000 × g for 30 min) as described previously (17Young T.N. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 999-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After resuspension in Tris-Ca-sucrose, aliquots of membranes were analyzed for bound activity by gelatin zymography and by 14C-gelatin degradation (17Young T.N. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 999-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,18Harris E.D. Krane S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 258: 566-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 14C-Gelatin was incubated for 22 h at 37 °C with treated membrane aliquots in Tris-Ca-sucrose containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm APMA. Parallel experiments contained 1 mm o-phenanthroline. Reactions were stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and soluble radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Gelatin degradation by membrane-associated proteinase was determined relative to membrane-free controls. The effect of membrane association on the gelatinolytic activity of pre-activated MMP-2 was also determined as described previously (17Young T.N. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 999-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that treatment of A375M melanoma cells with antibodies directed against the vitronectin-binding integrin αvβ3 enhanced MMP-2 secretion and stimulated cellular invasion through Matrigel (7Seftor R.E.B. Seftor E.A. Gehlsen K.R. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Ruoslahti E. Hendrix M.J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To analyze the direct effect of vitronectin on melanoma MMP-2 secretion, B16F1 and B16F10 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of vitronectin, and secretion of gelatin-degrading MMPs was analyzed by zymography. A dose-dependent increase in secretion of a gelatinolytic metalloproteinase was observed in the conditioned medium of vitronectin-treated B16F1 cells (Fig. 1) and B16F10 cells (Fig. 2 A). The gelatinolytic enzyme was activated by treatment with APMA, inhibited by the zinc chelator o-phenanthroline (data not shown), and co-migrated with authentic MMP-2, suggesting its identity as MMP-2. MMP-2 secretion was not detectable by zymography in untreated B16F1 or B16F10 cells (Fig. 1, lane 1, and Fig. 2,lane 1), but it was observed in cells treated with as little as 10 μg/ml vitronectin. Addition of vitronectin in the presence of RGDS peptide inhibited the vitronectin-induced MMP-2 secretion, demonstrating that direct interaction of vitronectin with its cellular receptor is required for MMP-2 induction (Fig. 1). Furthermore, vitronectin-induced MMP-2 secretion was inhibited by colchicine, demonstrating that vitronectin does not displace MMP-2 from a common cell surface receptor such as αvβ3 (data not shown). Analysis of TIMP-2 activity by reverse zymography revealed a metalloproteinase inhibitor that co-migrated with TIMP-2 (M r21,000) in the conditioned medium of untreated cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 1), which was increased in vitronectin-treated cells (Fig.2 B, lanes 2–4). Incubation of the conditioned medium samples with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide, a procedure shown to denature TIMP to a noninhibitory form (14Salvesen G.S. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar), removed the TIMP-2 activity from the conditioned medium (Fig. 2 C). Vitronectin treatment also enhanced cell surface-associated MMP-2. B16F1 and B16F10 cells cultured with vitronectin (50 μg) displayed a 17 and 20% increase in cell surface MMP-2, respectively, as determined by cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an anti-MMP-2 antibody and an alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (15Moser T.L. Pizzo S.V. Bafetti L.M. Fishman D.A. Stack M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To assess the functional effect of MMP-2 induction, the ability of melanoma cells to penetrate a synthetic basement membrane (Matrigel) was analyzed. Both B16F1 and B16F10 cells displayed enhanced in vitro invasive behavior when cultured in the presence of vitronectin (Fig.3).Figure 2MMP and TIMP activity in B16F10-conditioned medium. B16F10 cells (1 × 106) were cultured for 18 h in serum-free medium containing 0 (lane 1), 100 (lane 2), 200 (lane 3), or 300 (lane 4) μg/ml vitronectin, and conditioned media were analyzed for MMP activity by gelatin zymography on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (A) and for TIMP activity by reverse zymography on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (B and C).

Gray R.D. Pizzo S.V. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1998-2004PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin is a broad spectrum serine proteinase that degrades numerous extracellular matrix proteins, including vitronectin (19Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of plasmin-degraded vitronectin on melanoma cell MMP-2 secretion, vitronectin was subjected to limited proteolysis with plasmin (Fig. 4 C, lane 2) prior to incubation with melanoma cells. In contrast to results observed with intact vitronectin (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), plasmin-degraded vitronectin did not induce MMP-2 secretion (Fig.4 A, lane 3). Decreasing the extent of proteolysis did not reinstate the stimulatory effect (data not shown). Because plasmin has trypsin-like specificity and therefore may cleave within the RGD site utilized by melanoma cells for integrin-mediated vitronectin binding, limited proteolysis of vitronectin with endoproteinase V8 (which has Glu specificity (20Houmard J. Drapeau G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 306-309Crossref Scopus (628) Google Scholar)) was also performed (Fig. 4 C, lane 4). Similar to results obtained with plasmin, endoproteinase V8-cleaved vitronectin also failed to induce melanoma cell MMP-2 production (Fig.4 B, lane 3). Furthermore, Matrigel invasion was not stimulated by endoproteinase V8-cleaved vitronectin (Fig. 3,hatched bar). To determine whether MMP-2 itself may initiate vitronectin degradation, vitronectin was incubated with APMA-activated MMP-2 for 18 h at 37 °C at a 1:20 MMP-2:vitronectin ratio and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. No change in the electrophoretic migration of MMP-2-treated vitronectin was observed (Fig. 4 D, lane 2), demonstrating that vitronectin is not susceptible to proteolysis by MMP-2. To analyze further the effect of ligating the melanoma cell vitronectin receptor on MMP-2 secretion, the peptide RGDS, which interacts with both the αvβ3 and αvβ5 vitronectin receptors (12Felding-Habermann B. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), was utilized. Control experiments demonstrated binding of RGDS to vitronectin receptors on B16F1 and B16F10 cells, as evidenced by the ability of the peptide to inhibit melanoma cell adhesion to vitronectin in a concentration-dependent manner (TableI). Incubation of either B16F1 or B16F10 cells with up to 1 mg/ml of RGDS or RGES did not induce MMP-2 secretion (data not shown). However, simultaneous addition of vitronectin and RGDS inhibited vitronectin-induced MMP-2 secretion as shown in Fig. 1(lane designated 100+). Furthermore, inhibition of vitronectin-enhanced Matrigel invasion was 50% greater using RGDS peptide as compared with RGES (Fig. 5), further demonstrating that interaction of the RGD sequence of vitronectin with a cellular integrin(s) is necessary for MMP-2 induction.Table IEffect of RGDS on adhesion of B16F1 and B16F10 cells to vitronectinRGDSInhibitionB16F1B16F10μg/ml%0005021 ± 3.516 ± 9.010044 ± 1.740 ± 11.920089 ± 0.672 ± 16.0 Open table in a new tab Because recent data indicate that MMP activity may be regulated posttranslationally by interaction with the cell surface (17Young T.N.

Analysis of MMP-2 binding to the membranes of intact melanoma cells was assessed using 125I-labeled proMMP-2 or proMMP-2/TIMP-2. Attempts to determine an equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of either proMMP-2 or proMMP-2/TIMP-2 to intact cells were unsuccessful because saturation of binding sites was not achieved in the presence of 125I-labeled ligand concentrations up to 500 nm (data not shown). These data suggest that proMMP-2 and/or proMMP-2/TIMP-2 interacts with a prevalent cell-associated protein such as collagen or fibronectin (25Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3159-3167PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

To determine whether proMMP-2 or proMMP-2/TIMP-2 may associate with vitronectin binding integrins, binding experiments were performed in the presence of RGDS. No significant change in the amount of bound proMMP-2 or proMMP-2/TIMP-2 was observed in the presence of up to 1 mg/ml (2.3 mm) RGDS or control peptide RGES (TableII), suggesting that interaction of proMMP-2 and proMMP-2/TIMP-2 with intact murine melanoma cells is not mediated by vitronectin-binding integrins. This was confirmed by adhesion experiments that demonstrated that MMP-2, whether in proenzyme or active form, was unable to inhibit melanoma cell adhesion to vitronectin (Table III).Table IIEffect of RGDS on binding of proMMP-2 and proMMP-2/TIMP-2 to B16F10 cells[Peptide]ProMMP-2 boundProMMP-2/TIMP-2 boundRGDSRGESRGDSRGESμg/ml%%0100.0 ± 2.9100.0 ± 2.9100.0100.0192.8 ± 0.897.4 ± 2.1105.094.01091.5 ± 9.495.1 ± 3.389.698.010091.8 ± 11.194.5 ± 4.985.096.0100094.5 ± 6.291.5 ± 0.590.696.0 Open table in a new tab Table IIIEffect of MMP-2 on melanoma cell adhesion to vitronectinTreatmentConcentrationAdhesionng/mlNo. of cells/fieldControl70.6 ± 17.5ProMMP-235084.2 ± 8.270076.0 ± 9.4Active MMP-235072.4 ± 25.070065.8 ± 8.3 Open table in a new tab In addition to binding to intact cells, exogenous proMMP-2 (data not shown) and proMMP-2/TIMP-2 bound to isolated plasma membranes from both B16F1 and B16F10 cells and retained hydrolytic activity against a macromolecular gelatin substrate (Fig. 6,A and B). Gelatinolytic activity was not detected in either clone of B16 plasma membranes prior to the addition of exogenous proMMP-2 or proMMP-2/TIMP-2 (Fig. 6), which is consistent with the lack of MMP-2 secretion observed in unstimulated cells (Figs.1 and 2). The membrane-associated gelatinolytic activity was fully inhibited by addition of o-phenanthroline (Fig.6 B). Furthermore, membrane association enhanced the catalytic activity of activated MMP-2/TIMP-2. Incubation of MMP-2/TIMP-2 with either plasma membranes or detergent soluble extracts from B16F1 and B16F10 cells resulted in a 33–76% increase in gelatinolytic activity (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that membrane association may function as a mechanism for posttranslational regulation of MMP-2/TIMP-2 activity in melanoma cells. To assess the potential functional consequence of MMP-2 cellular association on invasive behavior, cells were incubated with 50 nm MMP-2 in serum-free culture medium containing 3% bovine serum albumin, washed to remove unbound MMP-2, and analyzed in a Matrigel invasion assay. A 3-fold increase in invasiveness was observed in cells containing bound MMP-2 relative to controls (Table IV), demonstrating that cellular association of MMP-2 contributes functionally to enhanced invasiveness.Table IVEffect of cell-associated MMP-2 on Matrigel invasionSampleRelative invasionNo. of cells/fieldControl22.0 ± 5.9+50 nm proMMP-268.4 ± 11.6 Open table in a new tab The initial site of melanoma cell metastasis in vivo is frequently the regional lymph nodes, and the appearance of lymph node metastases is correlated with poor prognosis (3Nip J. Shibata H.R. Loskutoff D.J. Cheresh D.A. Brodt P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1406-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Studies of experimental metastasis using B16F1 and B16F10 cells demonstrated similar incidence of lymph node metastases, although animals injected with B16F10 cells were more likely to develop pulmonary metastases (28Nathanson S.D. Haas G.P. Mead M.J. Lee M. J. Surg. Oncol. 1986; 33: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression of the vitronectin-binding integrin αvβ3 is enhanced in metastatic melanoma cells relative to parental nonmetastatic variants and recent experiments have demonstrated that adhesion of metastatic melanoma cells to lymph node sections is blocked by either anti-αvβ3 or RGD-containing peptides (3Nip J. Shibata H.R. Loskutoff D.J. Cheresh D.A. Brodt P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1406-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In related experiments, ligation of melanoma cell αvβ3 using an anti-integrin antibody was shown to enhance cellular invasiveness in vitro, and conditioned medium from cells treated with anti-αvβ3 displayed increased MMP-2 activity (7Seftor R.E.B. Seftor E.A. Gehlsen K.R. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Ruoslahti E. Hendrix M.J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). This is particularly interesting in light of previous data that indicate that MMP-2 expression by melanoma cells correlates with increased invasiveness, and it provides a biochemical mechanism whereby invasion may be enhanced (29Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Thorgeirsson U.P. Hart I.R. Grant S.S. Liotta L.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1985; 75: 99-103PubMed Google Scholar, 30Liotta L. Rao C.N. Wewer U.M. Annu. Rev.

These observations are supported by data from the present study that demonstrate a direct dose-dependent increase in MMP-2 secretion in vitronectin-treated B16F1 and B16F10 melanoma cells. As a functional consequence of increased MMP-2 levels, cellular invasiveness is also enhanced. The vitronectin-induced increase in MMP-2 secretion and invasive activity was abolished by RGDS peptide, providing evidence that vitronectin interaction with cellular integrins regulates invasive behavior. Concomitant with MMP-2 secretion, levels of TIMP-2 were also increased by vitronectin treatment. Previous studies have shown that MMP-2 is secreted as a proenzyme in complex with TIMP-2 by melanoma cells and other cell types, and additional reports suggest that the presence of TIMP-2 in this proenzyme-inhibitor complex is required for cellular activation of the MMP-2 zymogen by membrane-type MMPs (24Strongin A.Y.

The present data demonstrate that MMP-2/TIMP-2 associates with the plasma membrane fraction of murine melanoma cells and exhibits enhanced catalytic activity against macromolecular substrates relative to the solution phase enzyme supporting the role of membrane association in MMP regulation. The mechanism of interaction of proMMP-2 and proMMP-2/TIMP-2 with B16F1 and B16F10 cells is currently unknown. However, it has recently been reported that recombinant chick MMP-2 binds to hamster melanoma cells transfected with the β3 integrin subunit via a direct interaction with αvβ3, which is inhibited by RGD peptides, as well as to purified αvβ3 immobilized on microtiter wells (37Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the results of the present study, which show that binding of human proMMP-2 and proMMP-2/TIMP-2 to intact murine melanoma cells is not RGD-mediated. This is supported by the observation that MMP-2 secretion by vitronectin-treated cells was inhibited by colchicine, demonstrating that the enhanced proteinase levels observed were not due simply to displacement of MMP-2 by vitronectin from a common cell surface receptor. Furthermore, neither the peptide RGDS nor endoproteinase V8-treated vitronectin, both of which bind the cellular vitronectin receptor, increased the level of MMP-2 in conditioned medium. In addition, neither pro- nor active MMP-2 inhibited cell adhesion to vitronectin. The discrepancy between results reported in the current study and those of Brooks et al.(37Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar) may reflect differences in the distinct model systems employed. Alternatively, differences in the activation state of the enzymes may also influence cellular association because proteolytic activity may alter (or confer) cell binding ability. The complex array of functions attributed to integrins, including cell-matrix adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction, results from a cellular ability to discriminate functionally between transmembrane signals induced by simple ligand occupancy, receptor aggregation, or simultaneous occupancy and aggregation (38Miyamoto S.

In the present study MMP-2 secretion was induced by intact vitronectin in both B16F1 and B16F10 cells; however, limited proteolysis of vitronectin removed the stimulatory effect, regardless of whether the RGD site was disrupted (plasmin) or remained intact (endoproteinase V8). Furthermore, simple ligation of the vitronectin receptor with the peptide RGDS also failed to induce MMP-2 activity at concentrations well in excess of that required for inhibition of cell adhesion. However, antibody ligation of melanoma cell αvβ3, which can induce receptor aggregation, stimulated MMP-2 production (7Seftor R.E.B. Seftor E.A. Gehlsen K.R. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D.

Together, these data indicate that a multivalent ligand-receptor interaction, rather than simple ligand occupancy, is required for induction of MMP-2. In light of these results, it is interesting to consider recent biophysical data that demonstrate that under physiologic conditions, vitronectin can exist in both monomeric and multimeric forms (39Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14323-14332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Vitronectin in extravascular sites (i.e. matrix and tissue-associated) is predominantly in the multimeric form, suggesting that multivalent ligand-receptor interactions may prevail in vivo (39Zhuang P.

Furthermore, the current data suggest a biologic control mechanism whereby the stimulus for MMP-2 induction, i.e. intact vitronectin, may be removed. It is interesting to speculate that vitronectin-adherent melanoma cells, which also catalyze tissue-type plasminogen activator-mediated plasmin generation (13Stack M.S. Gray R.D. Pizzo S.V. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1998-2004PubMed Google Scholar), may initiate plasmin-dependent proteolysis of vitronectin, thereby disrupting the multivalent signal necessary for MMP-2 induction.

The novelets-related transcription factor (ERT) showed a homology with the ETS DNA-binding domain. Using constructs of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) type II receptor (RII) promoter linked to the luciferase gene, we have demonstrated that ERT activates transcription of the TGF-β RII gene through the 5′-TTTCCTGTTTCC-3′ response element spanning nucleotides +13 to +24 and multiple additional ETS binding sites between −1816 and −82 of the TGF-β RII promoter. A specific interaction between ERT and the ETS binding sites was also demonstrated using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Deletion mapping of ERT protein suggests that the transactivation domain resides in the amino terminus while the DNA-binding domain is localized to the carboxyl-terminal region. Our results suggest that ERT might be a major transcription factor involved in the transcriptional regulation of the TGF-β RII gene.

Aberrant TGF-β function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, and it has also been suggested that diminished responsiveness to TGF-β may contribute to the process of malignant transformation (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 419-472Google Scholar). This decreased responsiveness to TGF-β could be caused by defects not only in TGF-β expression or activation but also by defects in the regulation of TGF-β receptors (3Park K. Kim S.-J. Bang Y.-J.

Much work has recently been directed toward characterizing the TGF-β receptors and their intracellular signaling pathways. TGF-β type II and type I receptors (TGF-β RII and RI, respectively) are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases that together are sufficient for signal transduction (7Lin H. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R. Lodish H. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Association between the type I and type II receptors is essential for signaling responses (8Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). It has been repeatedly demonstrated that a genetic alteration of either RI or RII resulting in dominant negative or loss of function can lead to loss of responsiveness (3Park K. Kim S.-J. Bang Y.-J.

In a previous study, our laboratory described a series of gastric cancer cell lines in which resistance to TGF-β is correlated with gross structural mutations in the TGF-β RII gene (3Park K. Kim S.-J. Bang Y.-J. Park J.-G. Kim N.K. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8772-8776Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). We have now studied several additional TGF-β-resistant cell lines in which Southern analysis failed to show gross deletions or rearrangements, yet in which no TGF-β RII protein or mRNA was produced. This suggested that abnormalities in transcriptional regulation of the type II receptor might also be found to underlie certain instances of escape from TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition. We have recently cloned and sequenced the promoter region of the TGF-β RII gene, identified several positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements, and reported the relevant target sequences for three putative novel transcriptional factor complexes (13Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Kim D.H.

Basal levels of transcription are determined by the core promoter element in cooperation with both PRE1 and PRE2 (positive regulatory elements 1 and 2). PRE1, consisting of nucleotides −219 to −172, contains two discrete target sequences that bind an AP1/CREB-like transciption factor in addition to an unidentified novel transcription factor complex. PRE2 is located between +1 and +35 and contains two overlapping target sequences, both of which appear to bind novel transcription factor complexes. To identify potential transcriptional activators of the TGF-β RII gene, we adapted the yeast one-hybrid system (15Li J.J. Herkowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) to find proteins that recognize the PRE2 of the TGF-β type II receptor gene. Screening a human placenta cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain, we isolated a cDNA clone that induced greater LacZ activity. DNA sequencing analysis of a corresponding plasmid, pACT2ERT, revealed that the encoded gene belongs to a novel member of the etstranscription factor family (16Watson D.K. McWilliam M.J. Lapis P.

Further, we demonstrate that the ERT protein specifically binds to the PRE2 region of the TGF-β RII gene and activates its transcription. The following oligonucleotides, 5′-GAGGAGTTTCCTGTTTTCCCCCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGGGGAAACAGGTAAACTCCTC-3′, containing the previously described PRE2 binding site were synthesized and annealed (13Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The PRE2 mutant oligonucleotides were constructed by replacing the underlined sequences with 5′-AAGTG-3′ and 5′-CACTT-3′, respectively. The oligonucleotides were ligated and subcloned into theBamHI site of pUC18. A fragment corresponding to a four tandem repeat was subcloned into the yeast reporter plasmids, pHlSi and pLacZi (CLONTECH). The reporter constructs were subsequently integrated into the yeast strain YM4271 yielding YM4271::PRE2::His3 (or lacZ) and YM4271::PRE2M::His3 (orlacZ). These yeast strains were used as host strains for the library screen. Saccharomyces cerevisiae YM4271 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, leu2–3, 112, trp1–903, tyr1–501) was purchased fromCLONTECH and used for yeast transformation.Escherichia coli strains DH5α and DH10B (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for subcloning and electroporation experiments. The histidine yeast reporter strain YM4271-PRE2-His3 was transformed with a MATCHMAKER human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) by the LiAc/polyethylene glycol method. Approximately 5 × 104 transformants were plated per 150-mm dish containing his−leu− minimal selective medium supplemented with 45 mm 3-aminotriazole. Approximately 2 × 106 cDNA plasmids were screened in three different transformations. Based on large colony size and rapid growth, a total of 30 histidine positive clones were selected. Plasmids were recovered and electroporated into the E. colistrain DH10B. Plasmids were rescreened by transforming YM4271-PRE2-lacZ and plated on leu−ura− minimal medium. The filter replica method using X-gal (40 μg/ml) was used to confirm β-galactosidase activities. One plasmid, pACT2ERT, showed the strongest blue color. The specific DNA binding of pACT2ERT was confirmed by comparing the β-galactosidase activities of wild-type and mutant reporter strains using both the filter replica method and O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) liquid method (CLONTECH). The plasmid pcDNA3.1-ERT was generated by subcloning a 2.5-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment containing the entire ERT coding sequence into theEcoRI-HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). The plasmid pGL2-pro derivatives including wild-type and mutant PRE2 sequences were constructed by inserting theKpnI-XbaI fragment of pUC18/PRE2 and pUC18/PRE2M into the KpnI-NheI site of pGL2-pro (Promega). The construction of plasmid −219/+35pTBPII-luc is explained elsewhere (13Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol.

TGF-β RII promoter-luciferase constructs were generated by polymerase chain amplification using genomic DNA containing the 5′-untranslated region of TGF-β RII as a template. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into a promoterless luciferase expression plasmid, pGL2 (Promega) using BglII and SstI restriction sites built into the oligonucleotides used for amplification.

Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). ERT DNA fragments were produced by polymerase chain reaction. For the construction of AU-tagged ERT expression plasmids, polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into elongation factor-1 promoter, pCEFL-AU5, using standard methods to generate pCEFL-AU-ERT (1–371, 1–301, 1–200, 1–120, 120–371, 200–371, and 301–371). One μg of DNA of pcDNA3.1(−)-ERT constructs was used as the DNA template forin vitro RNA transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). The RNAs were translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and [35S]methonine. Expressed proteins were electrophoresed on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, dried, and autoradiographed. In vitro translated protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubating at room temperature for 20 min with 10,000 cpm of32P-labeled probe, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothretiol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, bovine serum albumin (300 μg/ml) in 20 μl of binding mixture. HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cell line was maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the transient expression assays, cells were transfected using the Lipofectin-mediated transfection method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following incubation with Lipofectin for 15 min, cells were incubated for 48 h. The cells were then harvested, and luciferase activity was measured. β-Galactosidase activity was used to correct for transfection efficiencies. SNU620 human gastric cancer cells, HeLa229 human cervical cancer cells, and SK-BR3 breast cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Total RNA was isolated from cells using guanidium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform. 10 μg of RNA was eletrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 0.66 m formaldehyde, transferred to a Duralon-UV membrane, and cross-linked with a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). Blots were prehybridized and hybridized in 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C. RNA blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for ERT/ESX/ESE-1 (23Chang C.-H. Scott G.H. Kuo W.-L. Xiong X. Suzdaltseva Y. Park J.W. Sayre P. Erny K. Collins C. Gray J.W. Benz C.C.

We are interested in isolating novel transcription factors that regulate expression of the TGF-β RII gene. The “yeast one-hybrid” strategy (15Li J.J. Herkowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) was used to screen for human placenta cDNAs encoding for proteins which bind to the TGF-β RII receptor promoter PRE2. Four tandem copies of the PRE2 were ligated together and subcloned into the upstream region of the minimal promoter of either the pHISi or pLacZi reporter plasmids and integrated into the yeast genome of YM4271 (Fig.1 A). The nucleotide sequence of the ligated PRE2 was verified by DNA sequencing. With the strategy described under “Materials and Methods,” we isolated several plasmids that induced greater LacZ activity in YM4271 (PRE2wt). One cDNA clone, pACT2ERT, showed the strongest blue color on β-galactosidase assay utilizing the filter replica method. Liquid assay of β-galatosidase activity using ONPG as a substrate confirmed the specific transcriptional activation of pACT2ERT. While the presence of the pACT2ERT plasmid doubled β-galactosidase activity in the wild-type strain, it did not increase enzymatic activity in the mutant strain (Fig. 1 B). The complete sequence of a 2.5-kb cDNA insert was determined by the dideoxy sequencing method. The 2.5-kb ERT cDNA contains a 1116-base pair open reading frame that encodes a 371-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 41,000 daltons.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 771-779PubMed Google Scholar) in the ETS domain. There is no significant homology between ERT and any other ets family members outside the carboxyl-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis of various cancer cell lines showed a major 2.2-kb and a minor 2.7-kb message when probed with the cloned 2.5-kb ERT cDNA insert (Fig. 2). Since the major 2.2-kb ERT mRNA is smaller than the cloned 2.5-kb ERT cDNA insert, we probed the same blot with the 3′-UTR sequences from nucleotides 1980 to 2529. This 3′-UTR probe recognized only the 2.7-kb ERT transcript (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6), suggesting that the two different ERT transcripts resulted from alternative poly(A) signals. Most of the ets family members are known to be potent transcriptional activators when tested in transient transfection assays (22Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To analyze the ability of ERT to activate the TGF-β type II receptor promoter, the TGF-β RII promoter-luciferase constructs were cotransfected with an expression vector for ERT into HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cells. While ERT did not induce luciferase expression in the control reporter construct, we found ERT to be a potent transcriptional activator of the TGF-β type II receptor promoter construct. As seen in Fig. 3, −1,670/+36pTBPII-luc construct was induced 5-fold by ERT. The −1,670/+36mtpTBPII-luc construct, in which the second positive regulatory element was mutated, was also activated more than 2.5-fold, suggesting that the fragment between −1,670 and +2 contains multiple ERT regulatory sequences (Fig.3). In the previous study (13Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we reported that at least two distinct nuclear DNA binding proteins shared a common recognition sequence from +11 to +29 in the PRE2 of the TGF-β type II receptor promoter. This sequence contains two putative target sequences for protein-binding of ets family members in a reverse-orientation (5′-GGAAACAGGAAACT-3′). Competitive inhibition for DNA binding to the +1/+50 sequence was abolished by mutation of nucleotides +16 to +20 (see Fig. 6 B).Figure 6Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ofin vitro translated ERT. A, intact ERT and the ERT deletion mutant were transcribed in vitro with T7 polymerase and translated in the rabbit reticulocyte system in the presence of [35S]methionine (arrowheads). TheBamHI restriction enzyme was used to generate a construct in which the carboxyl-terminal region common to the ets family members was deleted. B, gel shift assays demonstrating that ERT binds to the PRE2 of the TGF-β type II receptor promoter (arrowhead). The PRE2 probe used in all reactions was a32P-labeled dimer of the oligonucleotide +1/+50, a wild-type PRE2. Cold competitor oligonucleotides were present at 100-fold molar excess. The sequences of the competitors used in this experiment are shown at the top. The underlined bases show the mutated nucleotides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the putative ERT response element in the second positive regulatory element, we generated chimeric constructs containing four tandemly linked copies of the PRE2 sequence of the TGF-β RII promoter between +1 and +36 linked to a pGL2-promoter. Mutated forms of the putative ERT responsive elements (shown inbold) were generated by nucleotide substitution as described in Fig. 4 A. In cotransfection assays, ERT induced luciferase expression by the wild-type construct (WT-luc) approximately 3.5-fold over that of the control. Mutation of nucleotides +16 to +20 of the ERT response element in construct MT1-luc resulted in significant reduction in transcriptional activation (Fig.4 B). Therefore, the sequence 5′-TTTCCTGTTTTCC-3′ (GGAAACAGGAAA in a reverse orientation) located between +13 and +24 appears to be responsible for ERT-mediated activation of the TGF-β type II receptor gene. Next, we mutated the individual ETS binding site (EBS) in the second positive regulatory element to see whether both EBSs are required for the maximum induction of TGF-β type II receptor promoter activity by ERT. MT2, in which the first EBS is mutated (Fig.4 A), was induced 2-fold by ERT, and MT3, in which the second EBS was mutated, was also induced 1.5-fold, whereas MT4, in which both EBSs were mutated, showed little induction (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that ERT can activate the TGF-β type II receptor promoter through either EBS but that both sites are required for the maximal induction. We next examined whether additional EBS might be identified in the entire TGF-β RII promoter. A computer search revealed multiple copies of EBS between −1816 and +25 (Fig. 5). As seen in Fig. 3, the activity of TGF-β type II receptor promoter-luciferase contructs was induced 2- to 4-fold by ERT. The activity of contruct −70/+36 was induced 2-fold by ERT, suggesting that this induction was due to EBSs located in +8/+36 promoter region since no EBS is present in the sequences between −70/−1. Upon mutating the two EBSs between +8/+25 (−1670/+36mt), basal levels of activity dropped 2-fold suggesting that these sites are required for the basal expression of the TGF-β type II receptor. In the presence of ERT, the mutated construct induced activity 2-fold, indicating that other upstream EBSs are also responsive to ERT. To analyze the ability of ERT to bind to the TGF-β RII promoter element PRE2,in vitro translated ERT protein was made by subcloning theEcoRI-BglII portion of the insert into theEcoRI-BamHI site of pcDNA3.1. This 41-kDain vitro translated ERT protein was consistent with the predicted size of the open reading frame and was used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig.6 A). A radiolabeled PRE2 (+1/+50) probe was incubated with in vitro translated ERT protein in competition with unlabeled PRE2 and mutant PRE2 oligonucleotides. While specific unlabeled competitors competed for labeled protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 6 B, lane 4), oligonucleotides mutated in nucleotides +16 to +20 comprising the ETS-binding site (lane 5) did not compete for binding to ERT. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal ETS-domain from the ERT protein produced a smaller protein of approximately 30 kDa (Fig. 6 A,lane 3) that failed to interact with the wtPRE2 (Fig.6 B, lane 6). To analyze the DNA sequence requirements for the binding of ERT and the relative binding affinities, we designed oligonucleotides encoding a whole spectrum of different functionally relevant binding sites for ets-related factors, including the site in the interleukin-2 receptor β-chain gene (Fig.7 A). The relative binding affinities of ERT for these sites were compared with its affinity for the human TGF-β RII promoter ETS sites. Equivalent amounts of wild-type labeled oligonucleotides were used as probes in EMSAs with equal amounts of full-length ERT in vitro translated protein (Fig. 7 B). The in vitro translated ERT formed a complex with all the ets-related binding site oligonucleotides tested but with different affinities (Fig.7 B). EBS oligonucleotides in the TCRα enhancer Tα2, polyomavirus PEA3, and HTLV-1 LTR promoters bound to the ERT with strong affinity, whereas ERT interacted with IL-2-receptor β chain, β2 integrin CD18, and HIV2 LTR ets binding site oligonucleotides with weaker affinities. To determine if ERT binding correlates to the transcriptional induction by ERT, we cotransfected HepG2 cells with these oligonucleotides linked to a luciferase reporter gene and an ERT expression vector or a control pGL2-pro. A direct correlation was found between the relative strengths of the binding affinities and the level of activity induced by ERT (Fig.7 C). PEA3 was induced 5-fold, TRα and HTLV-1 were both induced 3-fold, while the other weak ERT affinity binding oligonucleotides showed no appreciable induction, suggesting that binding is necessary for ERT-mediated transcriptional induction. Transcription factors often display a modular structure with domains being responsible for DNA binding, transactivation, or protein-protein interaction. To identify potential transactivation domains within ERT, several truncations of ERT were tested in transient transfection assays (Fig.8). Deletion of the first 200 amino acids led to a severe reduction of ERT-mediated transcription, implicating the existence of an amino-terminal transactivation domain. Interestingly, the ERT DNA binding domain alone (200/371 or 301/371) suppressed basal activity of TGF-β type II receptor promoter, suggesting that it acts as a dominant negative mutant. To analyze the location of the transactivation domain in ERT, fusions of ERT amino acids to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 were constructed. These plasmids were transfected into the HepG2 cells with a luciferase reporter (G5BLuc) containing five GAL4 binding sites upstream from the E1B TATA box (Fig. 9). Comparable expression of the GAL4-ERT fusion proteins was investigated by Western blot analyses using anti-GAL4 antibodies (data not shown). Significant increases of basal transcription were observed with the GAL4-ERT-(1–371). Transcriptional activity was diminished with deletion of the amino teminal region of ERT (Fig. 9 B). Basal level of transcription was significantly elevated with the GAL4-ERT-(1–200) fusion protein. In addition, the GAL4-ERT-(1–300) is less active than GAL4-ERT-(1–200), suggesting that amino acids 200 to 300 exert an inhibitory effect on transactivation (Fig. 9 B). These data are in agreement with the identification of a transactivation domain at the amino terminus of ERT. We have isolated a new member of the ets family of transcription factors, which is a potent transcriptional activator of the TGF-β RII gene, by using a novel genetic approach based on the yeast one-hybrid system. Using this genetic selection to screen a human placenta cDNA library for sequences encoding DNA-binding domains that can recognize the PRE2 of the human TGF-β RII gene in yeast, we isolated a human cDNA that codes for a protein, ERT, that binds to the PRE2 of the TGF-β RII promoter in a sequence-specific manner and activates transcription. The deduced amino acid sequence shows high homology with the ETS-domain, the DNA binding region in theets family genes. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of ERT to the recently reported epithelial specific ets-family member, ESX/ESE-1 (23Chang C.-H. Scott G.H. Kuo W.-L. Xiong X. Suzdaltseva Y. Park J.W. Sayre P.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that PRE2 contained at least one nuclear protein recognition sequence from +11 to +29 (13Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This region contains two direct repeats of the purine-rich sequences (GGAAAC) in a reverse-orientation. Competition for binding to ERT was abolished by mutation of this sequence, suggesting that these purine-rich sequences are the binding sites for ERT. Expression of exogenous ERT increases the level of transcription from the TGF-β RII promoter, implying an activating role for ERT in TGF-β RII expression. We have detected high-affinity binding sites for ERT in the regulatory regions of various genes, and we have demonstrated that ERT can transactivate the isolated ETS sites of these promoters. Proteins of the ets gene family members have a conserved DNA-binding domain (the ETS domain) and regulate transcriptional initiation from a variety of cellular and viral gene promoter and enhancer elements, including the human interleukin-2 receptor β-chain gene promoter (25Lin J.-X. Bhat N.K. John S. Queale W.S. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6201-6210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the human β2 intergrin CD18 promoter (26Böttinger E.P. Shelley C.S. Farokhzad O.C. Arnaout M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2604-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A combination of EMSA and methylation interference studies on the binding of ETS proteins to the target sequences has shown that the GGAA purine core is essential for the specific binding of ETS-related proteins. All members of the ets family share a common recognition sequence, whereas the flanking sequences are divergent for different members of the ets family. Differences in ERT binding to and ERT-mediated transactivation of a variety of genes containing EBS examined in this study could therefore reflect the precise recognition sequence for ERT. We identified multiple EBS-like sequences in the region between −1816 and +36 by a computer analysis. The TGF-β RII promoter PRE2 contains two copies of the consensus core sequence GGAA located at +14 to +17 and +21 to +24 which are between +1 and +50. This region is essential for TGF-β RII promoter and enhancer activities. It is noteworthy, however, that these ETS-binding sites by themselves are not sufficient to fully activate the promoter since mutational analysis reveals that the first positive regulatory element (PRE1) of the TGF-β RII promoter cooperates with the second positive regulatory element (PRE2) to sustain basal levels of promoter activity (13Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since the sequence between −1 and −1883 is also responsive to ERT, it is possible that these ETS-binding sites functionally interact with the first positive regulatory element to achieve the full promoter activity of the TGF-β RII gene. The expression patterns of different members of the ets gene family vary between tissues (22Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Many members of this family are expressed in hematopoietic cells, suggesting a role for these members of the ets family in hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation (22Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). All the ets family genes, with the exception of yan (32Lai Z.-C. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 609-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and ERF (33Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J.

The sequence of the ESX gene is identical to the ERT nucleotide sequence; however, our ERT cDNA is 524 nucleotides longer in the 3′-untranslated region and 150 nucleotides longer in the 5′-untranslated region compared with the published ESX sequence (23Chang C.-H. Scott G.H. Kuo W.-L. Xiong X. Suzdaltseva Y. Park J.W. Sayre P. Erny K. Collins C. Gray J.W. Benz C.C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1617-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Oettgen P.

Our preliminary results show that other ets family members such as ETS-1 and ETS-2 also induce TGF-β RII promoter activity, suggesting that ets family members may be one of the major transcription factors involved in regulation of TGF-β RII gene expression. Since most cells express the TGF-β receptors, it is possible that expression of the TGF-β RII gene may be regulated by distinct ets family members in different tissues. TGF-β plays a critical role in many cellular processes, including regulation of cell cycle and cell differentiation, and it has now been demonstrated that aberrant expression of TGF-β receptors may play a role in a wide variety of human pathologies. We have recently identified a subset of human gastric cancer cell lines that are resistant to TGF-β and that lack TGF-β RII mRNA expression despite evidence of a normal gene, suggesting that transcriptional regulation may play an important role in controlling TGF-β RII expression. We demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between expression patterns of TGF-β RII mRNA and ERT mRNA in human gastric cancer cell lines. 2S.-G. Choi, M. Kato, J. Chang, Y.-J. Bang, and S.-J. Kim, manuscript in preparation. Examination of the mechanisms underlying loss of TGF-β RII expression in different human gastric cancer cell lines suggests a complex interplay between mutational events and transcriptional regulation. Given the importance of the ets family genes in regulating TGF-β RII gene expression, it is quite likely that regulation of this family of transcription factors, including ERT, will emerge as a key mechanism controlling cellular responsiveness to TGF-β.

Mites are the closest animals to human life and their relation is inseparable in the modern residential environment. House dust mites cause heavy atopic diseases such as asthma and dermatitis, which are rapidly increasing worldwide, especially among the children in developed countries. Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus are recognized as the main sources of house dust allergens. Among their allergens, the group-2 allergen proteins, Der f 2 and Der p 2, show the highest positive rate for atopic patients (1Heymann P.W. Chapman M.D. Aalberse R.C. Fox J.W. Platts-Mills T.A.E. J.

They are also homologous to the major allergen from the mite Lepidoglyphus destructor (4Varela J. Ventas P. Carreira J. Barbas J.A. Gimenez-Gallego G. Polo F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which is important in farming environments. These proteins are 125–129 amino acid residues long and have three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Although the properties of these proteins related to their allergenicity have been well characterized, their biological function in mites is unknown. Homologous proteins were also found in human epididymis, cow milk, and moth trachea (5Kirchhoff C. Osterhoff C. Young L. Biol.

However, there have been no clues for their functions except for their expression patterns. This is in contrast to the case of the other major allergen group including Der f 1 and Der p 1, because they were found to be cysteine proteases, and their activity was suggested to be involved in the induction of allergic responses (8Robinson C. Kalsheker N.A. Srinivasan N. King C.M. Garrod D.R. Thompson P.J. Stewart G.A. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1997; 27: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, the innate functions of Der f 2 and Der p 2 have interested many allergy researchers. It is generally accepted that allergic symptoms are initiated by the specific binding of allergens to immunoglobulin E (IgE) 1The abbreviations used are: IgE, immunoglobulin E; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; RMSD, root mean square difference. antibodies, which cross-link the high affinity IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils (9Metzger H. Alcaraz G. Hohman R. Kinet J. Pribluda V. Quarto R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 419-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). So monovalent ligands to allergen-specific IgE are expected to block IgE receptor aggregation. Structure determination of allergens will offer the basis of design of such drugs. The tertiary structures of some pollen allergens have been previously reported including ragweed allergens Amb t 5 and Amb a 5, a major birch allergen Bet v 1, and a minor birch allergen profilin (10Metzler W.J.

However, the tertiary structure of Der f 2 and the following drug-design processes are exceptionally urgent considering the serious mental influences on atopic children. In this study, we have determined the tertiary structure of Der f 2 by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Unexpectedly we found that Der f 2 is a single-domain protein of immunoglobulin fold. There are few single-domain proteins of this fold, and this protein is soluble and monomeric. We feel it is of interest also in terms of the evolution of protein folds. The structural similarity to the two regulatory domains of transglutaminase and other small pieces of information prompted us to suppose that Der f 2 is a component of the innate antibacterial defense system in mites. Furthermore, we found that Der f 2 binds to the surface of bacteria, which is the first clue to the biological function of this class of proteins. We also discuss previous work related to the immunoglobulin E epitopes on the basis of the tertiary structure. Escherichia coli BL21 cells harboring pFLT1 (pGEMEX1 derivative containing cDNA for clone 1 of Der f 2; see Ref. 15Nishiyama C. Yuuki T. Usui Y. Iwamoto N. Okumura Y. Okudaira H. Int. Arch.

Labeled recombinant Der f 2 was expressed and purified as described (16Iwamoto N. Nishiyama C. Yasuhara T. Saito A. Yuuki T. Okumura Y. Okudaira H. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1996; 109: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). NMR samples contained 1.5 mm of Der f 2 in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, 140 mm N-octyl-β-d-glucoside, 0.01% NaN3at pH 5.6. NMR spectra were acquired at 55 °C on a Varian Unityplus 600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance pulse field gradient probe. The sequential assignment of the1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts was achieved mainly by through-bond heteronuclear correlations along the backbone and side chains with the following 3D pulse sequences: HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, HBHA(CO)NH, HN(CA)HA, C(CO)NH, HC(C)H-TOCSY (17Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) were derived from three-dimensional 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOE spectroscopy spectra recorded with a mixing time of 75 ms. The pulse sequences of HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCANH, HBHA(CO)NH, HN(CA)HA, C(CO)NH and15N-edited NOE spectroscopy were modified with pulse field gradient method and sensitivity enhancement method (17Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Upper limits of distance constraints were calculated as kI −1/6, where Iis the peak intensity and k is a constant adjusted in each NOE spectroscopy spectrum and relaxed by 0.5 Å considering mobility. Lower limits of distance constraints were all 1.8 Å. The structures were calculated with the program X-PLOR ver. 3.1 (18Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). Initial coordinates were generated using random φ and ψ angles, whereas peptide bonds and side-chains took extended conformations. The macroprogram sa.inp in X-PLOR ver. 2.1 was used to carry out simulated annealing calculation. The target function that is minimized during simulated annealing comprises only potential terms for covalent geometry, experimental distance restraints, and van der Waals nonbonded repulsion. No hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential or experimental torsion angle terms were present in the target function. The final structure calculations were based on 1086 interproton distance restraints (526 intra-, 258 sequential (‖i − j‖ = 1), 56 middle range (2 ≤ ‖i − j‖ ≤ 5), and 246 long range (‖i − j‖ > 5) NOEs). A final set of 10 converged structures was selected from 20 calculations on the basis of agreement with the experimental data and van der Waals energy. A mean structure was obtained by averaging the coordinates of the structures that were superimposed in advance to the best converged structure and then minimizing under the constraints. The E. coli strain C was grown to late log phase, collected by centrifugation, and suspended in 1/10 of the original volume with 0.9% NaCl. An equal volume of 20% acetic acid was added, and the bacteria were left at room temperature for 5 min. 5 volumes of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) was added, and the bacteria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in one-tenth of the original culture volume in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2). 100 μg of Der f 2 were added to the bacterial suspension (0.1 ml of Der f 2 to 0.1 ml of bacteria) and incubated at room temperature for the time indicated. The suspension was centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g, the pellet was washed twice in 200 μl of water and then suspended in 40 μl of 0.5 mammonium formate (pH 6.4). The ammonium formate eluates were immediately adjusted to 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 mm dithiothreitol, heated at 70 °C for 5 min, and subjected to electrophoresis (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Backbone sequential assignments for Der f 2 (129 amino acid residues) were obtained by a strategy using a combination of four triple resonance measurements, 3D HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, and were complete except for HN and N of Asp-1 and Thr-123, and Cα of Glu-53. The nitrogen chemical shifts of prolines were not assigned. Side-chain assignments were obtained principally by 3D C(CO)NH, HC(C)H-TOCSY and HC(C)H-COSY, and partially extended using NOE data. All nonexchangeable resonances were assigned except for Lys-33 Cε and Lys-126 Hγ, Hδ, and Hε, whose assignments were not fixed owing to heavy overlaps. In addition, Hε1 and Nε1 of Trp-92 were not detected, possibly because of fast proton solvent exchange enhanced by interaction with added detergent molecules. The secondary structure was determined as all β, using tertiary NOEs between backbone protons (Fig. 1), which had been estimated beforehand by the results of chemical shift index method (20Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Using 1086 distance constraints extracted after assignments of 3D 15N- and 13C-edited NOE spectroscopy spectra, we obtained 10 structures from 20 calculations. A summary of the structural statistics for a set of the final structures and for the mean structure is presented in TableI. There were no violations above 0.6 Å in any of the structures, and the number of violations above 0.3 Å ranged from 4 to 13. The deviation from ideal bond lengths was 0.004 Å. These figures are relatively good, considering that our distance constraint set was tighter than those in the typical three-level classification. However, since the number of NOE constraints was not large, the quality of the structure should be regarded as medium.Table IStructural statisticsParameter〈SA〉(SA) rRMSDs from experimental distance constraints (Å) (1086)0.058 ± 0.0010.057Number of distance constraint violations greater than 0.3 Å 4–139 Maximum (Å)0.530.42F NOE(kcal/mol)1-aThe value of the square-well NOE potential,F NOE, is calculated with a force constant of 50 kcal/mol per Å2.

Open table in a new tab Fig.2 a shows the tertiary structure determination of Der f 2. The root mean square difference (RMSD) value of the 10 final structures from the minimized averaged structure was 0.90 ± 0.15 Å for the backbone (N, Cα, C′) atoms of residues 1–129 and 1.44 ± 0.17 Å for the nonhydrogen atoms of the same residue range. We also calculated local RMSD values for the backbone atoms (N, Cα, C′) at each residue after the best fit superposition of the whole backbone (data not shown), and found that the residues of large local RMSD value were distributed around the whole sequence. Therefore the reason the structural convergence was not excellent is not due to local flexibility but to the number of NOE distance constraints. Der f 2 has an immunoglobulin fold (Fig. 2 b). The topology corresponds to s-type (21Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). One β-sheet consists of three strands of residues 13–19 (a), 36–43 (b), and 85–92 (e), and the other sheet is composed of four β-strands 62–65 (c′), 49–57 (c), 104–111 (f), and 116–127 (g), and an additional short strand of residues 5–8 (tentatively named as a′). They include three β-bulges at the positions 14–15, 117–118, and 123–124. Der f 2 has three disulfide bonds at the positions 8–119, 21–27, and 73–78 (22Nishiyama C. Yuuki T. Takai T. Okumura Y. Okudaira H. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1993; 101: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but no disulfide bridge between the β-strands b and f, which is often found in immunoglobulin-fold domains. The immunoglobulin fold is the most ubiquitous module and is distributed among many protein superfamilies of different functions (21Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). There are, however, few single-domain proteins with the immunoglobulin fold. Der f 2 is not membrane bound like Thy-1, a subunit in a protein complex like β2-microglobulin, nor does it polymerize into filaments like the major sperm protein from nematode. Therefore, this simple immunoglobulin-fold protein, Der f 2, might reflect the characteristics of the most ancient immunoglobulin-like domain, and it is of special interest to compare this structure with other domains of immunoglobulin fold, mainly distributed among vertebrate immune systems, cell surface receptors, coagulation/fibrinolysis systems, and some enzymes that bind to sugar chains. We searched for structural similarities to the known protein folds using the program Dali (23Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar). It listed many proteins of immunoglobulin fold, but the fourth domain of human blood coagulation factor XIII (24Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Trong I.L. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) was reported to be the most structurally similar to Der f 2, where the Z-score was 4.6. This value is not large, probably because of the quality of our structure determination. Because the second one, the second domain of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (25Jones E.Y. Harlos K. Bottomley M.J. Robinson R.C. Driscoll P.C. Edwards R.M. Clements J.M. Dudgeon T.J. Stuart D.I. Nature. 1995; 373: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), had the Z-score of 4.2, it is difficult to conclude that the domain of factor XIII is the most similar. Transglutaminase, including factor XIII, is composed of four domains, and the third and fourth domains have the s-type immunoglobulin fold. We superimposed the Der f 2 structure onto the third and fourth domains of factor XIII using 62 Cα pairs (Fig.3 a) and obtained RMSD values 2.77 Å in both cases. Then we aligned the primary sequences of these factor XIII domains (26Ichinose A. Hendrickson L.E. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6900-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) to those of Der f 2 (2Yuuki T. Okumura Y. Ando T. Yamakawa H. Suko M. Haida M. Okudaira H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 1233-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and homologous proteins (3Chua K.Y. Doyle C.R. Simpson R.J. Turner K.J. Stewart G.A. Thomas W.R. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl.

Biol. 1996; 26: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) on the basis of tertiary structures (Fig.3 b). Although the sequences in each group are highly variable, we could find identical amino acid residues shared by both groups at many positions. The numbers of such residues were 32 both in the third and fourth domains of factor XIII, which is much larger than the number in the second domain of vascular cell adhesion molecule, which is 22. Phe-41, which is located at the center of domains, is perfectly conserved among the two groups shown in Fig. 3 b. In particular, the factor XIII fourth domain is well aligned to the group-2 mite allergens without large insertions or deletions except for three disulfide bond-related segments. Intriguingly, Der f 1, the other major mite allergen, is a cysteine protease, and this protease family has been shown to be evolutionally related to the second domain of factor XIII (27Pedersen L.C. Yee V.C. Bishop P.D. Trong I.L. Teller D.C. Stenkamp R.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, Tyr-372 (Fig. 3 a, red) of factor XIII, neighboring the catalytic triad (orange), corresponds to the tyrosine that has been recognized as unique to the mite allergen cysteine proteases (8Robinson C. Kalsheker N.A. Srinivasan N. King C.M. Garrod D.R. Thompson P.J. Stewart G.A. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1997; 27: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The fact that Der f 2 inhibited guinea pig liver transglutaminase 2S. Kojima, unpublished observation. is also interesting as it relates to the structural similarity described above. Although the biological function of Der f 2 is unknown, the above findings reminded us of the innate immune system of invertebrates (28Muta T. Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In invertebrates that do not have immunoglobulins, the coagulation system is prominent as an antimicrobial response. Two types of coagulation mechanisms have been reported, each of which are associated with transglutaminase and a cascade of serine proteases, respectively. Der f 3, a minor mite allergen, is a serine protease that has a similar substrate specificity to blood coagulation factor XII and is reported to activate the human serine protease cascade (29Takahashi K. Aoki T. Kohmoto S. Nishimura H. Kodera Y. Matsushima A. Inada Y. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1990; 91: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We found that Der f 2 binds the surface of E. coli cells (Fig. 4) in a manner similar to hemolin, a bacteria-binding protein from moths composed of four immunoglobulin-like domains (30Sun S. Lindström I. Boman H.G. Faye I. Schmidt O. Science. 1990; 250: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Der f 2 has a cluster of nine basic amino acids (Fig. 3 a), which implies a negatively charged target surface. Preliminary results show that Der f 2 does not bind to strains K12 or BL21. All of the three types of mite allergens mentioned are localized in the gastrointestinal tract, mouth region and feces (31van Hage-Hamsten M. Olsson S. Emilson A. Härfast B. Svensson A. Scheynius A. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1995; 25: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32Stewart G.A. Bird C.H. Krska K.D. Colloff M.J. Thompson P.J. Exp. Appl. Acarol. 1992; 16: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the feces, which are suggested to cause allergic symptoms (33Tovey E.R. Chapman M.D. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Nature. 1981; 289: 592-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), have microbial degradation activities (34Stewart G.A. Bird C.H. Thompson P.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1992; 90: 141-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HE1, EPV20, and esr16, the Der f 2 homologs from human, cow, and moth, respectively, are included in epithelial mucosae, where antibacterial proteins are excreted (35Reddy E.S.P. Bhargava P.M. Nature. 1979; 279: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 36Reiter B. Oram J.D. Nature. 1967; 216: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 37Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These observations imply that Der f 2 is a component of the antibacterial defense system in mites. A survey of recent literature data (38Breiteneder H. Pettenburger K. Bito A. Valenta R. Kraft D. Rumpold H. Scheiner O. Breitenbach M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1935-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 39Aabin B. Poulsen L.K. Ebbehøj K. Nørgaard A. Frøkicer H. Bindslev-Jensen C. Barkholt V. Int. Arch.

Toxicology. 1994; 91: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) made us realize that Bet v 1, conalbumin and lactoferrin, which show the highest positive rate for sera from allergic patients of birch pollen, hen egg, and cow milk, respectively, are components of antimicrobial host defense systems. Since the cloning of the group-2 allergens, IgE and T-cell epitopes have been intensely studied. The experiments using 14 synthetic peptides of 15 residues in length spanning the entire sequence of Der p 2 showed that IgE antisera do not bind to most peptides; the peptide comprising residues 65–78 bound IgE, but its activity was extremely weak (41van't Hof W. Driedijk P.C. van den Berg M. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Jung G. Aalberse R.C. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore recognition by IgE depends strongly on the conformation of Der p 2, and considering the intense homology, it is probably also the case for Der f 2. Truncation of N- or C-terminal short sequences (42Nishiyama C. Fukada M. Usui Y. Iwamoto N. Yuuki T. Okumura Y. Okudaira H. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or destruction of the disulfide bond 8–119 (43Takai T. Yokota T. Yasue M. Nishiyama C. Yuuki T. Mori A. Okudaira H. Okumura Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) reduced IgE-binding activity severely, which corresponds to our result that Der f 2 is composed of only one domain. Nishiyama et al. (42Nishiyama C. Fukada M. Usui Y. Iwamoto N. Yuuki T. Okumura Y. Okudaira H. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) made site-directed mutants at residues 1–21, 70–81, and 114–129 of Der f 2, which were selected considering the studies mentioned above, and measured their IgE-binding activities. Using their results, we mapped the molecular surface for those substitutions that decreased IgE binding (Fig.5). This figure suggests that two IgE epitope areas on the surface. One epitope area includes Asp-7, Asn-10 and Lys-15, and the second one includes Cys-73, Phe-75, Lys-77, and Cys-78. However, the borders of these areas are distorted at the residues Asp-19 and Asn-71. Experiments that can judge whether each decrease of IgE binding is due to global destabilization or local effects on the allergen-antibody interface might improve epitope definition. Although additional amino acid substitutions are desired to clarify the borders and judge the existence of other epitope areas, our structure suggests mosaic distribution of IgE epitopes and provides strategies for their complete characterization. The engineered Der f 2 has already begun to be applied for immunotherapy strategies. For example, the mutated allergen in which the disulfide bond 8–119 was disrupted retained complete activity to stimulate T-cell proliferation (43Takai T. Yokota T. Yasue M. Nishiyama C. Yuuki T. Mori A. Okudaira H. Okumura Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, developments of monovalent ligands to allergen-specific IgE are also desired to suppress the symptoms by blocking IgE receptor aggregation. Since the protein HE1 is a human homolog of Der f 2, chimeric proteins of HE1, and Der f 2 would be candidates of monovalent IgE ligands that induce no additional responses of antibodies. The tertiary structure of Der f 2 will provide the basis of such strategies and any other drug design processes. We thank Dr. Mark B.

The protein structure of αB-crystallin is stabilized by intermolecular exchange with αA-crystallin. α-Crystallin is an oligomer protein of two subunits, αA and αB, in a ratio of 3 to 1 for most mammalian lenses. The αA- and αB-crystallins are differentially expressed in the lenses of humans and most other mammalian species; αB-crystallin appears earlier than αA-crystallin and is dominant in epithelial cells, but the αA-to-αB ratio increases with differentiation (1Delcour J. Papaconstantinou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Brahma S.K. Sanyal S. Curr.

Overbeek P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2276-2284PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of the differential expression is not clear. Moreover, how the two subunits interchange after expression and the significance of the 3-to-1 ratio are also not well established.The rather high concentration of α-crystallin in the lens and its extremely high thermostability (5Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) may be crucial in the protection against aggregation of β- and γ-crystallins. But how the thermostability is achieved is not fully understood. One possibility is through an intermolecular exchange that results in a dynamic quaternary structure. The observation that α-crystallin is the major crystallin in the lens HMW 1The abbreviations used are: HMW, high molecular weight; FPLC, fast performance liquid chromatography; IEF, isoelectric focusing. 1The abbreviations used are: HMW, high molecular weight; FPLC, fast performance liquid chromatography; IEF, isoelectric focusing. aggregates and water-insoluble fraction (6Spector A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 130-146PubMed Google Scholar) may arise from some mechanisms that cause the loss of this dynamic quaternary structure.In vitro study of α-crystallin has been handicapped by the fact that α-crystallin and its two subunits, especially isolated from human lenses, are already extensively modified and are difficult to obtain in their pure, native state. Previously, the two subunits were isolated from α-crystallin under denatured conditions and were unable to refold to the native state. The use of recombinant DNA technology to clone human α-crystallin has largely solved these problems (7Merck K.B. De Haard-Hoekman W.A. Oude Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. De Jong W Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 8Andley U.P. Mathurt S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol.

We have recently prepared both recombinant human αA- and αB-crystallins and performed a comparative study between them (10Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The recombinant αA- and αB-crystallins exist in solution as homo-oligomers of molecular mass ∼600 kDa (10Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence of the interoligomeric exchange of the αA- and αB-crystallins and the stabilization of protein structure by subunit interchange. The biological significance of the 3-to-1 ratio of αA and αB subunits in vivo is discussed.DISCUSSIONThe intermolecular exchange between αA- and αB-crystallin subunits was demonstrated by IEF in the native state. Similar results have been reported (18van den Oetelaar P.J. van Someren P.F. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3488-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but the αA- and αB-crystallins used were isolated from bovine lenses under denatured conditions, and they were not properly reconstituted (19Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the significance of the exchange was not clearly established. Our use of recombinant αA- and αB-crystallins, which are folded in the native form (10Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), should yield results more relevant to physiological conditions. Although exchange occurs in αA/αB samples with any ratios, a 3-to-1 ratio appears to be most thermostable. Results of heat-induced aggregation indicate that αA-crystallin is thermally more stable than αB-crystallin, probably because of αB's greater hydrophobicity (10Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interaction makes an important contribution to protein folding at low temperatures, but the hydrophobic entropy decreases as the system becomes enthalpy-driven at high temperatures. Thus, in vitro or in vivo aggregation between αA- and αB-crystallin (formation of an 600–800-kDa aggregate with a 3-to-1 ratio) may result from a stabilization effect of αA-crystallin on αB-crystallin. The slight shift in the FPLC peak for αA and the 3-to-1 mixture preincubated at 62 °C (Fig. 5) may be due to partial unfolding, which is also apparent in near-UV CD measurements (Fig. 4). This has been reported in the calf lens α-crystallin (17Das B.K. Liang J.-N. Chakrabarti B. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the present study indicates that only recombinant αB-crystallin undergoes heat-induced HMW aggregation. The notion of stabilization of αB by αA was recently demonstrated by a study of αA-knockout mice (20Brady J.P. Garland D. Duglas-Tabor Y. Robinson W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Mice with the targeted disruption of the αA gene developed lens opacification starting from the nucleus and showed dense inclusion bodies that contain mostly αB.The significance of the intermolecular exchange between αA- and αB-crystallin is its stabilization of the protein structure. But how this stabilization is achieved is difficult to speculate, since we do not know α-crystallin tertiary and quaternary structures; α-crystallin could not be crystallized for x-ray diffraction study. None of the structural models previously proposed, such as the original or modified three-layer model (21Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoender H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Walsh M.T. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20079-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the micelle-like structure (23Augusteyn R.C. Koretz J.F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 222: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), or the overlapping two-annulus model (24Carver J.A Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), can explain the experimental data. It is obvious that the 3-to-1 ratio provides a balance in charge and hydrophobicity that stabilizes the protein structure, but a more definite explanation cannot be attained until the tertiary structure is determined. The near-UV CD clearly indicates that hybrid aggregate has a more compact structure than either αA- or αB-crystallin homo-oligomers. The difference of near-UV CD spectra between in vitro formed 3αA-to-1αB hybrid aggregate and the human infant lens α-crystallin may indicate that they do not have exactly the same tertiary structure, probably either because of different folding and aggregation between in vitro and in vivo conditions or because of modifications in the human lens α-crystallin and lack of modifications in the recombinant α-crystallin. The difference is most pronounced in the 290-nm bands, which originate from tryptophan transition, 1Lb(15Liang J.N. Chakrabarti B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1847-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Strickland E.H. Horwitz J. Billups C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The red shift of the band in the human lens α-crystallin from recombinant α-crystallin (from 292 to 295 nm) indicates that Trp residues in the human lens α-crystallin are more buried than in the recombinant α-crystallin (15Liang J.N. Chakrabarti B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1847-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Kahn P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 339-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is difficult to tell what causes this shift, but it is most likely due to a different folded structure (either tertiary or quaternary structure); the shape of near-UV CD spectrum of human lens α-crystallin is very different from that of recombinant α-crystallin.The protective binding of α-crystallin to the partially unfolded β- and γ-crystallins was reported in in vitro experiments (27Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 28Horwitz J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 10-12PubMed Google Scholar). Since no subsequent release of the bound substrate was observed, we should expect plenty of α-β and α-γ complexes in the lens, especially in the aged lens nucleus where modification-related partial unfolding is extensive. Instead of dimers, such as α-β and α-γ, HMW complexes were observed (29Takemoto L. Boyle D. Curr. Eye Res. 1994; 13: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In human lenses, the major component of the soluble HMW and insoluble proteins is α-crystallin; β- and γ-crystallins are the minor components (6Spector A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 130-146PubMed Google Scholar). The chaperone complex formation cannot completely explain this phenomenon (19Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the question arises: why does α-crystallin, whose apparent function is to protect other crystallins from aggregation and denaturation, itself become aggregated and insoluble? Since α-crystallin has been shown to be thermally very stable (5Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), thermal denaturation and aggregation are unlikely to be responsible for insolubilization. Another possible unfolding mechanism is post-translational modification. Lens crystallins have a long half-life and can accumulate a variety of modifications. Although α-crystallin is thermally more stable than β- or γ-crystallin, it is not more stable in the presence of urea (30Liang J.N. Pelletier M.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Das B.K. Liang J.-N. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1997; 236: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); α-crystallin is totally unfolded in 6–7 m urea or 2.5 mguanidine HCl, but 6 m guanidine HCl is required for γ-crystallin to be completely unfolded. Therefore, α-crystallin may be more susceptible to modification-induced structural perturbation than γ-crystallin, which may lead to HMW aggregation and insolubilization. It is possible that when αA-crystallin is extensively modified, it fails to stabilize αB-crystallin. Recently, we have observed an extensive modification in urea-soluble α-crystallin of human lenses; IEF and reverse-phase FPLC showed a greater extent of modification in the αA subunit than in the αB subunit. 2T.-X. Sun and J. J.-N. Liang, unpublished data. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that lens α-crystallin subunits αA and αB undergo intermolecular exchange, which stabilizes protein conformation. The hybrid aggregate with a 3-to-1 ratio is the most stable combination and may explain why most mammalian lenses contain this ratio of α-crystallin subunits. α-Crystallin is an oligomer protein of two subunits, αA and αB, in a ratio of 3 to 1 for most mammalian lenses. The αA- and αB-crystallins are differentially expressed in the lenses of humans and most other mammalian species; αB-crystallin appears earlier than αA-crystallin and is dominant in epithelial cells, but the αA-to-αB ratio increases with differentiation (1Delcour J. Papaconstantinou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Brahma S.K. Sanyal S. Curr. Eye Res. 1987; 6: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 3Chiesa R. McDermott M.J. Spector A. Curr. Eye Res. 1989; 8: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Robinson M.L. Overbeek P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2276-2284PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of the differential expression is not clear. Moreover, how the two subunits interchange after expression and the significance of the 3-to-1 ratio are also not well established. The rather high concentration of α-crystallin in the lens and its extremely high thermostability (5Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) may be crucial in the protection against aggregation of β- and γ-crystallins. But how the thermostability is achieved is not fully understood. One possibility is through an intermolecular exchange that results in a dynamic quaternary structure. The observation that α-crystallin is the major crystallin in the lens HMW 1The abbreviations used are: HMW, high molecular weight; FPLC, fast performance liquid chromatography; IEF, isoelectric focusing. 1The abbreviations used are: HMW, high molecular weight; FPLC, fast performance liquid chromatography; IEF, isoelectric focusing. aggregates and water-insoluble fraction (6Spector A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 130-146PubMed Google Scholar) may arise from some mechanisms that cause the loss of this dynamic quaternary structure. In vitro study of α-crystallin has been handicapped by the fact that α-crystallin and its two subunits, especially isolated from human lenses, are already extensively modified and are difficult to obtain in their pure, native state. Previously, the two subunits were isolated from α-crystallin under denatured conditions and were unable to refold to the native state. The use of recombinant DNA technology to clone human α-crystallin has largely solved these problems (7Merck K.B. De Haard-Hoekman W.A. Oude Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. De Jong W Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 8Andley U.P. Mathurt S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol.

We have recently prepared both recombinant human αA- and αB-crystallins and performed a comparative study between them (10Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The recombinant αA- and αB-crystallins exist in solution as homo-oligomers of molecular mass ∼600 kDa (10Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence of the interoligomeric exchange of the αA- and αB-crystallins and the stabilization of protein structure by subunit interchange. The biological significance of the 3-to-1 ratio of αA and αB subunits in vivo is discussed. DISCUSSIONThe intermolecular exchange between αA- and αB-crystallin subunits was demonstrated by IEF in the native state. Similar results have been reported (18van den Oetelaar P.J. van Someren P.F. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3488-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but the αA- and αB-crystallins used were isolated from bovine lenses under denatured conditions, and they were not properly reconstituted (19Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the significance of the exchange was not clearly established. Our use of recombinant αA- and αB-crystallins, which are folded in the native form (10Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), should yield results more relevant to physiological conditions. Although exchange occurs in αA/αB samples with any ratios, a 3-to-1 ratio appears to be most thermostable. Results of heat-induced aggregation indicate that αA-crystallin is thermally more stable than αB-crystallin, probably because of αB's greater hydrophobicity (10Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interaction makes an important contribution to protein folding at low temperatures, but the hydrophobic entropy decreases as the system becomes enthalpy-driven at high temperatures. Thus, in vitro or in vivo aggregation between αA- and αB-crystallin (formation of an 600–800-kDa aggregate with a 3-to-1 ratio) may result from a stabilization effect of αA-crystallin on αB-crystallin. The slight shift in the FPLC peak for αA and the 3-to-1 mixture preincubated at 62 °C (Fig. 5) may be due to partial unfolding, which is also apparent in near-UV CD measurements (Fig. 4). This has been reported in the calf lens α-crystallin (17Das B.K. Liang J.-N. Chakrabarti B. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the present study indicates that only recombinant αB-crystallin undergoes heat-induced HMW aggregation. The notion of stabilization of αB by αA was recently demonstrated by a study of αA-knockout mice (20Brady J.P. Garland D. Duglas-Tabor Y. Robinson W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Mice with the targeted disruption of the αA gene developed lens opacification starting from the nucleus and showed dense inclusion bodies that contain mostly αB.The significance of the intermolecular exchange between αA- and αB-crystallin is its stabilization of the protein structure. But how this stabilization is achieved is difficult to speculate, since we do not know α-crystallin tertiary and quaternary structures; α-crystallin could not be crystallized for x-ray diffraction study. None of the structural models previously proposed, such as the original or modified three-layer model (21Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoender H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Walsh M.T. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20079-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the micelle-like structure (23Augusteyn R.C. Koretz J.F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 222: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), or the overlapping two-annulus model (24Carver J.A Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), can explain the experimental data. It is obvious that the 3-to-1 ratio provides a balance in charge and hydrophobicity that stabilizes the protein structure, but a more definite explanation cannot be attained until the tertiary structure is determined. The near-UV CD clearly indicates that hybrid aggregate has a more compact structure than either αA- or αB-crystallin homo-oligomers. The difference of near-UV CD spectra between in vitro formed 3αA-to-1αB hybrid aggregate and the human infant lens α-crystallin may indicate that they do not have exactly the same tertiary structure, probably either because of different folding and aggregation between in vitro and in vivo conditions or because of modifications in the human lens α-crystallin and lack of modifications in the recombinant α-crystallin.

https://openalex.org/W2015942983,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) have been shown to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ stores by totally independent mechanisms, which are pharmacologically distinct from that activated by inositol trisphosphate. Although cADPR and NAADP are structurally and functionally different, they can be synthesized by a single enzyme having ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. In this study, three different assays were used to measure the metabolism of cADPR in sea urchin egg homogenates including a radioimmunoassay, a Ca2+release assay, and a thin layer chromatographic assay. Soluble and membrane-bound ADP-ribosyl cyclases were identified and both cyclized NAD to produce cADPR. The soluble cyclase was half-maximally stimulated by 5.3 μm cGMP, but not by cAMP, while the membrane-bound form was independent of cGMP. The two forms of the cyclase were also different in the pH dependence of utilizing nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD), a guanine analog of NAD, as substrate, indicating they are two separate enzymes. The stimulatory effect of cGMP required ATP or ATPγS (adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)) and a cGMP-dependent kinase activity was shown to be present in the soluble fraction. The degradation of cADPR to ADP-ribose was catalyzed by cADPR hydrolase, which was found to be predominantly associated with membranes. Similar to the membrane-bound cyclase, the cADPR hydrolase activity was also independent of cGMP. Both the soluble and membrane fractions also catalyzed the synthesis of NAADP through exchanging the nicotinamide group of NADP with nicotinic acid (NA). The base-exchange activity was independent of cGMP and the half-maximal concentrations of NADP and NA needed were about 0.2 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The exchange reaction showed a preference for acidic pH, contrasting with the neutral pH optimum of the cyclase activities. The complex metabolic pathways characterized in this study indicate that there may be a multitude of regulatory mechanisms for controlling the endogenous concentrations of cADPR and NAADP. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) have been shown to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ stores by totally independent mechanisms, which are pharmacologically distinct from that activated by inositol trisphosphate. Although cADPR and NAADP are structurally and functionally different, they can be synthesized by a single enzyme having ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. In this study, three different assays were used to measure the metabolism of cADPR in sea urchin egg homogenates including a radioimmunoassay, a Ca2+release assay, and a thin layer chromatographic assay. Soluble and membrane-bound ADP-ribosyl cyclases were identified and both cyclized NAD to produce cADPR. The soluble cyclase was half-maximally stimulated by 5.3 μm cGMP, but not by cAMP, while the membrane-bound form was independent of cGMP. The two forms of the cyclase were also different in the pH dependence of utilizing nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD), a guanine analog of NAD, as substrate, indicating they are two separate enzymes. The stimulatory effect of cGMP required ATP or ATPγS (adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)) and a cGMP-dependent kinase activity was shown to be present in the soluble fraction. The degradation of cADPR to ADP-ribose was catalyzed by cADPR hydrolase, which was found to be predominantly associated with membranes. Similar to the membrane-bound cyclase, the cADPR hydrolase activity was also independent of cGMP. Both the soluble and membrane fractions also catalyzed the synthesis of NAADP through exchanging the nicotinamide group of NADP with nicotinic acid (NA). The base-exchange activity was independent of cGMP and the half-maximal concentrations of NADP and NA needed were about 0.2 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The exchange reaction showed a preference for acidic pH, contrasting with the neutral pH optimum of the cyclase activities. The complex metabolic pathways characterized in this study indicate that there may be a multitude of regulatory mechanisms for controlling the endogenous concentrations of cADPR and NAADP. The sea urchin egg is a good model system for investigating mechanisms of Ca2+ mobilization. Studies utilizing this system have led to the discoveries of two novel Ca2+messengers, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) 1The abbreviations used are: cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); cGDPR, cyclic GDP-ribose; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; NA, nicotinic acid; NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NGD, nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide; RIA, radioimmunoassay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); cGDPR, cyclic GDP-ribose; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; NA, nicotinic acid; NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NGD, nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide; RIA, radioimmunoassay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (1Clapper D.L.

In the case of sea urchin eggs, evidence indicates cADPR, in conjunction with IP3, is responsible for mediating the Ca2+mobilization associated with fertilization. Thus, inhibition of either the cADPR or the IP3 receptor alone is not sufficient to inhibit fertilization, but the blockage of both receptors by specific antagonists inhibits the Ca2+ mobilization (13Lee H.C.

In addition to cyclizing NAD, the cyclase can also catalyze the exchange of the nicotinamide group of NADP with nicotinic acid (NA) to produce NAADP (23Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It is thus an important enzyme in Ca2+signaling. Two types of cyclase have been characterized. A soluble form is abundant in Aplysia ovotestis and its crystal structure has recently been solved (24Prasad G.S. McRee E.A. Stura D.G. Levitt D.G. Lee H.C. Stout C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A membrane-bound homolog of theAplysia cyclase is CD38 (25States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C.

Calosso L. Mehta K. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 95-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, neither of the these two enzymes has been shown to be regulated by cGMP. The egg cyclase, although having an activity among the lowest of all tissue extracts measured so far (20Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), is particularly important because of its cGMP dependence, a typical characteristic of a signaling enzyme. In this study, three different assays with sensitivity suitable for measuring the low cyclase activity in egg extracts were developed and used. Results show the presence of two types of cyclase and that the soluble form is sensitive to cGMP. A degradation activity hydrolyzing cADPR to ADP-ribose is present predominantly in the membranes. In contrast, both the soluble and membrane fractions can also catalyze the synthesis of NAADP via a base-exchange reaction. The egg extract is thus an important source for characterizing and purifying various components of the complex pathways involved in the metabolism of the Ca2+ messengers, cADPR and NAADP.DISCUSSIONThe sea urchin egg has been an ideal cellular model for investigating the mechanisms of Ca2+ mobilization both at the single-cell and biochemical levels. It was by using this model that the existence of Ca2+ release mechanisms other than that mediated by IP3 was first demonstrated (1Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol.

Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Using caged analogs and microinjection, it was shown conclusively that both cADPR and NAADP can mobilize Ca2+ in live eggs (Refs. 42Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholarand 43Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Gee K.R. Kestner T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4172-4178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 44Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). That nitric oxide can activate the cADPR-mediated signaling pathway indicated that the synthesis of cADPR is regulated and that it can be activated by physiological stimuli (17Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because of the special role of sea urchin eggs in establishing cADPR as a Ca2+ messenger, it was of importance and interest to characterize the metabolism of cADPR and NAADP in this cell model.Results in this study show that there are two forms of ADP-ribosyl cyclase in sea urchin egg, soluble and membrane-bound. This is established based on several criteria. First, the soluble cyclase cannot be sedimented by centrifugation by as high a force as 430,000 × g for 30 min. Second, only the soluble cyclase shows stimulation by cGMP. Third, the cGMP-dependent stimulation of the soluble cyclase is critically dependent on ATP but the membrane cyclase is neither stimulated by cGMP nor dependent on ATP. Finally, the soluble and membrane-bound cyclases show completely opposite pH dependence when using NGD as substrate.The insensitivity of the membrane-bound cyclase to cGMP is not due to the lack of a suitable G-kinase in the membrane fraction since only marginal stimulation by cGMP is seen in the total homogenate, which can be accounted for by the stimulation of the soluble cyclase (cf. Fig. 2). Also, supplementing the membrane fraction with a supernatant fraction could not restore the cGMP stimulation (data not shown). The supernatant fraction contained G-kinase activity as determined by the kinase assay shown in Fig. 9, but its cyclase activity was inactivated by ATP removal using a desalting column as described under “Results.” Supplementing the membrane fraction with a recombinant form of the mammalian 1α isoform of cGMP-dependent protein kinase also failed to restore the cGMP sensitivity of the membrane cyclase (data not shown).It is not unusual that there are two forms of ADP-ribosyl cyclase. TheAplysia cyclase is a soluble protein of about 30 kDa, whereas CD38 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein (reviewed in Refs. 21Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Biochimie. 1995; 77: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and22Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, guanylyl cyclase is found as both soluble and particulate forms (45Garbers D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9103-9106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What is unusual in the sea urchin egg is that the two forms of ADP-ribosyl cyclase are present in the same cell. The fact that the soluble cyclase is sensitive to cGMP makes it reasonable to assume that it is the signaling enzyme responsible for mediating the Ca2+ mobilizing effect of nitric oxide observed in sea urchin eggs (17Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus the elevation of cGMP levels in eggs by nitric oxide (17Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) stimulates the soluble cyclase, resulting in increased production of cADPR and mobilization of the Ca2+ stores. In this scenario, cADPR is functioning as a Ca2+ messenger. Accumulating evidence suggests that cADPR can also function as a modulator, sensitizing the Ca2+-induced Ca2+mechanism to Ca2+ (reviewed in Ref. 10Lee H.C. Re. Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 355-388PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane-bound cyclase could be responsible for regulating the local concentration of cADPR around the Ca2+ release channel and, by doing so, set the Ca2+ sensitivity of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism. Another finding reported in this study that is consistent with this proposal is the predominant association of the of cADPR hydrolase with membranes. The presence of both synthesis and degradation activities would allow for fine adjustment of the local concentration of cADPR and thus the sensitivity of the Ca2+ release mechanism to Ca2+.It is likely that the cGMP stimulation of the soluble cyclase is mediated by protein kinase G, which is consistent with previous results in intact egg and homogenates showing that the cGMP-activation of the cADPR-dependent pathway can be blocked by protein kinase inhibitors (16Galione A. White A. Willmott N. Turner M. Potter B.V. Watson S.P. Nature. 1993; 365: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this study, the cGMP stimulation of the soluble cyclase is found to require ATP and the presence of protein kinase G activity in the egg supernatant is demonstrated. The egg protein kinase G appears to be a minor component since its detection requires that most (98%) of the protein kinase A and the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase activities be blocked. The egg G kinase is nevertheless very unique. Unlike other forms of G-kinase, the G-kinase in the egg has a specific substrate,i.e. the soluble cyclase, and is not stimulated by equimolar cAMP. A recombinant form of the mammalian 1α isoform of cGMP-dependent protein kinase was also found to be unable to stimulate the soluble cyclase from eggs (data not shown), further demonstrating the specificity of the egg G kinase.The egg extracts can also catalyze the synthesis of NAADP via a base-exchange reaction. The activity is present in both the soluble and membrane fractions, but no cGMP stimulation is observed in either fraction. It is known that the Aplysia cyclase can catalyze both the cyclization and base-exchange reactions (23Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Whether the egg cyclase is also responsible for synthesizing NAADP remains to be shown. The specific exchange activity in the egg extracts, however, appears to be much higher than the cyclase activity. Similar to theAplysia cyclase, the exchange activity catalyzed by the egg extracts also shows a remarkable preference for acidic pH as low as pH 5 (23Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that, under physiological conditions, the cytoplasmic pH can be as acidic as pH 5. However, it should be noted that NAADP is a highly effective Ca2+ release activator and only nanomolar concentrations are needed to mobilize the Ca2+ stores (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 41Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The exchange activity does not have to be at its optimum to produce sufficient amounts of NAADP for Ca2+ signaling. In any case, it is clear that a synthetic pathway for NAADP is present in the egg extracts, which should continue to be a rich source for elucidating the complex metabolism of not only NAADP but also cADPR. In that regard, work is in progress to purify and characterize the soluble egg cyclase. The sea urchin egg is a good model system for investigating mechanisms of Ca2+ mobilization. Studies utilizing this system have led to the discoveries of two novel Ca2+messengers, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) 1The abbreviations used are: cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); cGDPR, cyclic GDP-ribose; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; NA, nicotinic acid; NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NGD, nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide; RIA, radioimmunoassay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); cGDPR, cyclic GDP-ribose; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; NA, nicotinic acid; NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NGD, nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide; RIA, radioimmunoassay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (1Clapper D.L.

Calosso L. Mehta K. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 95-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, neither of the these two enzymes has been shown to be regulated by cGMP. The egg cyclase, although having an activity among the lowest of all tissue extracts measured so far (20Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), is particularly important because of its cGMP dependence, a typical characteristic of a signaling enzyme. In this study, three different assays with sensitivity suitable for measuring the low cyclase activity in egg extracts were developed and used. Results show the presence of two types of cyclase and that the soluble form is sensitive to cGMP. A degradation activity hydrolyzing cADPR to ADP-ribose is present predominantly in the membranes. In contrast, both the soluble and membrane fractions can also catalyze the synthesis of NAADP via a base-exchange reaction. The egg extract is thus an important source for characterizing and purifying various components of the complex pathways involved in the metabolism of the Ca2+ messengers, cADPR and NAADP. DISCUSSIONThe sea urchin egg has been an ideal cellular model for investigating the mechanisms of Ca2+ mobilization both at the single-cell and biochemical levels. It was by using this model that the existence of Ca2+ release mechanisms other than that mediated by IP3 was first demonstrated (1Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol.

Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Using caged analogs and microinjection, it was shown conclusively that both cADPR and NAADP can mobilize Ca2+ in live eggs (Refs. 42Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholarand 43Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Gee K.R. Kestner T. J. Biol.

Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). That nitric oxide can activate the cADPR-mediated signaling pathway indicated that the synthesis of cADPR is regulated and that it can be activated by physiological stimuli (17Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because of the special role of sea urchin eggs in establishing cADPR as a Ca2+ messenger, it was of importance and interest to characterize the metabolism of cADPR and NAADP in this cell model.Results in this study show that there are two forms of ADP-ribosyl cyclase in sea urchin egg, soluble and membrane-bound. This is established based on several criteria. First, the soluble cyclase cannot be sedimented by centrifugation by as high a force as 430,000 × g for 30 min. Second, only the soluble cyclase shows stimulation by cGMP. Third, the cGMP-dependent stimulation of the soluble cyclase is critically dependent on ATP but the membrane cyclase is neither stimulated by cGMP nor dependent on ATP. Finally, the soluble and membrane-bound cyclases show completely opposite pH dependence when using NGD as substrate.The insensitivity of the membrane-bound cyclase to cGMP is not due to the lack of a suitable G-kinase in the membrane fraction since only marginal stimulation by cGMP is seen in the total homogenate, which can be accounted for by the stimulation of the soluble cyclase (cf. Fig. 2). Also, supplementing the membrane fraction with a supernatant fraction could not restore the cGMP stimulation (data not shown). The supernatant fraction contained G-kinase activity as determined by the kinase assay shown in Fig. 9, but its cyclase activity was inactivated by ATP removal using a desalting column as described under “Results.” Supplementing the membrane fraction with a recombinant form of the mammalian 1α isoform of cGMP-dependent protein kinase also failed to restore the cGMP sensitivity of the membrane cyclase (data not shown).It is not unusual that there are two forms of ADP-ribosyl cyclase. TheAplysia cyclase is a soluble protein of about 30 kDa, whereas CD38 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein (reviewed in Refs. 21Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Biochimie. 1995; 77: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and22Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, guanylyl cyclase is found as both soluble and particulate forms (45Garbers D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9103-9106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What is unusual in the sea urchin egg is that the two forms of ADP-ribosyl cyclase are present in the same cell. The fact that the soluble cyclase is sensitive to cGMP makes it reasonable to assume that it is the signaling enzyme responsible for mediating the Ca2+ mobilizing effect of nitric oxide observed in sea urchin eggs (17Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus the elevation of cGMP levels in eggs by nitric oxide (17Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) stimulates the soluble cyclase, resulting in increased production of cADPR and mobilization of the Ca2+ stores. In this scenario, cADPR is functioning as a Ca2+ messenger. Accumulating evidence suggests that cADPR can also function as a modulator, sensitizing the Ca2+-induced Ca2+mechanism to Ca2+ (reviewed in Ref. 10Lee H.C. Re. Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 355-388PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane-bound cyclase could be responsible for regulating the local concentration of cADPR around the Ca2+ release channel and, by doing so, set the Ca2+ sensitivity of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism. Another finding reported in this study that is consistent with this proposal is the predominant association of the of cADPR hydrolase with membranes. The presence of both synthesis and degradation activities would allow for fine adjustment of the local concentration of cADPR and thus the sensitivity of the Ca2+ release mechanism to Ca2+.It is likely that the cGMP stimulation of the soluble cyclase is mediated by protein kinase G, which is consistent with previous results in intact egg and homogenates showing that the cGMP-activation of the cADPR-dependent pathway can be blocked by protein kinase inhibitors (16Galione A. White A. Willmott N. Turner M. Potter B.V. Watson S.P. Nature. 1993; 365: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this study, the cGMP stimulation of the soluble cyclase is found to require ATP and the presence of protein kinase G activity in the egg supernatant is demonstrated. The egg protein kinase G appears to be a minor component since its detection requires that most (98%) of the protein kinase A and the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase activities be blocked. The egg G kinase is nevertheless very unique. Unlike other forms of G-kinase, the G-kinase in the egg has a specific substrate,i.e. the soluble cyclase, and is not stimulated by equimolar cAMP. A recombinant form of the mammalian 1α isoform of cGMP-dependent protein kinase was also found to be unable to stimulate the soluble cyclase from eggs (data not shown), further demonstrating the specificity of the egg G kinase.The egg extracts can also catalyze the synthesis of NAADP via a base-exchange reaction. The activity is present in both the soluble and membrane fractions, but no cGMP stimulation is observed in either fraction. It is known that the Aplysia cyclase can catalyze both the cyclization and base-exchange reactions (23Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Whether the egg cyclase is also responsible for synthesizing NAADP remains to be shown. The specific exchange activity in the egg extracts, however, appears to be much higher than the cyclase activity. Similar to theAplysia cyclase, the exchange activity catalyzed by the egg extracts also shows a remarkable preference for acidic pH as low as pH 5 (23Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that, under physiological conditions, the cytoplasmic pH can be as acidic as pH 5. However, it should be noted that NAADP is a highly effective Ca2+ release activator and only nanomolar concentrations are needed to mobilize the Ca2+ stores (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 41Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The exchange activity does not have to be at its optimum to produce sufficient amounts of NAADP for Ca2+ signaling. In any case, it is clear that a synthetic pathway for NAADP is present in the egg extracts, which should continue to be a rich source for elucidating the complex metabolism of not only NAADP but also cADPR. In that regard, work is in progress to purify and characterize the soluble egg cyclase.

The cDNA sequence analysis showed that this Drosophila kinase is a homologue of mammalian p38 MAPK and the yeast HOG1 gene and thus was referred to as Dp38. A distinguishing feature of all MAPKs is the conserved sequence TGY in the activation domain. Dp38 was rapidly tyrosine 186-phosphorylated in response to osmotic stress, heat shock, serum starvation, and H2O2 in Drosophila l(2)mbn and Schneider cell lines. However, unlike mammalian p38 MAPK, the addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not significantly affect the phosphorylation of Dp38 in the LPS-responsivel(2)mbn cell line. Following osmotic stress, tyrosine 186-phosphorylated forms of Dp38 MAPK were detected exclusively in nuclear regions of Schneider cells. Yeast complementation studies demonstrated that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOG1 mutant strain JBY10 (hog1-Δ1) was functionally complemented by Dp38 cDNA in hyperosmolar medium. These findings demonstrate that similar osmotic stress-responsive signal transduction pathways are conserved in yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells, whereas LPS signal transduction pathways appear to be different.

Once activated, p38 is known to phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2, which in turn phosphorylates a small heat shock protein (2Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S.

The activation of p38 MAPK requires phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues in subdomain VIII of the activation domain.

The third subgroup of the MAPKs is ERK, which is activated by epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor. The ERK subgroup plays a central roles in growth and differentiation (9Karin M. Curr.

A partial deduced amino acid sequence of aDrosophila p38 MAPK from a PCR product has been previously reported by Biggs and Zipursky (15Biggs W.H. Zipursky S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, no information is available with regard to Drosophila p38 cDNA(s), and its function in Drosophila cell physiology and development remains to be elucidated. In this work, we describe the full cDNA of a Drosophila homologue of p38 MAPK and certain functional roles in Drosophila cells. Reagents were purchased from following sources:Thermus aquaticus polymerase (Takara); Mega prime DNA labeling system (Amersham); Cy5 Autocycle sequencing kit and Cy5 Autoread sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.); Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.); Nylon filter (Amersham Hybond-N+); PCR machine (Perkin-Elmer); A.L.F. express DNA sequencer (Pharmacia); enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Corp.); phosphospecific p38 MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs). Water was of Milli Q grade. All other chemicals were of the highest commercial grade. Gateff's Drosophila l(2)mbn hemocyte cell line (24Gateff E. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman and Hall, London1998: 189-200Google Scholar) and Schneider cell line (25Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were grown at 23 °C in Corning flasks in Schneider medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5 or 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowhittaker) heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. Except when specially mentioned, all DNA and RNA manipulations were carried out using standard techniques (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two pairs of degenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized, sense primer-1 (SP-1; 5′-GTN GCN ATH AAR AAR YT-3′) and sense primer-2 (SP-2; 5′-GTN GCN ATH AAR AAR AT-3′), which included all possible codons specifying conserved subdomain II sequences VAIKKL and VAIKKI, respectively. Antisense primers were synthesized; antisense-1 (AP-1; 5′-GCN-ACR-TAN-CCN-GTC-AT-3′) and antisense-2 (AP-2; 5′-GCN ACR-TAN CCN GTN AR-3′) correspond to the complementary sequences MTGYVA and LTGYVA, respectively, both of which contain the conserved phosphorylation sites located in subdomain VIII. An aliquot of the Drosophila l(2)mbn cDNA library (2.5 μl) was amplified with 1 μm of each primer in pairs (four combinations: SP-1/AP-1, SP-2/AP-1, SP-1/AP-2, and SP-2/AP-2) with the following thermal cycle profile: 94 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified mixtures were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels, and each band was purified and cloned into pBlueScript SK(−). ADrosophila cDNA library in λ Zap II (Stratagene) was made as described (27Tryselius Y. Hultmark D. Insect Mol. Biol. 1997; 6: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. Dan Hultmark (University of Stockholm, Sweden). A full-length Dp38 cDNA was isolated from ∼ 2.5 × 105 independent clones previously transferred onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham) using a specific 420-bp PCR product as a probe. The 420-bp PCR product was random-primed using fluorescein-11-dUTP. The membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C in a solution containing 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 5% dextran sulfate at 60 °C for 2 h. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 60 °C in this solution containing fluorescein-11-dUTP-labeled probe, washed, and detected using anti-fluorescein-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham). Positive plaques were purified by two rounds of screening, and the cDNA inserts were subcloned into pBlueScript SK(−) plasmid by in vivo excision from the recombinant λ Zap II as described by Stratagene. The cDNA inserts were sequenced across both strands using an A.L.F. express automatic sequencer (Pharmacia). Insect cells (∼106), exposed to various stress conditions, were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The total cellular proteins (100 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). The antibody used for this study was rabbit anti-human p38 phosphospecific antibody, purchased from New England Biolabs. This antibody specifically recognizes the phosphorylated active form of Tyr182 of human p38 MAPK and cross-reacts with Drosophila p38 and murine p38 MAPKs. According to the manufacturer's information, it does not cross-react with either inactive p38 or other MAPKs (JNK and ERK). The anti-p38 phosphospecific antibody was diluted to 1:1000 and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature (25 °C). After washing, the blot was subsequently incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:3000. Detection was carried out using the ECL Western blot detection kit (Amersham). Total RNA from Drosophila l(2)mbn cells and Schneider cells was extracted (30Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) and was separated by using electrophoresis on a denaturating formaldehyde-agarose gel. The RNA was capillary-transferred to a Hybond-N membrane, baked at 80 °C for 2 h, and cross-linked by UV irradiation. The membrane was prehybridized at 42 °C for 1 h in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out in this solution containing [α-32P]dCTP random-primed Dp38 cDNA insert (106 cpm/ml). The blot was briefly washed at 50 °C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then washed twice at 50 °C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min and twice at 55 °C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min and autoradiographed at −70 °C using intensifying screens. The S. cerevisiae hog1 mutant (JBY10) and HOG1 plasmid (pJB30; HOG1 URA3 CEN) as described by Brewter et al. (3Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. C. Gustin (Rice University, Houston, TX). The yeast strain was transformed with Dp38-sense (Dp38-sense URA3 CEN), Dp38-antisense (Dp38-antisense URA3 CEN), or pJB30 (HOG1 URA3 CEN) plasmid as described previously (31Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structures of all plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The transformants were selected on synthetic complete (SC)-Ura medium (32Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), and osmotic cell growth was tested on a YPD plate containing 0.6 or 0.9 m NaCl (32Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were cultured 15 h in 5 ml of SC-Ura medium at 30 °C with vigorous shaking. The cultured cells were inoculated into 80 ml of fresh SC-Ura medium, and cells were grown further under the same condition. When A 600 reached 1.0, the cells were harvested and resuspended into 200 ml of the same medium containing 0.6 m NaCl. The cells were further incubated for 1.5 h at 30 °C with vigorous shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min and were washed one time with water. The cell pellets were stored at −70 °C for later use. Frozen cells were thawed on ice with 2 ml of ice-cold modified H buffer (33Booher R.N. Alfa C.E. Hyams J.S. Beach D.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 485-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) containing 10% glycerol (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNaN3, 0.25 mm each meta- and orthovanadate, 0.1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml each pepstatin A, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma) were added, and cells were broken by vortexing six times for 30 min at 4 °C. After transferring supernatants into new tubes, samples were recentrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min in microcentrifuge tubes at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, stored at −70 °C, and later used for protein determination and Western blot analysis. Epitope (6 × His) tag was added to the amino-terminal region of Dp38 by subcloning of Dp38 cDNA into His-tagged bacterial expression vector PQE-30 (Qiagen). The His-tagged Dp38 insert was subsequently subcloned intoDrosophila transfection vector, pPacPL that contains the actin 5C promotor (34Petersen U.-M. Björklund G. Ip Y.T. Engström Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3146-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The transfection vector pPacPL-luciferase was constructed to control transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (35Rio D.C. Rubin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1833-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cells were used 24 h post-transfection. Schneider cells expressing His-tagged proteins were activated with 300 mmNaCl for 0, 5, 15, and 60 min. The cells were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 30 min and subsequently centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The epitope-tagged protein kinases were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with the monoclonal anti-His antibody (Qiagen) prebound to protein G-agarose for 15 min at room temperature. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice successively with decreasing concentrations of NETF buffer,i.e. 6, 3, and 0% NETF (6, 3, and 0% Nonidet P-40, respectively, in 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF) and were finally washed once with kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate). The immunocomplexes were resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP and 10 μg of myelin basic protein, and the kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The reactions were terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The phosphorylation of the substrate proteins was examined after SDS-PAGE by autoradiography and phosphor-imaging (Fuji Bas 2500) analysis. Cells were grown in 24-well culture dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml and then were fixed for 30 min in 3% formaldehyde, washed, and blocked in a Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight in a Tris-buffered saline solution containing Triton X-100, 5% bovine serum albumin, and a 1:2000 dilution of p38 phosphospecific antibody. The cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h. Detection was carried out with the ABC reagent kit using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were mounted in glycerol and examined with a Olympus BX microscope. The Fasta, TFASTA, WORDSEARCH, and BLAST algorithms were used to determine nucleic acid and protein sequence homology between Dp38 and other known proteins (36Argos P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 751-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To isolate a Drosophila homologue of p38 MAPK, primers were synthesized based on conserved subdomains II and VIII of known MAPKs. One of the primer pairs (sense primer-1 and antisense primer-1) gave a specific 420-bp PCR product that was subsequently cloned, reamplified, and used to screen a Drosophila l(2)mbn cDNA library. From approximately 2.5 × 105 clones, one positive plaque was obtained. This plaque was purified, and the insert was excised into pBlueScript SK(−) and sequenced. The insert of this clone contained a 5′-noncoding region and an open reading frame of 1098 bp corresponding to 366 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). An untranslated flanking sequence of 187 bp was present between the terminal codon and the poly(A) site. The calculated molecular mass of the deduced protein was 42,151 Da. Comparative sequence analysis showed Dp38 to be most homologous to human p38 MAPK (37Han J. Richter B. Li Z. Kravchenko V. Ulevitch R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 265: 224-227Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) followed by Xenopus Mpk2 (2Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R.

A. 1992; 89: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The Thr184 and Tyr186 residues in subdomain VIII are in an equivalent position to TGY, TPY, and TEY sequences in other members of the MAPK family (Fig. 2 A). It is interesting to note that Dp38 is more closely related to other p38 MAPKs than to Drosophila ERK and Drosophila JNK (Fig. 2 B). A recent crystallography study of p38 MAPK comparing its structure with that of ERK2 demonstrated that the phosphorylation “Lip” (a regulatory loop near the active site) of p38 consists of 13 residues, 6 residues shorter than that of ERK2, and the conformation of the Lip of unphosphorylated p38 is unique in that it plays a role in activator specificity (39Wang Z. Harkins P.C. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Like mammalian p38, the phosphorylation Lips of Dp38 and HOG1 are also 6 residues shorter than that of Drosophila ERK (Fig. 2 A). These observations suggest that Dp38, together with HOG1 and mammalian p38, falls into the same structural MAPK subgroup.Figure 2A, sequence homology betweenDrosophila p38 MAPK (dp38) and other known vertebrate and invertebrate MAPKs. The identical amino acid residues between Dp38 and other known MAPKs are indicated by dotsunder the aligned sequences. The conserved dual phosphorylation sites (TPY, TGY, and TEY) are underlined.

Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In the case of mammalian p38 MAPK, the activation is mediated by phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr by MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3) and MKK6, whereas SEK/MKK4 may activate both p38 and JNK (11Dérijard B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that HEP, a Drosophila homologue of MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6, phosphorylated and activated Drosophila JNK in vitro (18Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip T.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Whether HEP is also an upstream activator for Dp38 MAPK remains to be determined. To verify the expression of Dp38 MAPK in Drosophila cell lines, total RNA from l(2)mbn and Schneider cells was hybridized with a random-primed cDNA fragment. In a Northern blot, high expression of a single RNA band appeared below the 18 S ribosomal RNA in both Drosophila cell lines (data not shown). To address stimulus specificity of Dp38 kinase, Tyr186phosphorylation of Dp38 was examined using p38 Tyr186-specific antibody following various forms of extracellular stress. This antibody is specific for the Tyr186-phosphorylated “active” form of Dp38 and does not recognize unphosphorylated Dp38. Fig.3 A shows that Tyr186 of Dp38 was intensely phosphorylated in bothDrosophila Schneider and l(2)mbn cells in response to osmotic shock, heat shock, and H2O2, whereas unstimulated cells contained only trace levels of Tyr186 phosphorylation. In addition, we also observed that when l(2)mbn cells were cultured at the recommended concentration of 5% fetal bovine serum (24Gateff E. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman and Hall, London1998: 189-200Google Scholar), Dp38 (Tyr186) was constitutively and intensely phosphorylated; however, if the concentration of fetal bovine serum in the culture medium was increased to 10%, as in the present study, the phosphorylated state was not detectable without stimulus (Fig.3 B). We find this result very interesting, since this is the first time a p38 MAPK has been shown to be phosphorylated under conditions of serum starvation. This result suggests the involvement of Dp38 in a wide range of physiological stress conditions. It is important to note that up until now, almost all studies carried out with l(2)mbn cells cultured in Schneider medium were supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum according to Gateff's instructions (24Gateff E. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman and Hall, London1998: 189-200Google Scholar). The fact that Dp38 is constitutively activated when cells are cultured in 5% fetal bovine serum reflects their state of cellular stress. Hence, one should take into consideration this physiological state when conducting experiments on these cells. Interestingly, LPS, which is known to activate p38 kinase in mammalian cells (1Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar), does not cause significant phosphorylation of Dp38 in either Schneider cells or immunocompetent Drosophila l(2)mbn cells (Fig. 3 A). This result contrasts with the observations reported for Drosophila JNK. Drosophila JNK is activated in response to LPS treatment in both l(2)mbn and S2* Schneider cells (18Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip T.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It is well established thatl(2)mbn cells when treated with even infinitesimal concentrations of LPS respond by inducing a rapid up-regulation of antibacterial peptide genes (41Engström Y. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 211-244Google Scholar). In addition, Tyr186 phosphorylation of Dp38 was examined in Schneider cells following a 15-min treatment with increasing concentrations of NaCl (0–500 mm NaCl). Our results suggest that the amount of Tyr186 phosphorylation of Dp38 was proportional to the NaCl concentration with maximal phosphorylation at 300 mm (Fig. 3 C). We also examined the time course of Tyr186 phosphorylation from 0 to 120 min in the presence of 300 mm NaCl. Tyr186 phosphorylation was detected within 2 min, reached its maximum level after 5 min, and returned to its basal level by 60 min (Fig. 3 D). This result suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of Dp38 is one of the earliest events following osmotic shock. The kinetics of Tyr186phosphorylation in response to osmotic shock are similar to those observed for HOG1 in yeast (3Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). To confirm that the Tyr186 phosphorylation status is directly proportional to the Dp38 MAPK activity, Dp38 kinase activity was assayed using myelin basic protein as a substrate. Schneider cells transfected with epitope (His)-tagged Dp38 were treated with 300 mm NaCl from 0 to 60 min and then immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-His antibody bound to protein G agarose. The kinase assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 4shows that there is a good correlation between kinase activity and the Tyr186 phosphorylation status shown in Fig. 3 D. While at time 0 cells simply showed background levels of activity, the osmotic stressed Dp38-transfected cells showed highest MAPK activity after 5 min, which then gradually decreased (Fig. 4). However, no kinase activity was detected after osmotic shock in the untransfected control cells (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that Dp38 Tyr186 phosphorylation is necessary for kinase activity. Furthermore, this result is consistent with the observation that mammalian p38 with mutations in the dual phosphorylation motif (Ala-Gly-Phe instead of Thr-Gly-Tyr) could not be phosphorylated on Tyr and Thr after a stress stimulus and was catalytically inactive (4Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). The high sequence homology and similar activation mechanism induced by hyperosmolarity between Dp38 and HOG1led us to investigate whether Dp38 is a functional homologue of theHOG1 gene. HOG1-Δ1 mutant yeasts were transformed with HOG1, Dp38-sense, or Dp38-antisense constructs. The viability of transformed yeast cells was then tested on medium containing 0.6 m NaCl and 0.9 m NaCl. The results demonstrated that while Dp38-antisense-transformed cells failed to grow on 0.6 m NaCl medium, whereasHOG1 and Dp38-sense-transformed cells grew well (Fig.5). However, Dp38-sense-transformed cells failed to grow on the medium containing 0.9 m NaCl (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Dp38 partially complemented the function of HOG1 in a hyperosmotic environment. Hanet al. (1Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar) reported that murine p38 MAPK could complement the HOG1-Δ1 mutant strain on 0.9 m medium with lower efficacy than that of the HOG1 gene. To verify the Tyr186 phosphorylation status of Dp38 under hyperosmotic conditions, overnight cultures of Dp38-sense- and Dp38-antisense-transformed yeast cells were harvested and treated with medium containing 0.6 m NaCl for 1.5 h at 30 °C. An aliquot of each lysate (Dp38-sense- and Dp38-antisense-transformed cells) was subjected to Western blot analysis using Tyr186phosphospecific antibody (Fig. 6). The results demonstrate that Dp38-sense-transformed cells contain the Tyr186-phosphorylated form of Dp38 in the presence of 0.6m NaCl. However, no phosphorylation band was detected in Dp38-antisense-transformed cells (Fig. 6). This result leads us to believe that the Tyr186-phosphorylated active form of Dp38 in complemented cells is an important event for yeast cell survival under hyperosmotic media.Figure 6Western blot analysis of Dp38 transformed yeast HOG1 mutant following osmotic shock. Dp38-sense (lane 1) and antisense (lane 2) transformed cells were grown in SC-Ura medium (A 600 = 1.0) and further treated with 0.6 m NaCl in the same medium at 30 °C for 1.5 h. Equal amounts (100 μg) of soluble cell extracts were analyzed for immunoblotting using p38 phosphospecific antibody. The Tyr186-phosphorylated form of Dp38 is indicated by an arrow. Protein size markers in kilodaltons are presented on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The subcellular distribution of Tyr186-phosphorylated Dp38 MAPK was examined by immunocytochemistry. In the control experiment, no reliable staining was detected, which indicates that the level of the Tyr186-phosphorylated form of Dp38 is not significant (data not shown). However, very specific staining was detected in the nuclear region of hyperosmotically stimulated cells (Fig.7). These data suggest that Dp38 was specifically Tyr186-phosphorylated in response to hyperosmotic stress and exclusively located in the nucleus. In conclusion, we have cloned and sequenced the Drosophilap38 MAPK from a l(2)mbn cDNA library and demonstrated its phosphorylation in response to various extracellular stress signals such as osmotic shock, heat shock, serum starvation, and H2O2. Furthermore, Dp38 could complement aHOG1-Δ1 mutant strain in medium containing 0.6m NaCl. The Tyr186 phosphorylation of Dp38 was very rapid following stress, and the phosphorylated Dp38 was exclusively detected in the nuclear zone of Schneider cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that the p38 MAPK stress signal pathway is well conserved in Drosophila. The availability of the Dp38 cDNA will allow us to better understand the role of this kinase in the physiology and development ofDrosophila.

(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9871–9874). We investigated the mechanism(s) in conscious rats. Hyperglycemia per se caused a rapid and marked increase in Glc-6-Pase mRNA abundance and protein levels. By contrast, hyperglycemia decreased the abundance of PEPCK mRNA. Importantly, inhibition of glucokinase activity by glucosamine infusion blunted both the stimulation of Glc-6-Pase and the inhibition of PEPCK gene expression by Glc, suggesting that an intrahepatic signal (metabolite) generated by the metabolism of glucose at or beyond Glc-6-P was responsible for the regulatory effect of Glc.The effect of Glc on the l-type pyruvate kinase gene is mediated by xylulose-5-P (Doiron, B., Cuif, M., Chen, R., and Kahn, A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 5321–5324). Thus, we next investigated whether an isolated increase in the hepatic concentration of this metabolite can also reproduce the effects of Glc on Glc-6-Pase and PEPCK gene expression in vivo. Xylitol, which is directly converted to xylulose-5-P in the liver, was infused to raise the hepatic concentration of xylulose-5-P by ∼3-fold. Xylitol infusion did not alter the levels of Glc-6-P and of fructose-2,6-biphosphate. However, it replicated the effects of hyperglycemia on Glc-6-Pase and PEPCK gene expression and resulted in a 75% increase in the in vivo flux through Glc-6-Pase (total glucose output).

We have recently demonstrated that the marked increase in Glc-6-Pase mRNA and protein levels in the liver of diabetic rats was restored to normal levels following normalization of the plasma glucose concentrations by either insulin or the glycosuric agent phlorizin (19Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (9844): 9871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Since phlorizin administration failed to normalize Glc-6-Pase gene expression when hyperglycemia was maintained by glucose infusion (19Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (9844): 9871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we suggested that Glc-6-Pase gene expression in the diabetic liver is regulated by glucose independent of insulin. This preliminary observation has received support by a recent comprehensive study in primary cultured hepatocytes which demonstrated stimulation of Glc-6-Pase gene expression by glucose and fructose 2,6-biphosphate (22Argaud D. Kirby T. Newgard C. Lange A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12854-12861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, Glc-6-Pase belongs to a family of genes whose expression is regulated by carbohydrates. In particular, this family includes genes coding for key enzymes within the gluconeogenic, glycolytic, and lipogenic pathways, such as l-type pyruvate kinase (23Munnich A. Marie J. Reach G. Vaulont S. Simon M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10228-10231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vaulont S. Munnich A. Decaux J. Kahn A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). While changes in the plasma glucose concentration are likely to regulate the gene expression of liver enzymes in the intact organism as well (19Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (9844): 9871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the impact of these changes on in vivo glucose fluxes has not been delineated. It has long been recognized thatacute hyperglycemia decreases HGP in perfused liver (29Glinsman W.H. Hern E.P. Lynch A. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 216: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and in non-diabetic animals (10Rossetti L. Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K. Sebel G. Hu M. J. Clin.

Endocrinol. & Metab. 1979; 47: 1160-1163Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This decrease is associated with increased flux through glucokinase (increased glucose cycling), with no measurable changes in the in vivo fluxes through gluconeogenesis and Glc-6-Pase (10Rossetti L. Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K. Sebel G. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of hyperglycemia, it may be difficult to isolate the impact of the stimulation of hepatic Glc-6-Pase gene expression on hepatic glucose fluxes. The aim of the present work was to test the hypothesis that the flux of glucose through glucokinase modulates Glc-6-Pase gene expression in conscious rats. We also wished to determine whether glucose itself or an intracellular metabolite generated by glucose metabolism is responsible for this stimulatory effect on the expression of the Glc-6-Pase gene. Our results indicate that, similar to what has been recently observed for the hepatic pyruvate kinase gene in cultured hepatocytes (33Doiron B. Cuif M. Chen R. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5321-5344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), an intrahepatic signal generated by the metabolism of glucose in the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (Fig. 1 A) can reproduce the stimulatory effect of glucose on the expression the Glc-6-Pase gene in vivo. Most important, this stimulation resulted in a marked increase in the rate of glucose production. We propose that the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate shunt represents a glucose sensing regulatory pathway which activates a feedback control system limiting the size of the Glc-6-P pool in response to sustained increases in the rate of hepatic glucose phosphorylation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) were used in all studies. Rats were housed in individual cages and subjected to a standard light (6 a. m. to 6 p. m.) and dark (6 p. m. to 6 a. m.) cycle. Five to seven days before the in vivo study, rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) and indwelling catheters were inserted into the right internal jugular vein and in the left carotid artery. The venous catheter was extended to the level of the right atrium and the arterial catheter was advanced to the level of the aortic arch (34Rossetti L. Smith D. Shulman G.I. Papachristou D. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 35Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Studies were performed in awake, unstressed, chronically catheterized rats using a combination of the pancreatic and hyperglycemic clamp techniques (10Rossetti L. Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K. Sebel G. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar,36Massillon D. Barzilai N. Hawkins M. Prus-Wertheimer D. Rossetti L.

All rats were fasted for 6 h before the in vivo studies. At the beginning of the basal period and 120 min before starting the glucose/insulin/xylitol infusions, a prime continuous infusion of high performance liquid chromatography-purified [3-3H]glucose (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA; 20 μCi of bolus, 0.2 μCi/min) was initiated and maintained throughout the remainder of the study. Briefly, in protocol 1, a primed continuous infusion of somatostatin (1.5 μg/kg·min) and regular insulin (∼0.7 milliunits/kg·min) were administered, and a variable infusion of a 25% glucose solution was started at time 0 and periodically adjusted to clamp the plasma glucose concentration at ∼7 mm for 5 h (euglycemic studies) or at ∼7 mm for 2 h followed by 1, 3, or 5 h at ∼17 mm (hyperglycemic studies). When indicated, glucosamine (GlcN) was infused at a rate of 30 μmol/kg·min, designed to elevate and maintain the plasma GlcN concentrations at ∼2 mm. During the first 2 h of the studies (euglycemic period) the rate of insulin infusion was adjusted as required to maintain normoglycemia during the somatostatin infusion. The average insulin infusion required to maintain normoglycemia in all groups was 0.7 ± 0.1 milliunits/kg·min, without the need for glucose infusion. In one group of rats the rate of insulin infusion was increased to 18 milliunits/kg·min for 3 h while the plasma glucose concentration was raised and maintained at ∼17 mmby a variable infusion of glucose. In protocol 2, a primed continuous infusion of somatostatin (1.5 μg/kg·min) and regular insulin (1.0 milliunits/kg·min) were administered, and a variable infusion of a 25% glucose solution was started at time 0 and periodically adjusted to clamp the plasma glucose concentration at ∼7 mm for 5 h. During the last 3 h of the studies, vehicle or xylitol (30 μmol/kg·min) were also infused. Blood samples (∼25 μl) were taken every 10 min to monitor the plasma glucose concentrations and adjust the rates of glucose infusion. Plasma samples for determination of plasma insulin, glucagon, and FFA concentrations were obtained every 30 min during the study. At the end of the insulin infusion, rats were anesthetized (pentobarbital 60 mg/kg body weight, intravenously), the abdomen was quickly opened, portal vein blood obtained and liver was freeze-clamped in situ with aluminum tongs precooled in liquid nitrogen. The time from the injection of the anesthetic until freeze-clamping of the liver was less than 45 s. Tissue samples were stored at −80 °C for analysis. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Microsomes were prepared according to van de Werve et al. (11van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6033-6036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol.

Briefly, liver tissue (100 mg) was homogenized in 10 volumes of a Tris sucrose/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.3, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EGTA. This homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g; the cytosol was then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g, and the pellet resuspended in 1 ml of Tris sucrose/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer. The resuspended pellet was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence of Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.1%. Protein content was measured by the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Equal amounts of proteins (20 μg) were subjected to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with a 1:2500 dilution of polyclonal anti-Glc-6-Pase antibody (16Haber B. Chin S. Chuang E. Buikhuisen W. Naji A. Taub R. J. Clin.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 153-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by a 1:2500 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies kit (Amersham, ECL, Arlington Heights, IL). Total RNA was isolated from freeze-clamped liver tissues according to the Trizol method (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). The isolated RNA was assessed for purity by the 260/280 absorbance ratio. 20 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on a 1.2% formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel in 1 × MOPS running buffer. The RNA was visualized with ethidium bromide and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham). We used a 1.25-kilobase Eco-HindIII Glc-6-Pase cDNA, a 2.2-kilobase glucokinase cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Mark Magnuson, Vanderbilt University), and a PEPCK cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Hanson, Case Western Reserve University) which were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, using the Random Prime Labeling system (Life Technologies). Prehybridization was performed for 4 h at 42 °C in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide (v/v), 5 × Denhardt's, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 1% SDS, 100 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h in the same buffer with the32P-labeled probe. The filters were washed 3 times for 10 min in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and 2 times in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 55 °C, then exposed to Fuji x-ray films for 12–48 h at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Quantification was done by scanning densitometry. Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Glucose Analyzer II, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Plasma insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay, using rat and porcine insulin standards. The plasma concentration of FFA was determined by an enzymatic method with an automated kit according to the manufacturer's specifications (Waco Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Plasma [3H]glucose radioactivity was measured in duplicates in the supernatants of Ba(OH)2 and ZnSO4 precipitates (Somogyi procedure) of plasma samples (20 μl) after evaporation to dryness to eliminate tritiated water. Fructose 2,6-biphosphate was extracted at 80 °C in 0.1 mNaOH and measured using the 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase assay (38Van Schaftingen E. Lederer B. Bartrons R. Hers H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Xylulose-5-P concentration was assayed according to the method of Casazza and Veech (39Casazza J. Veech R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 690-698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Casazza J. Veech R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Uridine diphosphoglucose and uridine diphosphogalactose concentrations and specific activities in the liver were obtained through two sequential chromatographic separations, as previously reported (10Rossetti L. Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K. Sebel G. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Plasma glucosamine concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography following quantitative derivatization with phenyl isothiocyanate as described previously (41Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Differences between groups were determined by ANOVA analysis of variance. All values are presented as the mean ± S.E. The term total glucose output (TGO) is intended as total in vivo flux through Glc-6-Pase. The term hepatic glucose production (HGP) is intended as the netrates of Glc-6-P dephosphorylation to glucose. Finally, glucose cycling is defined as the input of extracellular glucose into the Glc-6-P pool followed by exit of plasma-derived Glc-6-P back into the extracellular pool. Under steady-state conditions for plasma glucose concentrations, the rate of glucose disappearance equals the rate of glucose appearance. The latter was calculated as the ratio of the rate of infusion of [3-3H]glucose (dpm/min) and the steady-state plasma [3H]glucose specific activity (dpm/mg). When exogenous glucose was given, the rate ofendogenous glucose production was calculated as the difference between rate appearance and the infusion rate of glucose. The percent of the hepatic glucose-6-phosphate pool directly derived from plasma glucose was calculated as the ratio of [3H]uridine diphosphoglucose and plasma [3H]glucose specific activities (10Rossetti L. Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K. Sebel G. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in age and body weight among groups. TableI displays biochemical parameters during the euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp studies. The plasma glucose levels were kept at approximately 7 mm in the euglycemic studies and 17 mm in the hyperglycemic studies. Insulin, glucagon, and FFA levels were not significantly different between groups. During the hyperglycemic studies in which glucosamine was infused the plasma glucosamine concentration averaged 2.1 ± 0.3 mm. Table II displays biochemical parameters during the pancreatic clamp studies with vehicle or xylitol infusions. There were no significant differences in the plasma glucose, insulin, FFA, and glucagon concentrations between the two groups.Table ISteady state plasma glucose, FFA, insulin, and glucagon concentrations during the euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp studiesGroupnGlucoseFFAInsulinGlucagonmmmicrounits/mlpg/mlEuglycemia77.2 ± 0.20.52 ± 0.0931 ± 5158 ± 11Hyperglycemia817.6 ± 1.31-ap < 0.01 versus euglycemia (1).0.46 ± 0.1240 ± 6175 ± 18Hyperglycemia + glucosamine617.5 ± 0.51-ap < 0.01 versus euglycemia (1).0.44 ± 0.0639 ± 4166 ± 16Hyperglycemia + insulin517.1 ± 0.71-ap < 0.01 versus euglycemia (1).0.31 ± 0.191-ap < 0.01 versus euglycemia (1).489 ± 27158 ± 191-a p < 0.01 versus euglycemia (1Nordlie R.

In the presence of similar plasma insulin and glucagon levels, 2–3 h hyperglycemia per se inhibited HGP by 40% compared with either basal studies (saline infusion) or time control studies at euglycemia. However, this suppression of HGP could not be detected following 4–5 h of hyperglycemia. In fact, HGP was similar between 4 and 5 h of hyperglycemia and euglycemia. Fig. 2, B and C, display the rates of in vivo Glc-6-Pase flux (TGO) and glucose cycling during pancreatic clamp studies at euglycemia and hyperglycemia. While TGO was not significantly affected by hyperglycemia at 3 h, it was significantly increased (by 58%) following 5 h at hyperglycemiaversus euglycemia. As previously reported (10Rossetti L. Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K. Sebel G. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), hyperglycemia markedly stimulated the rate of glucose cycling. However, this rate was further increased between 3 and 5 h of hyperglycemia, probably reflecting the marked stimulation of the flux through Glc-6-Pase. To examine in vivo the effect of hyperglycemia per se on the gene expression of key hepatic enzymes, we infused somatostatin to inhibit the endogeneous secretion of insulin and glucagon, replaced insulin either at basal or high levels, and infused glucose at a variable rate to achieve and maintain either euglycemia or hyperglycemia for 1, 3, or 5 h (Fig.1 B). The relative abundance of Glc-6-Pase mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis using a 1.25-kilobase cDNA that recognizes the catalytic portion of this enzyme. Fig.3 A shows that hyperglycemia markedly increased the Glc-6-Pase mRNA in the liver of nondiabetic rats. Analysis of the time course of this effect demonstrates a rapid increase in the mRNA abundance within 1 h reaching a maximal value (more than 5-fold increase) at 3 and 5 h. The stimulatory effect of glucose on Glc-6-Pase gene expression could be mediated by glucose directly or by a metabolite derived from glucose metabolism. The first step in hepatic glucose metabolism is its phosphorylation by glucokinase. Glucosamine is a potent competitive inhibitor of glucokinase and it has been previously used for this purpose in vitro (42Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in vivo (37Barzilai N. Hawkins M. Angelov I. Hu M. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Balkan B. Dunning B. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Specifically, we have recently shown that glucosamine, at plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in the present studies (∼2 mm), decreases hepatic glucokinase activity in vitro (by 60%) and the flux through glucokinase in vivo (37Barzilai N. Hawkins M. Angelov I. Hu M. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to delineate whether glucose needs to be phosphorylated to regulate the hepatic gene expression of Glc-6-Pase, we performed additional 3-h hyperglycemic clamp studies while the hepatic activity of glucokinase was markedly inhibited by maintaining throughout the plasma glucosamine concentration at ∼2 mm. This duration of hyperglycemia (3 h) was selected since substantial accumulation of Glc-6-Pase mRNA was consistently observed at this time. The stimulatory effect of glucose on Glc-6-Pase gene expression (Fig. 3 A) was prevented by the glucosamine-induced inhibition of glucokinase activity, indicating that glucose needs to be phosphorylated to exert its effect on the Glc-6-Pase gene. To assess the specific effect of glucose on Glc-6-Pase enzyme expression, we next examined the effect of hyperglycemia per se on PEPCK and GK mRNA levels. Indeed, it has been previously shown that glucose independent of insulin decreases PEPCK gene transcription and accelerates the degradation of the PEPCK mRNA in streptozotocin-diabetic rats (26Kahn C. Lauris V. Koch S. Crettaz M. Granner D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, liver PEPCK mRNA was used as negative marker for Glc-6-Pase enzyme expression since its expression is expected to be regulated in an opposite fashion by glucose per se. In fact, PEPCK mRNA displayed opposite regulation to Glc-6-Pase mRNA. Hyperglycemia markedly, rapidly, and progressively decreased PEPCK mRNA starting within 1 h of hyperglycemia (Fig.3 B). Although the inhibitory effect of hyperglycemia was less pronounced on GK mRNA than on PEPCK mRNA, Fig.4 shows that high glucose levels were also associated with a moderate decrease in the abundance of glucokinase mRNA both at the end of 3- and 5-h hyperglycemic clamp studies. Most important, glucosamine infusion completely blocked the effect of 3-h hyperglycemia on PEPCK and GK mRNA levels suggesting that, as for Glc-6-Pase mRNA, this effect required glucose phosphor"

We have previously shown that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) can activate histone H4 gene expression. In this report we establish that a mouse histone H4 gene and its human homolog lose stringent cell cycle control in synchronized embryonic fibroblasts in which IRF-2 has been ablated. We also show that there are reduced mRNA levels of this endogenous mouse histone H4 gene in the IRF-2−/− cells. Strikingly, the overall mRNA level and cell cycle regulation of histone H4 transcription are restored when IRF-2 is reintroduced to these cells. IRF-2 is a negative regulator of the interferon response and has oncogenic potential, but little is known of the mechanism of these activities. Our results suggest that IRF-2 is an active player in E2F-independent cell cycle-regulated gene expression at the G1/S phase transition. IRF-2 was previously considered a passive antagonist to the tumor suppressor IRF-1 but can now join other oncogenic factors such as c-Myb and E2F1 that are predicted to mediate their transforming capabilities by actively regulating genes necessary for cell cycle progression.

One putative mechanism of the oncogenic activity of IRF-2 is that IRF-2 antagonizes the antiproliferative action of IRF-1 by competing for binding sites in the promoters of several growth-suppressing genes (4Beneath P.

Unlike many other genes that are regulated at the G1/S transition point such as dihydrofolate reductase and thymidine kinase, FO108 is regulated by an E2F-independent mechanism (11van Wijnen A.J. van Gurp M.F. de Ridder M.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter element ofFO108 that interacts with IRF-2 is essential for the peak in transcription of this gene in early S phase and was designated a cell cycle element (CCE) (8Ramsey-Ewing A. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4475-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, other protein factors can also interact with the CCE, namely HiNF-P (H4TF2) and HiNF-D, a CDP/cut, Cdc2, cyclin A, pRB complex (9van Wijnen A. Ramsey-Ewing A. Bortell R. Owen T. Lian J.

This result could be due to partial functional redundancy among these factors, the use of alternative binding sites, or differential binding properties of these factors in vivo. Weak interactions of IRF-2 and CDP/cut with alternative binding sites in theFO108 promoter have been observed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). 3T. J. Last, P. S. Vaughan, J. L.

Therefore, to definitively establish the role of IRF-2 in histone H4 transcription regulation, we have performed cell cycle analyses using embryonic fibroblasts from IRF-2 knockout (IRF-2−/−) mice (16Matsuyama T.

Individual resistant colonies that expressed both CAT mRNA and IRF-2 protein were isolated and expanded. Whole cell extracts from the various cell lines were prepared as described (20Jiang S.-W. Eberhardt N.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3607-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). EMSAs were carried out with 10 μg of each extract and 10 fmol of radioactive CCE probe as described previously (7Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J.

Cells maintained as monolayer cultures were synchronized by the double thymidine block method (21Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Last T.J. Owen T. McCabe L. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Danish Centre for Human Genome Research, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 282-287Google Scholar). After the final release from block, cells were collected at hourly time points for RNA isolation and DNA synthesis assays by [3H]thymidine uptake (21Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Last T.J. Owen T. McCabe L. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Danish Centre for Human Genome Research, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 282-287Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 μg of total RNA from each time point was separated in an agarose/formaldehyde gel as described (18Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar), blotted on Zeta-Probe (Bio-Rad), and probed with a rat histone H4 fragment (22Grimes S. Weisz-Carrington P. Daum III, H. Smith J. Green L. Wright K. Stein G. Stein J. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 534-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Antisense RNA probes for CAT and cyclophilin (internal control) were prepared from pTriCAT and pTriCyclophilin plasmids using a MaxiScript kit according to the manufacturer (Ambion) except that the cyclophilin probe was made with 200 μm UTP and 20 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. RNase protection assays were performed with the RPA II kit according to the manufacturer (Ambion) using 10 μg of total RNA, 8 × 104 cpm of CAT probe, and 3.5 × 104 cpm of cyclophilin probe and digesting with 0.5 units of RNase A and 5 units of RNase T1. For S1 analysis, 52-nucleotide probes were synthesized that were complementary to the junction of the unique 5′-untranslated region and the coding region of mouse histone H4-A and H4-B mRNA (H4-A, 5′-CCTCTGCCAGACATAGCTAATGTAATCTGAAACACCAGCTGGTGAGGCATTG-3′; H4-B, 5′-CGACCAGACATAGTTAAATTCTTACAAGCTTTCAGTAGGAAGCTGGTGAACT-3′). These probes were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). S1 nuclease assays were performed with the S1 assay kit according to the manufacturer's directions for oligonucleotide probes (Ambion). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA and 1.2 × 105 cpm of probe were hybridized overnight at 16 °C and digested with 100 units of S1 nuclease. Fragments protected from RNase or S1 digestion were separated on a 5 or 8% denaturing acrylamide gel (Sequagel, National Diagnostics), respectively. Quantitation of protected bands was performed with a STORM 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). To compare the cell cycle regulation of a histone H4 gene in synchronized IRF-2+/+ and IRF-2−/− cells, a construct containing the wild type FO108 promoter sequence fused to CAT (7Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was stably transfected into NIH 3T3 or IRF-2−/− embryonic fibroblasts. Integration of the H4-CAT in each cell type was assayed by CAT enzymatic activity (data not shown). The H4-CAT stably transfected lines were synchronized by the double thymidine block method, which arrests cells at the G1/S phase boundary (21Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Last T.J. Owen T. McCabe L. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Danish Centre for Human Genome Research, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 282-287Google Scholar). The synchronization was monitored by DNA synthesis assays and Northern analysis of cellular histone H4 mRNA levels performed at hourly time points after release from block (Fig.1). Northern analysis revealed an 8–10-fold peak in total cellular histone H4 mRNA levels at the onset of S phase (Fig. 1 A), which is consistent with previous studies (8Ramsey-Ewing A. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4475-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Plumb M. Stein J. Stein G. Nucl.

This peak in total histone mRNA levels is due to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, with the latter involving sequences in the histone 3′-untranslated region (reviewed in Ref. 25Osley M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 827-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Therefore, to monitor only the transcriptional contribution to the regulation of histone H4, we measured CAT mRNA levels by RNase protection, which in this case is a direct measure of the stably integrated human histone H4 promoter activity. A single protected fragment of CAT mRNA was detected for each time point as seen at the top of Fig. 1 B. In the IRF-2+/+ NIH 3T3 cells, the levels of CAT mRNA peaked concomitantly with the peak of DNA synthesis and showed a 2.5–3-fold increase over base-line levels (Fig. 1 B). This magnitude of increase in transcriptional activity agrees with many previous studies from several laboratories in which a 2–5-fold increase in transcription of histone genes occurred at the onset of S phase bothin vivo and in vitro (8Ramsey-Ewing A. van Wijnen A.J.

In contrast, cyclophilin mRNA, which was used as an internal control, showed no fluctuations in mRNA levels over the synchronized time course (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that human H4 transcription is cell cycle-regulated in mouse cells in a manner similar to the regulation of this H4 promoter in human cells (8Ramsey-Ewing A. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4475-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We next examined the regulation of histone H4 in synchronized H4-CAT IRF-2−/− cells. Strikingly, cells that lack IRF-2 show no transient increase in the levels of CAT mRNA in a synchronized time course (Fig. 2). This result was reproducibly seen in several experiments (Fig. 2, inset). Therefore, IRF-2 is critical for the cell cycle regulation of this promoter. Interestingly, the presence of IRF-1, which is able to bind and activate transcription of the H4 promoter in vitro (7Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), is unable to promote the proper cell cycle regulation of the H4-CAT gene in IRF-2−/− cells (Fig. 2). This supports our previous study in which IRF-1 was unable to compensate for IRF-2-mediated activation of the H4 promoter in vivo (7Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate the specificity of IRF-2 for this cell cycle-regulated gene. We directly assessed whether IRF-2 is a key mediator in H4 gene transcription during the cell cycle by reintroducing IRF-2 into the H4-CAT IRF-2−/− cells. These cells were stably transfected with a human IRF-2 expression vector, and colonies were assayed for the presence of IRF-2 by EMSA. Four positive isolates are shown in Fig. 3 along with the other cell types used in this study. As expected, no IRF-2-specific complexes are seen in extracts from IRF-2−/− cells (Fig. 3, lane 4), while at least two protein DNA complexes are seen in extracts from NIH 3T3, IRF-1−/−, HeLa, and the IRF-2 add-back cell lines (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3 and 5–8). Assignment of the complexes from NIH 3T3, IRF-1−/−, and HeLa as specific for IRF-2 are based on oligonucleotide competition and antibody identification (Refs. 7Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar and 10van Wijnen A.J. van den Ent F.M.I. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3273-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and data not shown). The exact migration of the protein-DNA complexes from the cells in which human IRF-2 was introduced into mouse cells varies slightly from both the human HeLa cells and the mouse NIH 3T3 and IRF-1−/−cells, but these complexes are IRF-2-specific as shown by oligonucleotide competition (Fig. 3, lanes 9–11). Therefore, we have successfully reintroduced IRF-2 protein in the IRF-2−/− cells. In a cell cycle analysis of one of the IRF-2 add-back cell lines, a transient peak of H4-CAT transcription is again concomitant with the peak in DNA synthesis (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with all four of the IRF-2 add-back cell lines analyzed (Fig. 4, inset). Therefore, the reintroduction of IRF-2 is sufficient to restore the cell cycle-regulated transcription of the human histone H4 gene in the IRF-2 knockout cells. Having established that IRF-2 is necessary for cell cycle-regulated transcription of the introduced H4-CAT gene, one would expect an effect on the endogenous histone H4 genes. To test this prediction, we examined the regulation of mouse histone H4 genes in IRF-2−/− and IRF-2+/+ cells. Eukaryotic cells have multiple H4 genes that display nearly identical coding sequences but divergent promoter regions. It is thought that these multiple genes are required to ensure proper chromatin structure in various cell types or stages of cell development. We selected two mouse H4 genes, one of which is the apparent homolog of FO108 (designated A (29Seiler-Tuyns A. Paterson B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) and another that is quite divergent (designated B (30Meier V.S. Bohni R. Schumperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 795Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). We established the binding properties of the CCE interacting factors HiNF-M/IRF-2, HiNF-P, and HiNF-D to the two mouse promoter sequences by EMSA (TableI). Mouse H4-A has the same binding properties as the human sequence, while H4-B does not interact with IRF-2 and has only weak interaction with HiNF-D. We therefore anticipated that H4-A would be regulated in a manner analogous to the human H4 gene FO108 and that H4-B would not be regulated by IRF-2.Table IProtein interactions with mouse histone genes: H4-A is the homolog of human histone H4 FO108* Determined by EMSA with oligonucleotide competition as previously described (9van Wijnen A.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3273-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We determined the effect of IRF-2 on endogenous histone mRNA by comparing the expression levels of H4-A and H4-B in proliferating IRF-2−/−, IRF-2 add-back, or IRF-1−/−control cells by S1 nuclease protection analysis using specific oligonucleotide probes complementary to a unique segment of the 5′-untranslated regions of H4-A and H4-B. Fig.5 shows that endogenous H4-A mRNA levels were approximately 3-fold lower in IRF-2−/− cells compared with the IRF-1−/− cells, which have normal IRF-2 levels (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 1 and 3). Furthermore, the levels of H4-A are restored when IRF-2 is reintroduced to these cells (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the H4-B gene, which does not interact with IRF-2, generates similar mRNA levels in all three cell types (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–7). We then monitored the cell cycle regulation of endogenous histone H4 genes in various cell types. Comparison of H4-A and H4-B mRNA levels during the cell cycle of synchronized IRF-2−/−cells shows that there is a transient increase in H4-A mRNA during the cell cycle although the amplitude of the peak is reduced and slightly delayed when compared with the regulation of the H4-B message (Fig. 6, A and B). This moderate level of cell cycle regulation of histone H4-A message in IRF-2−/− cells is not unexpected, because the post-transcriptional mechanisms of cell cycle regulation discussed above are presumably operational for this gene (while they are not a factor in the regulation of CAT mRNA, which was assayed in Figs. 1,2, and 4). In contrast, maximal cell cycle regulation of histone H4-A (and H4-B, not shown) is seen in the IRF-2-positive IRF-1−/− cells (Fig. 6 C). Furthermore, the maximal regulation of mouse histone H4-A (and H4-B, not shown) is restored when IRF-2 is reintroduced to the IRF-2−/− cells (Fig. 6 D). Therefore, IRF-2 plays a role in the overall expression and cell cycle regulation of a subset of the mouse histone H4 genes. Along with previous results demonstrating that IRF-2 can activate both a growth control gene (7Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and a differentiation-specific gene (gp91 phox ) (31Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23445-23451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the present study further implicates IRF-2 as an active participant in growth control and not only a passive antagonist of the tumor suppressor IRF-1. The mechanism by which IRF-2 contributes to cell cycle regulation is not yet known but may involve the recently described phosphorylation of IRF-2 (32Birnbaum M.J. van Zundert B. Vaughan P.S.

Although IRF-2 directly interacts with the H4 promoter, it is not yet clear whether the IRF-2 effect on cell cycle regulation is direct. IRF-2 may be involved in the recruiting of other factors to the promoter region of the H4 gene. It is very likely that the cell cycle regulators present in the HiNF-D complex (cyclin A, Cdc2, and pRB), which interact with multiple histone genes (14van Wijnen A.J. Aziz F. Grana X. DeLuca A. Desai R.K. Jaarsveld K. Last T.J. Soprano K. Giordano A. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12882-12886Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), are necessary components of histone H4 cell cycle regulation. In conclusion, the results described in this report clearly establish for the first time that the oncogenic transcription factor IRF-2 is necessary for correct cell cycle regulation of histone H4 gene transcription and that IRF-2 is required for the coupling of histone gene expression with S phase progression in an E2F-independent manner.

The stoichiometry of the first class of sites depends on the nucleotide bound to the E-site; GTP-tubulin has two tightly bound Mg2+ (at the N- and E-sites), whereas GDP-tubulin has a single high affinity Mg2+ (N-site; the E-site becomes low affinity (see Ref. 3Correia J.J. Baty L.T. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17278-17284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This has been confirmed by studying the binding of Mg2+ to tubulin having GTP, GDP, or no nucleotide at the exchangeable site of the β-subunit and one Mg2+ ion already bound (23Mejillano M.R. Himes R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The low affinity Mg2+ binding sites are involved in tubulin polymerization (19Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither the high affinity binding of Mg2+ to the N-site nor its intriguing role are well understood (3Correia J.J. Baty L.T. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol.

The present study aims to understand the specific roles of the respective Mg2+ ions coordinated with the GTP bound to E- and N-sites in tubulin stability, structure and function. Toward these purposes, the isotherm of binding of Mg2+ to the N-site has been measured, and the different effects of the high affinity cations bound to GDP- and GTP-tubulin have been compared employing DSC, CD, fluorescence, and sedimentation equilibrium methods. It will be shown that the functional microtubule-stabilizing cation and γ-phosphate at the E-site impart negligible stabilization to the αβ-tubulin dimer, whereas the non-functional cation bound to the N-site, at the α-subunit, is essential for tubulin stability, and communicates with the colchicine site at the β-subunit. Preparation of calf brain tubulin, without (GDP-tubulin) or with (GTP-tubulin) a γ-phosphate at the E-site was performed as described in Ref. 7Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, with minor modifications. GDP-tubulin was finally equilibrated in PEDTA buffer with 1 mm GDP by chromatography in Sephadex G-25 columns (10 or 25 × 0.9 cm). To prepare GTP-tubulin, 1 mm GTP and Mg2+ were added to GDP-tubulin. In the experiments at the lower free Mg2+ concentration, the EDTA concentration in the buffer was 2 mm. Nucleotides and Mg2+ quantification by high performance liquid chromatography and atomic absorption spectrometry, respectively, and microtubule assembly were performed as described (7Dı́az J.F.

Fresh MilliQ grade water was employed to prepare all the solutions, as well as plasticware containers; any glassware material was rinsed with PEDTA buffer before use. The binding of Mg2+ was measured as follows. Aliquots of 200 μl of tubulin (15 μm) with a known total Mg2+concentration were incubated at 10 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 1 h in a TLA-100 rotor, using a TLX-120 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments Inc.). After centrifugation, the lower half of the tubes, which contain tubulin in equilibrium with free Mg2+, and the upper half, with cation and essentially no protein, were carefully withdrawn, and the total Mg2+concentration was determined in both halves. Mg2+ bound to tubulin was quantified by the difference in the cation concentration between the lower and the upper parts of the centrifuge tube. Free Mg2+ was calculated from the total Mg2+concentration in the upper half, by solving the multiple equilibria, which take into account the cation binding to phosphate, nucleotide, and EDTA.

This, together with the calculated errors in the measurement of the total amount of Mg2+, resulted in an estimated uncertainty of 10–15% for the lower calculated free Mg2+ concentrations, and less than 10% for the higher concentrations. Note that, in the buffer solution employed, the small free Mg2+ concentration approximates the mean ionic activity of MgCl2 within experimental error. A model of ligand binding assuming multiple classes of independent binding sites for Mg2+ (33Klotz I.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1985; 18: 227-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in the tubulin molecule was fitted to the experimental data, using a non-linear least squares procedure, based on the modified Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm (34Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in Pascal: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, MA1989Google Scholar). The effect of Mg2+ on the kinetics of tubulin inactivation at constant temperature was followed by monitoring two independent properties: (i) the loss of the assembly capacity of tubulin (20 μm) with paclitaxel, monitored turbidimetrically (7Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and (ii) the loss of colchicine binding sites, measured from the fluorescence of the MTC-tubulin complex (see below). Before measurement, samples were supplemented to final total Mg2+concentrations of 7 and 5 mm in the assembly and MTC binding buffers, respectively. Control experiments were run in parallel at 7 mm Mg2+ in the initial equilibration buffer. The far-UV CD spectra of tubulin (1–5 μm, equilibrated in PEDTA with 1 mmnucleotide and a known amount of Mg2+) were acquired in a JASCO J720 dichrograph equipped with a temperature regulated cell holder (1de Pereda J.M.

Thermal denaturation was monitored following the variation in ellipticity at 220 nm, using a temperature scan rate of 0.5 °C·min−1. Changes in secondary structure were estimated by deconvolution of the CD spectra using Yang (36Yang J.T. Chuen-Shang C.W. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar), LIMCOMB, and CCA (37Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal.

The effect of Mg2+ on the fluorescence spectrum of the colchicine analog MTC (50 μm total concentration) bound to tubulin (5 μm) was measured essentially as described (39Andreu J.M. Gorbunoff M.J. Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1742-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), using a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorimeter (Kyoto, Japan; λex = 350 nm, λem = 423 nm). The fluorescence cell (5 × 10 mm) was mounted on a holder thermostated with a water bath at 20 °C. The free and bound ligand were measured with the same high speed centrifugation method described for Mg2+binding, except that MTC was measured spectrophotometrically (ε343 = (1.76 ± 0.01) × 104m−1 cm−1) (39Andreu J.M. Gorbunoff M.J. Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1742-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The measurements were performed at 10 °C with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics, using an An60Ti rotor and either 12-mm double sector or six-channel centerpieces. Tubulin samples (loading concentrations between 0.5 and 15 μm) were equilibrated in PEDTA, 20 μm nucleotide, with the desired amount of Mg2+. Short column (40–50 μl) sedimentation equilibrium was performed either at low speed (30 min at 30,000 rpm, followed by 2–3 h at 15,000 rpm) or as described (40Sackett D.L. Lippoldt R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3511-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar): 1 h at 32,000 rpm, followed by 1–2 h at 26,000 rpm, which permitted attainment of equilibrium. Absorbance scans were taken at the appropriate wavelength (230, 275, or 290 nm). In all cases, base-line offsets were determined subsequently by high speed sedimentation. Whole-cell apparent weight-average molecular masses (Mw,ac) were obtained using the programs XLAEQ and EQASSOC (supplied by Beckman; see Ref. 41Minton A.P. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar). The partial specific volume was 0.736 cm3/g (42Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), which was corrected for temperature (43Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar). To determine the equilibrium constant for tubulin dimerization (K 2), two different methodologies were employed. (i) Equilibrium association models were globally fitted to multiple sedimentation equilibrium data using either the MicroCal-Origin version of NONLIN (44Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) or the programs MULTEQ1B and MULTEQ3B based on the conservation of signal algorithm (41Minton A.P. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar). A value of 1.16 ml mg−1 cm−1 was used for the extinction coefficient of tubulin at 275 nm in phosphate buffer (45Andreu J.M. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6465-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the subunit relative molecular mass was taken as 55,000 (46Lee J.C. Frigon R.F. Timasheff S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7253-7262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) The dependence of the apparent weight-average molecular mass (Mw,a) on protein concentration was calculated from the local slopes of transformed data (lnC versus r 2) at defined radial distance intervals, using the program MWPLOTZ (kindly supplied by A. Minton, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). In this study, the Mw,a values were calculated by superimposing data obtained from different loading protein concentrations and averaging over a concentration interval of ±0.1 log units. Models for self-association (47Chatelier R.C. Minton A.P. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 48Rivas G. Ingham K.C. Minton A.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11707-11712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were fitted to the Mw,a versus concentration data using a non-linear least-squares method (34Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in Pascal: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, MA1989Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 42,000 and 60,000 rpm. Sedimentation coefficients were calculated from the rate of the movement of (i) the solute boundary (with XLAVEL, Beckman) or (ii) the second moment of the boundary (with VELGAMMA, Beckman), and (iii) from the distribution of the apparent sedimentation coefficients,g(s*), using the DCDT program (49Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 50Stafford W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficients were corrected to standard conditions (51van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall Inc., NJ1986: 110-121Google Scholar) to get the corresponding s 20, w values. The heat capacity measurements were performed in a MicroCal MC2 differential scanning calorimeter, as described previously (52Arriaga P. Menéndez M. Martı́n Villacorta J. Laynez J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6603-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Tubulin samples (15 μm) for DSC were equilibrated in PEDTA buffer with 1 mm GDP (or GTP) and the desired Mg2+concentration. The scanning rate was 0.5 °C min−1, unless otherwise stated. The reversibility of thermal transitions was checked by reheating the samples after the first scan. The influence of scanning conditions on the profiles of the calorimetric transitions of tubulin was checked by running samples at several rates. The kinetic analysis of the DSC curves was carried out as described (53Sánchez-Ruı́z J.M. López-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 54Sánchez-Ruı́z J.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 921-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The thermal stability of GDP- and GTP-tubulin measured by DSC was found to be similar at free Mg2+ concentrations above 1 μm. However, it was dramatically reduced at the low activity of Mg2+ ions of the EDTA containing buffer employed for nucleotide exchange (7Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This prompted an in-depth examination of the system by means of the following complementary biochemical and DSC experiments. The binding isotherms of Mg2+ to GDP- and GTP-tubulin in PEDTA buffer at 10 °C were directly determined by high speed sedimentation of the protein (Fig. 1). The experimental data for GDP-tubulin can be described assuming two classes of independent binding sites in the αβ-tubulin dimer: one Mg2+ high affinity site (n 1,Mg = 1.1 ± 0.2; K 1,Mg = (1.1 ± 0.3) × 107m−1), plus several low affinity sites (n 2,Mg = 48,K 2,Mg = 106 m−1; the latter values were taken from Frigon and Timasheff (17Frigon R.P. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4559-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and constrained in the fitting procedure). Measurements of samples incubated for an extra 1–2-h period at the lower ligand concentrations were essentially identical, indicating equilibrium. High affinity Mg2+binding to tubulin is reversible, since supplementing cation-depleted tubulin (equilibrated in 40 ± 5 nm free Mg2+) to 360 ± 20 nm free Mg2+ increased binding from 0.4 ± 0.1 to 0.75 ± 0.1 Mg2+ per tubulin heterodimer, which is within the experimental error of the reference isotherm (Fig. 1). GTP-tubulin has one more Mg2+ binding site (Fig. 1,empty symbols) than GDP-tubulin, with anapparent affinity in the order of 105m−1. The analysis of its Mg2+binding isotherm is complicated by the presence of GDP, which has a much higher affinity than GTP for the tubulin E-site at low Mg2+concentration (3Correia J.J. Baty L.T. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17278-17284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Correia J.J. Beth A.H. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10681-10686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, as the cation concentration decreases, GDP progressively exchanges into the GTP-tubulin samples. GTP-tubulin in 63 μm free Mg2+ had a measured nucleotide content (0.1 GDP and 1.7 GTP per tubulin molecule), corresponding to a 90% of GTP-tubulin, and its stoichiometry of binding of Mg2+ is one more cation than that of GDP-tubulin. On the other hand, at 3.2 μm free Mg2+ the binding stoichiometry is slightly higher than 1, but the nucleotide content (0.7 GDP and 1.2 GTP per tubulin molecule) indicates that only 25% of the protein is GTP-tubulin. The results are compatible with the partial Mg2+ binding data of Mejillano and Himes (23Mejillano M.R. Himes R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in a different buffer. These high affinity Mg2+ binding sites of tubulin, one in GDP-tubulin and two in GTP-tubulin, have been previously identified as the cation-binding loci at the N and E GTP-binding sites in α- and β-tubulin, respectively (3Correia J.J. Baty L.T. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17278-17284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Correia J.J. Beth A.H. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10681-10686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Osei A.A. Everett G.W. Himes R.H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, binding isotherm of the highest affinity Mg2+ to the N-site had not been measured; nor had cation-depleted tubulin been studied. Equilibration of tubulin in Mg2+ free buffers results in a decrease in bound nucleotide, supposedly coming from either nucleotide dissociation from the E-site or from the irreversible protein denaturation which occurs for prolonged incubation times (4Correia J.J. Beth A.H. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10681-10686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Croom H.B. Correia J.J. Baty L.T. Williams R.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To know the role of the Mg2+ cation bound to the N-site of GDP-tubulin in nucleotide binding, and to identify the sites from which nucleotide may come off by cation removal, the GDP and GTP bound to tubulin were determined as a function of the free Mg2+ and incubation time (see TableI for a summary). Tubulin samples with the high affinity Mg2+ site saturated contain close to one GTP and one GDP per αβ-dimer. However, samples partially depleted from the high affinity cation have their nucleotide content reduced to 0.6–0.7 GTP and 0.9 GDP per heterodimer at the conclusion of sample preparation (an equivalent time of 0.5 h). Upon prolonged incubation at 20 °C, the GTP (and GDP) stoichiometry decreased more slowly, to values approaching the Mg2+/tubulin stoichiometry of the samples (Table I). These results indicate that dissociation of Mg2+ from the N-site (α-subunit), which is quite reversible at short periods of time as shown above, results in dissociation of GTP (and GDP), supposedly coming from the N-site (and the E-site, respectively). This reveals the instability of the cation-depleted tubulin. The results suggest the possibility that the nucleotide binding capacity and, hence, the functionality of the β-subunit in the αβ-dimer is controlled by the cation ligation state of the α-subunit, and will be further addressed later.Table IEffect of Mg 2+ on nucleotide content of tubulin[Mg2+]freetGXP/tubulinGTP/tubulinGDP/tubulinMg2+/tubulinmin45 nm301.50.60.90.445 nm3001.20.50.7ND1-aNot determined.62 nm301.60.70.90.662 nm1201.40.60.80.662 nm3001.30.60.7ND 5 μm301.80.90.91.050 μm301.80.81.01.11-a Not determined. Open table in a new tab GDP-tubulin equilibrated at 55 nm free Mg2+ and re-equilibrated in 6 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm GTP polymerized in 3.4 m glycerol-containing buffer with a critical concentration (15 μm) 1.7 times higher than that of a GTP-tubulin control directly equilibrated in 6 mm MgCl2 (9 μm). The slope of the plot of plateau turbidity versus total protein concentration was about 1.3 times lower than that of the control (data not shown). Since GDP-tubulin is unable to assemble in Mg2+-glycerol buffer (7Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), this implies that around 70 ± 10% of the Mg2+-depleted protein has been able to back-exchange GTP and reassemble. This result also suggests that nucleotide"

Substitutions were made at three positions (Phe452, Tyr532, and Phe538) that correspond to residues observed in the crystal structure of the homologous β subunit of the bovine mitochondrial F-ATPase to be in proximity to the adenine ring of bound ATP. Although conservative substitutions at these positions had relatively little effect on V-ATPase activity, replacement with nonaromatic residues (such as alanine or serine) caused either a complete loss of activity (F452A) or a decrease in the affinity for ATP (Y532S and F538A). The F452A mutation also appeared to reduce stability of the V-ATPase complex. These results suggest that aromatic or hydrophobic residues at these positions are essential to maintain activity and/or high affinity binding to the catalytic sites of the V-ATPase.Site-directed mutations were also made at residues (Phe479and Arg483) that are postulated to be contributed by the A subunit to the noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites. Generally, substitutions at these positions led to decreases in activity ranging from 30 to 70% relative to wild type as well as modest decreases inK m for ATP. Interestingly, the R483E and R483Q mutants showed a time-dependent increase in ATPase activity following addition of ATP, suggesting that events at the noncatalytic sites may modulate the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

The level of sequence identity between these proteins is only 20–25%, however, and the A subunit contains a large (100-amino acid) insertion not present in β, suggesting that significant structural and functional differences may exist between these proteins. From the x-ray crystal structure of the F1 domain from bovine heart mitochondria it was confirmed that the nucleotide binding sites are at the interface between the β and α subunits, with the catalytic site primarily on β and the noncatalytic site primarily on α (29Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). Previous biochemical experiments on the V-ATPase suggest that the catalytic nucleotide binding site is located on the A subunit while the noncatalytic site resides on the B subunit. For the catalytic site, these data include ATP-protectable labeling of the A subunit by reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide and 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, which correlates with inhibition of activity (for references, see Forgac (30Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar)). In addition, modification of a single A subunit cysteine residue (Cys254of the bovine A subunit) by N-ethylmaleimide, cystine, or by disulfide bond formation with Cys532, leads to inactivation of the enzyme (31Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Also, labeling of the A subunit by the photoaffinity ATP analog 2-[azido-32P]ATP correlates well with inhibition by this reagent (34Zhang J. Vasilyeva E. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Finally, the A subunit, unlike the B subunit, contains several consensus sequences that appear to be critical for ATP hydrolysis in the homologous β subunit (35Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21471-21478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Omote H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20571-20576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Iwamoto A. Park M.Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3156-3160.39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including the glycine-rich loop. There is limited information concerning the structure of the nucleotide binding sites on the V-ATPase, although mutagenesis studies in yeast have begun to identify residues important for V-ATPase activity (38Liu Q. Kane P.M. Newman P.R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2018-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 39Liu J. Kane P.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11750-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To investigate residues involved in formation of the nucleotide binding sites, site-directed mutagenesis of theVMA1 gene in yeast was performed. Based on the crystal structure of the F1 β subunit and sequence alignment of the β and A subunits, mutations were made in several residues proposed to form part of the adenine binding pocket at the catalytic site, including Phe452, Tyr532, and Phe538 (corresponding to Tyr345, Phe418, and Phe424, respectively, of the bovine mitochondrial β subunit) (29Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations were constructed at two residues, Phe479 and Arg483(corresponding to Tyr368 and Arg372 of the bovine F1 β) (29Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar), which are postulated to be contributed by the A subunit to the noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites. The effects of these mutations on activity, kinetics and assembly of the V-ATPase complex were assessed. Zymolyase 100T was obtained from Sekagaku America, Inc. Concanamycin A was obtained from Fluka Chemical Corp. Tran35S-label was purchased from ICN Biomedicals. Leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin were all purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Yeast extract, dextrose, peptone, and yeast nitrogen base were purchased from Difco. Zwittergent 3–14 was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. Molecular biology reagents were from Promega and New England Biolabs. ATP and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Yeast strain SF838–5Aα vma1Δ-8(MATα, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, ade6, vma1Δ::LEU2), used for integrations and subsequent biochemical characterization, was a kind gift from Dr. Patricia Kane, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SUNY, Syracuse. The plasmid pPK17-7, containing VMA1 lacking the entire VMA1-derived endonuclease subcloned into the yeast shuttle vector pSEYC68 at BamHI and SalI sites (15Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 39Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was from Dr. Kane. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YEPD) medium or in supplemented synthetic dextrose medium. Mutagenesis was performed on the wild typeVMA1 cDNA using the Altered Sites II in vitromutagenesis system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The full-length VMA1 cDNA lacking the endonuclease spacer region (15Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) was cloned into pAlter-1 using BamHI and SalI sites. The mutagenesis oligonucleotides were as follows with the substitution sites underlined: F452Y, GAAAGCATTACCCATCTATC; F452W, CAAAGAAAGCATTGGCCATCTATCAAC; F452A, CAAAGAAAGCATGCCCCATCTATCAAC; F479Y, CAATTACCCTGAATATCCTGTTTTAAG; F479A, CAATTACCCTGAAGCTCCTGTTTTAAGAG; F479W, CAATTACCCTGAATGGCCTGTTTTAAGAG; R483K, GAATTTCCTGTTTTAAAAGATCGTATG; R483E, GAATTTCCTGTTTTAGAAGATCGTATGAAG; R483Q, GAATTTCCTGTTTTACAAGATCGTATGAAG; Y532F, CAACAAAATGGTTTCTCCACTTATG; Y532S, CAACAAAATGGTTCCTCCACTTATGATG; F538Y, CACTTATGATGCTTACTGTCCAATTTGG; F538W, CACTTATGATGCTTGGTGTCCAATTTGG; and F538A, CACTTATGATGCTGCCTGTCCAATTTGG. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy method. Cassettes containing each mutation were subcloned usingHpaI and SalI into a wild type pAlterI/VMA1 plasmid that had not been subjected to mutagenesis. The full-length mutant vma1 cDNAs were then subcloned, along with wild type VMA1 for a positive control, into the yeast integration vector YIp5 (New England Biolabs) usingBamHI and SalI sites. Wild type VMA1 in YIp5 (WT-VMA1) as a positive control, YIp5 vector alone (vma1Δ/YIp5) as a negative control, or vma1mutant YIp5 plasmids were linearized with ApaI to target the integration of the constructs to the URA3 locus. Yeast cells SF838-5Aα vma1Δ-8 were transformed with the linearized constructs using the lithium acetate method (41Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2893) Google Scholar). The transformants were then selected on Ura− plates as described previously (42$$Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was isolated from the transformed yeast cells and the VMA1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction. The presence of the site-directed mutations was confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. Growth phenotypes of the mutants were assessed on YEPD plates buffered with 50 mmKH2PO4 and 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 5.5 or 7.5. Plates containing 50 mmCaCl2 were buffered to pH 7.5 using 50 mmMES/MOPS (43Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Yeast integrated with either wild type plasmid (WT-VMA1), vma1 mutant plasmids, or the vector YIp5 alone (vma1Δ/YIp5) as a negative control were cultured overnight in 1 liter of YEPD pH 5.5 to log phase. Vacuoles were isolated as described previously (44Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). For purification of the V-ATPase, vacuolar membranes were washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmEDTA, and solubilized in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) with Zwittergent 3–14, and the V-ATPase was isolated by glycerol density gradient sedimentation on 20–50% glycerol gradients as described previously (45Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates and solubilized vacuoles were prepared using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8m urea, 5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, as described previously (46Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast V-ATPase A subunit (Molecular Probes, Inc.), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Immunoblots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method following the manufacturer's protocol from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. Yeast strains WT-VMA1,vma1Δ/YIp5, and vma1 mutants were grown in synthetic dextrose-methionine-free medium overnight, converted to spheroplasts, and metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label (50 μCi/5 × 106 spheroplasts) for 60 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted, washed, and lysed in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) with C12E9, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The V-ATPase was cross-linked using dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) and immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast A subunit and protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% acrylamide gel, fixed in 30% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid for 1 h, incubated in Enlightning solution (NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min, dried, and analyzed using autoradiography. A model for the V-ATPase was created from the 2.8 Å resolution structure of bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase (29Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences were first aligned using the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis software package. Approximately 23% sequence identity was obtained after sequence alignment, with good agreement in predicted secondary structure (47Wishart D.S. Boyko R.F. Willard L. Richards F.M. Sykes B.D. Comp. Biol. Sci. 1994; 10: 121-132Google Scholar). The positions of insertions and deletions created by the alignment procedure were examined on the model of F1-ATPase using InsightII (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA), and were found to be mostly in loops at the surface of the molecule. A few were located within secondary structure elements and the sequence alignment was adjusted to move these by a few residues to the end of the structural elements. The large insertion of about 100 amino acids present in the A subunit (but not β) was not modeled. The resultant structure now containing the amino acid sequence of V-ATPase was subjected to 200 steps of energy minimization using X-PLOR (48Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1987Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (44Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of 1 μm concanamycin A, a specific V-ATPase inhibitor (49Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). ATPase assays performed on vacuoles or on purified enzyme contained 1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2 and were done at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry et al. (51Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) assay, and determinations on purified enzyme included initial protein precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Site-directed mutations of the VMA1 cDNA encoding the yeast V-ATPase A subunit were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Three of the residues mutated, Phe452, Tyr532, and Phe538, are located in the C-terminal domain of the A subunit and are candidates for contributing to the adenine binding pocket of the catalytic nucleotide binding site. Two additional A subunit residues, Phe479 and Arg483, are postulated on the basis of sequence alignment and the crystal structure of F1 to form part of the noncatalytic nucleotide binding site located on the B subunit. The mutant vma1 cDNAs were subcloned into the yeast integration vector YIp5 and expressed in a vma1Δ strain in which the VMA1 gene was deleted. The deletion of genes encoding subunits of the V-ATPase results in a conditional lethal phenotype (14Hirata R. Ohsumi Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 52Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which is also used to screen for mutants defective in vacuolar acidification. These strains are able to grow on medium buffered to acidic pH (5.0–5.5) but are unable to grow at neutral pH (7.5) or in neutral medium containing 50 mm CaCl2. TableI summarizes the growth phenotypes for these vma1 mutants. The wild type strain WT-VMA1grew under each condition and the negative controlvma1Δ/YIp5 strain exhibited the expected conditional lethal phenotype. F452A was unable to grow at pH 7.5 in the absence or presence of elevated extracellular calcium, exhibiting a growth phenotype similar to the vma1Δ strain. F538W was unable to grow at pH 7.5 in the presence of high calcium. The remaining mutants, including those at the noncatalytic site, showed relatively normal growth at pH 7.5. It has previously been determined that 20% of V-ATPase activity is sufficient to rescue the growth phenotype (39Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results thus suggest that the F452A and F538W mutants are deficient in vacuolar acidification, but that the remainder of the mutant strains have a V-ATPase activity that is at least 20% of wild-type. It was next necessary to determine whether these mutations directly caused a loss of V-ATPase activity.Table ICharacterization of growth phenotypes of wild type and vma1 mutantsVMA1mutationpH 5.5pH 7.5pH 7.5 + 50 mM CaCl2WT-VMA1++++++vma1Δ/YIp5++——Catalytic site F452Y+++++ F452W+++++ F452A++—— Y532F++++++ Y532S++++++ F538Y++++++ F538W+++— F538A++++++Noncatalytic site F479Y+++++ F479W+++++ F479A++++++ R483K++++++ R483E++++++ R483Q++++++ Open table in a new tab Fig.1 shows the V-ATPase activities of the wild type WT-VMA1, vma1Δ/YIp5, and vma1 mutant strains. Fig. 1 A shows the relative ATPase activities for the strains containing mutations at the catalytic site, and Fig. 1 B the activities for the strains with the proposed noncatalytic site mutations. V-ATPase activities were measured in isolated vacuoles using a coupled spectrophotometric assay at 1 mm ATP and 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activities are expressed relative to the WT-VMA1 strain, defined as 100%, which had a specific activity of 0.19 (± 0.04) μmol of ATP/min/mg protein. 2The specific activity reported is that for unwashed vacuoles at 1 mm ATP. Higher specific activities are obtained for washed vacuoles at saturating ATP concentrations. The negative control, vma1Δ/YIp5 strain, had no measurable activity. F452Y, Y532F, F538Y, and F538A had nearly wild type levels of activity, whereas F452W and Y532S had approximately 50% and F538W had 20% of wild type levels. F452A had less than 5% of wild type activity and was comparable to the deletion strain. Mutations at the noncatalytic site all appear to reduce activity by 30–70% as shown in Fig.1 B. These data are consistent with the growth phenotypes. It was next necessary to determine whether the observed decrease in activity was due to decreased protein levels or to decreased V-ATPase assembly. Fig. 2 shows the effects of the mutations on A subunit stability and the presence of the A subunit on the vacuolar membrane, which provides an initial measure of V-ATPase assembly. Fig. 2 is an immunoblot using the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast A subunit to determine levels of the A subunit in either whole cell lysates (CELL) or isolated vacuoles (VAC). The top panel shows the immunoblots for the wild type WT-VMA1 and for vma1Δ/YIp5. Themiddle and bottom panels show the immunoblots for the strains containing mutations at the catalytic site, and the proposed noncatalytic site, respectively. Of the mutations tested, only R483E showed somewhat lower levels of A subunit in the whole cell lysate compared with the wild type. However, all of the mutated proteins, including R483E, showed normal levels of A subunit on the vacuolar membrane. As a further test of assembly, the V-ATPase was immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled cells. Cells were converted to spheroplasts and labeled with Tran35S-label for 60 min at 30 °C followed by cell lysis, detergent solubilization, and immunoprecipitation using the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As can be seen in Fig.3 A, most of the mutants at the catalytic site showed normal assembly relative to wild type. An exception is the mutant F452A, which shows very little intact V-ATPase complex by immunoprecipitation. Because this mutant showed normal levels of A subunit on the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 2) and normal assembly following detergent solubilization and density gradient sedimentation (data not shown), it appears that this mutation has resulted in a destabilization of the complex such that it can no longer survive immunoprecipitation. Fig. 3 B shows immunoprecipitation of the V-ATPase from the noncatalytic site mutants. As can be seen, none of the mutations dramatically reduces assembly, although F479W and R483E show somewhat lower labeling in the B subunit region. The possible significance of these results is discussed below. To determine if any of the mutations resulted in changes in KmATP orV max for ATP hydrolysis, kinetic analysis on the purified enzymes was performed (TableII). Vacuoles were isolated from wild type WT-VMA1 and vma1 mutant strains and the V-ATPases were solubilized and purified by glycerol density gradient sedimentation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ATPase activities of the purified enzymes were measured over a range of ATP concentrations from 100 μm to 2.5 mm ATP, while the MgCl2 was maintained at 1 mm above the ATP concentration. K m and V max values were calculated from double reciprocal plots of ATP concentration versus ATPase activity. WT-VMA1 had a specific activity of 1.8 (±0.1) μmol/min/mg of protein at 1 mm ATP, aK m of 0.72 (±0.19) mm ATP and aV max of 2.7 (±0.1) μmol/min/mg of protein. As shown in"
https://openalex.org/W1996143170,"Among phospholipase C-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), some have a surprisingly long carboxyl-terminal intracellular domain (mGluR1a, -5a, and -5b), and others have a short one (mGluR1b, -1c, and -1d). All mGluR1 sequences are identical up to 46 residues following the 7th transmembrane domain, followed by 313, 20, 11, and 26 specific residues in mGluR1a, mGluR1b, mGluR1c, and mGluR1d, respectively. Several functional differences have been described between the long isoforms (mGluR1a, -5a, and -5b) and the short ones (mGluR1b, -1c, and -1d). Compared with the long receptors, the short ones induce slower increases in intracellular Ca2+, are activated by higher concentration of agonists, and do not exhibit constitutive, agonist-independent activity. To identify the residues responsible for these functional properties, a series of truncated, chimeric, and mutated receptors were constructed. We found that the deletion of the last 19 carboxyl-terminal residues in mGluR1c changed its properties into those of mGluR1a. Moreover, the exchange of the long carboxyl-terminal domain of mGluR5a with that of mGluR1c generated a chimeric receptor that possessed functional properties similar to those of mGluR1c. Mutagenesis of specific residues within the 19 carboxyl-terminal residues of mGluR1c revealed the importance of a cluster of 4 basic residues in defining the specific properties of this receptor. Since this cluster is part of the sequence common to all mGluR1 variants, we conclude that the long carboxyl-terminal domain of mGluR1a suppresses the inhibitory action of this sequence element.

Moreover, the second intracellular loop of mGluRs likely plays a role equivalent to that of the third intracellular loop of the other GPCRs for G-protein coupling and activation (8Gomeza J. Joly C.

The role of this domain is not yet fully characterized, but it may be involved in specific regulation of the receptor function, possibly by interacting with specific proteins (16Pin J.-P. Duvoisin R.

In the rat mGluR1b, mGluR1c, and mGluR1d, the 313 carboxyl-terminal residues of mGluR1a are replaced by 20, 11, and 26 residues, respectively. All these splice variants do couple to PLC indicating that the long carboxyl-terminal domain of mGluR1a is not critical for this function of the protein. Differences in PLC coupling have been reported between the long forms, mGluR1a, -5a, and -5b, and the short forms, mGluR1b, mGluR1c, and mGluR1d. In contrast to the long forms, which generate fast chloride current responses upon agonist application when expressed inXenopus oocytes, mGluR1c induces slowly developing responses (14Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prézeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Moreover, only the long forms display a significant constitutive, agonist-independent activity when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (14Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K.

Accordingly, it has been proposed that the long carboxyl-terminal domain enables better PLC coupling efficacy (23Prézeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gabellini N. Manev R.M. Candeo P. Favaron M. Manev H. NeuroReport. 1993; 4: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To identify the sequence responsible for the specific functional properties of mGluR1 splice variants, a series of truncated and chimeric receptors were constructed and analyzed both inXenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells. This approach allowed us to identify a basic tetrapeptide in the carboxyl-terminal end of these receptors that confers to the short variants mGluR1b, -c, and -d their specific PLC-coupling properties, i.e. slow responses in oocytes, lower potency of agonists, and absence of constitutive activity. Since this sequence is conserved in mGluR1a, we propose that the apparent inhibitory action of this basic tetrapeptide is prevented by the presence of the long carboxyl-terminal tail of this receptor. The obtention of mGluR cDNAs and the construction of the eucaryotic expression plasmids have been described previously (14Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prézeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 1997; 335: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To generate mGluR1Δ1139 and mGluR1Δ1093, polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed using mGluR1a cDNA as template (20 ng), dNTP (200 μm), 2 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and 100 pmol of sense and antisense primers in a 100-μl reaction made with the 10 × buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. The sense primer was 5′-CGG TGG CCC TGG GGT GC-3′, and the antisense primers containing the additional stop codon and an XbaI site were 5′-CTT GCT CTA GAT GGG CAG GTC CTC CTC CTC-3′ (for mGluR1Δ1139) and 5′-CTC CTT CTA GAA GGT GCT CAG GTG CAG GGG-3′ (for mGluR1Δ1093). The resulting PCR products were cut by SphI and XbaI and subcloned into pmGluR1a cut with the same enzymes. For the construction of mGluR1Δ879, a similar PCR reaction was performed with 5′-CTC AAC ATT TTC CGG AGA TAG AAG ACC GGG-3′ and 5′-GTA CCT CTA GAG AAG GTT TTT GAA TAA TTC-3′ as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The resulting product was subcloned into pmGluR1a after digestion withBspEI and XbaI. The truncated mGluR5Δ (N887Stop) was constructed by PCR using pmGluR5a as a template DNA, a sense primer containing the stop codon just downstream of the ApaI site located at position 2651 (5′-TG ACT TGG GCC CAG TAG GAT CCG AGT ACC CGG-3′) and an antisense primer located downstream of the second ApaI site (position 3151) in the mGluR5a sequence. The resulting product was digested by ApaI and ligated into the pmGluR5a previously cut by ApaI and dephosphorylated. To generate pmGluR5/1a and pmGluR5/1b, the SphI-XbaI fragment from pmGluR1a and pmGluR1b were subcloned into pmGluR5a cut withXbaI and partially digested with SphI. To generate pmGluR5/1c, the 2544-bp fragment obtained after digestion of pmGluR5a by EcoRI and partial digestion by SphI was subcloned into pmGluR1c cut with EcoRI and SphI. mGluR1aΔβ was constructed by PCR as described above using pmGluR1a as a template DNA (100 ng), 5′-ACA TTT TCC GGA TGG CAG CTC CAG GGG CAG GGA ATG-3′ as sense primer containing the mutations, 5′-TTG GGA TTC CCT TGG TAA CTT TTA GTG AGG-3′ as antisense primer and Vent DNA polymerase. The resulting product was digested byBspEI-KasI and inserted into pmGluR1a previously digested with the same enzymes. The mutant mGluR1cΔβ was constructed by PCR using pmGluR1c as a template DNA, the same sense primer as described above, and T7 as antisense primer. The resulting product was digested by BspEI-XhoI and inserted into pmGluR1c previously digested with the same enzymes. For functional expression into mammalian cells, all constructed cDNAs were inserted into the pRK5 expression vector, downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter (14Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of truncated, chimeric, or mutant receptor DNA was verified by double strand DNA sequencing on both strands with 17–25 mere primers using the dideoxynucleotide method and Sequenase (U.S Biochemical Corp.). The preparation of oocytes and the in vitro synthesis of RNA transcripts from the cloned cDNA were performed as described previously (18Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prézeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10331-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Recordings were performed in Barth's medium using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique (Axoclamp-2A) 3–4 days after injection. Data were analyzed using the pclamp software (Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA). HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected by electroporation as described previously (28Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar). Electroporation was carried out in a total volume of 300 μl with 10 μg of carrier DNA, 500 ng (unless otherwise specified) of plasmid DNA containing the wild type or mutated mGluR, and 10 million cells. Determination of IP accumulation in transfected cells was performed as described previously after labeling the cells overnight with [3H]myoinositol (23.4 Ci/mol, NEN Life Science Products, France) (28Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation was conducted for 30 min in a medium containing 10 mm LiCl and 1 mmGlu. The basal IP formation was determined after a 30-min incubation in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. The Glu degrading enzyme glutamate pyruvate transaminase (1 unit/ml) and 2 mmpyruvate were also added to avoid the possible action of Glu released from the cells. Results are expressed as the amount of IP produced over the radioactivity present in the membranes. The dose-response curves were fitted according to the equation y = ((y max − y min)/1 + (x/EC50)n H) +y min) where EC50 is the concentration of agonist giving a response equal to 50% of the maximum, y max and y mincorrespond to the maximal and minimal values, and n H is the Hill coefficient, using the kaleidagraph program. HEK 293 cell membranes were prepared as described previously (23Prézeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (40 μg of protein) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (2.5% (w/v) SDS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 6.25% glycerol), resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% acrylamide) and transferred by electroblotting onto a Hybond C extra membrane (Amersham, France). Immunodetection of mGluR1 and actin proteins was performed as described previously (23Prézeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar). Chemiluminescent blots were quantitated using the GS-525 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) for which volume analysis of the bands is calculated as pixel density units. For normalization of the results we measured the ratio of metabotropic Glu receptor to the actin signal for each sample. The generation and characterization of the mGluR1 antibody (generous gift of Drs. V. Matarese and F. Ferraguti, Glaxo, Verona, Italy) raised against a chimeric protein containing part of the extracellular domain has been described previously (29Conquet F. Bashir Z.I. Davies C.H. Daniel H.

Eighteen hours after transfection, HEK 293 cells grown on coverslips were washed three times with PBS, fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and washed three times in PBS. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and rabbit anti-mGluR1 (1:250). Cells were washed in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, and bound primary antibodies were detected with a fluorescein-labeled mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:50; Sigma, L'Isle d'Abeau, France) for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were washed, and the coverslips were mounted with Mowiol 4.88 and visualized with a Zeiss (Axiophot) microscope. Statistical differences were examined using the Stat-View Student program (Abacus Concept, Berkeley, CA) using t test or analysis of variance (Fisher's PLSD test). As shown in Fig. 1, several functional differences were observed between the long mGluR1 isoform mGluR1a and the short variant mGluR1c in agreement with our previous studies (18Pin J.-P. Waeber C.

Neurochem. 1996; 67: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, mGluR1a induced faster Chloride currents than mGluR1c upon activation with Glu (Fig. 1 a). When the time needed to reach the maximal amplitude of the current after the beginning of the response was measured (time to peak), it was found to be 5 s in oocytes expressing mGluR1a and 15 s in oocytes expressing mGluR1c (p < 0.001) (Fig.2 a), even though the amount of cRNA injected was adjusted to obtain responses similar in amplitudes (414 ± 28 nA (n = 111) for mGluR1a and 385 ± 35 nA (n = 140) for mGluR1c). In mGluR1a-expressing HEK 293 cells, a 2-fold higher basal Glu-independent PLC activity was measured compared with mock-transfected cells or cells expressing mGluR1c (Figs. 1 b and 2 a). Glu stimulated IP formation to similar extents in cells expressing mGluR1a or mGluR1c, but the EC50 value for Glu was smaller when determined in mGluR1a-expressing cells than in cells expressing mGluR1c (1.08 ± 0.12 μm (n H = 1.03 ± 0.14;n = 8) and 5.67 ± 0.89 (n H= 1.13 ± 0.20; n = 8) (p < 0.001), respectively) (Fig. 1 c). These functional differences did not result from a lower level of expression of the short variant as shown by Western blotting of membrane proteins prepared from both cell types (Fig. 1 d).Figure 2Summary table of the wild type and mutant receptors constructed and analyzed in this study. a, wild type receptors mGluR1a and mGluR1c; b, truncated mGluR1a receptors; c, wild type, truncated, and chimeric mGluR5 receptors; d, mGluR1a and -1c mutants.

In mGluR1Δ1139, a stop codon was introduced at position 1139 so that the last 60 amino acids including a large number of serine and threonine residues and a PDZ interacting sequence (17Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R.J. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 286: 284-288Crossref Scopus (917) Google Scholar) were removed. In mGluR1Δ1093, an additional segment rich in acidic residues was removed. Finally, an additional truncated receptor mGluR1Δ879 with a carboxyl-terminal intracellular tail shorter than that of mGluR1c was also constructed (Fig. 3). The coupling to PLC of these truncated receptors was first analyzed after expression in Xenopus oocytes. In oocytes expressing mGluR1Δ1139, mGluR1Δ1093 as well as in oocytes expressing mGluR1Δ879, Glu induced fast responses similar in shape to those measured in oocytes expressing mGluR1a (Figs. 2 b and4 a). These truncated receptors were also expressed in HEK 293 cells. In these cells all truncated and wild type receptors stimulated IP formation to a similar extent when activated with Glu (data not shown). All truncated receptors also exhibited constitutive activity like mGluR1a (Figs. 2 b and 4 b). Taken together, these results indicate that the truncated receptor mGluR1Δ879, which possesses a carboxyl-terminal intracellular domain shorter than that of mGluR1c, displays the same functional properties as the long variant mGluR1a both in Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells (Fig. 4). This suggests that sequence elements within the 19 carboxyl-terminal residues of mGluR1c are responsible for the specific functional properties of this short mGluR1 variant. To examine whether the carboxyl-terminal end of mGluR1c was sufficient to explain its functional properties, we exchanged the carboxyl-terminal domain of the other PLC-coupled mGluR (mGluR5a) with that of mGluR1a or mGluR1c taking advantage of a conservedSphI site in the mGluR1 and mGluR5 sequences (Figs.2 c and 5). Like the wild type mGluR5a that also possesses a large carboxyl-terminal domain (Fig.2 c), mGluR5/1a induced fast responses in oocytes (Figs.2 c and 6 a) and possessed high constitutive activity (Figs. 2 c and6 b). In contrast, the chimeric mGluR5/1c receptor with the carboxyl-terminal tail of mGluR1c induced slowly developing responses in oocytes (Figs. 2 c and 6 a) and had reduced constitutive activity (Figs. 2 c and 6 b). Moreover, when various concentrations of Glu were used to stimulate IP formation in cells expressing these chimeric receptors, a lower EC50 value was measured with mGluR5/1a-expressing cells than with cells expressing mGluR5/1c (0.74 ± 0.25 μm (n H = 0.62 ± 0.12;n = 4) and 4.39 ± 1.13 (n H= 1.05 ± 0.20; n = 4) (p < 0.02), respectively) (Fig. 6 c). Finally, a truncated mGluR5 receptor with a carboxyl-terminal intracellular tail similar in length to that of mGluR1c (see Fig. 5) has the same functional properties as the wild-type mGluR5a (Fig. 2 c). The presence of the carboxyl-terminal half of the mGluR1c intracellular tail is therefore sufficient to confer to mGluR5 the specific PLC coupling properties of mGluR1c.Figure 6In contrast to the long carboxyl-terminal tail of mGluR1a, the carboxyl-terminal end of mGluR1c impairs PLC coupling of mGluR5. In a, mGluR5/1a induces a chloride current at faster onset than does mGluR5/1c. In b, mGluR5/1a exhibits a higher affinity for the agonist glutamate than does mGluR5/1c. Values are means ± S.E. of 4 independent experiments performed in triplicate. In c, mGluR5/1c displays significantly reduced IP production in the absence of agonist as compared with mGluR5/1a. The maximal IP formation induced by 1 mm Glu was 100 ± 2, 991 ± 160, and 880 ± 232 in mock-transfected cells, in cells expressing mGluR5/1a, and in cells expressing mGluR5/1c, respectively. Values are means ± S.E. of 4 independent experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The carboxyl-terminal sequences of mGluR1b, mGluR1c, and mGluR1d display no sequence homology after the splice junction site (Fig. 5). They share however similar functional properties (18Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prézeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 979-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) suggesting that their specific few carboxyl-terminal residues may not play a critical role in these properties. In agreement with this proposal, a truncated mGluR1a receptor (mGluR1Δ939) with a carboxyl-terminal tail slightly longer than that of mGluR1d shares functional properties with these short receptor variants: it induces slow responses in oocytes and displays no constitutive activity (data not shown). Therefore, the short sequence located between Arg-878 and the splice junction site (KKPGAGNA, see Fig. 5) may be responsible for the specific functional properties of these mGluR1 variants. Interestingly, residue Arg-878 is the second of a cluster of 4 basic residues, RRKK (Fig. 5). To examine if this cluster of basic residues could be responsible for the specific properties of the short mGluR1 splice variants, we constructed mutated mGluR1a and mGluR1c receptors in which Arg-878, Lys-879, and Lys-880 were replaced by Met, Ala, and Ala, respectively. These mutated receptors were named mGluR1aΔβ and mGluR1cΔβ, respectively. Mutation of these 3 basic residues in mGluR1a did not modify its functional properties when examined either in Xenopus oocytes or in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2 d). However, mGluR1cΔβ induced fast current responses when expressed inXenopus oocytes (Figs. 2 d and7 a) and displayed agonist-independent constitutive activity (Figs. 2 d and7 b) and an increased potency of glutamate (6.39 ± 1.76 μm (n H = 1.03 ± 0.21;n = 4) and 0.97 ± 0.53 (n H= 0.96 ± 0.21; n = 4) (p < 0.01) for mGluR1c and mGluR1cΔβ, respectively) (Fig. 7 c) even though it appeared to be expressed at a lower level than the wild type mGluR1c (Fig. 7 d). To verify that all wild type and mutated mGluR1 receptors were correctly targeted to the plasma membrane, immunostaining of HEK 293 cells expressing these receptors was performed using an antibody directed against their conserved extracellular domain. As shown in Fig.8, all receptors were found at the plasma membrane level. Interestingly, the labeling was found as large patches along the plasma membrane in many cells expressing mGluR1c. Suc"

Primary overexpression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase in LDL receptor−/− mice was accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of LDL cholesterol appearance in plasma (whole body LDL cholesterol transport) and a corresponding reduction in circulating LDL cholesterol levels. The increase in hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity necessary to achieve a 50% reduction in plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations was ∼10-fold. In comparison, cholestyramine increased hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity ∼3-fold and reduced plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations by 17%. This study demonstrates that augmentation of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression is an effective strategy for lowering plasma LDL concentrations even in animals with a genetic absence of LDL receptors.

Conversion of cholesterol to bile salts is the principal regulated pathway whereby cholesterol is removed from the body. The initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the major bile salt biosynthetic pathway is hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (1Shefer S. Hauser S. Berkersky I. Mosbach E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 404-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to bile salts fluxing through the liver in the enterohepatic circulation (2Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R.

Bile salt sequestrants such as cholestyramine bind bile salts in the intestinal lumen, thereby preventing their reabsorption and decreasing the return of bile salts to the liver. Loss of bile salts from the enterohepatic circulation results in derepression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression and an increase in the synthesis of bile salts from cholesterol (6Danielsson H.

The efficacy of these interventions is postulated to result from a reduction in the availability of unesterified cholesterol within hepatocytes. Depletion of unesterified cholesterol within the hepatocyte triggers a compensatory increase inde novo cholesterol synthesis and induction of the LDL receptor pathway, the latter leading to enhanced clearance of LDL from plasma (7Reihner E.

Although induction of hepatic LDL receptor activity has been emphasized as the major mechanism responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effects of bile salt sequestrants, a recent study suggests that these agents may also reduce the rate of LDL cholesterol entry into plasma (16Gaw A. Packard C.J. Lindsay G.M. Murray E.F. Griffin B.A. Caslake M.J. Colquhoun I. Wheatley D.J. Lorimer A.R. Shepherd J. Arterio. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Humans (and animals) who genetically lack LDL receptors are characterized by massive elevations of circulating LDL levels, accelerated atherosclerosis, and premature coronary heart disease (17Goldstein J.L. Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 1981-2030Google Scholar). In the absence of functional LDL receptors, the clearance of LDL from plasma is reduced, and the conversion of VLDL to LDL is increased. In Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, the absence of functional LDL receptors leads to a ∼20-fold elevation of the plasma LDL concentration that is the result of a 60–75% reduction in the rate of LDL clearance from plasma coupled with a 2–5-fold increase in the rate of LDL entry into the plasma space (whole body LDL transport) (18Kita T.

Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 32-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the mouse, targeted disruption of the LDL receptor gene leads to a 14-fold increase in the plasma concentration of LDL that is due to an 88% reduction in the rate of LDL clearance from plasma coupled with a 70% increase in whole body LDL transport (20Osono Y. Woollett L.A. Herz J. Dietschy J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1124-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we transiently overexpressed an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene in hamsters using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and determined the effects on hepatic sterol balance and LDL transport (21Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M. Meidell R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This demonstrated that primary overexpression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase markedly lowered plasma LDL concentrations in animals fed control or Western-type diets. Notably, the reduction in plasma LDL levels was due, in large part, to a decrease in the rate of LDL cholesterol entry into the plasma space (whole body LDL transport). This observation raised the possibility that enhancing hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity might also be effective in lowering plasma LDL concentrations in animals lacking LDL receptors. The present study characterizes the response to hepatic 7α-hydroxylase overexpression in mice with targeted disruption of the LDL receptor gene. The results of this study indicate that enhancement of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression is an effective strategy for lowering plasma LDL concentrations not only in animals with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, but also in animals that genetically lack LDL receptors. All studies were performed in female mice with targeted disruption of the LDL receptor gene (22Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). All animals were housed in colony cages (five animals/cage) in a room with light cycling (12 h of light and 12 h of dark) and controlled temperature and humidity. All measurements were made at the mid-dark phase of the light cycle. The animals were maintained on a low fat (50 mg/g of diet), low cholesterol (0.23 mg/g of diet) cereal-based diet (Wayne Lab Blox, Allied Mills, Chicago, IL). The recombinant adenoviruses AdCMV7α (carrying a gene encoding rat 7α-hydroxylase), AdCMVluc (carrying a gene encoding firefly luciferase), and AdCMVβgal (carrying theEscherichia coli lacZ gene) have been described previously (21Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M. Meidell R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Large-scale production of recombinant adenovirus was performed as described (24Willard J.E. Landau C. Glamann D.B. Burns D. Jessen M.E. Pirwitz M.J. Gerard R.D. Meidell R.S. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2190-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) by infecting confluent monolayers of 293 cells grown in 15-cm tissue culture plates with primary stock at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1–1.0. Infected monolayers were lysed with Nonidet P-40 when >90% of the cells showed cytopathic changes, and recombinant virus was purified by precipitation with polyethylene glycol 8000, centrifugation on a discontinuous CsCl density gradient, and desalting by chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B. Purified virus eluting in the void volume was collected, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until used. Hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity was determined using an HPLC/spectrophotometric assay that quantifies the mass of 7α-hydroxycholesterol formed from endogenous microsomal cholesterol after enzymatic conversion to 7α-hydroxycholesten-3-one using cholesterol oxidase (25Chiang J.Y.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasma was obtained from LDL receptor−/− donor mice. The LDL was isolated from plasma by preparative ultracentrifugation in the density range of 1.020–1.055 g/ml and labeled with 125I- or131I-tyramine cellobiose as described previously (26Glass C.K. Pittman R.C. Keller G.A. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7161-7167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of hepatic LDL uptake were measured using primed infusions of125I-tyramine cellobiose-labeled LDL. The infusions of125I-tyramine cellobiose-labeled mouse LDL were continued for 4 h, at which time each animal was administered a bolus of131I-tyramine cellobiose-labeled LDL as a marker of plasma volume and killed 10 min later by exsanguination through the inferior vena cava. Tissue samples along with aliquots of plasma were assayed for radioactivity in a γ-counter (Packard Instrument Co.). The tissue spaces achieved by the labeled LDL at 10 min (131I dpm/g of tissue divided by 131I dpm/μl of plasma) and at 4 h (125I dpm/g of tissue divided by 125I dpm/μl of plasma) were then calculated and have the units of μl/g. The increase in tissue space over the 4-h experimental period equals the rate of radiolabeled LDL movement into each organ and is expressed as μl of plasma cleared of its LDL content per h per g of tissue or per whole organ. Clearance values were multiplied by the plasma LDL concentration to obtain the absolute rates of LDL uptake. VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) was isolated from fasted rabbits by preparative ultracentrifugation and radioiodinated using iodine monochloride (27Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). VLDL turnover studies were performed in mice as described by Ishibashi et al.(22Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Rates of hepatic cholesterol synthesis were measured in vivo using [3H]water. As described previously (28Spady D.K. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 303-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the animals were administered ∼20 mCi of [3H]water intravenously and then returned to individual cages under a fume hood. One h after the injection of [3H]water, the animals were anesthetized and exsanguinated through the inferior vena cava. Aliquots of plasma were taken for the determination of body water specific activity, and samples of liver were taken for the isolation of digitonin-precipitable sterols. Rates of sterol synthesis are expressed as nmol of [3H]water incorporated into digitonin-precipitable sterols/h/g of liver. Hepatic 7α-hydroxylase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (used as an invariant control) mRNA levels were determined by nuclease protection as described previously (29Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5584-5591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes were synthesized using 0.5 μm [32P]dCTP and 1 μm (mouse 7α-hydroxylase), 5 μm (rat 7α-hydroxylase), or 300 μm (mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) unlabeled dCTP. Samples of liver were homogenized in guanidinium thiocyanate, and the RNA was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). Total RNA (40 μg) was hybridized with the 32P-labeled cDNA probes simultaneously at 42 °C overnight. Unhybridized probe, present in excess relative to the amount of specific mRNA, was then digested with 40 units of mung bean nuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.). The mRNA-protected 32P-labeled probes were separated on 7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gels together with32P-labeled MspI-digested pBR322 size standards. The radioactivity in each band, as well as background radioactivity, was quantified using an isotopic imaging system (AMBIS, Inc., San Diego, CA). The level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA did not vary among the various experimental groups and was used to correct for any procedural losses. The liver, gallbladder, and small bowel were removed en block from LDL receptor−/− mice that had been administered AdCMV7α or control virus. The tissues and their contents were placed in a 400-ml beaker with ∼200 ml of ethanol (and trace amounts of tauro[24-14C]cholic acid as an internal standard) and refluxed for 4 h. After extraction with diethyl ether, bile acids in the ethanolic extract were separated and quantified by HPLC. Liver cholesterol was quantified by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. The cholesterol distribution in plasma was determined by FPLC using a Superose 6 column (Sigma). Two-ml fractions were collected and assayed for cholesterol using an enzymatic kit (Sigma). The data are presented as means ± S.D. To test for differences among the dietary regimens, one-way analysis of variance was performed. Significant results were further analyzed using the Tukey multiple comparison procedure. To examine the role of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase in controlling plasma LDL concentrations in animals lacking LDL receptors, we first determined the effect of agents known to suppress (cholate) or up-regulate (cholestyramine) 7α-hydroxylase expression. LDL receptor−/− mice were fed a low cholesterol diet supplemented with cholate (0.3%) or cholestyramine (3%) for 4 weeks. The animals were then killed and used for the determination of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression and plasma cholesterol concentrations. As shown in Fig. 1, orally administered cholate suppressed hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity by ∼90%, whereas cholestyramine increased hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity ∼3-fold. Parallel changes were observed in hepatic 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels (data not shown). The effect of orally administered cholate and cholestyramine on the lipoprotein distribution of cholesterol in plasma was determined by FPLC and is shown in Fig.2. In animals fed cholate, the amount of cholesterol carried in the lower density lipoproteins (VLDL, IDL, and LDL) was markedly increased, whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were reduced. In animals fed cholestyramine, LDL cholesterol concentrations were reduced by 15–20%, whereas VLDL and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were unchanged. Measurements of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity and plasma cholesterol concentrations were also made in animals fed the cholate or cholestyramine diets for 3 days. These studies showed that the effects observed at 4 weeks were largely present at 3 days, although the variability in serum cholesterol values was much greater at 3 days than at 4 weeks (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of cholate or cholestyramine on the lipoprotein distribution of plasma cholesterol in LDL receptor−/− mice. Animals were fed a low cholesterol diet supplemented with cholate (0.3%) or cholestyramine (3%) for 4 weeks. Equal volumes of plasma (from five animals in each group) were pooled and injected onto a Superose 6 column. Two-ml fractions were collected and assayed for cholesterol. Each value represents the mean of two such experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated the effect of overexpressing an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene on plasma lipoprotein concentrations in mice lacking LDL receptors. LDL receptor−/− mice were administered, by intravenous injection, recombinant adenovirus expressing rat 7α-hydroxylase from the cytomegalovirus promoter (AdCMV7α) or equivalent doses of control virus (recombinant adenoviruses expressing either the firefly luciferase gene or theE. coli lacZ gene from the cytomegalovirus promoter). Preliminary time course studies showed that plasma LDL concentrations progressively declined for 2–3 days after the administration of AdCMV7α, remained relatively constant for 4–5 days, and then returned to preinjection values over the next 7–10 days; neither of the control viruses altered plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations over this time frame. Therefore, all subsequent studies were performed 3 days after the injection of recombinant adenovirus. Any animal that lost weight during this 3-day period of time was not studied. The relationship between hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity and plasma LDL concentrations in mice lacking LDL receptors is illustrated in Fig.3. LDL receptor−/− animals were administered 1 or 2 × 109 pfu of AdCMV7α or equivalent doses of AdCMVluc. Three days later, the animals were killed and used for the determination of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression and plasma lipoprotein concentrations. AdCMV7α increased hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity and reduced plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity necessary to achieve a 50% reduction in plasma LDL concentrations was ∼10-fold. By comparison, 3% cholestyramine increased hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity 3-fold and reduced plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations by 17%. Fig. 4 shows the effect of 7α-hydroxylase gene transfer on the lipoprotein distribution of plasma cholesterol as determined by FPLC. LDL receptor−/−mice were administered 1 × 109 pfu of AdCMV7α or the same dose of control virus (AdCMVluc). Three days later, the animals were killed after a 6-h fast, and equal volumes of plasma were pooled and injected onto a Superose 6 column. Primary overexpression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase markedly reduced the amount of cholesterol carried in the lower density lipoproteins (92% reduction in VLDL and 53% reduction in IDL/LDL); high density lipoprotein cholesterol was also reduced (19%), but to a lesser extent. Lipoproteins in fractions corresponding to VLDL (tubes 1–6) and IDL/LDL (tubes 8–18) were separated on precast 1% agarose gels and stained with Fat Red 7B (31de Silva H.V. Mas-Oliva J. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1297-1310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase markedly reduced the amount of pre-β-migrating lipoproteins in FPLC fractions corresponding to VLDL and of β- and pre-β-migrating lipoproteins in FPLC fractions corresponding to IDL/LDL (data not shown). A change in the plasma concentration of LDL may be due to a change in the rate of LDL entry into the plasma space or to a change in the rate of LDL clearance by one or more tissues of the body. To determine the mechanism responsible for the fall in plasma LDL concentrations associated with 7α-hydroxylase gene transfer, we performed LDL transport studies using 125I-tyramine cellobiose-labeled homologous LDL. LDL receptor−/− mice were administered 1 × 109 pfu of AdCMV7α or the same dose of control virus (AdCMVluc). Three days later, LDL transport rates were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in TableI, rates of LDL clearance by the liver, extrahepatic tissues, and whole body were not altered by primary overexpression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase. Multiplication of the tissue clearance rates by the concentration of LDL cholesterol in plasma yields the mass of LDL cholesterol transported by the liver, extrahepatic tissues, and whole body, and these values are also shown in Table I. Because 7α-hydroxylase gene transfer reduced plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations but had no effect on LDL clearance rates, the absolute rates of LDL cholesterol uptake fell in proportion to the decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations. At steady state, the rate of LDL cholesterol uptake by all tissues of the body must equal the rate of LDL cholesterol entry into the plasma space (whole body LDL cholesterol transport). Overexpression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase reduced the rate of whole body LDL cholesterol uptake by ∼50% (from 27 to 14 μg/h/100 g of body weight), but had no effect on whole body LDL cholesterol clearance, indicating that the fall in plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations was due entirely to a decrease in the rate of LDL cholesterol entering the plasma space.Table IEffect of 7α-hydroxylase gene transfer on rates of LDL clearance and LDL cholesterol uptakeLDL clearanceLDL uptakeAdCMVlucAdCMV7αAdCMVlucAdCMV7αμl/h/100 g body wtμg/h/100 g body wtHepatic6 ± 15 ± 18 ± 14 ± 11-aDiffers from the corresponding control value (p < 0.05).Extrahepatic12 ± 212 ± 219 ± 29 ± 21-aDiffers from the corresponding control value (p < 0.05).Whole body18 ± 317 ± 327 ± 314 ± 31-aDiffers from the corresponding control value (p < 0.05).1-a Differs from the corresponding control value (p < 0.05).

LDL receptor−/− mice were administered 1 × 109 pfu of AdCMV7α or the same dose of control virus (AdCMVluc). Three days later, each animal was injected intravenously with 125I-labeled VLDL. Blood was obtained from the retro-orbital sinus at 2 min and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 h. The plasma content of 125I-labeled apoB was measured by isopropyl alcohol precipitation (32Holmquist L. Carlson K. Carlson L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 88: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity present at each time point was expressed relative to the radioactivity present 2 min after the injection of radiolabeled VLDL. As shown in Fig. 5, the rate of disappearance of125I-VLDL from plasma did not differ between the AdCMV7α- and AdCMVluc-treated mice. To further characterize the compensatory response to primary overexpression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase, we measured hepatic cholesterol levels and hepatic cholesterol synthesis rates in LDL receptor−/− mice administered AdCMV7α or control virus. LDL receptor−/− mice were administered 1 × 109 pfu of AdCMV7α or control virus (AdCMVβgal). Three days later, the animals were administered 20 mCi of [3H]water and killed 1 h later for the determination of hepatic cholesterol levels and hepatic cholesterol synthesis rates. As shown in Table II, rates of hepatic cholesterol synthesis were up-regulated ∼5-fold in animals administered AdCMV7α, whereas control virus had no significant effect. The concentration of esterified and unesterified cholesterol in the liver was not significantly altered in animals administered AdCMV7α. As also shown in Table II, cholestyramine increased the rate of hepatic cholesterol synthesis ∼3-fold, whereas cholate suppressed hepatic cholesterol synthesis by 75%.Table IIEffect of 7α-hydroxylase gene transfer on hepatic cholesterol levels and de novo cholesterol synthesis ratesHepatic cholesterol contentHepatic cholesterol synthesisUnesterifiedEsterifiedmg/gnmol/h/gControl1.5 ± 0.20.42 ± 0.05981 ± 150AdCMV7α1.6 ± 0.30.37 ± 0.064919 ± 8502-aDiffers from the control value (p < 0.05).Cholestyramine1.6 ± 0.20.38 ± 0.042783 ± 3062-aDiffers from the control value (p < 0.05).Cholate1.7 ± 0.30.92 ± 0.092-aDiffers from the control value (p < 0.05).244 ± 332-aDiffers from the control value (p < 0.05).2-a Differs from the control value (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab To investigate the effect of primary overexpression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase on the enterohepatic pool of bile salts, we determined the size and composition of the bile salt pool in LDL receptor−/− mice administered AdCMV7α. LDL receptor−/− mice were administered 1 × 109 pfu of AdCMV7α. Three days later, the animals were killed, and the amount and type of bile salts present in the liver, gallbladder, and small intestine were determined. For comparative purposes, bile salt pool size and composition were also determined in animals fed cholestyramine (3%) or cholate (0.3%).

LDL receptor−/− mice were administered 1 × 109 pfu of AdCMV7α or control virus (AdCMVluc). Three days later, the animals were killed, and samples of liver were taken for the determination of 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels using a nuclease protection assay with probes specific for the exogenous (rat) or endogenous (mouse) genes. Preliminary nuclease protection experiments showed that the mouse probe did not yield a protected band when hybridized with rat RNA, and the rat probe did not yield a protected band when hybridized with mouse RNA (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 6, expression of the transgene had relatively little effect on expression of the endogenous gene. The endogenous gene was suppressed by only ∼30% even under conditions in which the transgene was expressed at levels sufficient to raise 7α-hydroxylase activity 10-fold. This observation is in contrast to the hamster, in which overexpression of an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene reciprocally suppressed expression of the endogenous gene (5Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A.

Twelve conserved aspartate (aspartates 47, 49, 55, 194, 231, and 234), glutamate (glutamates 106, 198, and 274), and histidine (histidines 44, 50, and 79) residues were identified by alignment of NixA with homologous transporters. Polymerase chain reaction-generated site-directed mutants of these residues were expressed in E. coli along with the H. pylori urease gene cluster. Mutations in residues within the predicted periplasmic domains of NixA maintained near wild type levels of Ni2+ uptake and urease activity, as did control mutations of conserved positively charged residues (lysines 140 and 268; arginines 162 and 167). Mutations in highly conserved motifs in predicted helices II and III of NixA abolished Ni2+ uptake and urease activity. Mutations in helices V and VI and the cytoplasmic domains decreased Ni2+transport rates by ≥90%. Reduction in rates of Ni2+transport correlated with reduction in urease activities (r = 0.77). Ni2+ transport was inhibited in the presence of Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+, indicating that these ions may also be bound or transported by NixA. We conclude that conserved Asp, Glu, and His residues in the transmembrane domains of NixA are critical for the transport of the divalent cations Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ into the cytoplasm of H. pylori.

Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative, spiral-shaped, microaerophilic bacterium is a well established etiologic agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease (1Blaser M.J. J. Infect.

Microbiol. 1989; 27: 225-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and numerous putative adherence factors (8Lee A. Mitchell H. Hunt R.H. Tytgat G.N.J. Helicobacter pylori: Basic Mechanisms to Clinical Cure. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Lancaster, UK1994Google Scholar). Possibly the most significant virulence factor is an abundant urease, comprising 6% of the total soluble protein of the cell (9Hu L.-T. Mobley H.L.T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 992-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 550-kDa multimeric enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide (10Mobley H.L.T. Island M.D. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 451-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H. pylori has been shown to be highly sensitive to low pH unless urea is present (11Marshall B.J. Barett L.J. Prakesh C. McCallum R.W. Guerrant R.L. Campylobacter IV. University of Goteberg, Goteberg, Sweden1988: 402-403Google Scholar). The ammonia produced by ureolysis has been postulated to allow the acid-sensitive organism to survive and colonize the low pH environment of the gastric mucosa by neutralizing gastric acid. Ammonia produced by this reaction may also contribute directly to histological damage (12Blaser M.J. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An even greater role of urease in H. pylori colonization and pathogenesis has been implied by the observation that urease-negative mutants ofH. pylori are unable to colonize animal models of infection in which the pH of the stomach is maintained at neutrality by the administration of a proton pump inhibitor (13Eaton K.A. Krakowka S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3604-3607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tsuda M. Karita M. Morshed M.G. Okita K. Nakazawa T. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3586-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The divalent nickel ion is a requisite cofactor in the active site of urease (15Hawtin P.R. Delves H.T. Newell D.G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 77: 51-54Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since human serum concentrations of Ni2+average only 2–11 nm (16Sundermann Jr., F.W. Scand. J. Work Environ. Health. 1993; 19: 34-38PubMed Google Scholar), H. pylori must be capable of scavenging Ni2+ from presumably similar concentrations present in the gastric mucosa. One mechanism by which this is accomplished is the NixA nickel transport protein (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). When a plasmid carrying nixA was cotransformed intoEscherichia coli also expressing the H. pyloriurease gene cluster, NixA proved to be a very high affinity Ni2+ importer with a K T = 11.3 nm, well suited to physiological conditions, and allowed synthesis of catalytically active urease independent of growth conditions (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).NixA is a 331-amino acid, 37-kDa integral membrane protein consisting of eight predicted transmembrane domains. Three one-component Ni2+-importing homologs have been identified: the HoxN protein of Alcaligenes eutrophus (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the HupN protein ofBradyrhizobium japonicum (19Fu C. Javedan S. Moshiri F. Maier R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5099-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the UreH protein of the thermophilic Bacillus TB90 (20Maeda M. Hidaka M. Nakamura A. Masaki S. Vozumi T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 432-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NixA, HoxN, HupN, and UreH share the amino acid sequence motif HX 4DH located in transmembrane helix II of NixA with the NikC component of the nonhomologous Nik ABC type Ni2+ transporter of E. coli (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, the amino acid sequence motif GX 5GHSSVV, located in the sequence spanning the second periplasmic loop and helix III of NixA, is also conserved in HoxN, HupN, and UreH (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this report, we present the results of specific site-directed mutagenesis of 12 potential metal-binding residues conserved among NixA and homologous transporters by direct measurement of Ni2+uptake and the synthesis of catalytically active urease.DISCUSSIONH. pylori is a serious human pathogen whose ecological niche is highly restricted to the gastric mucosa of humans, and production of an abundant urease is required for colonization. To synthesize catalytically active urease, Ni2+ must be present in the cytosol for incorporation into the nascent subunits as they are folded and assembled into the 550-kDa multimeric enzyme (10Mobley H.L.T. Island M.D. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 451-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As normal human serum concentrations of Ni2+ range only from 2 to 11 nm, it is predictable that H. pylori must have systems capable of scavenging Ni2+ from presumably similar concentrations in the gastric mucosa. One such system has been shown to be the NixA nickel transport protein, which has a K T of 11.3 nm, well suited to these low physiological Ni2+ concentrations (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Isogenic NixA-deficient H. pylori mutants possess only 30% of the nickel-importing capacity of the parent strains and demonstrated a 42% decrease in urease activity, even when grown on rich medium (Brucella agar supplemented with 10% sheep blood) (33Bauerfeind P.G. Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2877-2880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While this may imply thatH. pylori possesses alternate mechanisms of Ni2+incorporation, the reduction in urease activity of NixA-deficient mutants and the similarity of the K T of NixA to the normal serum concentration clearly underscore the importance of NixA in the synthesis of catalytically active urease, particularly under physiological conditions.NixA is clearly homologous to other single component high affinity Ni2+ importers, namely HoxN (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HupN (20Maeda M. Hidaka M. Nakamura A. Masaki S. Vozumi T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 432-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and UreH (19Fu C. Javedan S. Moshiri F. Maier R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5099-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Size, sequence homology, hydropathy, and charge distribution, along with the analysis of NixA-reporter fusions,2 strongly support an eight-transmembrane domain topology for NixA. While the UreH protein is probably too small to possess eight transmembrane domains and shares only 13% homology with NixA (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it does contain two sequence motifs (HX 4DH and GX 5GHSSVV), which are present in the other high affinity Ni2+ permeases (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also the only known example of a Ni2+-specific transporter encoded within a bacterial urease operon. Interestingly, HoxN and HupN are both encoded within hydrogenase clusters (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), while NixA is not included in any operon structure, and its gene (nixA) is found over 400,000 base pairs away from the urease operon in the recently published genome sequence of H. pylori (34Tomb J.F. Tomb J.-F. White O. Kerelabage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Ketchum K.A. Klenk H.P. Gill S. Dougherty B.A. Nelson K. Quackenbush J. Zhou L. Kirkness E.F. Peterson S. Loftus B.

Nature. 1997; 388: 534-547Crossref Scopus (3006) Google Scholar).To investigate the role of 12 conserved negatively charged or histidine residues in the transport of Ni2+ across the periplasmic membrane, we constructed specific site-directed mutations of these residues and measured the effect of these single amino acid changes directly on Ni2+ uptake and on the resultant urease activities of recombinant constructs. MgCl2 (10 mm) was included in the transport buffer to inhibit the nonspecific binding and transport of Ni2+ by the CorA, MgtA, and MgtB Mg2+ transport systems. The E. coli NikABCD transporter has a significantly lower affinity for Ni2+ and a lower rate of Ni2+ transport (35De Pina K. Navarro C. McWalter L. Boxer D.H. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) compared with NixA and would not be relevant at the low Ni2+ concentrations used in this study. As expected, mutations H44I, D49I, and H50I, which comprise the HX 4DH motif of helix II abolished Ni2+ uptake and urease activity. Recent studies of the two corresponding His residues in HoxN (30Eitinger T. Wolfram L. Degen O. Anthon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17139-17144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) confirm the importance of these residues in Ni2+ binding and transport. Mutation of Asp47, which is conserved in three of the four homologs and lies in the variable region of the helix II motif in NixA, also abolished Ni2+transport and urease activity.Since the helix II motif is highly conserved among NixA and its homologs, as well as in the NikC protein of the E. coli Nik nickel-importing ABC transporter and the Ni2+ binding site of human serum albumin (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is very tempting to assign the role of Ni2+ specificity determinant to this motif. However, the recent discovery of a cobalt-importing transporter NhlF inRhodococcus rhodochrous (36Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is similar in size and topology to NixA and also contains this motif, implies that the HX 4DH motif is not the sole determinant of specificity. As further support for this concept, we found that the presence Co2+ in 10–100-fold excess produced 50% inhibition of 63Ni2+ transport by NixA. The presence of 500-fold excess Ni2+ decreased57Co2+ transport by approximately 90% in NhlF, although direct uptake of 63Ni2+ by NhlF could not be demonstrated (36Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).NixA mutation H79I in the GX 5GHSSVV motif also abolished Ni2+ uptake and urease activity. While this motif is conserved perfectly among NixA and homologous transporters, it is present as a slight variant (GX 5GHSTVV) in helix III of the the cobalt importer of R. rhodochrous (36Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Despite this slight change in consensus, it also seems unlikely that this sequence alone is sufficient for ion specificity.The fact that mutation D194I completely abolished Ni2+transport and urease activity, as did the mutations in the helix II and III motifs, implies that these residues are directly involved in binding and translocation of nickel ions. Notably, Western blotting confirmed that none of these mutations truncated the synthesis of the protein or impaired the insertion of the transporter into the membrane, and no significant increase in proteolytic degradation products were observed in relation to total amount of NixA.Mutations of residues that are located in predicted periplasmic or cytoplasmic loops (E106I, K140I, R162I, R167I, and K286I) all exhibited Ni2+ transport rates not significantly different than the wild type. Similarly, they also exhibited wild type or greater than wild type urease activity. Mutation of residues located in or immediately adjacent to predicted transmembrane domains (D55I, D231I, E198I, D234I, and E274I), but not in the helix II or III motifs, reduced 63Ni2+ transport to <10% of wild type. These constructs, however, showed significant urease activities due to the sensitivity of the urease assay conditions (1 μm NiCl2). It appears, therefore, that the mutated conserved residues outside of the helix II and III motifs are not absolutely essential for Ni2+ transport.Urease activities correlated directly with observed rates of transport, with the exception of mutation E106I, which gave inconsistent transport results, often exhibiting >150% of the wild type transport. It may be reasonable to assume that residues that maintained low transport rates and significant urease activities are involved in the formation of the “pore” or precise alignment of helices within the membrane, rather than direct binding and translocation of nickel ions. More conservative replacements, multiple concomitant replacements, or spectroscopic analysis would be required to confirm this hypothesis.Alternatively, it may be the combination of one or more of these residues with residues that clearly abolish all transport and urease activity when mutated that defines the Ni2+ specificity determinant of NixA and the other high affinity one-component transporters. The possibility of additional periplasmic binding proteins or highly ion specific surface proteins that interact with NixA and other transporters also cannot be ruled out (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).The fact that the high affinity NixA permease may also transport lower levels of Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ is not altogether surprising. While each of these ions would be toxic in high concentration, specific exporters of these ions (37Ge Z. Hirasuka K. Taylor D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that could serve as compensatory mechanisms have been described in the literature. Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative, spiral-shaped, microaerophilic bacterium is a well established etiologic agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease (1Blaser M.J. J. Infect.

Helicobacter pylori: Basic Mechanisms to Clinical Cure. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Lancaster, UK1994Google Scholar). Possibly the most significant virulence factor is an abundant urease, comprising 6% of the total soluble protein of the cell (9Hu L.-T. Mobley H.L.T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 992-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 550-kDa multimeric enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide (10Mobley H.L.T. Island M.D. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 451-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H. pylori has been shown to be highly sensitive to low pH unless urea is present (11Marshall B.J. Barett L.J. Prakesh C. McCallum R.W. Guerrant R.L. Campylobacter IV. University of Goteberg, Goteberg, Sweden1988: 402-403Google Scholar). The ammonia produced by ureolysis has been postulated to allow the acid-sensitive organism to survive and colonize the low pH environment of the gastric mucosa by neutralizing gastric acid. Ammonia produced by this reaction may also contribute directly to histological damage (12Blaser M.J. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An even greater role of urease in H. pylori colonization and pathogenesis has been implied by the observation that urease-negative mutants ofH. pylori are unable to colonize animal models of infection in which the pH of the stomach is maintained at neutrality by the administration of a proton pump inhibitor (13Eaton K.A.

The divalent nickel ion is a requisite cofactor in the active site of urease (15Hawtin P.R. Delves H.T. Newell D.G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 77: 51-54Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since human serum concentrations of Ni2+average only 2–11 nm (16Sundermann Jr., F.W. Scand. J. Work Environ. Health. 1993; 19: 34-38PubMed Google Scholar), H. pylori must be capable of scavenging Ni2+ from presumably similar concentrations present in the gastric mucosa. One mechanism by which this is accomplished is the NixA nickel transport protein (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol.

When a plasmid carrying nixA was cotransformed intoEscherichia coli also expressing the H. pyloriurease gene cluster, NixA proved to be a very high affinity Ni2+ importer with a K T = 11.3 nm, well suited to physiological conditions, and allowed synthesis of catalytically active urease independent of growth conditions (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). NixA is a 331-amino acid, 37-kDa integral membrane protein consisting of eight predicted transmembrane domains. Three one-component Ni2+-importing homologs have been identified: the HoxN protein of Alcaligenes eutrophus (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the HupN protein ofBradyrhizobium japonicum (19Fu C. Javedan S. Moshiri F. Maier R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Significantly, the amino acid sequence motif GX 5GHSSVV, located in the sequence spanning the second periplasmic loop and helix III of NixA, is also conserved in HoxN, HupN, and UreH (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we present the results of specific site-directed mutagenesis of 12 potential metal-binding residues conserved among NixA and homologous transporters by direct measurement of Ni2+uptake and the synthesis of catalytically active urease. DISCUSSIONH. pylori is a serious human pathogen whose ecological niche is highly restricted to the gastric mucosa of humans, and production of an abundant urease is required for colonization. To synthesize catalytically active urease, Ni2+ must be present in the cytosol for incorporation into the nascent subunits as they are folded and assembled into the 550-kDa multimeric enzyme (10Mobley H.L.T. Island M.D. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 451-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As normal human serum concentrations of Ni2+ range only from 2 to 11 nm, it is predictable that H. pylori must have systems capable of scavenging Ni2+ from presumably similar concentrations in the gastric mucosa. One such system has been shown to be the NixA nickel transport protein, which has a K T of 11.3 nm, well suited to these low physiological Ni2+ concentrations (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Isogenic NixA-deficient H. pylori mutants possess only 30% of the nickel-importing capacity of the parent strains and demonstrated a 42% decrease in urease activity, even when grown on rich medium (Brucella agar supplemented with 10% sheep blood) (33Bauerfeind P.G. Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2877-2880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While this may imply thatH. pylori possesses alternate mechanisms of Ni2+incorporation, the reduction in urease activity of NixA-deficient mutants and the similarity of the K T of NixA to the normal serum concentration clearly underscore the importance of NixA in the synthesis of catalytically active urease, particularly under physiological conditions.NixA is clearly homologous to other single component high affinity Ni2+ importers, namely HoxN (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HupN (20Maeda M. Hidaka M. Nakamura A. Masaki S. Vozumi T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 432-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and UreH (19Fu C. Javedan S. Moshiri F. Maier R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5099-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Size, sequence homology, hydropathy, and charge distribution, along with the analysis of NixA-reporter fusions,2 strongly support an eight-transmembrane domain topology for NixA. While the UreH protein is probably too small to possess eight transmembrane domains and shares only 13% homology with NixA (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it does contain two sequence motifs (HX 4DH and GX 5GHSSVV), which are present in the other high affinity Ni2+ permeases (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also the only known example of a Ni2+-specific transporter encoded within a bacterial urease operon. Interestingly, HoxN and HupN are both encoded within hydrogenase clusters (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), while NixA is not included in any operon structure, and its gene (nixA) is found over 400,000 base pairs away from the urease operon in the recently published genome sequence of H. pylori (34Tomb J.F. Tomb J.-F. White O. Kerelabage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Ketchum K.A. Klenk H.P. Gill S. Dougherty B.A. Nelson K. Quackenbush J. Zhou L. Kirkness E.F. Peterson S. Loftus B.

Nature. 1997; 388: 534-547Crossref Scopus (3006) Google Scholar).To investigate the role of 12 conserved negatively charged or histidine residues in the transport of Ni2+ across the periplasmic membrane, we constructed specific site-directed mutations of these residues and measured the effect of these single amino acid changes directly on Ni2+ uptake and on the resultant urease activities of recombinant constructs. MgCl2 (10 mm) was included in the transport buffer to inhibit the nonspecific binding and transport of Ni2+ by the CorA, MgtA, and MgtB Mg2+ transport systems. The E. coli NikABCD transporter has a significantly lower affinity for Ni2+ and a lower rate of Ni2+ transport (35De Pina K. Navarro C. McWalter L. Boxer D.H. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) compared with NixA and would not be relevant at the low Ni2+ concentrations used in this study. As expected, mutations H44I, D49I, and H50I, which comprise the HX 4DH motif of helix II abolished Ni2+ uptake and urease activity. Recent studies of the two corresponding His residues in HoxN (30Eitinger T. Wolfram L. Degen O. Anthon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17139-17144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) confirm the importance of these residues in Ni2+ binding and transport. Mutation of Asp47, which is conserved in three of the four homologs and lies in the variable region of the helix II motif in NixA, also abolished Ni2+transport and urease activity.Since the helix II motif is highly conserved among NixA and its homologs, as well as in the NikC protein of the E. coli Nik nickel-importing ABC transporter and the Ni2+ binding site of human serum albumin (18Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is very tempting to assign the role of Ni2+ specificity determinant to this motif. However, the recent discovery of a cobalt-importing transporter NhlF inRhodococcus rhodochrous (36Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is similar in size and topology to NixA and also contains this motif, implies that the HX 4DH motif is not the sole determinant of specificity. As further support for this concept, we found that the presence Co2+ in 10–100-fold excess produced 50% inhibition of 63Ni2+ transport by NixA. The presence of 500-fold excess Ni2+ decreased57Co2+ transport by approximately 90% in NhlF, although direct uptake of 63Ni2+ by NhlF could not be demonstrated (36Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).NixA mutation H79I in the GX 5GHSSVV motif also abolished Ni2+ uptake and urease activity. While this motif is conserved perfectly among NixA and homologous transporters, it is present as a slight variant (GX 5GHSTVV) in helix III of the the cobalt importer of R. rhodochrous (36Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Despite this slight change in consensus, it also seems unlikely that this sequence alone is sufficient for ion specificity.The fact that mutation D194I completely abolished Ni2+transport and urease activity, as did the mutations in the helix II and III motifs, implies that these residues are directly involved in binding and translocation of nickel ions. Notably, Western blotting confirmed that none of these mutations truncated the synthesis of the protein or impaired the insertion of the transporter into the membrane, and no significant increase in proteolytic degradation products were observed in relation to total amount of NixA.Mutations of residues that are located in predicted periplasmic or cytoplasmic loops (E106I, K140I, R162I, R167I, and K286I) all exhibited Ni2+ transport rates not significantly different than the wild type. Similarly, they also exhibited wild type or greater than wild type urease activity. Mutation of residues located in or immediately adjacent to predicted transmembrane domains (D55I, D231I, E198I, D234I, and E274I), but not in the helix II or III motifs, reduced 63Ni2+ transport to <10% of wild type. These constructs, however, showed significant urease activities due to the sensitivity of the urease assay conditions (1 μm NiCl2). It appears, therefore, that the mutated conserved residues outside of the helix II and III motifs are not absolutely essential for Ni2+ transport.Urease activities correlated directly with observed rates of transport, with the exception of mutation E106I, which gave inconsistent transport results, often exhibiting >150% of the wild type transport. It may be reasonable to assume that residues that maintained low transport rates and significant urease activities are involved in the formation of the “pore” or precise alignment of helices within the membrane, rather than direct binding and translocation of nickel ions. More conservative replacements, multiple concomitant replacements, or spectroscopic analysis would be required to confirm this hypothesis.Alternatively, it may be the combination of one or more of these residues with residues that clearly abolish all transport and urease activity when mutated that defines the Ni2+ specificity determinant of NixA and the other high affinity one-component transporters. The possibility of additional periplasmic binding proteins or highly ion specific surface proteins that interact with NixA and other transporters also cannot be ruled out (17Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).The fact that the high affinity NixA permease may also transport lower levels of Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ is not altogether surprising. While each of these ions would be toxic in high concentration, specific exporters of these ions (37Ge Z. Hirasuka K. Taylor D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that could serve as compensatory mechanisms have been described in the literature.

This was recently confirmed by the cloning, from melanoma cells, of an enzyme capable of synthesizing type 1 chains, which was shown to have no homology to other galactosyltransferases. We report here the molecular cloning and functional expression of a second human β3-galactosyltransferase distinct from the melanoma enzyme. The new β3-galactosyltransferase has homology to the melanoma enzyme in the putative catalytic domain, but has longer cytoplasmic and stem regions and a carboxyl-terminal extension. Northern blots showed that the new gene is present primarily in brain and heart. When transfected into mammalian cells, this gene directs the synthesis of type 1 chains as determined by a monoclonal antibody specific for sialyl Lewisa. A soluble version of the cloned enzyme was expressed in insect cells and purified. The soluble enzyme readily catalyzes the transfer of galactose to GlcNAc to form Gal(β1–3)GlcNAc. It also has a minor but distinct transfer activity toward Gal, LacNAc, and lactose, but is inactive toward GalNAc.

Both types of carbohydrate structures are present in soluble oligosaccharides of human milk (1Haeuw-Fievre S. Wieruszeski J.-M. Plancke Y. Michalski J.-C. Montreuil J. Strecker G. Eur. J.

The differences in function between type 1 and type 2 chains are not well understood. For example, during both embryogenesis (5Brown D.G. Warren V.N. Pahlsson P. Kimber S.J. Histochem.

Furthermore, both type 1 and type 2 chains can be ligands for the selectin family of leukocyte extravasation receptors (7Berg E.L. Robinson M.K. Mansson O. Butcher E.C. Magnani J.L. J. Biol.

This enzyme requires Mn2+ for activity and is regulated by α-lactalbumin to change the kinetics of transfer to glucose, thus favoring the synthesis of lactose.

This enzyme is clearly different from the β4-Gal-T and is expected to have a more restricted tissue distribution. The type 1 elongating enzyme is thought to be distinct from another β3-Gal-T activity detected in various sources and transferring to lactose or LacNAc (11Bailly P. Piller F. Cartron J.-P. Eur. J.

Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 630-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as well as normal colonic mucosa (17Seko A. Ohkura T. Kitamura H. Yonezawa S. Sato E. Yamashita K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3468-3473PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, DNA from COLO 205 cells when transfected into mammalian cells produced cell lines de novosynthesizing type 1 chains (18Sherwood A.L. Green T.G. Holmes E.H. J. Cell Biochem. 1992; 50: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). No molecular information is available for any of these enzymes, and it is therefore difficult to judge their similarity. A β3-Gal-T was recently cloned from the human melanoma WM266–4 cell line using an expression cloning strategy that relied on lectin resistance to identify clones (19.Sasaki, K., Sasaki, E., Kawashima, K., Hanai, N., Nishi, T., and Hasegawa, M. (July 5, 1994) JP0618759 A 940705.Google Scholar). This enzyme, which has no homology to known glycosyltransferases, transfers galactose in vitro to produce Gal(β1–3)GlcNAc(β1–3)Gal(β1–4)Glc and directs the synthesis of sLea in transfected cells. We report here the cloning and functional expression of a new β3-Gal-T from human brain distinct from the enzyme present in melanoma cells. The new enzyme is homologous to the melanoma cell enzyme in the putative catalytic domain, and is mainly expressed in brain and heart. When transfected in mammalian cells, the new gene directs the de novo synthesis of type 1 chains. A soluble version of the enzyme expressed in insect cells transfers galactose to GlcNAc to produce Gal(β1–3)GlcNAc. The recombinant enzyme also transfers galactose to Gal, LacNAc, and lactose, at distinctly lower rates. To distinguish the two β3-Gal-T enzymes, we propose to name the melanoma enzyme β3GalT1 and the human brain enzyme β3GalT2. All cell culture media, sera, and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc. CHO K1 cells (ATCC CCL-61) were maintained in α-minimal essential medium, 5% fetal bovine serum. Sf9 insect cells were grown in Sf-900 II SFM medium. GlcNAc, Gal, Gal(β1–3)GlcNAc, p-nitrophenyl β-d-lactopyranoside, GalNAcα-benzyl, and UDP-Gal were purchased from Sigma. Antibody CSLEX was purchased from Becton Dickinson, and GSLA1 was a gift from Dr. J. Magnani (GlycoTech Corp.). The cDNA for Fuc-T III in the expression vector pcDM7 was a gift from Dr. J. B. Lowe (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ann Arbor, MI). The cDNA sequence of β3GalT2 was cloned by its homology to β3GalT1 (19.Sasaki, K., Sasaki, E., Kawashima, K., Hanai, N., Nishi, T., and Hasegawa, M. (July 5, 1994) JP0618759 A 940705.Google Scholar). Using the complete 322-amino acid protein sequence of β3GalT1, a TBLASTN search was performed (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) on the dbest data base (release: Feb. 4, 1996). The best aligning EST sequences (accession numbers R13867, H14861, and R13064) from infant brain showed sequence identities of about 67% over a stretch of about 68 amino acids to the putative catalytic domain of β3GalT1. Thirty-eight amino acids deduced from the cDNA sequence of R13867 were then used to search again the dbest data base (release: Feb. 29, 1996) using TBLASTN. An additional human fetal EST cloneD81474 was found, further extending the homology within the catalytic domain. The sequences of EST clonesR13867 and D81474 were artificially combined, and primers were designed, allowing PCR amplification of a 307-bp DNA fragment specific for combined ESTs R13867 and D81474. These primers, designated galtdia2.pcr (ACT CGC CAG TGA TTG AAC ACA AAC) and galtdia3.pcr (TGA AGC CAG ATC TGC CTC CC) were then used to screen a collection of 16 heat-inactivated human λ cDNA libraries (QUICK-screen™,CLONTECH) by PCR for the presence of the 307-bp diagnostic fragment. A viable form of the human brain λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH, HL3002) was screened for the full-length cDNA of the putative new β3-Gal-T. Screening was done by preparing hierarchical λ phage pools and screening them by PCR using primers galtdia2.pcr and galtdia3.pcr, essentially as described previously by D'Esposito et al. (21D'Esposito M. Mazzarella R. Pengue G. Jones C. D'Urso M. Schlessinger D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4806-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, 9.5 × 105 plaque-forming units from the human brain λgt10 cDNA library were used to infect Escherichia coli C600 hfl cells, mixed with LB top agar, and plated onto 32 six-well tissue culture plates. After bacterial lysis, λ phage were eluted with SM buffer and extracted once with chloroform. The samples were briefly centrifuged and the clear lysates were subsequently stored at 4 °C (top level pool). For each 96-well plate of the top level, column and row pools were prepared by mixing equal volumes of phage lysate from each well to obtain a total of 40 column and row λ phage pools. Aliquots (1 μl each) of every well in each column and row were pooled, heat-treated (5 min at 95 °C), and tested by PCR with primer pair galtdia2.pcr and galtdia3.pcr for the presence of the 307-bp DNA fragment. The intersections of each positive column and row pool were identified as a potentially positive wells possibly containing single independent clones and were individually re-tested by PCR. Two positive top level wells were selected and their phage titer determined. Level 1 pools were obtained by replating 13,000 plaque-forming units each from the selected top level wells onto 16 six-well plates and preparation of the corresponding phage lysates. Positive level 1 pools were identified by PCR using the strategy described above. To further reduce phage complexity, 450 plaque-forming units of several positive level 1 wells were subsequently plated onto four 24-well tissue culture plates each. Phage from positive level 2 wells were plated at a density so that single λ plaques could be isolated. Forty-eight single phage lysates were prepared and analyzed by PCR. Purity and insert size of each λ phage clone was determined by PCR using λ DNA specific oligonucleotide primers lgt10–5′.seq (AGC AAG TTC AGC CTG GTT AAG T) and lgt10–3′.rev (TTA TGA GTA TTT CTT CCA GGG). One of the 307-bp positive phage lysates, designated GA4/1, contained the largest insert (3 kb). After plaque purification, the insert of clone GA4/1 was subcloned into the singleEcoRI site of expression vector pZEOSV (Invitrogen). Isolation of the insert of λ clone GA4/1 was done either by PCR amplification using the λgt10-specific primers shown above or by excision from purified λ DNA using restriction endonucleaseEcoRI. The DNA sequences of several clones of GA4/1 in pZEOSV (GA4/1.zeo) were determined. Both strands were sequenced using 21-mer and 22-mer oligonucleotide primers synthesized according to the sequence of the cDNA insert. The DNA sequences were assembled with the CAP program (22Huang X. Genomics. 1995; 14: 18-25Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Clone Manager (Scientific & Educational Software) and the sequence analysis software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (23Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). A premade Northern blot of poly(A)+ RNA (multiple tissue Northern blot,CLONTECH) was prehybridized in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, and 1% SDS solution at 65 °C for 4 h and then hybridized overnight at 65 °C with a 32P-random prime-labeled (24Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar) probe from the GA4/1 insert, containing the entire coding region of β3GalT2. Filters were washed at room temperature in 5 × SSC, 0.2% SDS two times and then in 2 × SSC, 0.2% SDS two times. Final wash was in 0.1 × SSC, 0.2% SDS at room temperature. To create a cell line capable of producing sLea, CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the gene for Fuc-T III (25Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Expression vector pcDNA(+).hyg was constructed by inserting into the single NheI restriction endonuclease site present in vector pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen) a XbaI-restricted 1.68-kb DNA fragment encompassing the entire expression unit for hygromycin-B resistance. The fragment was obtained from vector pREP7 (Invitrogen) by PCR amplification using primers Hyg1.Xba (GCT CTA GAG CGT TTG CTG GCG GTG TCC) and Hyg2.Xba (GCT CTA GAC CAT GGG TCT GTC TGC TCA GTC CA). In pcDNA(+).hyg both, the hygromycin-B resistance gene and inserted genes/cDNAs are transcribed in the same direction. The complete cDNA for human Fuc-T III was excised from pcDM7 using restriction endonuclease XhoI and ligated into pcDNA(+).hyg cut with the same restriction endonuclease to create vector FTIII.hyg. Correct orientation of the Fuc-T III coding sequence was verified by restriction analysis. CHO-K1 cells were seeded overnight in six-well plates and transfected with 4 μg/well of FTIII.hyg, using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were trypsinized into a T-175 flask, and 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem) was added to the medium after 24 h. After 3 weeks of selection, surviving cells were sorted by FACS for the surface expression of the sLexepitope by incubation with monoclonal antibody CSLEX-1 and staining with FITC-labeled polyclonal anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The sorted cells were placed in 96-well plates at a density of 0.5 cells/well. Cells from wells containing single colonies were analyzed for surface expression of sLex by FACS with CSLEX, and clones displaying the highest staining were used for further experiments. A mammalian expression vector was prepared containing the complete open reading frame of β3GalT2. Construction was done by PCR amplifying a DNA fragment from plasmid GA4/1.zeo using oligonucleotides NGalTATG.ECO (CGC GAA TTC GCC ACC ATG CTT CAG TGG AGG AGA AGA CAC TGC) and NGalTTAG.ECO (CGC GAA TTC CTA ATG TAG TTT ACG GTG GCG ATA CCT GCC). Oligonucleotide NGalTATG.ECO had a 5′ extension containing an EcoRI restriction endonuclease site and consensus sequence for efficient translation (26Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide NGalTTAG.ECO included the putative stop codon of the β3GalT2 and an 5′ extension containing an EcoRI restriction endonuclease site. The gel-purified, amplified 1.29-kb PCR fragment was directly ligated into plasmid pCR3™-uni (Invitrogen). Correct orientation of the DNA insert present in plasmid pGA4/1CDS.uni was verified by restriction analysis. CHO/Fuc-T III cells seeded overnight in a six-well plate were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid pGA4/1CDS.uni using LipofectAMINE. Cells were trypsinized in a T-175 flask, and after 24 h 0.5 mg/ml G418 was added to the culture medium. After 3 weeks of selection, cells were analyzed by FACS for the expression of sLea on their surface. FACS analysis was performed by first incubating the cells with the monoclonal antibody GSLA1 and after washing with a FITC-labeled polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). A basic mammalian expression vector for the expression ofStaphylococcus aureus protein A fusions was prepared as follows. First an expression vector was constructed containing 20 amino acids of the human γ-interferon signal sequence and the first 6 amino acids of mature human γ-interferon (27Nishi T. Fujita T. Nishi-Takaoka C. Saito A. Matsumoto T. Sato M. Oka T. Itoh S. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. Taniguchi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) plus suitable cloning sites for the cDNA insertion. Oligonucleotides IFNG-NEW1 (GTG GCA AAG CTT TCT AGA GGC GCG CCA CCA CCA TGA AAT ATA CAA GTT ATA TCT TGG CTT TTC AGC TCT GCA TCG TTT TGG GTT CTC TTG) and IFNG-NEW3 (GGA CTA GTT CTA GAA CCG GTT TAC TAC TCG AGG GAT CCG TCG ACG GGG TCC TGG CAG TAA CAG CCA AGA GAA CCC AAA ACG AT) were annealed, the single-stranded regions were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and theHindIII/SpeI-restricted DNA fragment was subcloned into vector pcDNAI/neo (Invitrogen) restricted withHindIII and XbaI, resulting in plasmid IFNG-new.neoI. A DNA fragment encoding for the Ig-binding domains of protein A was amplified from plasmid pRIT2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) by PCR using oligonucleotides SPANEW1.SAL (GGT ACG GTC GAC TGG GAT CAA CGC AAT GGT TTT ATC) and SPANEW3.XHO (GGT GCA CTC GAG ATT TGT TAT CTG CAG ATC GAC). This DNA fragment was then cut with restriction endonucleasesSalI and XhoI and subcloned into plasmid IFNG-new.neoI restricted with the same enzymes. At the carboxyl-terminal end of protein A were added XhoI and AgeI cloning sites for in-frame insertion of cDNAs. The resulting plasmid, designated sPROTA2.neoI, is capable of directing the expression of secreted protein A or protein A fusion proteins under control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter (data not shown). A DNA fragment encoding for amino acids 125–422 (Fig. 1) of β3GalT2 was inserted into the XhoI and AgeI sites of vector sPROTA2.neoI. Construction was done by PCR amplification of the corresponding DNA fragment from GA4/1.zeo using oligonucleotides NGALTS1.XHO (GGT GCA CTC GAG AAA GGT ACT GGA CAT CCA AAT TCT TAC) and NGALTEND.AGE (GGT GCA ACC GGT TAC TAA TGT AGT TTA CGG TGG CGA TAC C). The amplified 0.92-kb PCR fragments was restricted with AgeI and XhoI and subcloned into sPROTA2.neoI, cut with the same enzymes. The presence of the β3GalT2 insert in the resulting protein A fusion vector SPA2GATS.neoI was verified by sequencing. The complete expression cassette for the protein A fusion of β3GalT2 of vector SPA2GATS.neoI was then transferred into an insect cell expression system to be able to purify larger quantities of the fusion protein for functional studies. This was achieved by transferring a 1.8-kbXbaI fragment from SPA2GATS.neoI into the uniqueXbaI site of donor plasmid pFastBac1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Correct orientation of the DNA insert present in the resulting donor plasmid SPA2GATS.bac1 was verified by restriction analysis. Donor plasmid SPA2GATS.bac1 was used to create inE. coli recombinant SPA2GATS bacmid DNA containing all the genetic elements for the production of recombinant virus particles, by utilizing Tn7-mediated transposition according to protocols given in the instruction manual of the BAC-TO-BAC baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The recombinant bacmid DNA was then used to transfect Sf9 insect cells, and isolated virus was then used to obtain a high titer virus stock. For large scale production of the β3GalT2/protein A fusion, Sf9 cells grown at 28 °C in flasks to a density of 2 × 106 were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5, and culture supernatants were harvested 72 h post-infection. After centrifugation, filtration and concentration, supernatants were made 25 mm in sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 100 mm in NaCl and loaded onto a SP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 25 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, and the β3GalT2/protein A fusion protein was eluted with 25 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 500 mm NaCl. The eluted fractions were dialyzed against 40 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 100 mmNaCl, 20 mm MnCl2 and loaded onto a UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose column, equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with loading buffer, followed by washing with loading buffer without MnCl2. Elution of the enzyme was accomplished with buffer containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml UDP (Fluka). The enzyme was stored at 4 °C. A protein A fusion chimera of β3GalT1 was cloned and expressed in a manner analogous to that indicated above for β3GalT2. A portion of β3GalT1 representing the complete stem region and catalytic domains (amino acids 35–326) was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of Colo 205 cells (ATCC CCL-222), and recombinant virus were produced in a manner analogous to that described for β3GalT2. Cell culture and protein purification was performed as indicated above for β3GalT2. The protein A portion of the β3GalT2/protein A fusion protein was used to semi-quantitatively determine the concentration of the soluble form of β3GalT2. Microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 120 μl of human IgG (5 μg/ml; Sigma) in PBS and blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. Samples as well as a protein A standard (0.5–50 ng/ml recombinant IgG-binding fragment of protein A; Sigma) diluted in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.5% BSA (PBS/BSA) were added to the microtiter plates and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Wells were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated successively with 100 μl of biotinylated goat anti-protein A antibody (1:100.000; Sigma) and 100 μl of streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (1:5000; Boehringer) in PBS/BSA, for 60 min at room temperature. Wells were washed six times with PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 and developed with TMB substrate solution (Bio-Rad), and absorbance at 450 nm was measured after stopping with 50 μl of 1 mH2SO4. The linkage synthesized by the β3GalT2/protein A fusion protein was analyzed by HPAE/PAD as follows: to 28 μl of assay stock solution (180 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.26 mm UDP-Gal), 2 μl of MnCl2 (500 mm), 1 μl of GlcNAc (500 mm), 14 μl of H2O, and 5 μl of enzyme were added. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h the reaction was stopped by freezing. An aliquot of 25 μl of the reaction mix was analyzed by HPAE/PAD (Dionex) using the following conditions: 70% H2O, 30% 0.5 mNaOH, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Enzymatic activity of the β3GalT2/protein A fusion protein was determined using a radioactive assay similar to the method of Palcicet al. (28Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycocojugate J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar) as follows; the appropriate amounts of enzyme were incubated with 14 μl of assay stock solution (180 mmsodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.26 mm UDP-Gal, 2 μl of [3H]UDP-Gal (Amersham Corp.)), 1 μl of MnCl2 (500 mm), 2.5 μl of GlcNAc-Lemieux (37 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide) at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of water and loaded on a C18 Sep-Pack cartridge (Waters), and the column was washed twice with 5 ml of H2O and eluted with 5 ml of methanol. All fractions were counted in a BETAmatic β counter (Kontron) after the addition of 10 ml of scintillation fluid. Enzymatic activity was determined by calculating percent UDP-Gal conversion (3H activity in the methanol fraction versus total 3H activity of all fractions). It is difficult to predict the sequence homology of glycosyltransferases based on their enzymatic activity. Some glycosyltransferases are grouped into families of homologous genes, as for example the α1–3 fucosyltransferases (29Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 283-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), or have characteristic motifs, as is the case for sialyltransferases (30Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 31Geremia R.A. Harduin-Lepers A. Delannoy P. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: v-xiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many glycosyltransferases, however, have little or no homology even between enzymes that utilize the same activated sugar donor and carbohydrate acceptor. This is the case for galactosyltransferases, which seem to have no common motif except possibly for a hexapeptide (B-D-K-K-N-A, where A is either E or D and B is either R or K) identified by Joziasse et al. (32Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Tunen A.J. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14290-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TBLASTN (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) data base searches using all possible permutations of this peptide motif revealed no new homologous sequences. The cloning of β3GalT1 by an elegant expression cloning method using lectin resistance for phenotype selection (19.Sasaki, K., Sasaki, E., Kawashima, K., Hanai, N., Nishi, T., and Hasegawa, M. (July 5, 1994) JP0618759 A 940705.Google Scholar) provided the opportunity to search for novel galactosyltransferase genes by sequence similarity. Searches performed on the dbest data base using the TBLASTN algorithm revealed several ESTs with homology to portions of the β3GalT1 sequence. From a total of four ESTs identified (all of which were from human brain), a continuous cDNA fragment encoding for about 102 amino acids of a putative new galactosyltransferase gene was assembled. This cDNA fragment allowed the design of primers, which were used to provide a diagnostic PCR signal for the presence of the new putative gene. From the strength of the PCR signal, the new gene was found to exist mainly in libraries from human brain, heart, and cells of the immune system (data not shown). The human brain library gave the strongest PCR signal and was subsequently used as a starting point for the identification of the new gene. To clone the new gene, the method of D'Esposito et al. (21D'Esposito M. Mazzarella R. Pengue G. Jones C. D'Urso M. Schlessinger D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4806-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used, which relies on successive levels of splits, tests, and expansions of λ phage pools to obtain successively enriched fractions of the target gene. Starting with approximately 1 million clones, the first split to 192 wells (level 0) provided 17 wells with a positive PCR signal. This translates into an abundance of the cDNA of at least 1 in 84,000 calculated on the basis of 950,000 independent λ phage clones used for the primary infection. Each of the level 0 wells potentially contained a single independent clone from the putative gene. Because the diagnostic PCR amplified signal was from an internal portion of the putative new gene, no information was obtained regarding the length of the various level 0 clones and it was therefore not possible to judge which of the positive wells contained the complete gene. Two level 0 wells were chosen for subsequent expansion solely on the strength"

Receptors for activin and TGFβ have been identified as dimers of serine-threonine kinase subunits that regulate cytoplasmic proteins known as Smads. Despite major advances in our understanding of activin and TGFβ receptors and signaling pathways, little is known about inhibin receptors or the mechanism by which this molecule provides a functionally antagonistic signal to activin. Studies described in this paper indicate that an independent inhibin receptor exists. Numerous tissues were examined for inhibin-specific binding sites, including the developing embryo, in which the spinal ganglion and trigeminal ganglion-bound iodinated inhibin A. Sex cord stromal tumors, derived from male and female inhibin α-subunit-deficient mice, were also identified as a source of inhibin receptor. Abundant inhibin and few activin binding sites were identified in tumor tissue sections by in situ ligand binding using iodinated recombinant human inhibin A and125I-labeled recombinant human inhibin A. Tumor cell binding was specific for each ligand (competed by excess unlabeled homologous ligand and not competed by heterologous ligand). Based on these results and the relative abundance and homogeneity of tumor tissues versus the embryonic ganglion, tumor tissues were homogenized, membrane proteins were purified, and putative inhibin receptors were isolated using an inhibin affinity column. Four proteins were eluted from the column that bind iodinated inhibin but not iodinated activin. These data suggest that inhibin-specific membrane-associated proteins (receptors) exist.

In 1932, McCullagh (1McCullagh D.R. Science. 1932; 76: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) proposed that the gonads produce a nonsteroidal factor that regulates pituitary function.

Dimeric inhibin A (α-βA), inhibin B (α- βB), activin A (βA-βA), activin AB (βA-βB), and activin B (βB-βB) have been purified from follicular fluid. Homo- or heterodimeric assembly of the βC-, βD-, and βE-subunits has not been demonstrated to date. The inhibin and activin β-subunits are 30% homologous to TGFβ based on alignment of conserved cysteine amino acids. Crystal structures of two TGFβ family members (TGFβ2 and osteogenic protein-2) have been solved, and the overall structural similarity between these proteins implies that a conserved topology exists between members of the superfamily (8Daopin S. Li M. Davies D.R. Proteins. 1993; 17: 176-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Griffith D.L. Keck P.C. Sampath T.K. Rueger D.C. Carlson W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Proteins within the TGFβ family span multiple species and appear to be central factors in bone formation and morphogenesis of embryos, and the genes that encode them may function as tumor suppressor genes (10Massague J. Cheifetz S. Laiho M. Ralph D. Weis F. Zentella A. Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 81-103PubMed Google Scholar). Activin activity is inhibited by interaction with a bioneutralizing binding protein called follistatin (11DePaolo L. Bicsak T. Erickson G. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 198: 500-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Follistatin binds both inhibin and activin through the β-subunit; however, the ability of follistatin to neutralize inhibin activity cannot be determined until a cellular activity is described for inhibin that is not confounded by activin. Follistatin is structurally complex and is highly conserved between species with two conserved amino acid differences between rat and human and 87% homology with the Xenopus follistatin homologue (12Esch F.S. Shimasaki S. Mercado M. Cooksey K. Ling N. Ying S. Ueno N. Guillemin R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13Shimasaki S. Koga M. Buscaglia M.L. Simmons D.M. Bicsak T.A. Ling N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cellular response to activin is transduced through two single membrane-spanning serine-threonine kinase subunits (3Mathews L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 310-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The ligand binds a type II receptor (70–75 kDa) that transphosphorylates a type I receptor (50–55 kDa). The holo-receptor complex is then competent to initiate intracellular signaling cascades (3Mathews L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 310-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Two ligand binding type II receptor genes have been identified (type RII and type RIIB receptor subunits), and four alternatively spliced variants of the type IIB receptor have been cloned (14Attisano L. Wrana J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 86: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The isoforms differ by changes in an extracellular proline-rich region immediately preceding the transmembrane domain and in a region between the transmembrane domain and serine-threonine kinase domain. Inhibin is able to bind the type II receptor but not recruit a type I receptor (15Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 16Lebrun J.J. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17Xu J. McKeehan K. Matsuzaki K. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6308-6313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the ability of inhibin to inhibit activin action is based, in part, upon this dominant negative interaction with receptor subunits. Receptors for many of the individual ligands have been identified, and they have structural characteristics similar to those described for the activin receptor. Inhibin α-subunit is distinct within the TGFβ superfamily because it is capable of heterodimeric assembly (with activin β-subunit) and is not able to homodimerize. The inhibin α-subunit is one of four proteins distantly related to the core ligands (activin/TGFβ/bone morphogenic protein). Other ligands with distant homology include Mullerian inhibiting substance (the receptor of which is analogous to the TGFβ structure), growth differentiation factor-9 (the receptor of which has not been identified), and glial-derived nerve growth factor (the receptor of which includes a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored binding protein that presents the ligand to a tyrosine kinase receptor) (18Teixeira J. Donahoe P.K. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 336-341PubMed Google Scholar, 19Durbec P. Marcos-Gutierrez C.V. Kilkenny C. Grigoriou M. Wartiowaara K. Suvanto P. Smith D. Ponder B. Costantini F. Saarma M.T.

An alternative hypothesis is that a separate inhibin receptor or inhibin accessory protein exists that mediates an inhibin-specific signal. Supporting the hypothesis that an independent inhibin receptor exists, inhibin-specific binding sites have been identified on ovarian granulosa cells and testicular Leydig cells (21Woodruff T.K. Lyon R.J. Hansen S.E. Rice G.C. Mather J.P. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 22Woodruff T.K. Krummen L.A. McCray G. Mather J.P.

Reprod. 1994; 50: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The most compelling evidence indicative of an inhibin receptor or cell surface ancillary binding protein is the identification of an inhibin-specific protein complex in a hematopoietic cell line (K562) (16Lebrun J.J. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that inhibin activity involves an inhibin-specific receptor. Therefore, studies were initiated to isolate the inhibin receptor. Mice that are genetically deficient in the inhibin α-subunit are deficient in inhibin A and inhibin B and overexpress activin A and activin B (24Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Su J.-G. Hsueh A.J.W. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 360: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 25Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Mather J.P. Krummen L.A. Lu H. Bradley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8817-8821Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These inhibin knockout mice are normal during embryonic and early postnatal development. However, microscopic focal gonadal tumors of the mixed or incompletely differentiated sex cord stromal (granulosa/Sertoli cell) type develop in mice as early as 4 weeks of age. Eventually, 100% of these mice will have either unilateral or bilateral tumors and die of a cancer cachexia-like syndrome due to the activin secreted from the tumors (26Coerver K. Woodruff T.K. Finegold M. Mather J. Bradley A. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 534-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon investigation, these tumors were found to bind inhibin specifically, and data are presented identifying tumor-derived inhibin receptor proteins. Recombinant human (rh)-inhibin A and rh-activin A were obtained from Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). The ligands were formulated in a buffer of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4. Recombinant human follistatin (288aa) was obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Distribution Program (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). rh-activin A and rh-inhibin A were iodinated by a modified lactoperoxidase method. Briefly, 5 μg of ligand was diluted in 0.4 m sodium acetate, pH 5.6, and 0.5 nmol of Na125I (0.5 nmol/mCi on calibration date), 0.5 IU of lactoperoxidase, and 0.25 nmol of H2O2 were added sequentially. The ligands were incubated at ambient temperature with intermittent vortexing for 5 min. The reaction was quenched with 450 μl of phosphate-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20 + 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Intergene, Purchase, NY). A 10-μl aliquot of the precolumn fraction was removed for trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Free iodine was removed using Sephadex G-10 column chromatography (PD-10, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The specific activity of the ligands was approximately 100 μCi/μg (range, 89–102 μCi/μg). To verify that the iodinated inhibin and activin used in these studies were active, ligands were assayed for bioactivity by perifusion of dispersed rat pituitary cells and quantitation of FSHβ mRNA (27Weiss J. Jameson J.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 265-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Both ligands retained full biological activity (data not shown). Moreover, activin was able to bind type RII receptor expressed in a rat pituitary cell line (αT3), indicating that this ligand would be able to bind its receptor in the eluate if it existed (data not shown). In situ ligand binding was performed as described previously using rat embryos collected on E13, E15, and E17 or control ovaries and gonadal tumors collected from inhibin α-subunit knockout mice (22Woodruff T.K. Krummen L.A. McCray G. Mather J.P. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Roberts V.J. Bentley C. Guo Q. Matzuk M.M. Woodruff T.K. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4201-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, 12-μm cryocut tissue sections were incubated for 3 h at room temperature in blocking buffer: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 (1:1), 20 mm HEPES, 0.05% cytochrome C, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.01 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% bacitracin, 0.4 μg/ml leupeptin. Slides were then incubated at room temperature overnight in the same buffer containing 40 pm125I-rh-inhibin A, 40 pm125I-rh-activin A or in the presence of 40 nmexcess homologous ligand (to define nonspecific background) or heterologous ligand (to define low affinity binding to heterologous ligands). The slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (two times for 10 min each); fixed in 3.7% formalin, 2% glutaraldehyde (10 min); rinsed in water (four times for 1 s each); and allowed to dry. Dry slides were exposed to autoradiographic film for 1–14 days. 20–25 grams of gonadal tumor tissue isolated from adult male and female inhibin α-subunit knockout mice were mechanically homogenized in 0.15 m NaCl plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin (10 μg/ml, serine protease inhibitor); EDTA-Na2 (0.5 mg/ml, metalloprotease inhibitor); leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml, serine and cysteine protease inhibitor), and pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml, aspartate protease inhibitor)). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g. The resultant cleared extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 85 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1% octyl β-glucoside, 30 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and insoluble membranes were discarded. Four separate isolations of protein were performed. An inhibin affinity column was prepared by coupling 5 mg of rh-inhibin A to AffiGel 10 (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's protocol. Coupling efficiency was >98%. Soluble membrane proteins were passed in series though a blank AffiGel-10 column (bed volume, 5 ml) and then over the rh-inhibin A-coupled column (bed volume, 5 ml). The eluate was reprocessed twice through the inhibin column. The column was washed extensively with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% octyl β-glucoside. After a stable baseline was reached, the column-bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0, 0.1% octyl β-glucoside and immediately neutralized with 3 mTris, pH 8.5. The column fractions were analyzed by chemical cross-linking and mobility on SDS-PAGE (26Coerver K. Woodruff T.K. Finegold M. Mather J. Bradley A. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 534-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100,000 cpm of biologically active iodinated inhibin or activin was added to equivalent aliquots of column fractions and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Disuccinimidyl suberate, dissolved in Me2SO (Pierce), was added to a final concentration of 500 μm and allowed to react with the bound complexes for 1 h at room temperature. The products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The successful identification of activin/TGFβ/BMP/MIS receptor subunits has proceeded based on degenerate oligonucleotide priming from the conserved serine-threonine kinase domain of the activin receptor subunit. Studies in our laboratory were initiated to identify a subunit receptor that bound inhibin and not activin using degenerate oligonucleotides against the conserved serine-threonine kinase domain in pituitary and inhibin α-subunit tumor tissue. No independent receptor isoform was identified using this approach (data not shown). Second, an expression library generated from rat ovaries was generated and screened for inhibin-binding proteins. No inhibin-specific binding proteins were identified using this methodology (data not shown). Ligand binding studies in ovary (22Woodruff T.K. Krummen L.A. McCray G. Mather J.P. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), testis (23Krummen L.A Moore A. Woodruff T.K. Covello R. Taylor R. Working P. Mather J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the developing embryo (Fig. 1) indicate that separate inhibin and activin binding sites exist in specific cellular groups. In the embryo, inhibin-specific binding sites are detected in the trigeminal ganglion and spinal ganglion. Because activin receptors and follistatin are also present near or coincident with the inhibin binding sites in ovary, testis, and the embryo, no attempt was made to purify the inhibin receptor from these source tissues (22Woodruff T.K. Krummen L.A. McCray G. Mather J.P. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Krummen L.A Moore A. Woodruff T.K. Covello R. Taylor R. Working P. Mather J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Roberts V.J. Bentley C. Guo Q. Matzuk M.M. Woodruff T.K. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4201-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These studies indicate, however, that several tissues or cellular groups have inhibin binding sites that are distinct from activin binding sites. Based on our in situ ligand binding studies, we hypothesized that gonadal tumor tissues arising from the genetic deletion of the inhibin α-subunit in mice would be a potential source of inhibin receptor. Gonadal tumors (both ovarian and testicular) were collected from adult inhibin α-subunit-deficient mice and embedded immediately on dry ice. Tumor tissues were processed to examine inhibin or activin binding sites using in situ ligand binding (Fig.2). The tumors had a mixed sex cord stromal phenotype, and all cells bound labeled ligands (Fig. 2, B(125I-inhibin A) and F (125I-activin A)). Addition of 1000-fold molar excess unlabeled inhibin A competed with the 125I-inhibin A (Fig. 2 C), and excess activin A competed with 125I-activin A (Fig.2 G). Inhibin and activin did not cross-compete with heterologous labeled ligand, indicating that the tissues have distinct inhibin and activin binding sites (Fig. 2, D and H). Sections of ovaries obtained from wild-type littermate animals had low level inhibin binding to antral granulosa cells (Fig.2 A) and higher levels of activin A binding to ovarian follicles (Fig. 2 E). The pattern and intensity of inhibin and activin binding in control mouse ovaries is identical to the binding pattern of the two ligands previously described in normal rat ovary (22Woodruff T.K. Krummen L.A. McCray G. Mather J.P. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because the tumor tissues appeared to be enriched for an inhibin binding moiety and had little activin binding (which we predicted would represent binding to follistatin, a cytoplasmic protein), ovarian and testicular tumor tissues were homogenized, and membrane proteins were isolated from multiple tumors. Protein was incubated with iodinated inhibin, cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate, and analyzed under nonreducing conditions on denaturing SDS-PAGE (Fig.3). In addition, iodinated inhibin formed complexes with proteins in both ovarian and testicular tumor extracts. Incubation of membrane extracts with 100-fold excess unlabeled rh-inhibin A reduced the inhibin binding in ovarian tumor extracts and competed efficiently for the binding in testicular tumor homogenates. Ovarian and testicular tumor homogenates were passed over an inhibin affinity column, resulting in an enrichment of proteins that bind inhibin. Ovarian and testicular tumor homogenates were combined from this experiment forward. To examine whether the proteins that could be isolated would bind specifically to inhibin, solubilized membrane protein from ovarian and testicular tumors was passed over the inhibin affinity column twice, the column was washed, and the protein that bound the immobilized inhibin was eluted using a low pH buffer. Fractions representing the eluted protein peak were neutralized with Tris, and aliquots were incubated with iodinated inhibin and iodinated activin. The proteins were cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). When incubated with fractions representing the protein peak eluted from the inhibin affinity column,125I-rh-inhibin A was specifically shifted upward in the chromatogram, whereas 125I-rh-activin A was not (Fig. 4,A and B, lanes 5–9). Four specific125I-rh-inhibin A complexes corresponding to sizes of 130, 116, 86, and 72 kDa were identified (Fig. 4 A, lane 7, a, b, c, and d, respectively). These proteins were identified in four independent experiments. However, attempts to microsequence the proteins were unsuccessful due to blocked N termini or lack of sufficient material. Internal sequence analysis was attempted in the cases of blocked N termini; however, no sequence data were generated due to the small amount of protein recovered in the purifications. To confirm that the proteins were receptors and did not include follistatin, two experiments were conducted. First, iodinated activin was used as a probe in a ligand binding blot to detect follistatin in the solubilized membrane protein fraction and in fractions isolated from the inhibin affinity column (Fig.5 A). Iodinated activin was used in this experiment because iodinated inhibin does not bind follistatin in this format (data not shown). Iodinated activin binds rh-follistatin in the positive control lane, yet it does not detect free follistatin in the total membrane protein fraction or in the column eluate fractions. This suggests that the homogenate and eluate are essentially devoid of free follistatin and indicates that the membrane preparation is likely free of cytoplasmic proteins. To determine whether membrane-bound proteoglycan-associated follistatin was present in the membrane or column fraction, an antibody against follistatin was used in an immunoblot analysis of isolated protein (Fig. 5 B). The antibody detected a high molecular weight protein in the membrane fraction but not in the column eluate. These data suggest that follistatin is membrane-associated but is not in a form capable of binding activin and indicate that the proteins eluted from the inhibin affinity column do not include follistatin. Inhibin is an gonad-derived dimeric protein hormone. The principle biological activity of inhibin is to suppress pituitary FSH secretion in a classic endocrine fashion (2Vale W.W Rivier C. Hsueh A. Campen C. Meunier H. Bicsak T. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1988; 44: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar, 29Woodruff T.K. Krummen L.A. Lyon R. Stocks D.L. Mather J.P.

It may also participate in ovarian follicle development and oocyte maturation (31Rivier C. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2463-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Alak B.M.

Reprod. 1997; 56: 1559-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Closely related to inhibin (α-β) is activin (β-β). Activin stimulates pituitary FSH synthesis and secretion in a dose-dependent manner and causes follicle atresia; however, it is synergistic with inhibin in stimulating oocyte maturation (2Vale W.W Rivier C. Hsueh A. Campen C. Meunier H. Bicsak T. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1988; 44: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar, 21Woodruff T.K. Lyon R.J. Hansen S.E. Rice G.C. Mather J.P.

Reprod. 1997; 56: 1559-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in ovarian and pituitary function, activin is known to regulate erythrodifferentiation (34Shao L. Frigon Jr., N.L. Young A.L. Yu A.L. Mathews L.S. Vaughan J. Vale W.W. Yu J. Blood. 1992; 79: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), promote neuronal survival (35Schubert D. Kimura H. LaCorbiere M. Vaughan J. Karr D. Fischer W.H. Nature. 1990; 344: 868-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and regulate mesoderm development in Xenopus and mouse embryos (36Johansson B.M. Wiles M.V.

Biol. 1995; 172: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Activin regulates these functions through a family of receptor kinases (38Attisano L. Carcamo J. Bentura F. Weis F. Massague J. Wrana J. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 39Massague J.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One subunit, the type RII(B) receptor, binds the ligand and then transphosphorylates a second type RI receptor. The ligand-RII-RI complex is a functional serine threonine kinase, the functional targets of which are the members of the Smad cytoplasmic protein family (41Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Although specific activin receptor subunits have been identified and cloned, efforts to isolate an inhibin receptor have not been successful. Numerous studies were done to identify an inhibin receptor. The inability to identify an inhibin receptor using oligonucleotides directed against conserved regions of known activin receptors suggests that the inhibin receptor may differ from the activin receptor subunits. Numerous in situ ligand binding studies were done using a wide variety of tissues to localize inhibin binding sites that could be indicative of novel inhibin function and a source of potential inhibin receptor. In the ovary, inhibin-specific binding sites are associated with the granulosa cell (22Woodruff T.K. Krummen L.A. McCray G. Mather J.P. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ovary is capable of producing inhibins, activins, and follistatins in response to pituitary gonadotropins and to local growth regulatory factors (42Woodruff T.K. D'Agostino J. Schwartz N.B. Mayo K.E. Science. 1988; 239: 1296-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Inhibin A and inhibin B are released from the ovary and regulate pituitary FSH in a traditional endocrine feedback manner (43Burger H.G. Hum. Reprod. 1993; 2: 129-132Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 44Woodruff T.K. Besecke L.M. Groome N. Draper L.B. Schwartz N.B. Weiss J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to endocrine regulations, the follicular granulosa cell, theca, cell and ooctye are able to respond to inhibin and to activin, and these effects can be modulated by the binding protein follistatin. Inhibin stimulates granulosa cell proliferation, theca cell androgen production, and ooctye maturation (21Woodruff T.K. Lyon R.J. Hansen S.E. Rice G.C. Mather J.P.

Each of these effects may be coordinated through an independent inhibin receptor. In the testis, inhibin-specific binding sites are present on interstitial cells that are also positive for 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, suggesting that these cells are the steroidally active Leydig cells (23Krummen L.A Moore A. Woodruff T.K. Covello R. Taylor R. Working P. Mather J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In experiments described in this paper, we identified inhibin binding sites in the trigeminal ganglion and spinal ganglion of the developing rat embryo. The ability of inhibin to act on these sites requires that the ligand be present. Inhibin α-subunit mRNA is expressed in the somites of the embryonic rat on E12, in the dorsal root ganglion from E12 to E20 (47Roberts V.J. Barth S.L. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and in the somites of the 10.5 day mouse embryo (48.Grieger, D. M., Grewal, R., Meunier, H., Program of the 75th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, 1993, 298, Las Vegas, NV.Google Scholar); immunoreactive α-subunit protein is localized in the somites of chick embryos (49Blauer M. Kohonen J. Leivonen I. Vilja P. Tuohimaa P. Development. 1992; 115: 1079-1086PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, both inhibin α- and β-subunit mRNAs are detected in different stages of the early mouse embryo and in embryonic stem and embryonic carcinoma cells that model early murine fetal development (50Albano R.M. Groome N. Smith J.C. Development. 1993; 117: 711-723PubMed Google Scholar, 51Van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Feijen A. Lawson K.A. Mummery C.L. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Likewise, human pre-embryos have been shown to secrete immunoreactive α-subunit protein (52Phocas I. Sarandakou A. Rizos D. Dimitriadou F. Mantzavinos T. Zourlas P.A. Hum. Reprod. 1992; 7: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, the developing embryo likely produces inhibin in restricted cellular sites, and this inhibin may have effects specifically on cellular loci such as the trigeminal ganglion and spinal ganglia, where inhibin-specific binding sites have been localized. Further analysis will be required to delineate the specific effect(s) of inhibin (and activin) on these cellular sites. A powerful model system to delineate the physiological relevance of inhibin and activins is the genetic deletion of subunit genes through homologous recombination (the knockout mouse model). A series of animals deficient in the α- or β-subunits, in the receptors for activin, and in the activin/inhibin-binding protein, follistatin, have been generated (24Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Su J.-G.

Commun. 1994; 203: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and, as shown herein, the tumors bound iodinated inhibin A preferentially. Upon identification of the ovarian tumors as a tissue source of a potential inhibin receptor, we initiated studies to purify the protein using classical affinity chromatography methods. Four inhibin-binding proteins were partially purified. The receptor proteins were identified by cross-linking labeled ligand to putative receptor and examining the retardation of the complex on SDS-PAGE. Our inability to sequence the N terminus of the proteins isolated by affinity purification means that we can only speculate on the relationship between the proteins that bind iodinated inhibin. The two smaller proteins (complexes of 86 and 72 kDa) may be proteolytic cleavage products of the larger proteins. A broad spectrum mixture of protease inhibitors was used throughout the purification procedure; however, degradation of the larger proteins is a possibility. Alternatively, the larger molecular weight shifts may represent complexes of the smaller proteins with the iodinated inhibin. A third possibility is that several classes of inhibin receptor proteins exist in the tumor tissues. For example, inhibin may bind a yet-unidentified type II receptor, may bind and activate a type RI receptor, may have a structurally dissimilar receptor, or may use an adapter protein, such as type RIII receptor, to act in concert (or competition) with activin type RII or RI receptors. The existence of an inhibin-specific receptor and competition with the activin receptor are not mutually exclusive conclusions. Indeed, an inhibin-specific protein band has been identified in the context of activin type RII and RI receptors in human erythroid precursor cells (16Lebrun J.J. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Whether the protein identified in the K562 cell system is similar to one of the proteins identified in this study remains to be clarified. Indeed, the complete elucidation of the functional relationship between inhibin and activin receptors awaits the cloning of the inhibin receptor. The fact that the inhibin receptor can be clearly identified in the knockout mouse tumor tissue is significant. It is known that one of the phenotypes of these tumors is low expression of type RII receptor, likely due to down-regulation by activin (24Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Su J.-G. Hsueh A.J.W. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 360: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 25Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Mather J.P. Krummen L.A. Lu H. Bradley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1994; 203: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, the inhibin receptor may be up-regulated by persistent activin or by the lack of negative feedback of inhibin. Clearly, additional studies are necessary to determine what role, if any, activin and inhibin have in tumorigenesis and whether an inhibin receptor is expressed in human epithelial ovarian tumors. In summary, inhibin binding moieties were found to be abundant in gonadal tumors that arise from the genetic elimination of the α-subunit of inhibin. Four inhibin-binding proteins were purified by inhibin affinity chromatography from these tumors. Finally, the proteins eluted from the inhibin column were found to be distinct receptor proteins and not follistatin. Further work will be required to clone and characterize the inhibin receptor-generated proteins identified by affinity column purification; however, the results presented in this study represent an important first step toward the elucidation of the inhibin receptor and signal transduction system.

(1995)Genomics 27, 457–466) encodes a polypeptide belonging to the hydratase/isomerase superfamily. We modeled the structure of rECH1 based on rat mitochondrial 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1. The model predicts that rECH1p has the hydratase fold in the core domain and two domains for interaction with other subunits. When we incubated 3,5,8,11,14-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA with purified rECH1p, the spectral data suggested a switching of the double bonds from the Δ3-Δ5 to the Δ2-Δ4 positions. This was confirmed by demonstrating that the product was a valid substrate for 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. These results indicate that rECH1p is Δ3,5-Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies to a synthetic polypeptide derived from the C terminus of rECH1p showed that rECH1p is located in the matrix of both mitochondria and peroxisomes in rat liver. Consistent with these observations, the 36,000-Da rECH1p has a potential N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal as well as a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal type 1. Transport of the protein into the mitochondria with cleavage of the targeting signal results in a mature mitochondrial form with a molecular mass of 32,000 Da; transport to peroxisomes yields a protein of 36,000 Da. rECH1, a recently identified rat cDNA (FitzPatrick, D.

Transport of the protein into the mitochondria with cleavage of the targeting signal results in a mature mitochondrial form with a molecular mass of 32,000 Da; transport to peroxisomes yields a protein of 36,000 Da. An increasing body of evidence indicates that the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids can occur in both mitochondria and in peroxisomes (1Hiltunen J.K. Filppula S.A. Koivuranta K.T. Siivari K.M. Qin Y. Häyrinen H.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unsaturated fatty acids, which have only a few double bonds and not very long carbon chains, are effectively degraded by mitochondrial β-oxidation. Conversely, very long chain (poly)unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives, some of which are inhibitors of mitochondrial β-oxidation, undergo rapid chain shortening in mammalian peroxisomes with the probable exception of fatty enoyl-CoA esters that have Δ5 double bonds (2Hovik R. Osmundsen H. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since trans-2-enoyl-CoA is the only unsaturated intermediate in both peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation and since the double bonds of natural unsaturated fatty acids are mostly in thecis configuration at either odd- or even-numbered positions, auxiliary enzymes are required to link them to the β-oxidation pathway. These auxiliary activities include 2,4-enoyl-CoA reductase (EC1.3.1.34), Δ3-Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC5.3.3.8), and Δ3,5-Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. In mammalian tissues two mitochondrial and one peroxisomal isoform of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase have been described (3Dommes V. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol.

The peroxisomal form is an integral part of the peroxisomal multifunctional hydratase/dehydrogenase enzyme type 1 (MFE1). 1The abbreviations used are: MFE1, multifunctional hydratase/dehydrogenase enzyme type 1; rECH1, rat enoyl-CoA hydratase; rECH1p, rECH1 protein; PBS, phosophate-buffered saline; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. Δ3,5-Δ2,4-Dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity has been detected both in mitochondria and peroxisomes in rat liver, and several of these enzymes have been purified (11Chen L.-S. Jin S.-J. Tserng K.-Y.

Genomics. 1995; 27: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) recently isolated a peroxisome proliferator-induced rat liver cDNA that encodes a novel member of the hydratase/isomerase protein family with a type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL) at its C terminus. The gene was named rat enoyl-CoA hydratase (rECH1), referring to its possible activity. Here we show that the rECH1 protein (rECH1p) actually is a Δ3,5-Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase participating in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds at the Δ5 position. This is the first characterization of a dienoyl-CoA isomerase at the molecular level. We collected amino acid sequences related to rECH1p from data bases by using Blast (16Altschul S.F. Gish W.

The sequence alignment was performed with the GCG (28Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) and Clustal W program packages. The final alignment was performed using information from multiple sequence alignments and secondary structural information from the three-dimensional structures. The model was built with the program Insight II (Biosym Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA). A side chain rotamer library was used to model amino acid substitutions. Deletions and insertions were modeled by searching a data base of high resolution structures. The search was performed for fragments of the required length and end point separation by using two residues at each end of the loop as anchor points. The fragments obtained were evaluated on the basis of three criteria: root mean square deviation from the anchor points, sequence similarity, and interference with the core region. There were three insertions and no deletions with respect to hydratase 1. The model was refined by energy minimization with the program Discover using Amber force field in a step-wise manner. First, hydrogen atoms were relaxed, then the borders of insertions and deletions were harmonically restrained, and the rest of the molecule was fixed. In the next step, the borders of insertions and deletions and the Cα atoms of the conserved regions and finally only the Cα atoms of the conserved regions were harmonically constrained. We immunized rabbits with a synthetic peptide (CAMEKKDSKSITFSKL-COOH) from the C-terminal end of rECH1p. An N-terminal cysteine residue was added to link the peptide to Imject maleimide-activated ovalbumin (Pierce). We also raised rabbit antibodies against porcine fumarase (EC 4.2.1.2) (Boehringer Mannheim) purified by reverse phase chromatography on a microreverse phase column C2/C18 PC 3.2/3 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The IgG fraction from these antisera was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation to a saturation of 45% followed by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 high resolution 10/30 column (Pharmacia) in equilibrium with 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm potassium phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4, (PBS) containing 0.02% sodium azide.

Antibodies against the rat catalase were a gift from Dr. Stefan Alexson (Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden). The use of animals for immunization was approved by the university committee on animal experimentation. We utilized rECH1 cDNA in Bluescript KS− (15FitzPatrick D.R. Germain-Lee E. Valle D. Genomics. 1995; 27: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as a template for polymerase chain reaction amplification. The forward primer (5′-GACATATGGCATACGAGTCTATTCAAGTAACATCTGC) corresponds to nucleotides 170–196 with an additional 11 5′ nucleotides providing anNdeI restriction site, an ATG initiation methionine codon, and a GCA (alanine) codon. 3′ of this, the sequence continues with TAC encoding Tyr-54 of the full-length protein. The reverse primer (5′-CAGGATCCCACTCAGAGCTTGGAGAAGGTGAT) corresponds to nucleotides 974–997 and contains an additional BamHI restriction site on its 5′ end. We cloned the amplified polymerase chain reaction fragment into pUC 18 plasmid with the Sure Clone ligation kit (Pharmacia). After digestion with NdeI and BamHI, the cDNA was ligated into a pET 3a expression vector (30Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed in the BL21(DE3)LysS E. coli strain using a pET expression system (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer instructions. Induction was carried out for 3 h at 35 °C, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and suspended in 0.01 volume of the same buffer. The cells were lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 °C. RNase, DNase, and lysozyme were added to final concentrations of 2, 20, and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and the mixture was incubated at 35 °C for 45 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 15 min, and the supernatant was used for further experiments. Rat liver was homogenized in 0.25m sucrose, 0.1% (v/v) ethanol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, and fractionated by differential centrifugation into nuclear, heavy mitochondrial, light mitochondrial, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions as described by Verheyden et al. (31Verheyden K. Fransen U. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes were purified from the light mitochondrial fraction by centrifugation in a Nycodenz step gradient as described by Vanhove et al.(32Vanhove G. Van Veldhoven P.P. Vanhouette F.

Mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation in a self-generating Percoll gradient (33Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thirty μg of crude homogenate and 10 μg of mitochondrial and peroxisomal fractions were separated in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter. Filters were used for immunodetection with a secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Fourteen ml of the lysate containing 52 mg of soluble proteins was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 11 cm) in equilibrium with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 100 mm NaCl. The flow-through fraction containing rECH1p was dialyzed against 3 × 500 ml of 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, and applied to a 1-ml Resource S column (Pharmacia) in equilibrium with the same buffer. The bound rECH1p was eluted with a linear 20-ml gradient from 0 to 0.3 m NaCl in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0. During the purification procedure, the elution of rECH1p was detected by dot-blotting aliquots of fractions on a nitrocellulose filter and immunolabeling with anti-rECH1. The native molecular weight of rECH1p (20 μg) was determined by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 high resolution 10/30 column (Pharmacia) in 200 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA. Δ3-Δ2-Enoyl-CoA isomerase and 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (EC 4.2.1.17) activities were assayed as described by Palosaari and Hiltunen (10Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol.

Substrate concentrations of 60 μmwere used for activity measurements. For the activity measurement of Δ3,5-Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, the substrate was generated by incubating 0.2 unit of yeast acyl-CoA oxidase (Sigma) with 60 μm of arachidonoyl-CoA in 1 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate, 3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 23 °C for 10 min. Because the yeast acyl-CoA oxidase has intrinsic Δ3-Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity (11Chen L.-S. Jin S.-J. Tserng K.-Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10527-10534Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), 3,5,8,11,14-eicosapentenoyl-CoA accumulated in the reaction, as indicated by the increase of absorbance at 240 nm, and thus the addition of Δ3-Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase was dispensable. The dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity was monitored by following the appearance of a conjugated Δ2-Δ4 double bond at 300 nm (35Hiltunen J.K. Osmundsen H. Bremer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An extinction coefficient of 27,800 m−1cm−1 for trans-2,4-dienoyl-CoA was used for the calculations (36Yang S.Y. Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12238-12243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase purified fromCandida tropicalis was kindly provided by Kari Koivuranta, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland. Livers were harvested from control and clofibrate-treated (fed with 0.5% (w/w) clofibrate-supplemented chow for two weeks) Sprague-Dawley rats after vascular perfusion fixation. For this procedure, the rats were heparinized (15 units of heparin/g of body weight), euthanized, and perfused through the left ventricle and ascending aorta at a hydrostatic pressure of 120 cm (37Mendis-Handagama S.M. Zirkin B.R. Scallen T.J. Ewing L.L. J. Androl. 1990; 11: 270-278PubMed Google Scholar) for 2 min with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A prefixative solution containing 8% paraformaldehyde and 20 mm ethylacetimidate in PBS was then administered for 3 min. After this, the main fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS was infused for 15 min. Ethylacetimidate was included in the prefixative solution for its described capacity for maintaining antigen accessibility and preservation of antigenicity (38Tokuyasu K.T. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 894-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). After perfusion fixation, 1–2-mm blocks of liver were further fixed for 2 h at room temperature by immersion in the same fixative solution. Finally the tissue blocks were washed three times in 7.5% (w/v) sucrose in PBS, where they were kept at 4 °C until processed. For thin sections, tissues were embedded in Micro-Bed resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) according to manufacturer instructions, except that the tissues were infiltrated from 70% ethanol instead of completion of the dehydration protocol. The resin was polymerized at 4 °C under UV light (365 nm) for 60 h. For immunogold labeling, grids were incubated for 5 min with 50 mm glycine in PBS and for 15 min in blocking medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% fish skin gelatin in PBS (PBS-BSA-FSG). Primary labeling of the sections was made by incubating the grids for 2 h at room temperature with the primary antibody. Similar grids were incubated with the IgG fraction of rabbit serum containing antibodies to the rat peroxisomal peroxisomal MFE1 and mitochondrial Δ2-Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase as quality controls of the specificity of labeling. The grids were washed in PBS followed by incubation for 1 h with protein A-gold, 20 nm (for rECH1p test sections) or 10 nm (for specificity controls) diluted 1:30 in PBS-BSA-FSG-0.1% Tween 20. The grids were then washed in 500-μl drops of PBS containing 250 mm NaCl. The antigen-antibody complexes were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, and grids were finally washed in distilled water and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sequence identity between rECH1p and enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 is modest (25%), but the residues and elements that are functionally and structurally important in hydratase 1 are conserved (Fig.1) (25Engel C.K. Mathieu M. Zeelen J.P. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We modeled the rECH1p structure using the coordinates of hydratase 1 as a template. The alignment of rECH1 with the mature form of hydratase 1 (starting at Gly-30) (39Minami-Ishii N. Taketani S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) shows 48 additional N-terminal amino acid residues, three insertions, and three amino acid residues in the C terminus (SKL). The C-terminal extension could not be modeled. Regions containing a single amino acid residue insertion appear in the beginning and in the end of the trimerization domain 1, but the insertions do not affect the general scaffolding of the protein. There is a large insertion in the helical portion of the second part of the hydratase spiral (Fig.2). This section was modeled as an extended α-helix based on structural requirements and sequence analysis. The corresponding region in hydratase 1 has a flexible loop, which might indicate allowance of greater variability in this region. Insertions were modeled using a library of loops generated with the Insight II program from known high resolution three-dimensional structures in the Protein Data Bank. The loop library was scanned for structural elements giving the best matches with the predicted secondary structure element in the inserted region after positioning the insert in the model. The final model has a typical globular structure according to several structural tests (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 25: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).Figure 2Structural model of one subunit of rECH1. The modeling was carried out based on the published structure of hydratase 1, and energy minimization was done with the program Discover as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Panel A, green color indicates the core elements forming the hydratase fold, yellow indicates the trimerization domain 1, and the red color indicates trimerization domain 2. The N-terminal portion from Tyr-54 to His-65 and the helix connecting trimerization domains are marked withpurple. Panel B, blue color indicates the predicted β-sheets, red indicates α-helixes,purple indicates loops and coils, and insertions as compared with hydratase 1 are marked with green.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All the secondary structural elements forming the fold in enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 are conserved in rECH1p, and the insertions appear outside the central core of the enzyme. Especially Glu-144 and Glu-164, which are proposed to participate in the catalysis in hydratase 1, are also conserved in rECH1p (Asp-127 and Glu-147), with the exception that Glu-144 of hydratase 1 was replaced by Asp in rECH1p. The trimerization domains 1 and 2 of hydratase 1, which are involved in subunit interactions (25Engel C.K. Mathieu M. Zeelen J.P. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) are also conserved in rECH1p and do not contain insertions or deletions. We speculate, therefore, that like hydratase 1, rECH1p has a trimeric structural unit(s). The mature hydratase 1 is composed of dimers of two trimers forming a monohexameric enzyme. We expressed rECH1p inE. coli as an N-terminal-truncated version beginning at Tyr-54. An additional N-terminal Met-Ala sequence was contributed by the 5′ primer. The truncation site was chosen based on the following observations. The amino acid sequence similarity of rECH1p with the mature rat mitochondrial enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (39Minami-Ishii N. Taketani S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar),Pseudomonas sp. 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase (41Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H.

https://openalex.org/W2036190797,"In the present study we investigated the mechanism of inhibitory action of sphingosine (SP) on voltage-activated calcium channels (VOCCs) in pituitary GH4C1 cells. Using the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell mode, we show that SP inhibits Ba2+ currents (I Ba) when 0.1 mm BAPTA is included in the patch pipette. However, when the BAPTA concentration was raised to 1–10 mm, SP was without a significant effect. The effect of SP was apparently not mediated via a kinase, as it was not inhibited by staurosporine. By using the double-pulse protocol (to release possible functional inhibition of the VOCCs by G proteins), we observed that G proteins apparently evoked very little functional inhibition of the VOCCs. Furthermore, including GDPβS (guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate) in the patch pipette did not alter the inhibitory effect of SP on the Ba2+ current, suggesting that SP did not modulate the VOCCs via a G protein-dependent pathway. Single-channel experiments with SP in the pipette, and experiments with excised outside-out patches, suggested that SP directly inhibited VOCCs. The main mechanism of action was a dose-dependent prolongation of the closed time of the channels. The results thus show that SP is a potent inhibitor of VOCCs in GH4C1 cells, and that calcium may be a cofactor in this inhibition.

Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), as well as activators of proliferation (2Zangh H. Buckley N.E. Gibson K. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 299: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in many cell types. A role for sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate as possible second messengers has been postulated (9Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 10Choi O.H. Kim J.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). An interesting observation made recently is that sphingosines regulate the gating of a novel type of calcium channel located in membranes of intracellular calcium stores in endothelial cells (11Kim S. Lakhani V. Costa D.J. Sharara A.I. Fitz J.G. Huang L.-W. Peters K.G. Kindman L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5266-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sphingosines inhibit calcium entry through voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) in cardiac cells (12McDonough P.M. Yasui K. Betto R. Salvati G. Glembotski C.C. Palade P.T. Sabbadini R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 981-989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and capacitative calcium entry in Jurkat T cells (13Breittmayer J.-P. Bernard A. Aussel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5054-5058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An inhibitory effect of sphingosines on depolarization-evoked calcium entry has also been observed in synaptosomes (14Sitges M. Talamo B.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brain microsomes, the sphingosine derivative sphingosine phosphorylcholine stimulated calcium release via the ryanodine receptor (15Dettbarn C. Betto R. Salvati G. Sabbadini R. Palade P. Brain Res. 1995; 669: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas sphingosine blocked activation of the ryanodine receptor in cardiac cells (16Dettbarn C.A. Betto R. Salviati G. Palade P. Jenkins G.M. Sabbadini R.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 229-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Another interesting observation is that SP inhibits sustained, VOCC-dependent calcium gradients in hippocampal neurons after stimulation with either glutamate or N-methyl-d-aspartate (17Connor J.A. Wadman W.J. Hockberger P.E. Wong R.K.S. Science. 1988; 240: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This SP-evoked inhibition was attributed to inhibition of PKC, but in the light of recent observations, it may be the result of SP-evoked blockade of VOCCs. Thus, SPs appear to be potent regulators of calcium signaling. However, the mechanisms involved are not yet known. In pituitary cells, changes in intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+] i ) are of crucial importance for the regulation of hormone synthesis and secretion (18White B.A. Bauerle L.R. Bancroft F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5942-5945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Day R.N. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The increase in [Ca2+] i may be the result of agonist-evoked activation of phospholipase C and the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and the concomitant release of sequestered calcium (20Gershengorn M.C. Thaw C. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Rebecchi M.J. Gershengorn M.C. Biochem.

Agonist-evoked activation of phospholipase C also results in the activation of VOCCs (23Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15350-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5827-5832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Suzuki N.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In pituitary cells, the L- and the T-type VOCCs have been identified (27Armstrong C.M. Matteson D.R. Science. 1985; 227: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 28Matteson D.R. Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 87: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In particular, L-type VOCCs are considered important for the stimulation of hormone synthesis and secretion (23Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15350-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol.

Chiavaroli C. Schlegel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25158-25164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulating GH3 pituitary cells with diacylglycerols activates sphingomyelinase, resulting in the production of sphingosine and ceramides (32Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol.

In a recent study, we observed that SPs potently inhibited calcium entry via VOCCs in GH4C1 pituitary cells (34Törnquist K. Pasternack M. Kaila K.

In GH4C1cells, PKC is assumed to participate in the regulation of VOCCs (20Gershengorn M.C. Thaw C. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,23Albert P.R.

In the present study, we have investigated the mechanisms of action of SP on VOCCs in GH4C1 cells. Using whole-cell, single-channel, and outside-out patch-clamp methods, we show that SP inhibits the gating of VOCCs in GH4C1 cells. This mechanism may, in part, be dependent on intracellular calcium. Fura 2-AM was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Sphingosine, staurosporine, GTPγS, GDPβS, and tetrodotoxin were acquired from Sigma. Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture was from Life Technologies, Inc., and serum was from Biological Industries (Beth Haemek, Israel). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Culture dishes were obtained from Falcon Plastics (Oxnard, CA). [3H]PN 200-110 (81 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). Clonal rat pituitary GH4C1 cells were generously given by Dr. Armen H. Tashjian, Jr. (Harvard University, Boston, MA). The cells were grown in monolayer culture in Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture with 15% (v/v) horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Ham's F-10+ medium) in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C, as described previously (39Tashjian Jr., A.H. Yasumura Y. Levine L. Sato G.H. Parker M.L. Endocrinology. 1968; 82: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 40Tashjian Jr., A.H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Before an experiment, the cells from a single donor culture were harvested with 0.02% EDTA solution and subcultured in 35-mm or 100-mm culture dishes for 7–9 days. For the patch-clamp experiments, the cells were grown on coverslips in 35-mm dishes. The cells were fed with Ham's F-10+ medium every 2–3 days. The studies were performed using the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell mode, in the cell-attached mode, and in the excised outside-out mode (41Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakman B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). The electrodes were made from GC150TF glass micropipettes (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Reading, United Kingdom). In the whole-cell experiments, the electrodes had a resistance of about 4–5 MΩ when filled with Hepes-buffered salt solution (HBSS-II buffer, containing (in mm): CsCl, 120; MgCl2, 5; Mg-ATP, 2; BAPTA, 0.1–10; glucose, 10; Hepes, 20 (pH 7.15), adjusted with CsOH). Leak and capacitative currents in the whole-cell recordings were compensated by the P/4 routine from a holding potential of −90 mV. The access resistance was 7–15 MΩ. No series resistance compensation was made. Before an experiment, the coverslips were attached to a perfusion chamber (volume approximately 300 μl), and the cells were extensively perfused with HBSS-I (containing (in mm): BaCl2, 60; TEA-Cl, 75; glucose, 10; Hepes, 10 (pH 7.2), adjusted with TEA-OH) or sphingosine using a peristaltic pump (ISMATEC®) at 1.5 ml/min. Sphingosine was applied by switching the channel of the pump. The recordings were made with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) at room temperature. The current signals were filtered at 2.3 kHz, sampled at 2 kHz, and stored on an Atari Mega/Ste computer. The cells were held at −70 mV with test pulses to −20 mV and +10 mV made throughout the experiment to avoid additional rundown of the channels. For the calculations, we used data derived from pulses to +10 mV. A stock solution of sphingosine (10 mm) was made in ethanol. The final concentration of the solvent did not exceed 0.2%. This concentration of the solvent did not have any effects on VOCCs in GH4C1 cells. To calculate the half-inactivation time (IT 50),i.e. defined as the 50% run-down of the initial steady current, a logistic equation was used, where t is the time from rupturing the cell membrane, b is the slope, and d is the residual current after full inactivation (Equation1). I/Imax=11+tIT50b+dEquation 1 This normalization of the results, where the steady state current before application of test compound was considered 100%, was made to make a comparison between different measurements feasible. In the cell-attached single-channel recordings, the cells were bathed in a high potassium HBSS-III buffer (containing (in mm): KCl, 140; MgCl2, 1.13; glucose, 10; HEPES, 10 (pH 7.2), adjusted with KOH) to abolish the membrane potential. In these experiments, the pipettes were filled with HBSS-IV buffer (containing (in mm): BaCl2, 110; TEA-Cl, 10; HEPES, 10 (pH 7.2), adjusted with TEA-OH), and had a resistance of 15–20 MΩ. Leak and capacitive currents in the single-channel experiments were subtracted and compensated for in all recordings. Data analysis was made using the pCLAMP6 program (Axon Instruments). The external solution used for the excised outside-out patch recordings was HBSS-I. The internal pipette solution in these experiments was HBSS-II lacking BAPTA but containing 4 mm CaCl2and 10 mm EGTA to give a free calcium concentration of 100 nm. This resting calcium concentration was chosen because of the apparent calcium-dependent effects of sphingosine observed in the whole-cell and cell-attached experiments. Thick-walled glass pipettes were used, which had a resistance of 9.5–11.5 MΩ. The outside-out patches were obtained using standard techniques (41Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakman B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). Patches with a resistance less than 5 GΩ were rejected from the experiments. Usually, the patches had a resistance higher than 20 GΩ. The excised patches were clamped at −50 mV to obtain more stable patches than those obtained at −70 mV, with test pulses to −10 mV and +10 mV. The current signals were sampled at 5 kHz, and filtered at 1 kHz using an Axoclamp-1A amplifier and Clampex software (Axon Instruments). After the sampling, no additional digital filtering was used. Data analysis was made using pClamp 6 software and Microcal Origin software. In a recent study, we showed that sphingosine derivatives inhibit the activation of VOCCs in GH4C1 cells, but the mechanism remained unclear (34Törnquist K. Pasternack M. Kaila K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using the whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp technique, we now found that 10 μm SP potently suppressed the current amplitude without any profound shift in the current-voltage relationship, suggesting that there is no voltage dependence of the inhibition (Fig. 1). VOCCs are prone to inhibition via a calcium-dependent mechanism (see Ref. 42Imredy J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1301-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether SP could modulate VOCCs via this mechanism, different concentrations of BAPTA were included in the pipette solution. With 0.1 mm BAPTA in the pipette solution, SP rapidly inhibited I Ba (Fig. 1). In control cells, the half-time value (IT 50) for the rundown was 267 ± 42 s, whereas in the presence of 10 μm SP, IT 50 was 143 ± 8 s (p < 0.05). However, when the pipette solution contained 1 mm or 10 mm BAPTA, the run-down in the presence of SP proceeded at a rate equal to that observed in control cells (Fig. 2). This result suggests that the inhibitory effect of SP on the VOCCs is mediated via a calcium-dependent mechanism.Figure 2BAPTA attenuates the inhibitory effect of SP on VOCCs in whole-cell recordings. Time course of the run-down of normalized individual currents (I/I max) measured at the end of a 200-ms depolarizing pulse, where I max is the maximal current measured immediately prior to addition of test compound, and I the current measured at time points after addition of test compound. The cells were held at −70 mV and then step depolarizations to +10 mV were made. In these experiments, the patch pipette contained 0.1 mm (A1 and B1) or 1 mm (A2 and B2) BAPTA. Control cells (A1 and A2), and cells perfused with 10 μm SP (B1 and B2). Thecrossed lines indicate the calculated time where the current was decreased by 50% (IT 50, see Equation 1under “Experimental Procedures”). In A1 and B1, the data shown are from 5 separate cells, and inA2 and B2 from 7 separate cells each.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In some studies, BAPTA has been shown to act as a kinase inhibitor (43Dieter P. Fiztke E. Duyster J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1993; 374: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To test whether the effect of SP was mediated via activation of protein kinases, the cells were treated with 200 nmstaurosporine. Following a 15-min pretreatment of the cells with staurosporine, SP still (in the continuous presence of staurosporine) inhibited I Ba in a manner similar to that observed in control cells (in these experiments, theIT 50 value was 149 ± 36 s,n = 3; p < 0.05). It is well known that G proteins may have a constitutive inhibitory effect on VOCCs, and that agonist-evoked inhibition of VOCCs may be mediated via a G protein-dependent mechanism (see Ref. 44Hille B. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 531-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). However, in GH4C1 cells, G proteins seem to have a very modest effect on the VOCCs, as evaluated using the double-pulse protocol (to release the possible functional inhibition of Ca2+ channels by G protein (45Schwartz K. Neuron. 1993; 11: 305-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); Fig.3). In these experiments, we could not detect any difference in I Ba. Addition of 2 mm GDPβS (to inhibit G protein activation) to the pipette solution had no observable effects on the inhibitory action of SP on the calcium channel current. In these experiments, theIT 50 value was 87 ± 14 s (n = 4; p < 0.05, Fig. 3). Taken together, the above results exclude G proteins as the mediators of the observed SP-evoked inhibition of the VOCCs. To test whether SP has a direct effect on the VOCCs, single-channel analyses using the cell-attached mode of the patch clamp technique were performed with SP in the pipette solution. SP rapidly inhibited the Ba2+current (Fig. 4), suggesting a direct effect of SP on the VOCCs. An analysis of the kinetic characteristics of the single channels showed that SP inhibited the VOCCs mainly by increasing the closed time of the channels (Fig.5 and TableI). For the control cells, two conductance states were found. Using 3 μm and higher concentrations of SP, only one conductance amplitude could usually be detected. The values of the single-channel dwell times and amplitudes are summarized in Table I. When the pipette solution contained 10 μm SP, no openings of the VOCCs were observed in 7 out of 9 cells.Figure 5Effect of sphingosine on amplitude histograms and dwell times in single-channel recordings in GH4C1 cells. The left panelsdepict the results obtained with a control cell, and the right panels recordings with 5 μm SP in the pipette. The results are from two separate cells. A, unitary currents. ByF-comparison, a two-unitary current model was chosen for the best fit of the experimental data. For the control cell, the currents are 0.417 and 0.575 pA, and for the SP-treated cell 0.544 and 0.672 pA.B, closed time probability histogram. Two closed states were selected for the best fit of the data by F-comparison. The closed times are 0.334 and 3.215 ms for the control cell, and 0.509 and 11.283 ms for the SP-treated cell. C, open time histogram. A single open state was found.

Open table in a new tab To exclude an effect of cytosolic factors, we tested the action of sphingosine on excised outside-out patches. In these experiments, the free Ca2+ concentration was buffered to 100 nm. This Ca2+ concentration is below the resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which in our GH4C1 cells was 204 ± 15 nm(mean ± S.E., n = 6) as determined with Fura 2. After depolarization of the patch membrane to −10 mV, frequent openings of one or, rarely, two Ca2+ channels were observed (Fig. 6). We observed a substantial run-down of the channels during the first 5 min of the recording. Thus, sphingosine was usually applied within 1 min of the recordings. The calculated dwell times of the channels and their amplitudes (TableII) were quite similar to those obtained in the cell-attached recordings, suggesting that the functional properties of Ca2+ channels were well preserved in the outside-out recordings. Interestingly, in the outside-out configuration, we observed a second long-lasting open state of the Ca2+ channels, which was not observed in cell-attached recordings (Table II and Fig. 6). Presently, we do not have an explanation for this observation.Table IICharacterization of the amplitudes and kinetics of single VOCCs in outside-out patchesAmplitudeClosed timeOpen timeA1A2τ1τ2τ1τ2pAmsms0.82 ± 0.050.58 ± 0.041.09 ± 0.098.6 ± 1.60.38 ± 0.032.7 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab Application of 10 μm sphingosine led to a dramatic decrease in the open probability of the channels (Fig.7). In 7 out of 8 cells, a complete inhibition of the channel activity was observed within 1 min after application of sphingosine. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of SP on VOCCs in GH4C1 cells. Our results suggest that SP inhibits the VOCC-mediated current by prolonging the closed state of the channels, apparently in a calcium-dependent manner. Our present study is the first to show such properties of SP. An important kind of modulation of VOCCs occurs via G protein-mediated mechanisms. In some cell types, the effects of SP derivatives have been shown to be in part mediated by a G protein (8Törnquist K. Ekokoski E. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 46Goodemote K.A. Mattie M.E. Berger A. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26332-26340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several recent reports strongly suggest the existence of membrane receptors for SP derivatives, and this putative receptor appears to be coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (48Van Koppen C.J. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Zhang C. Laser K.T. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 956-961PubMed Google Scholar, 49van Koppen C.J. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Laser K.T. Zhang C. Jakobs K.H. Bünemann M.

Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5527-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, by using several manipulations known to affect G protein-dependent mechanisms (i.e. the double-pulse protocol to release the possible functional inhibition of Ca2+ channels by G protein (45Schwartz K. Neuron. 1993; 11: 305-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and by including GDPβS in the pipette solution), we could not influence the action of SP. Thus, an effect of SP mediated via a G protein seems unlikely in the present work. Sphingosine derivatives have been reported to inhibit the release of sequestered calcium in excitable cells (Refs. 16Dettbarn C.A. Betto R. Salviati G. Palade P. Jenkins G.M. Sabbadini R.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 229-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and 51Sabbadini R.A. Betto R. Teresi A. Fachechi-Cassano G. Salviati G. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 1995; 669: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have been unable to detect an SP-evoked increase in [Ca2+] i in intact GH4C1cells using Fura 2 (34Törnquist K. Pasternack M. Kaila K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); thus, we think it unlikely that SP could inhibit the channels through the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Nevertheless, our study showed that in the presence of strong intracellular Ca2+ buffering (achieved by including 1–10 mm BAPTA in the pipette solution), the effect of SP was abolished. This result suggests, but does not prove, that calcium is necessary for the SP-evoked inhibition of VOCCs. In control cells, the concentration of BAPTA in the pipette did not affect the IT 50 value of the run-down of the VOCCs. Another possibility is that BAPTA inhibited a kinase in our cells, as recent studies have indicated that BAPTA may inhibit tyrosine kinases (43Dieter P. Fiztke E. Duyster J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1993; 374: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This explanation appears unlikely, as pretreatment of the cells with the potent kinase inhibitor staurosporine neither abolished nor potentiated the effect of SP. A striking effect of SP was observed on the kinetics of single VOCCs. Using 5 μm and higher concentrations of SP, we found that the single channels were inhibited almost immediately after the gigaseal formation. Also in the excised outside-out experiments, the effect of SP on the open probability of the channels was almost immediate. These results suggest that SP inhibits the VOCCs directly (or possibly via a membrane-delimited action). We observed that SP significantly prolonged the closed time of the channels, without significant effects on either the amplitude, or the open time probability. These data suggest that SP is not an open-channel blocker. Similar results were found recently for the SP-evoked inhibition of single K+-channels in smooth muscle cells (52Petrou S. Ordway R.W. Hamilton J.A. Walsh Jr., J.V. Singer J.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, Yasui and Palade (53Yasui K. Palade P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C645-C649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the effect of SP on VOCCs in ventricular myocytes could be due to an effect of SP on channel gating. However, no single-channel experiments were performed in their study. In the present report, we did not evaluate which types of VOCCs were suppressed by SP. In a recent report, we have shown data suggesting that SPs apparently inhibited the L-type of VOCCs (34Törnquist K. Pasternack M. Kaila K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Theoretically, the effect of SP could be mediated via binding to the dihydropyridine binding site in the VOCCs. However, preliminary binding experiments showed that SP did not inhibit the binding of the dihydropyridine antagonist [3H]PN 200-110 to GH4C1cells. 2L. Karhapää and K. Törnquist, unpublished observation. Furthermore, considering that at least four different binding sites for antagonists to the VOCCs are known (54Glossman H. Striessnig J. Vitam. Horm. 1988; 44: 155-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility that SP could bind to some other known site than that of dihydropyridines. In conclusion, we have shown that SP, possibly directly or via a membrane-delimited action, inhibits VOCCs in GH4C1 cells by increasing the closed time probability of the channels. The action of SP apparently requires free intracellular Ca2+. Although the relatively rapid run-down of the channels in the present study precluded an investigation on the reversibility of the SP-evoked inhibition, our previous study clearly showed an almost total recovery of calcium entry after washout of SP (34Törnquist K. Pasternack M. Kaila K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of SP are not the result of an irreversible blockade of the channels. The physiological significance of SP in the regulation of pituitary cell function is still unclear. However, in preliminary studies, we have been able to measure significant endogenous levels of SP in GH4C1cells. 3K. Törnquist and H. Vuorela, unpublished results. Considering that the regulation of pituitary hormone synthesis and secretion is critically dependent on intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, SP may be an important regulator of pituitary cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2114499423,"A directly energized vacuolar pump for glutathione (GS) conjugates has been described for several plant species. Since glucuronate conjugates also occur in plants, we addressed the question whether plant vacuoles take up the abiotic glucuronate conjugate estradiol 17-(β-glucuronide) (E217G) via a GS conjugate pump, which in some cases has been reported to accept various organic anions as substrates, or via a distinct glucuronate transporter. Uptake studies into vacuoles from rye and barley were performed with E217G and metolachlor-GS (MOC-GS), a substrate of the GS conjugate ATPase, to compare glucuronate conjugate transport into vacuoles containing endogenous flavone glucuronides with those lacking specific glucuronate conjugates, respectively. Our results indicate that E217G and MOC-GS are taken up into vacuoles of both plants via a directly energized mechanism since transport was (i) strictly ATP-dependent; (ii) inhibited by vanadate but not by bafilomycin A1, azide, verapamil, nor by dissipation of the vacuolar ΔpH or ΔΨ; (iii) E217G uptake into rye vacuoles was partially driven by other nucleotides in the following order of efficiency: ATP > GTP > UTP ≅ CTP, whereas the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate, ADP, or PPi did not energize uptake. E217G transport into rye vacuoles was saturable (K m ≈0.2 mm). The rye-specific luteolin glucuronides decreased uptake rates of E217G and MOC-GS into rye and barley vacuoles to comparable degrees with the mono- and diglucuronidated derivatives (40–60% inhibition) being more effective than the triglucuronide. Inhibition of E217G uptake by luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide was competitive (K i = 120 μm). Taurocholate had no effect on E217G transport, and uptake of MOC-GS was not inhibited by E217G. Although GS conjugates and oxidized GS decreased MOC-GS transport, E217G uptake into rye and barley vacuoles was stimulated up to 7-fold in a concentration-dependent manner by these substances, with dinitrobenzene-GS being most effective. The stimulation of the GS conjugates was not due to detergent or redox effects and was specific for the E217G pump. GS conjugate stimulation of glucuronate uptake was unique for plants as E217G uptake into yeast microsomal vesicles was not affected. By comparison with a ΔYCF1 yeast mutant, defective in vacuolar transport of GS conjugates mediated by YCF1, it was shown that E217G was taken up into yeast vesicles via a YCF1-independent directly energized pump. These results indicate that E217G as a glucuronate conjugate is transported across the vacuolar membranes of plants and yeast by a carrier distinct from the GS conjugate ATPase.

In plants, many secondary compounds such as phenolic acids, coumarins, tannins, and flavonoids are detoxified and stored in the large central vacuole, a compartment with low metabolic activity (1Martinoia E.

Enzymatic conjugation of these substances with one or more hydrophilic ligands, primarily sugars, catalyzed by respective transferases is an integral part of the detoxification process and leads to higher water solubility. However, in several cases conjugation with glucuronate is also observed. In addition, conjugation of an anthocyanin with glutathione is apparently necessary for its vacuolar deposition in maize (2Marrs K. Alfenito M.R. Lloyd A.M. Walbot V. Nature. 1995; 375: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Another type of reaction is the esterification of phenolic compounds with polar substituents (3Strack D. Dey P.M. Harborne J.B. Plant Biochemistry. Academic Press, London1997: 387-416Crossref Google Scholar). Glucuronate conjugates are mainly produced in animals, where they play an important role in the degradation of heme resulting in bilirubin diglucuronide which is secreted into bile. Although a series of phenolic glucuronates have been identified in different plant taxa (4Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids. Chapman & Hall, London1988Crossref Google Scholar), glucuronyltransferases and the subsequent vacuolar deposition are poorly understood. In rye, two glucuronidated flavones, luteolin 7-O-diglucuronyl-4′-O-glucuronide (R1) 1The abbreviations used are: R1, luteolin 7-O-diglucuronyl-4′-O-glucuronide; R2, luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate; DNB, dinitrobenzene; E217G, β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide); GS, glutathione; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; MOC-GS, metolachlor-glutathione; MOAT, multiple organic anion transporter; MRP, multidrug resistance associated protein; YCF1, yeast cadmium factor 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BTP, bis-Tris propane; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: R1, luteolin 7-O-diglucuronyl-4′-O-glucuronide; R2, luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate; DNB, dinitrobenzene; E217G, β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide); GS, glutathione; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; MOC-GS, metolachlor-glutathione; MOAT, multiple organic anion transporter; MRP, multidrug resistance associated protein; YCF1, yeast cadmium factor 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BTP, bis-Tris propane; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. and luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide (R2), are specifically localized in the mesophyll tissue of primary leaves, whereas the epidermal layers contain glycosylated flavonoids (5Schulz M. Weissenböck G. Z. Naturforsch. 1986; 41c: 22-27Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The metabolism of these flavone glucuronates starting from luteolin is sequentially catalyzed by three anabolic cytosolic UDP-glucuronate:flavone-glucuronosyltransferases (6Anhalt S. Weissenböck G. Planta. 1992; 187: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) followed by vacuolar storage via an unknown mechanism and may also involve subsequent degradation of the luteolin triglucuronide initiated by a specific β-glucuronidase located in the cell wall (7.Anhalt, S. (1994) Charakterisierung und Lokalisation des Flavonoid-Abbaus im Mesophyll des Primärblattes von Secale cereale L., Ph.D. thesis, Universität zu Köln.Google Scholar). Accordingly, vacuolar steady-state concentrations of the flavone glucuronides show a maximum in the young rye leaf followed by a rapid decline during later development (8Strack D. Meurer B. Weissenböck G. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1982; 108: 131-141Crossref Google Scholar). In animals, glucuronate transport across the liver canalicular membrane has been investigated in detail and was shown to be mediated by a directly energized transporter belonging to the ABC family recognizing several anionic substances called MOAT (multiple organic aniontransporter; see Ref. 9Oude-Elferink R.P.J. Jansen P.L.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In plants, final deposition of glutathione conjugates within the plant vacuole is mediated by a directly energized transport process also involving an ABC transporter (10Martinoia E. Grill E.

Complementation of the cadmium hypersensitive ycf1 deletion mutant with MRP1 restores cadmium tolerance as well as glutathione conjugate transport activity (15Tommasini R. Evers R. Vogt E. Mornet C.

Cadmium tolerance is due to the transport of bis(glutathionato)cadmium complexes in yeast (16Li Z.-S. Lu Y.-P. Zhen R.-G. Szczypka M.S. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The human and rat liver canalicular MOAT represents a liver-specific isoform of the human multidrug resistance associated protein MRP1 (therefore denoted MRP2), and the transport function of the heterologously expressed mrp2 gene could be shown for a GS conjugate and leukotriene C4 (17Paulusma C.C.

As shown for MOAT, MRP1 is capable of transporting not only glutathione but also other negatively charged conjugates (20Lautier D. Canitrot Y. Deeley R. Cole S.P.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) including estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217G; Ref. 21Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In the case of glucose conjugates in plants, at least two mechanisms coexist as follows: species-specific plant flavonoid glucosides apparently use the proton gradient established by the vacuolar proton pumps, a vacuolar H+-ATPase and a H+-pyrophosphatase, and are transported by a species-specific proton antiport mechanism. In contrast, uptake of an abiotic herbicide glucoside is directly energized by MgATP (22Klein M. Weissenböck G. Dufaud A. Gaillard C. Kreuz K. Martinoia E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29666-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This difference may indicate that some glucosides are definitively stored within the vacuole, and others may be re-metabolized at a later stage of development. As outlined above, rye mesophyll cells accumulate specific flavone glucuronides. Therefore we started 14C and 3H labeling experiments with these substances to study the mechanism of their vacuolar deposition. However, so far different procedures have failed to specifically label the rye flavone glucuronides. To find evidence for a possible general mechanism of glucuronate transport into plant vacuoles, we investigated the transport of the steroid conjugate E217G, presumably not occurring in plants, and compared the uptake characteristics into rye vacuoles (containing endogenous glucuronates) and barley vacuoles (obviously lacking these compounds). Furthermore, we were interested in comparing the transport of metolachlor conjuated to glutathione (MOC-GS) with E217G, to elucidate whether the vacuolar uptake system for GS conjugates corresponds to a transporter with broad substrate specificity for anionic conjugates as shown for the canalicular MOAT/MRP2 (9Oude-Elferink R.P.J. Jansen P.L.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or the human multidrug resistance associated protein MRP1 (20Lautier D. Canitrot Y. Deeley R. Cole S.P.C. Biochem.

[phenyl-U-14C]Metolachlor-glutathione (1.7 × 106 Bq/mol, gift of Dr. K. Kreuz, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) was synthesized as described (23Furest E.P. Gronwald J.W. Weed Sci. 1986; 34: 354-361Crossref Google Scholar). Percoll and Ficoll 400 were supplied by Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany). Luteolin was from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). The flavonoid glucuronides luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide (R2) and luteolin 7-O-diglucuronyl-4′-O-glucuronide (R1; see Ref.5Schulz M. Weissenböck G. Z. Naturforsch. 1986; 41c: 22-27Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were isolated from Secale cereale L. cv. Kustro primary leaves grown in the field for 10 days as described (24Schulz M. Strack D. Weissenböck G. Markham K.R. Dellamonica D. Chopin J. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 343-345Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the following modification: the TLC step was omitted, and separation and final purification were done with a Sephadex LH-20 column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) using water as eluant. Luteolin-7-O-glucuronide was isolated from Antirrhinum majus L. petals (25Schulz M. Weissenböck G. Phytochemistry. 1987; 26: 933-937Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Purity of flavonoid glucuronides was higher than 95% as checked by HPLC. Dinitrobenzene-glutathione (DNB-GS) was prepared chemically by stirring 5 mm1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 10 mm reduced glutathione in water adjusted to pH 8.5 for 24 h at room temperature. Excess of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was removed by 3-fold shaking the mixture out with tert-butyl methyl ether. The aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness, and the concentration of the redissolved DNB-GS was determined photometrically (ε340 nm = 10 mm−1·cm−1). All other chemicals and solvents were of highest purity available and were mainly supplied by Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) and Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Bakara) and rye (S. cereale L. cv. Kustro; Lochow-Petkus, Bergen, Germany) were grown on vermiculite for 8 days in a growth cabinet with 13 h of fluorescent light (approximately 100 μmol × m−2 s−1) at 20 °C and 70% relative humidity and were watered daily with Hoagland's solution (22Klein M. Weissenböck G. Dufaud A. Gaillard C. Kreuz K. Martinoia E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29666-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The isogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains DTY7 (Matα, ura3-52, leu2-3,-112, his6) and DTY168 (Matαycf1Δ::hisG, ura3-52, leu2-3,-112, his6) were used for transport experiments into isolated microsomes. Protoplasts of both plants and barley vacuoles were isolated as described earlier (26Rentsch D. Martinoia E. Planta. 1991; 184: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Contamination of barley vacuoles with other cell constituents was less than 3% as measured by marker-enzyme activities (26Rentsch D. Martinoia E. Planta. 1991; 184: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As mechanical shearing forces using different needles and lysis conditions did not result in an acceptable yield of rye vacuoles, a different strategy was established. After digestion, rye protoplasts were washed twice with 0.5 msorbitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mmMES-KOH, pH 5.8, with a layer of Percoll containing 0.5 msorbitol and 20 mm MES, pH 6, underneath and sedimented on this layer for 5 min at 200 × g (Rotixa K., Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany). Either this crude preparation or protoplasts purified on a step gradient as described (26Rentsch D. Martinoia E. Planta. 1991; 184: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were used to lyse rye protoplasts by a combination of pH and osmotic shock. One part of concentrated protoplasts was mixed gently with four parts of lysis medium (10% (w/v) Ficoll 400, 20 mm MES-BTP, pH 8.5, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mg·ml−1 BSA, 5 mm DTT and sorbitol, total osmolarity of 0.22 osmol·kg−1) at 20 °C. After 15–20 min of gentle shaking a gradient was prepared consisting of 20 ml of the lysis mixture (bottom), an equal volume of medium A (0.4 m sorbitol, 5.5% (v/v) Percoll, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mg·ml−1 BSA, 20 mm MES-BTP, pH 7.2) and 5 ml of medium B (0.4m glycine betaine, 30 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT, 1 mg·ml−1 BSA, 20 mm MES-BTP, pH 7.2; top) in glass centrifugation tubes. Vacuoles were separated from unlysed protoplasts by centrifugation (5 min at 1000 ×g, Rotixa K) and were collected at the interphase of medium A and B. To concentrate the vacuoles, Percoll was added to a final concentration of 20% (v/v), and the gradient and centrifugation steps were repeated using 10-ml glass centrifugation tubes. All steps except for the lysis step were performed on ice and surveyed microscopically. Rye vacuoles were contaminated with less than 6% of nonvacuolar marker enzymes and retained almost 100% of soluble vacuolar hydrolases (data not shown). Yeast microsomal fractions were isolated from DTY7 and DTY168 strains grown overnight in YPD medium (1% (w/v) Bacto-yeast extract (Difco), 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone (Difco), 2% (w/v) glucose) at 30 °C to anA 600 of approximately 10 by disruption of enzymatically prepared spheroblasts in a glass/Teflon potter and pelleting membranes at 100,000 × g for 45 min as described in detail (15Tommasini R. Evers R. Vogt E. Mornet C. Zaman G.J.R. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. Martinoia E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6743-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Microsomal pellets were resuspended at anA 600 of 4 in 1.1 m glycerol, 50 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mg × ml−1 BSA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg × ml−1 leupeptin. For transport experiments, yeast membranes were either used immediately after isolation or stored in liquid nitrogen. Vacuolar uptake experiments with [3H]β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217G) or [14C]metolachlor-glutathione (MOC-GS) were performed as described earlier (26Rentsch D. Martinoia E. Planta. 1991; 184: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, for each time point and condition polyethylene microcentrifugation tubes (0.4-ml capacity) were prepared as follows: 70 μl of medium C (23% (v/v) Percoll, 0.4m sorbitol, 30 mm KCl, 20 mmMES-BTP, pH 7.2, 0.12% (w/v) BSA, 1 mm DTT, and 1.5 kBq of [3H]E217G, 0.2 kBq of [14C]MOC-GS, or 1.8 kBq of [14C]sucrose, and further solutes as indicated in figures and tables) were placed on the bottom of the tube. Uptake was started by adding 30 μl of concentrated vacuole suspension. The samples were rapidly overlayered with 200 μl of silicone oil AR 200 and 60 μl of water. The incubation was terminated by flotation of the vacuoles (10,000 ×g for 15 s, Beckman Microfuge 11, München, Germany). 50 μl of the aqueous phase was used to determine the radioactivity. Vacuolar volume was calculated by the addition of 3.7 kBq of 3H2O which equilibrates rapidly between the medium and the vacuolar lumen. 3H2O was added directly to medium C in experiments with [14C]MOC-GS and in separate assays of identical composition for the experiments with [3H]E217G. Experiments in the presence of GSH and its conjugates were performed without DTT which had no effect on the uptake of either substrate. Unless stated otherwise, uptake rates of [3H]E217G or [14C]MOC-GS into barley and rye vacuoles were calculated by subtracting the radioactivity measured after 2 min of incubation from corresponding 18-min values. K m, V max, and K i data were calculated using a computer program (Enzfitter, Elsevier Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). After incubation of rye vacuoles in medium C supplied with 7.4 kBq [3H]E217G and further solutes as indicated in Fig. 1, 2 × 50 μl of the aqueous supernatants following silicone oil centrifugation containing about 6 μl of vacuolar volume were pooled and subjected to HPLC (22Klein M. Weissenböck G. Dufaud A. Gaillard C. Kreuz K. Martinoia E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29666-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) under the following conditions: Nucleosil RP-8 column (125 × 4.6 mm; 5-μm grain size; CS Chromatographie Langerwehe, Germany); flow rate 1 ml × min−1; solvent A, H2O containing 1% (v/v) H3PO4; solvent B, MeOH; linear gradient from 50 to 70% B in 23 min, sample volume 50 μl. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The radioactive peak of the vacuolar content was compared with that of the authentic substrate [3H]E217G and with unlabeled E217G and β-estradiol, both detected at 260 nm. Uptake of [3H]E217G was measured by the rapid filtration technique using nitrocellulose filters of 0.45-μm pore size (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) as described (15Tommasini R. Evers R. Vogt E. Mornet C. Zaman G.J.R. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. Martinoia E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6743-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In short, 1 part of microsomes was mixed with 6 parts of 0.4 mglycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm[3H]E217G, and additional compounds as indicated in figures and tables. Incubation was at 25 °C. At times indicated, samples of 100 μl were removed from the incubation medium and filtered through nitrocellulose filters premoistened with medium D (0.4 m glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 20 mmTris-MES, pH 7.4). Filters were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold medium D. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting after addition of 5 ml Readysafe (Beckman) and shaking until filters were dissolved. Unless stated otherwise, uptake rates were calculated by subtracting the radioactivity measured after 0.5 min of incubation from corresponding 10-min values. Conditions were repeated with at least three independent microsome preparations, each performed in triplicate. It has been shown previously that plants have the ability to deposit xenobiotics conjugated to glutathione in their vacuoles by a directly energized, ATP-driven glutathione (GS) conjugate pump (10Martinoia E. Grill E. Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Nature. 1993; 364: 247-249Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 11Li Z.-S. Zhao Y. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol.

In animals, a directly energized transport system named MOAT or MRP2 has been described which is responsible for the removal of conjugates of lipophilic substrates with glutathione but also with glucuronate or sulfate across the canalicular membrane of liver cells into bile (for review, see Ref. 28Keppler D. Arias I.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The present work was performed to address the following questions: (i) do plant vacuolar membranes possess an active transport system that is able to transfer other negatively charged conjugates like β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217G) apart from GS conjugates into the vacuole, and (ii) are these conjugate substrates of the transporter described for GS conjugates, thus corresponding to a “plant MOAT-like” pump? Intact rye vacuoles incubated in the presence of 36 nm[3H]E217G contained a single radioactive compound after HPLC separation that coeluted with authentic labeled or unlabeled E217G at identical retention times (Fig.1). Up to 60 min of incubation, no further radioactive peak was detected in vacuolar supernatants, excluding a possible modification of the transported compound, especially deglucuronidation to β-estradiol (Fig. 1). Rye as well as barley mesophyll vacuoles took up the abiotic glucuronate conjugate, [3H]E217G, in an ATP-dependent manner (Figs. 1 C and 2 A and TableI). ATP-stimulated uptake of the glucuronate into barley and rye vacuoles is linear for at least 22 min (Fig. 2 A). As shown earlier for barley (10Martinoia E. Grill E. Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Nature. 1993; 364: 247-249Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 29Hörtensteiner S. Vogt E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Amrhein N. Martinoia E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18446-18449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vacuolar uptake of [14C]MOC-GS into rye vacuoles was ATP-dependent and linear for at least 20 min (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of ATP and E217G at a concentration of 8.2 nm, vacuolar transport rates for E217G were comparable for both plant species (8.70 ± 1.69 and 8.48 ± 1.35 pmol E217G × (liter vacuolar volume × s)−1 for rye and barley vacuoles, respectively) suggesting the existence of an E217G carrier located in plant vacuolar membranes irrespective of the capacity to synthesize and store endogenous glucuronides. After 18 min of incubation in the presence of 8.2 nm E217G and ATP, vacuolar concentrations of the glucuronate ranged between 6.61 and 11.75 nm and between 6.24 and 10.16 nm in vacuoles isolated from rye and barley leaves, respectively. Thus, these results do not clearly demonstrate accumulation against the concentration gradient. Extending the incubation time up to 45 min resulted in only a weak further increase in vacuolar concentration (data not shown).Table IEffect of different inhibitors and MgATP on the uptake of β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) ([ 3 H]E 2 17G) and metolachlor-glutathione ([ 14 C]MOC-GS) into mesophyll vacuoles of barley and ryeTreatmentSecaleHordeumTransport of [3H]E217GTransport of [14C]MOC-GSTransport of [3H]E217GTransport of [14C]MOC-GS% MgATP-stimulated uptake rate% MgATP-stimulated uptake rateNo ATP4.7 ± 2.91.4 ± 0.67.9 ± 4.931-aData published previously (29).+MgATP (control)1001001001001-aData published previously (29).+MgATP + bafilomycin A1 (0.1 μm)100.1 ± 20.8105.3 ± 2.5110.2 ± 12.51011-aData published previously (29).+MgATP + vanadate (1 mm)28.7 ± 5.89.2 ± 0.719.0 ± 10.6111-aData published previously (29).+MgATP + NaN3 (1 mm)92.1 ± 6.7106.2 ± 0.898.2 ± 1.61021-aData published previously (29).+MgATP + NH4Cl (5 mm)98.1 ± 3.292.3 ± 8.685.1 ± 6.9961-aData published previously (29).+MgATP + valinomycin (5 μm)93.7 ± 5.2100.1 ± 1.289.7 ± 10.0ND+MgATP + verapamil (0.1 mm)96.2 ± 22.5104.5 ± 1.891.2 ± 18.1NDNo ATP + NH4Cl (5 mm)9.2 ± 5.5ND3.7 ± 5.6ND1-a Data published previously (29Hörtensteiner S.

Glu78 is also located in the first EGF-like domain and, when mutated to Lys, is associated with severe hemophilia B. Because Glu78 is conserved in related vitamin K-dependent proteins, it is difficult to understand how a mutation at this position is associated with factor IX-specific function. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that Glu78 exerts its biological activity by interacting with another residue. One candidate was found to be the second EGF-like domain residue, Arg94, which is also associated with severe hemophilia B when mutated. We constructed a series of mutants that included mutations at position 78 alone (Glu78 to Lys/Glu78 to Asp) or at both positions 78 and 94 (Glu78 to Lys and Arg94 to Asp). The functional parameters of immunopurified and activated mutants were compared with normal activated factor IX. Mutants were indistinguishable from normal factor IXa in cleaving the synthetic substrate CH3SO2-Leu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide or activating factor X in the absence of factor VIIIa. In contrast, in the presence of factor VIIIa, factor IXa Glu78 to Asp and factor IXa Glu78 to Lys/Arg94 to Asp were stimulated to the same extent as normal factor IXa, whereas factor IXa Glu78 to Lys was markedly less stimulated (140-foldversus 2,000-fold). This suggests that residues 78 and 94 should carry an opposite charge for a normal interaction of factor IXa to factor VIIIa. This hypothesis was confirmed in inhibition studies employing synthetic peptides comprising the factor IXa-binding motifs of factor VIII heavy (Ser558–Gln565) or light chain (Glu1811–Lys1818) and in direct binding studies. We propose that residues 78 and 94 link both EGF-like domains and thereby maintain the integrity of the factor VIII light chain binding site. Recently, we established that mutations at calcium-binding sites within the first epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of activated factor IX affect its interaction with factor VIIIa (Lenting, P. J., Christophe, O. D., ter Maat, H., Rees, D. J. G., and Mertens, K. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25332–25337).

In the intrinsic and extrinsic blood coagulation pathways, FIX is converted to activated FIX (FIXa) by factor XIa and the complex factor VIIa-tissue factor, respectively, in the presence of calcium ions (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). Activated FIX consists of an N-terminal light chain containing a Gla module with several γ-carboxylated glutamic acid residues, a short hydrophobic stack, two domains that share considerable homology with the epidermal growth factor (EGF), and a C-terminal heavy chain consisting of the catalytic domain (2Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Anson D.S. Choo K.H. Rees D.J. Giannelli F. Gould K. Huddleston J.A. Brownlee G.G.

These two chains are linked via a disulfide bridge.FIXa is a serine protease that, in complex with calcium ions and the cofactor factor VIIIa (FVIIIa), activates factor X (FX) on procoagulant membranes (5Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of FX activation by FIXa in this complex is markedly enhanced in the presence of FVIIIa (6van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 54: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of FVIII and FIX is apparent from the notion that deficiency or dysfunction of either of the two proteins is associated with bleeding disorders known as hemophilia A and B, respectively (8Sadler J.E. Davie E.W. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A. Leder P. Majerus P. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1987: 575-629Google Scholar). FIXa and FVIIIa assemble into the FXa-activating complex through several interactive sites (9Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the light chain of FVIIIa contains a high affinity binding site for FIXa between residues Glu1811 and Lys1818 (11Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W.H.P. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been established that the sequence Ser558–Gln565 of the FVIIIa heavy chain interacts with FIXa (10Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Both the heavy and the light chain of FIXa have been proposed to be involved in FVIIIa binding (12Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Maki S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11574-11580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P.F.M. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14884-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), although the precise locations of the interactive sites have not been elucidated yet. The FIXa heavy chain has been implicated by the finding that the enhancement of FIXa proteolytic activity by FVIIIa is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against the FIXa heavy chain (12Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Maki S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11574-11580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have obtained evidence that the FIXa light chain also interacts with the light chain of FVIII (13Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P.F.M. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14884-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, a monoclonal anti-FIX light chain antibody was found to abolish the binding of FIXa to FVIII light chain (13Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P.F.M. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14884-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, FVIII light chain binds to the light chain of FIXa in ligand blotting studies (13Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P.F.M. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14884-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), while FIXa light chain proteolytic fragments interfere with FVIIIa-induced conformational changes in the FIXa active site (14Astermark J. Hogg P.J. Björk I. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3249-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the effect of most of the FIX light chain mutations that combine moderate or severe hemophilia B (less than 5% biological activity compared with normal FIX) with normal FIX protein levels (15Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M.-C. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) are located in the first EGF-like domain (16Rees D.J.G. Jones I.M. Handford P.A. Walter S.J. Esnouf M.P. Smith K.J. Brownlee G.G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2053-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17McCord D. Monroe D.M. Smith K.J. Roberts H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10250-10254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent analysis of the crystal structure of the isolated first EGF-like domain of FIX revealed that a subset of these residues (Asp47, Gln50, and Asp64) is also associated with calcium binding (18Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).By using recombinant FIX variants mutated at position 64 we have demonstrated recently that the mechanism by which calcium binding to the first EGF-like domain contributes to FIX activity is complex (19Lenting P.J. Christophe O.D. ter Maat H. Rees D.J.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25332-25337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and involves amidolytic activity, proteolytic activity in the absence of FVIIIa, and the interaction with the FVIII light chain (19Lenting P.J. Christophe O.D. ter Maat H. Rees D.J.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25332-25337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The first EGF-like domain of FIX also comprises residues that, when mutated, are associated with severe hemophilia B, although by a calcium-independent mechanism (16Rees D.J.G. Jones I.M. Handford P.A. Walter S.J. Esnouf M.P. Smith K.J. Brownlee G.G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2053-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These residues include Glu78, which has previously been described as being associated with a FVIIIa-dependent defect (15Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M.-C. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Rees D.J.G. Jones I.M. Handford P.A. Walter S.J. Esnouf M.P. Smith K.J. Brownlee G.G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2053-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have addressed the contribution of the residue 78 to FIXa function employing mutant recombinant FIX. The immunopurified mutants were compared with normal FIX with regard to a number of functional parameters including enzymatic activity and FVIII binding. This approach revealed that Glu78, in concert with Arg94, is crucial for the interaction with the FVIII light chain, presumably because these residues link the two EGF-like domains by an electrostatic interaction.DISCUSSIONEGF-like modules have been found in proteins associated with blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, activation of the complement, cell adhesion, and developmental determination of embryonic cells (for reviews, see Refs. 4Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 31Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It is presumed that this structure is involved in general biological roles such as ligand receptor or protein-protein interactions (31Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The FIXa light chain contains two EGF-like domains. In this study, we focused our investigations on the potential role of these two domains in FIXa binding to FVIIIa. Defective FIX molecules with mutations in the first and second EGF-like domains, as present in the blood of patients with severe hemophilia B, have shed light on the possible contribution of these motifs in FIXa-FVIIIa interaction and thus in FVIIIa-dependent FX activation by FIXa (15Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M.-C. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Some residues, including Asp47, Asp49, Gln50, Asp64, and Glu78 in the first EGF-like domain and Gln92 and Arg94 in the second EGF-like domain, are potential sites involved in FVIIIa binding. The first EGF-like domain of FIX contains one high affinity binding site for calcium ions (32Handford P.A. Baron M. Mayhew M. Willis A. Beesley T. Brownlee G.G. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A recent crystal structure analysis of this domain revealed that residues 47, 50, and 64 are involved in calcium binding (18Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Recently, we have established that replacement of the side chain at position 64, thus abolishing calcium-binding to the first EGF-like domain, affects several functions of FIXa, including the FIXa-FVIII light chain interaction (19Lenting P.J. Christophe O.D. ter Maat H. Rees D.J.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25332-25337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of residue 78, which does not involve calcium binding. To this end, the mutant FIX molecules FIX E78K and FIX E78D were constructed, and the immunopurified proteins were compared with normal FIX in a number of functional parameters.We first demonstrated that, unlike residue 64 (19Lenting P.J. Christophe O.D. ter Maat H. Rees D.J.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25332-25337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), residue 78 is not involved in enzymatic activity of FIXa toward small substrates in the presence of calcium ions (Fig. 1) or FX (Fig. 2). However, while FIXa E78D activity toward FX is stimulated by FVIIIa to the same extent as normal FIXa, FIXa E78K activity is only slightly stimulated (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that the charge of the side chain at position 78 specifically affects the interaction of FIXa with FVIIIa. More detailed analysis revealed that this is due to an abnormal interaction of FIXa E78K with FVIII light chain, as assessed from direct binding studies (Fig. 4) and from competition studies employing two synthetic peptides (Table I). Furthermore, we resolved how the charge of residue 78 contributes to the binding of FIXa to FVIII light chain. Because the FIXa binding site in the FVIII A3 domain is rich in basic residues (11Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W.H.P. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), it seems conceivable that the acidic residue Glu78 is in direct interaction with the FVIII light chain. One argument against this view, however, is the notion that Glu78 and its surrounding sequence (Gly-Phe-Glu-Gly-Lys) is identical in FX (27Fung M.R. Hay C.W. MacGillivray R.T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3591-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and highly similar in FVII (Ala-Phe-Glu-Gly-Arg; Ref. 28Hagen F.S. Gray C.L. O'Hara P. Grant F.J. Saari G.C. Woodburry R.G. Hart C.E. Insley M. Kisiel W. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2412-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and Protein C (Gly-Trp-Glu-Gly-Arg; Ref. 29Beckmann R.J. Schmidt R.J. Santerre R.F. Plutzy J. Crabtree G.R. Long G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5233-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The apparent involvement of the non-FIX-specific residue Glu78in a FIX-specific function such as FVIII binding may be explained by Glu78 being in interaction with another residue, which should have the potential of stabilizing a FIX-specific site involved in FVIII light chain binding and which should be FIX-specific. The Glu78 counterpart should share the same function, and consequently mutation at this position should result in a severe hemophilia B phenotype as well. First, Arg94 is conserved in the FIX sequence of other mammalian sequences (33Katayama K. Ericsson L.H. Enfield D.L. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Davie E.W. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene (Amst.). 1990; 86: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas other related human vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors have Asp (FX, Ref. 27Fung M.R. Hay C.W. MacGillivray R.T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3591-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or Gly (FVII and Protein C; Refs. 28Hagen F.S. Gray C.L. O'Hara P. Grant F.J.

Schmidt R.J. Santerre R.F. Plutzy J. Crabtree G.R. Long G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5233-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) in this position. Second, mutation at this FIX-specific position is associated with severe hemophilia B (see data base in Ref. 15Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M.-C. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, the recently published crystal structure demonstrated that the distance of Glu78 from the Gla domain or the heavy chain eliminates any possible contact with residues within one of these domains, while residue Arg94 located in the second EGF-like domain is close to Glu78 in porcine FIXa (Ref. 30Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar; see Fig.5).Therefore, we have addressed the possibility that a compensatory mutation at position 94 into FIXa E78K would restore the FVIIIa-dependent FX activation. Indeed, the activity toward FX of the double-mutant, FIXa E78K/R94D, is stimulated by FVIIIa to nearly the same extent as normal FIXa (Fig. 3). The apparently normal interaction of FIXa E78K/R94D with FVIIIa was confirmed from direct binding studies (Fig. 4) and employing synthetic peptides that comprise the FIXa-binding sequences on FVIII light and heavy chains (Table I). Thus, our results strongly support the theory that within normal FIXa, residue Glu78 is in functional association with residue Arg94.Previously, it has been established that the two EGF-like domains in FIX interact weakly with each other (37Medved L.V. Vysotchin A. Ingham K.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the bridge formed by residues 78 and 94 links both EGF-like domains and that this interaction is crucial for the integrity of the FVIII light chain binding site on the FIXa light chain and thus for FVIIIa-dependent FX activation. The observation that the natural variant R94S, which cannot form a salt bridge with residue 78, has a very low activity (38Bottema C.D.K. Ketterling R.P. Li S. Yoon H.-P. Phillips III, J.A. Sommer S.S. Am. J. Genet. 1991; 49: 820-838PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with our conclusion. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the overall electrostatic environment in the contact region between both EGF-like domains may provide alternative possibilities of contact between the two modules. Determination of the precise nature of the interaction would require a high resolution three-dimensional structure of the complete FIXa light chain in a calcium ion-bound conformation.Our findings would explain why chimeric recombinant FIXa in which the first EGF-like domain has been replaced by the corresponding domain of FX (39Lin S.-W. Smith K.J. Welsh D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 144-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or FVII (40Chang J.-Y. Monroe D.M. Stafford D.W. Roberts H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 1202Google Scholar) retain normal or increased biological activity, respectively, whereas chimeric FIX with the two EGF-like domains of FX possesses only 4% normal biological activity (39Lin S.-W. Smith K.J. Welsh D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 144-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, inspection of the known amino acid sequence of EGF-like domains from each of the above mentioned proteins shows that the first two chimeras possess the residues Glu78 and Arg94, whereas the chimera with the two EGF-like domains of FX possesses residues Glu78 and Asp94. In the latter case, no salt bridge (required for FVIIIa binding) exists between the two residues. In addition, our model for the interaction of the two EGF-like domains would also explain the notion that a fragment of FIX that contains the two EGF-like domains inhibits FVIII-dependent blood coagulation (41Astermark J. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2438-2443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It is noteworthy that the same strategy has revealed that electrostatic interactions are also predominant in the binding between tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (42Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gething M.J.H. Sambrook J.F. Gerard R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21423-21426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By mutagenesis of basic to acidic residues in the enzyme and vice versa in the inhibitor, Madison et al. (42Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gething M.J.H. Sambrook J.F. Gerard R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21423-21426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) succeeded in restoring the interaction between both proteins. In the present study, we noted a similar type of interaction between two modules within the same protein.It is known that EGF-like domains in blood coagulation proteins have features that set them apart from those in other molecules, not only structurally but also in terms of function. For example, they do not contain the conserved amino acids present in EGF and tumor growth factor-α that are necessary for these proteins to express growth factor activity. Our study demonstrates that EGF-like domains of vitamin K-dependent proteins are not just spacers between the Gla region and the protease part but can also serve as an important functional element involved in the interaction with its natural cofactor. Two possibilities may be considered to explain our findings. First, the interaction between residues 78 and 94 could permit a specific conformation of FIX and thereby a specific spatial alignment of the molecule with the two FIXa-binding sites on FVIII (10Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W.H.P. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This specific contact between both domains then allows the correct exposure of the FVIII light chain binding site on one of the EGF-like modules. Second, our findings could also suggest that the association of two similar motifs, encoded by separate exons, might form one single binding site. This association may allow the formation of the FVIII light chain binding site, which could be composed of several specific FIX residues dispersed among these two domains. Further studies will be necessary to distinguish between these two possibilities and to determine the location of the FVIII light chain binding site on the FIX light chain more precisely.

In the intrinsic and extrinsic blood coagulation pathways, FIX is converted to activated FIX (FIXa) by factor XIa and the complex factor VIIa-tissue factor, respectively, in the presence of calcium ions (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). Activated FIX consists of an N-terminal light chain containing a Gla module with several γ-carboxylated glutamic acid residues, a short hydrophobic stack, two domains that share considerable homology with the epidermal growth factor (EGF), and a C-terminal heavy chain consisting of the catalytic domain (2Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Anson D.S. Choo K.H. Rees D.J. Giannelli F. Gould K. Huddleston J.A. Brownlee G.G.

FIXa is a serine protease that, in complex with calcium ions and the cofactor factor VIIIa (FVIIIa), activates factor X (FX) on procoagulant membranes (5Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of FX activation by FIXa in this complex is markedly enhanced in the presence of FVIIIa (6van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 54: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of FVIII and FIX is apparent from the notion that deficiency or dysfunction of either of the two proteins is associated with bleeding disorders known as hemophilia A and B, respectively (8Sadler J.E. Davie E.W. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A. Leder P. Majerus P. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1987: 575-629Google Scholar). FIXa and FVIIIa assemble into the FXa-activating complex through several interactive sites (9Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol.

Recently, we have shown that the light chain of FVIIIa contains a high affinity binding site for FIXa between residues Glu1811 and Lys1818 (11Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W.H.P.

https://openalex.org/W1990884278,"In polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, sorting of membrane proteins in the trans-Golgi network for basolateral delivery depends on the presence of cytoplasmic determinants that are related or unrelated to clathrin-coated pit localization signals. Whether these signals mediate basolateral protein sorting through common or distinct pathways is unknown. The cytoplasmic domain of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) contains clathrin-coated pit localization signals that are necessary for endocytosis and lysosomal enzyme targeting. In this study, we have addressed the function of these signals in polarized sorting of the CD-MPR. A chimeric protein, made of the luminal domain of the influenza virus hemagglutinin fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the CD-MPR was stably expressed in MDCK cells. This chimera (HCD) is able to interact with the AP-1 Golgi-specific assembly proteins and is detected on the basolateral plasma membrane of MDCK cells where it is endocytosed. Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic domain of the CD-MPR indicate that HCD chimeras devoid of clathrin-coated pit localization signals are still transported to the basolateral membrane where they accumulate. A HCD chimera containing only the transmembrane domain and the 12 membrane-proximal amino acids of the CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail is also found on the basolateral membrane but is unable to interact with the AP-1 assembly proteins. However, the overexpression of this mutant results in partial apical delivery. It is concluded, therefore, that the basolateral transport of this chimera requires a saturable sorting machinery distinct from AP-1.

It is concluded, therefore, that the basolateral transport of this chimera requires a saturable sorting machinery distinct from AP-1. The plasma membrane of polarized cells can be divided into two distinct domains, apical and basolateral, which exhibit different protein and lipid compositions. The generation and the maintenance of these domains require a continuous supply of newly synthesized components. In MDCK 1The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; TGN, trans-Golgi network; MPR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; CD-MPR, cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Man-6-P, mannose 6-phosphate; MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. cells, newly synthesized membrane proteins destined for the basolateral or the apical surface are sorted in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and packaged into distinct transport vesicles (1Wandering-Ness A. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Vesicular transport from the TGN to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane domains are mechanistically different. Although the docking/fusion of transport vesicles with the basolateral plasma membrane relies, like many transport steps, on the presence of the common fusion machinery involving NSF/SNAP proteins, the apical delivery appears to be independent of these proteins (2Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). More recent studies have indicated that nonpolarized cells also make use of two types of transport intermediates for the delivery of membrane proteins to the plasma membrane, one dependent on the presence of NSF/SNAP proteins and another independent of these complexes (3Yoshimori T. Keller P. Roth M.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, polarized and nonpolarized cells have fairly similar overall organization of membrane traffic within the secretory pathway. Thus far, two distinct features have been shown to determine sorting to the apical domain: first, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of membrane proteins (4Brown D.A. Crise B. Rose K. Science. 1989; 245: 1499-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 5Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and second, the mannose-rich core part ofN-glycans present in the luminal domain of proteins (6Scheiffele P. Peränen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Many studies have now illustrated that sorting of membrane proteins to the basolateral plasma membrane is determined by the presence of specific, dominant protein determinants in their cytoplasmic domains (reviewed in Ref. 7Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Extensive mutagenesis has uncovered two types of sorting motifs for basolateral delivery. First, there are those related to signals for clathrin-coated pit localization, which either rely on a key tyrosine residue, like those found in the LDL receptor (proximal determinant) (8Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), the vesicular stomatatis virus G protein (9Thomas D.N.C. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3313-3320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (10Höning S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), or on a di-leucine motif, like in the IgG Fc receptor (11Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Second, there are basolateral targeting signals that are unrelated to determinants for clathrin-coated pit localization. Examples can be found in the LDL receptor (distal determinant) and in the poly-IgA receptor (8Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 12Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 13Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same (or a very closely related) basolateral sorting signal can mediate the recycling of endocytosed membrane proteins from endosomes back to the plasma membrane (14Aroeti B. Mostov K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The similarities between the determinants responsible for endocytosis, basolateral sorting, and plasma membrane recycling suggest that these processes are extremely related and involve similar sorting machineries that remain to be characterized. In addition to sorting membrane proteins destined for the apical or basolateral domains in the TGN, the polarized MDCK cells must also sort their newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases bound to the mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs). Previous studies have shown that one of the two MPRs, the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (Man-6-P/IGF II), traffics within the basolateral domain of MDCK cells because it can be detected on the basolateral membrane of these cells (16Prydz K. Brändli A.W. Bomsel M. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12629-12635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In nonpolarized cells, the endocytosis of this receptor relies on a tyrosine-based motif, whereas that of the other MPR, the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR), requires a weak tyrosine-based motif and a dominant motif containing two phenylalanine residues (17Johnson K.F. Chan W. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10010-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, efficient lysosomal enzyme targeting requires the presence of a di-leucine-based motif present at the carboxyl terminus of both MPRs (18Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Chen H.J. Remmler J. Delaney J.C. Messner D.J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22338-22346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the signals required for efficient endocytosis of the MPRs contribute, although weakly, to efficient lysosomal enzyme targeting (19Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The MPRs and their bound lysosomal enzymes are known to be sorted in the TGN via clathrin-coated vesicles. The first step in the formation of these transport intermediates is the interaction of the AP-1 Golgi-specific assembly proteins with TGN membranes. The MPRs are part of the membrane components that permit the efficient recruitment of AP-1 on membranes (21Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a process regulated by the small GTPase ARF-1 (24Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the case of the CD-MPR, specific determinants in its cytoplasmic domain, in particular a casein kinase II phosphorylation site are required for high affinity interaction of AP-1 with TGN membranes (25Mauxion F. Le Borgne R. Munier-Lehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the sorting of the CD-MPR in polarized MDCK cells. For this, we have stably expressed a chimeric protein made of the luminal domain of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of the CD-MPR. This HCD chimeric protein traffics within the basolateral domain and can be detected at the basolateral surface. Mutations of the different sorting signals proposed to mediate the interaction of the CD-MPR tail either with the Golgi-specific assembly proteins AP-1 or its plasma membrane counterpart AP-2 do not affect the basolateral delivery of the corresponding HCD chimeras. Truncations of the cytoplasmic domain indicated that a sorting determinant, unrelated to motifs necessary for clathrin-coated pit localization, is present in the membrane-proximal part of the CD-MPR cytoplasmic domain or the transmembrane domain, which confers basolateral targeting. This determinant, neither supports the AP-2-dependent endocytosis nor triggers the recruitment of AP-1 on membranes. This strongly suggests that an additional sorting machinery that recognizes signals unrelated to those mediating clathrin-coated pit localization could be responsible for basolateral targeting of membrane proteins in MDCK cells. MDCK cells (strain II) were grown as described (26Matlin K.S. Reggio H. Helenius A. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). PA317 amphotropic retrovirus packaging cells (27Miller A.D. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 6: 2895-2901Crossref Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mmglutamine, and antibiotics. All experiments, unless otherwise indicated, were performed with MDCK cells grown on 24.5-mm diameter, 0.4-mm pore size transwell units (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The polycarbonate filters were seeded with 0.5 to 1 × 106cells each, and cell monolayers were used for experiments 4 days after plating. All manipulations of DNA were performed essentially as described in Ref. 28Sambrook J Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. To optimize expression of the chimeric proteins a Kozak consensus sequence was introduced into the cDNA encoding HA. Two complementary oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-CAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGG-3′ and 5′-CCATGGTGGCGGCAAGCTTGGTAC-3′ were ligated between the KpnI and MscI sites of plasmid pBHA (29Mauxion F. Schmidt A. Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar) to create pBD16. To form pBD17 (wtHA), pBD16 was cleaved with HindIII and BamHI and the short fragment encoding the complete influenza virus hemagglutinin protein was cloned between EcoRI and BamHI sites of the retroviral vector pLXSN (30Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar) after making the HindIII and EcoRI ends flush with Klenow. The construction of a chimeric gene, HCD, consisting of the luminal domain of the influenza virus HA fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the small MPR has been described previously (29Mauxion F. Schmidt A. Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar). The chimeric gene HCD and all mutants derived thereof were inserted in pBD17 between the SalI and BamHI sites, thereby fusing the 5′ end of HA, containing the Kozak consensus sequence, to all chimeric genes. The cytoplasmic domain truncation mutants (HCD-Δ5 (pBD23), HCD-Δ17 (pBD20), and HCD-Δ55 (pBD26); see Fig. 1) and the substitution mutants (HCD-Δ55,A-1 (pBD28) and HCD-A13A18A45 (pBD19)) were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the wild type mouse CD-MPR cDNA (31Ludwig T. Ruther U. Metzger R. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Lobel P. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12211-12219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the method of Kunkel (32Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). For the truncation mutants the codons for the CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail residues 63 (His) and 51 (Gln) were changed to stop codons. In the case of the substitution mutants, the last residue (Tyr) of the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail residues Phe13, Phe18, and Tyr45 were changed to alanines. The truncation mutant HCD-Δ23 (pBD25) was generated by ligation of two complementary oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-GCATGATTGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCAATCAT-3′ between the PstI and BamHI sites of HCD, introducing a stop codon at Tyr45 in the cytoplasmic tail of the CD-MPR. Mutant HCD-Δ55 (pBD26) and Δ55,A-1 (pBD30) were constructed in a similar way using oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-ATGGAGCAGTGAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCACTGCTCCATTCCC-3′. This double-stranded DNA fragment was inserted between the BstXI and BamHI sites of HCD and HCD-A-1, respectively, creating a stop codon at residue 13 (Phe) of the cytoplasmic domain. Infectious virus was generated for each of the constructs from the plasmid form of the retroviral vector by transient transfection of the packaging cells PA317 essentially as described (30Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). Virus-containing medium harvested from PA317 cells was used to infect MDCK cells. Stably transfected MDCK cells were selected in medium containing 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and cloned using glass cylinders. Cells expressing the protein of interest were identified by immunofluorescence. At least two independent clones expressing the highest levels of the respective chimeric protein were used for further experiments. All transfected cell lines used were fully polarized as judged by methionine uptake (basal/apical ratio greater than 4:1) (33Balcarova-Stander J. Pfeiffer S.E. Fuller S.D. Simons K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2687-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and secretion of an endogenous glycoprotein complex (34Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Prior to experiments the tightness of monolayers was assessed with [3H]inulin (Amersham Corp.) (35Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed using cell lines of passage numbers 5 through 10 after cloning. MDCK cells grown on Costar Transwell units were rinsed with warm PBS++ (PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmMgCl2) and starved for 60 min in MEM lacking cysteine and methionine (Select Amine-kit; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.35 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, and 0.5% BSA (MEM-BSA). Cells were then pulse labeled in a wet chamber for 20 min at 37 °C from the basolateral side with labeling medium (MEM-BSA supplemented with 2 mCi/ml Expre35S35S (1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) NEN Life Science Products). One set of filters was washed three times with cold PBS++ and placed on ice in MEM-BSA; the other sets of filters were chased at 37 °C in MEM-BSA with a 100-fold excess methionine and cysteine. At the end of the chase cells were washed with cold PBS++ and placed on ice in MEM-BSA. Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed once with MEM-BSA and incubated either from the apical or basolateral side with a 1:500 dilution of an hemagglutinin antiserum (monoclonal antibody H269, generous gift of J. Skehel) in MEM-BSA for 90 min on a rocking platform. In some experiments the antibody was included in the apical or basolateral chase medium and allowed to bind for another 90 min on ice. The excess unbound antibodies were removed over 30 min by three washes with MEM-BSA and one wash with PBS++, filters were cut out of the holder, and cells were lysed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled protein. (For preparation of unlabeled lysates a cell line overexpressing the wild type HA was grown to confluency on 10-cm culture dishes. Cells from one dish were lysed on ice in 2.5 ml of B1 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS containing freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (2 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g, and 1 ml of supernatant was used to lyse labeled cells.) The lysate was centrifuged in an Eppendorf microfuge for 5 min to remove debris. An aliquot (one-tenth of the lysate) was supplemented with additional antibody (anti-HA, mAb H269) and incubated overnight at 4 °C, and total labeled protein was isolated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose. The second aliquot (nine-tenths of the lysate) was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored overnight at −70 °C. Labeled protein that had appeared on the cell surface and thus had bound antibody was precipitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed three times with B1, twice with B2 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate), twice with B3 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), and once with B4 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA). Finally, proteins were released from the beads by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The band intensities were calculated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and the amount of protein transported to the cell surface was expressed as the percentage of the total immunoprecipitated protein. In some experiments cells were pretreated with 10 mm butyric acid (Sigma) 12 h prior to labeling to induce transcription of stably transfected cDNA constructs (8Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). MDCK cells grown on 60-mm plastic dishes to subconfluency and treated with 10 mm NH4Cl 12–16 h prior to the experiment to reduce the endogenous level of lysosomal proteases were metabolically labeled essentially as described above except that cells were labeled for 1 h and chased for 3 h. After labeling cells were lysed, and an aliquot of the lysate was analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described (37Copeland C.S. Doms R.W. Bolzau E.M. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Internalization rates of CD-MPR chimeras were determined by the surface biotinylation assay described in Ref. 38Prill V. Lehmann L. Von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, except that MESNa was used for stripping of the cell surface biotin. Biotinylated CD-MPR chimera were detected by Western blotting with125I-labeled streptavidin. Signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager. HeLa cells were grown on coverslips in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mmHepes, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were washed in medium devoid of serum and then incubated for 30 min with a recombinant virus that expresses the T7 polymerase gene (39Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). After washing the cells in medium supplemented with 5 mm hydroxyurea, theN-[1(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl-ammonium-methylsulfate reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) was used to transfect the cells with the indicated constructs (HCD and HCD-Δ55) cloned in pGEM1 vector, following the manufacturer's instructions. After 1 h, the cells were washed and allowed to express for 2–3 h in medium supplemented with 5 mm hydroxyurea. Pulse-chase experiments performed in parallel indicated that similar levels of HCD and HCD-Δ55 were expressed under those conditions and transported through the secretory pathway with similar kinetics (data not shown). Cells were then fixed for 20 min with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and subsequently incubated with the monoclonal 100/3 anti-γ-adaptin antibody (kindly provided by E. Ungewickell) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody for 30 min at room temperature. The bound antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova). For quantitation of the fluorescent signal, randomly chosen fields were captured using a cooled charged and coupled device CH250 from Photometrics (Tuckson, AZ) having a Kodak KAF 1400 CCD CHIP (grade 2) for 12-Bit image collection that was controlled by the KHOROS software package running on a SUN 10/41 workstation (Silicon Graphics, USA). In every field, regions corresponding to the TGN area of transfected or nontransfected cells were selected, and the fluorescence in the Texas Red channel corresponding to the 100/3 monoclonal antibody was calculated using the AIM program developed by J. C. Olivo from the EMBL microcomputing and data acquisition group. After calculating the fluorescence intensities (mean intensity/pixel or total intensity) from 88 (HCD transfected), 122 (nontransfected), and 73 (HCD-Δ55) cells, mean and standard error were calculated. The confidence limits of the results obtained were assessed by Student's t test. In MDCK cells, the Man-6-P/IGF II receptor traffics between the TGN and the endocytic organelles of the basolateral domain and is found on the basolateral plasma membrane (16Prydz K. Brändli A.W. Bomsel M. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12629-12635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the transport of the CD-MPR in these cells, we have generated MDCK clones stably expressing chimeric proteins made of the luminal domain of the influenza virus HA, an apically sorted membrane glycoprotein, fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of this receptor (Fig.1) and performed pulse-chase experiments followed by cell surface immunoprecipitations to measure the appearance of these chimeric proteins on the apical or the basolateral domain. The normal transport of HA to the cell surface depends on its proper folding and trimerization (37Copeland C.S. Doms R.W. Bolzau E.M. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because modifications in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of HA can affect its normal rate of transport (40Doyle C. Roth M.G. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 41Doyle C. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) we determined whether the HA/CD-MPR chimera (HCD construct) is properly folded and transported through the secretory pathway. We first performed classical pulse-chase experiments on MDCK cells expressing either the wild type HA or the HCD and immunoprecipitated these labeled proteins using a monoclonal antibody directed against the luminal domain of HA. After a 20-min pulse, the HA and the HCD were found in low molecular weight, immature forms that were rapidly converted upon a chase into higher molecular weight, mature forms reflecting the conversion of high mannose to complex type oligosaccharides (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the HCD chimera moves efficiently through the secretory pathway with similar rates as the HA (t½ ≈ 30 and 25 min, respectively). Such pulse-chase experiments were also performed with the HCD-Δ55, which harbors a 55-amino acid-long truncation of the CD-MPR tail (Fig. 2). The rate of transport of this mutant was slightly slower than that of HCD (t½ ≈ 45 min), indicating that the deletion of the CD-MPR tail only moderately affects the transport of the corresponding chimera. The other mutants used in this study were transported through the secretory pathway with similar rates as that of HCD-Δ55 (data not shown). The oligomeric state of HCD and HCD-Δ55 were analyzed by centrifugation of detergent extracts on sucrose density gradients (37Copeland C.S. Doms R.W. Bolzau E.M. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). After the pulse, HCD and HCD-Δ55 immunoprecipitated from the different fractions distributed in a single peak, as the monomeric HA (Fig.3). After a chase period, however, both chimeric proteins with complex type sugars were recovered in denser fractions, showing a similar profile as the mature trimeric HA. A slightly higher percentage of the HCD-Δ55 remains in the lighter density fractions in comparison with HA or HCD following a 3-h chase. This suggests that the rate of oligomerization of the trucation mutant is slightly slower than that of HA or HCD. Nevertheless, these results show that both chimeric proteins acquire the same trimeric conformation as HA.Figure 3Oligomerization of wild type HA and HA/CD-chimeras. Transfected cells were either pulse labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 h (P) or pulse labeled for 1 h followed by a 3-h chase (C). Cell lysates were centrifuged on 5–25% (w/v) sucrose gradients containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Each fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next performed cell surface immunoprecipitations on biosynthetically labeled MDCK cells grown on filters to monitor the appearance of the newly synthesized wild type HA and HCD on the apical or the basolateral surface (Fig. 4).

At low pH a protonation process increases the proportion of both type 1 species at the expense of the type 1.5 species. This process, characterized by a pK a = 4.3, is assigned to the protonation of His121. At high pH the NMR spectrum of the Co(II)-M121H azurin experiences an additional transition, which is not observed in the case of the Cu(II) protein.

The dynamic properties of the M121H metal site appear to be related to changes in the coordination geometry and the strength of the axial interaction between the Nδ1(His121) and the metal. An important challenge in protein engineering is the creation or modification of metal sites in proteins (1Hellinga H.W. Cleland J.L. Craik C.S. Design of Metalloproteins. Wiley-Liss, New York1996: 369-398Google Scholar, 2Regan L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 257-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Properties that one might wish to manipulate range from metal binding strength and metal site stability to redox potential, catalytic activity, and substrate specificity. One way to meet this task is the creation of novel metal binding sites in proteins or protein domains that in their native state have no such site (3Higaki J.N. Haymore B.L. Chen S. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8582-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Browner M.F. Hackos D. Fletterick R. Nat. Struct.

This approach depends heavily on computer-assisted modeling and automated searches for appropriate attachment sites of side chains that can act as metal ligands. The side chains must be able to attain an orientation that is favorable for strong metal binding while at the same time leaving sufficient room for possible substrate binding. The method is demanding and success is not within easy reach, but when successful the result can be spectacular (3Higaki J.N. Haymore B.L. Chen S. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8582-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Browner M.F. Hackos D. Fletterick R. Nat. Struct.

A second approach makes use of natural metalloproteins and modifies existing metal sites by applying changes in the first and second coordination shell of the metal (1Hellinga H.W. Cleland J.L. Craik C.S. Design of Metalloproteins. Wiley-Liss, New York1996: 369-398Google Scholar, 8Barrick D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The advantage of this approach is that it is relatively easy to implement and that the native site provides a solid background against which the properties of the newly created site can be evaluated. Prime examples of proteins for which the second approach has been successful are the heme proteins (9Barrick D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and copper-containing proteins such as superoxide dismutase (10Lu Y. LaCroix L.B. Lowery M.D. Solomon E.I. Bender C.J. Peisach J. Roe J.A. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5907-5918Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the blue copper proteins (11Mizoguchi T.J. Di Bilio A.J. Gray H.B. Richards J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10076-10078Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Canters G.W. Gilardi G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The work described here focuses on the blue copper protein azurin fromPseudomonas aeruginosa. In azurin the metal in the active site is immobilized by three strong ligands (the nitrogen donors His46 and His117, and the sulfur donor Cys112) and a fourth weaker axial ligand (the sulfur donor Met121) (13Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 1071-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The carbonyl oxygen of Gly45provides for an additional axial interaction (13Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 1071-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic properties of the metal site are dominated by the copper-sulfur (Cys112) interaction (14Solomon E.I. Lowery M.D. Science. 1993; 259: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In the native protein this interaction is responsible, among others, for two sulfur-copper charge transfer transitions in the optical absorption spectrum, a weak one around 400 nm and a strong one around 600 nm, a pattern that is characteristic of a (distorted) tetrahedral “type 1” site (14Solomon E.I. Lowery M.D. Science. 1993; 259: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). By modifying the side chain ligands an optical spectrum can be obtained in which the intensity of the two bands is reversed (10Lu Y. LaCroix L.B. Lowery M.D. Solomon E.I. Bender C.J. Peisach J. Roe J.A. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5907-5918Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15den Blaauwen T. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 1121-1129Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This spectroscopic change corresponds with a change in the copper site geometry from (distorted) tetrahedral to square planar, a configuration that is typical of a “type 2” copper site (15den Blaauwen T. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 1121-1129Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Among the ligand mutations that have been explored so far there is one type of modification that leads to a site of which the characteristics have not been properly understood until now (16Karlsson B.G. Nordling M. Pascher T. Tsai L.C. Sjölin L. Lundberg L.G. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Kroes S.J. Hoitink C.W.G. Andrew C.R. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Messerschmidt A. Hagen W.R. Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When Met121 is replaced by an ionizable ligand such as lysine, glutamic acid, or histidine the spectroscopic properties of the site become dependent upon pH and temperature (16Karlsson B.G. Nordling M. Pascher T. Tsai L.C. Sjölin L. Lundberg L.G. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Kroes S.J. Hoitink C.W.G. Andrew C.R. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Messerschmidt A. Hagen W.R. Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For instance, in the optical spectrum the intensity of the band at 400 nm increases at high pH at the expense of the 600-nm band (17Kroes S.J. Hoitink C.W.G. Andrew C.R. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Messerschmidt A. Hagen W.R. Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Changes with pH can also be observed by nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (18Kroes S.J. Salgado J. Parigi G. Luchinat C. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 551-559Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and in the RR, 1The following abbreviations have been used: RR, resonance Raman; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; WEFT, water-eliminated Fourier transformation; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; EXSY, exchange spectroscopy; wt, wild type; pH*, pH meter readings in D2O samples. 1The following abbreviations have been used: RR, resonance Raman; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; WEFT, water-eliminated Fourier transformation; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; EXSY, exchange spectroscopy; wt, wild type; pH*, pH meter readings in D2O samples.

Biochem. 1996; 240: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and perturbed angular correlation spectra (19Danielsen E. Kroes S.J. Canters G.W. Bauer R. Hemmingsen L. Singh K. Messerschmidt A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Since the optical properties seem to be intermediate between those of a type 1 and a type 2 site, the new site has been called “type 1.5” (17Kroes S.J. Hoitink C.W.G. Andrew C.R. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Messerschmidt A. Hagen W.R. Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although structural information on this site has been lacking until now it was thought that the coordination geometry might correspond with a tetrahedral ligand configuration in which the copper has moved out of the plane of its three canonical strong ligands in the direction of the axial ligand at position 121 (17Kroes S.J. Hoitink C.W.G. Andrew C.R. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Messerschmidt A. Hagen W.R. Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Preliminary data from x-ray diffraction studies support this idea. 2A. Messerschmidt, unpublished observations. 2A. Messerschmidt, unpublished observations. However, this provides no clue as to the origin of the pH effects. The changes with pH appear more complicated than what might be expected on the basis of a simple two-state equilibrium, and until now it has not been possible to unravel the behavior of the site with pH. Apparently, changing the metal side chain ligands may introduce fluxionality in the metal binding site. Since this may have a strong bearing on the redox properties or the catalytic activity of a metal site in general, it is important for future reference to try and establish the basis of this fluxionality as accurately as possible. Attempts to pinpoint the nature of the changes that a type 1.5 site undergoes with pH, met with little success (17Kroes S.J. Hoitink C.W.G. Andrew C.R. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Messerschmidt A. Hagen W.R. Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Kroes S.J. Salgado J. Parigi G. Luchinat C. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Inorg.

Biochem. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The methods employed were either not sensitive enough to monitor all the species in solution or the time scale of the technique did not match the time scale of the motion within the site. As the Cu(II) form of the protein is by far the most accessible for spectroscopic characterization (as opposed to the Cu(I) form), all efforts have focused on this form of the protein. Unfortunately, the paramagnetism of the active site seemed to preclude the application of high resolution NMR techniques. The recent successful application of “paramagnetic NMR” to the blue copper proteins has made it clear, however, that with special precautions regarding sample preparation and pulse techniques, the active site of paramagnetic blue copper proteins can be studied in detail by NMR (20Kalverda A.P. Salgado J. Dennison C. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These investigations can be complemented with the NMR study of the Co(II) derivatives (21Piccioli M. Luchinat C. Mizoguchi T.J. Ramı́rez B.E. Gray H.B. Richards J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 737-742Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Salgado J. Jiménez H. Moratal J.M. Kroes S. Warmerdam G. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which exhibit similar dynamic properties but give more extensive NMR information due to their more favorable relaxation properties (23Bertini I. Luchinat C. NMR of Paramagnetic Molecules in Biological Systems. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Menlo Park, CA1986Google Scholar). Here the details of the dynamic behavior of a type 1.5 site are reported for the case of the M121H variant of azurin from P. aeruginosa. It is shown that the equilibrium features of the site, as observed by EPR, paramagnetic NMR (Cu(II), and Co(II) derivatives), RR, and optical techniques, can be analyzed by invoking a three state equilibrium corresponding with three different geometries of the copper site, and that two of these geometries allow the protonation/deprotonation of His121. The results are important in that they illustrate the difficulties encountered in unraveling the type of fluxionality a metal site may become susceptible to, when the native environment of the metal is tampered with. The findings may have important implications for the design of novel or modified metal sites in proteins. Wild-type (wt) and M121HAlcaligenes denitrificans azurins were obtained from the expression of the corresponding genes in Escherichia coli as reported previously (17Kroes S.J. Hoitink C.W.G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13836-13842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Co(II) metalloderivative was prepared by the addition of 5 molar equivalents of CoSO4 to the apoprotein solution at room temperature, and the metal uptake was followed by UV-visible spectroscopy (25Salgado J. Jiménez H.R. Donaire A. Moratal J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Samples for NMR experiments were concentrated by ultrafiltration in Centricon-10 concentration cells (Amicon) up to 4–5 mm. pH meter readings of D2O samples have not been corrected for the deuterium isotopic effect, and they are denoted as pH*. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Unity spectrometers operating at 300 or 400 MHz and on a Bruker DMX 600 MHz spectrometer. The super-WEFT pulse sequence (26Inubushi T. Becker E.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 51: 128-133Google Scholar) was used to detect the fast relaxing signals of the spectrum and to eliminate the solvent H2O or hydrogen deuterium oxide signal. EXSY and NOESY experiments were performed in a phase-sensitive mode using the WEFT-NOESY pulse sequence (27Chen Z. de Ropp J.S. Hernández G. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 8772-8783Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with delays, τ, of 25–50 ms between the 180 ° and 90 ° pulses and with mixing times of 3–10 ms. The spectra were Fourier-transformed using 512 or 1024 data points in both dimensions and square sine-bell weighting functions shifted 60 or 80 °. T 1 values were calculated by single exponential fitting of the signal intensities observed in an inversion-recovery experiment (23Bertini I. Luchinat C. NMR of Paramagnetic Molecules in Biological Systems. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Menlo Park, CA1986Google Scholar). pK a values were determined from the area, A, of the 1H NMR signals of spectra recorded at different pH values, by fitting the data to the following equation A=Amax/(10[pKaap−pH]+1)Equation 1 where A max is the area of the signal at high pH and pK a ap stands for the apparent pK a (see “Discussion”). As noted before (17Kroes S.J. Hoitink C.W.G. Andrew C.R. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Messerschmidt A. Hagen W.R. Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) the spectral changes with pH and temperature appear reversible in the pH range 3.5–10.5 and in the temperature range 5–55 °C. At pH 3–3.5 (irreversible) denaturation of the protein sets in slowly. Electronic spectra were recorded on a Cary 1 spectrophotometer. The 1H NMR spectrum of Cu(II)-wt azurin in D2O is shown in Fig.1 A. It is characterized by the presence of very broad resonances between 40 and 60 ppm (A), a sharper peak between 10 and 20 ppm (B), and an upfield-shifted peak (C). In the case of the Cu(II)-wt amicyanin, signals similar to A, B, andC have been assigned to the imidazole δ2protons of His96 and His54, the α proton of Cys93 and the β1 proton of His54, respectively, by EXSY spectroscopy on a 50% oxidized sample (20Kalverda A.P. Salgado J. Dennison C. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have detected an exchange peak only for signal B (Fig.2), which connects it to the Cys112 CαH proton. The high electron self-exchange rate of azurin (28Groeneveld C.M. Ouwerling M.C. Erkelens C.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2768-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the larger width of the paramagnetic signals, compared with amicyanin, prevent the observation of exchange peaks for signals A and C.Figure 2600 MHz WEFT-EXSY map of a 50% oxidized sample of wild type A. denitrificans azurin in D2O. The spectrum has been recorded at pH* 5.5 and 32 °C using a 3-ms mixing time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When we compare the spectra of Cu(II)-wt (Fig. 1 A) and Cu(II)-M121H (Fig. 1 B) azurins the main differences are the significant sharpening of signal B and the presence of two additional small peaks (2 and 3) close to this signal in the spectrum of the mutant. We will refer to these peaks as signals B2 andB3, and to the main peak Bas signal B1 (Fig. 1 B). Despite the larger width of signal B in the wt azurin, the longitudinal relaxation times of this proton are similar for both proteins (T 1 = 9.4 ± 0.3 ms for signalB from the wt azurin and 8.4 ± 0.2 ms and 7.2 ± 0.5 ms for signals B1 andB2 from the M121H azurin, respectively). No EXSY peaks were observed between reduced and oxidized Cu(II)-M121H azurin due to the low rate of the ESE reaction. 3S. Kroes, unpublished observations. By analogy with the wt azurin spectrum (Fig. 1 A), we assign the peakB1 as deriving from the Cys112 CαH proton. As we show further on, the peaks B1 andB2 are connected to each other by a slow exchange process. The spectrum of Cu(II)-M121H azurin does not change between pH* 5 and pH* 11, but below pH* 4.5 signal B1 decreases in intensity, while the area of the small signalsB2 andB3 increases (Fig.3). SignalsB1 andB2 appear to be connected in an EXSY spectrum where an exchange peak between them is clearly observed (Fig.4).Figure 4WEFT-EXSY spectrum of Cu(II)-M121H azurin (3-ms mixing time) recorded in D2O at pH* 6.0 and 20 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Due to the limited number of paramagnetically shifted resonances observed in the NMR spectrum of Cu(II)-M121H azurin we have studied also the cobalt derivative of this protein. Co(II)-M121H azurin exhibits a UV-visible spectrum which is similar to that of other cobalt-substituted blue copper proteins (22Salgado J. Jiménez H. Moratal J.M. Kroes S. Warmerdam G. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30McMillin D.R. Rosenberg R.C. Gray H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is dominated by intense ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions at 304 and 361 nm, as well as d-d (ligand field) transitions between ∼500 and ∼650 nm. Contrary to the case of the copper derivative of this protein (17Kroes S.J. Hoitink C.W.G. Andrew C.R. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Messerschmidt A. Hagen W.R. Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) the spectrum changes only slightly with pH (data not shown). These changes consist of a small reduction of the intensity of all the bands at pH values lower than 5 and are not large enough to allow the calculation of a pK a value. The 1H NMR spectrum of Co(II)-M121H at pH 6.0 is characterized by a group of paramagnetic signals spread from approximately +220 ppm to −40 ppm (Fig.6, A and B). A first inspection of the spectrum already shows that the majority of the paramagnetically shifted signals can be classified into three types,1, 2, and 3, according to their area (Fig. 6 B). As explained below, this is due to the existence of three species in solution which are in slow exchange. Increasing the temperature changes the equilibrium between these species and the weaker peaks (3) disappear (Fig.7 A). When the pH is changed from 6.0 to 4.2, only minor variations in signal intensities can be observed (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7Temperature (A) and pH (B) dependence of the low field region of the1H NMR spectrum of Co(II)-M121H azurin. Spectra were recorded at 400 MHz on 4 mm protein samples in H2O, using a super-WEFT pulse sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a 4-ms mixing time WEFT-NOESY spectrum recorded at 22 °C and pH 6, exchange cross-peaks are observed which permit grouping together signals that correspond to the same proton (Fig.8). Although the cross-signals are very clear at these conditions, they are not observed when the temperature or the pH are changed, probably because the exchange rate then becomes too fast or too slow for the EXSY peaks to be observed. This also helps us to discriminate between the exchange cross-peaks and normal NOE cross-peaks, since we do not expect the latter ones to be so strongly dependent on pH and temperature. In the 30–80 ppm spectral region at least four sets of three signals each can be distinguished, the signals in each set having relative areas of ∼5, ∼25, and ∼70%. The total area of the signals present in this region (a–f) corresponds to 6 protons, three of which (a, b, and e) are solvent-exchangeable and disappear when the spectrum is registered in D2O. Ring protons from coordinated histidines in cobalt-substituted proteins are normally hyperfine-shifted into the 30–80 ppm region (32Bertini I. Turano P. Vila A. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2833-2932Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Thus, all solvent-exchangeable protons found here we ascribe to imidazole NH groups. By analogy with the spectra of the cobalt derivatives of wt azurin and the M121Q mutant (22Salgado J. Jiménez H. Moratal J.M. Kroes S. Warmerdam G. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as with the spectra of other cobalt-substituted blue-copper proteins like Co(II)-stellacyanin (33Vila A.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the more downfield shifted NH signals (a and b) are assigned to His46 and His117. Of these two, signal a disappears at high pH (Fig. 9). The Nε2H proton of His117 is exposed to the solvent and can enter base-catalyzed fast exchange at high pH (34Moratal J.M. Salgado J. Donaire A. Jiménez H.R. Castells J. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 3587-3588Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, signal ais assigned to the Nε2H proton of His117, and the remaining signal (b) to the Nε2H proton of His46. The third group of labile signals (e) is overlapping with other (CH) signals at around 44 ppm, and the only resolved signal belonging to this NH group is the small signal at 46.8 ppm, e2. When the spectrum is recorded in D2O the group of signals between 42 and 48 ppm loses an area corresponding to one proton. We assign these NH signals (e) to the His121 Nε2H proton. The ring Cδ2H protons from the coordinated histidines normally give rise to relatively sharp signals in the 30–80 ppm region (21Piccioli M. Luchinat C. Mizoguchi T.J. Ramı́rez B.E. Gray H.B. Richards J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 737-742Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Salgado J. Jiménez H. Moratal J.M. Kroes S. Warmerdam G. Canters G.W.

In the spectrum of the Co(II)-M121H azurin, the signals from the three protons of this type, corresponding to the histidines 46, 117, and 121, overlap between 40–45 ppm (signals designatedc–f in Fig. 6 B), with the exception of signals c2 andc3. NOESY cross-peaks are typically observed between these Cδ2H signals and the Nε2H signal of the same histidine ring (21Piccioli M. Luchinat C. Mizoguchi T.J. Ramı́rez B.E. Gray H.B. Richards J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 737-742Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Salgado J. Jiménez H. Moratal J.M. Kroes S. Warmerdam G. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present case, such a correlation peak is only observed between signalsc1 andb1, (Fig. 8 B), which allows us to assign signals c and b to the same histidine (His46, according to the above assignment of signal b). Although the occurrence and behavior of other paramagnetically shifted signals is less relevant to the main goal of this study we briefly describe them here. The very broad signals corresponding to four protons observed downfield in the NMR spectrum of Co(II)-M121H azurin (Fig. 6 A, signalsA–D) are a characteristic feature of cobalt-substituted blue copper proteins (21Piccioli M. Luchinat C. Mizoguchi T.J. Ramı́rez B.E. Gray H.B. Richards J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 737-742Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Salgado J. Jiménez H. Moratal J.M. Kroes S. Warmerdam G.

Biochem. 1995; 231: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been proven for the wt P. aeruginosa azurin that the far downfield shifted signals A and B correspond to the β protons of Cys112 (21Piccioli M. Luchinat C. Mizoguchi T.J. Ramı́rez B.E. Gray H.B. Richards J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 737-742Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). With regard to the signalsC and D, similar signals in wt Co(II) and Ni(II) azurin have been tentatively assigned to the ε1 protons of His46 and His117 (21Piccioli M. Luchinat C. Mizoguchi T.J. Ramı́rez B.E. Gray H.B. Richards J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 737-742Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Salgado J. Jiménez H. Moratal J.M. Kroes S. Warmerdam G. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and these assignments have been proven through one-dimensional NOE for a pair of similar signals found in the 1H NMR spectrum of the Ni(II) derivative of the M121Q azurin (22Salgado J. Jiménez H. Moratal J.M. Kroes S. Warmerdam G. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present spectrum these signals appear significantly broader, possibly due to the effect of the exchange process. Moreover, for signals A and B a splitting into two signals, possibly corresponding to the aforementioned two main species, seems to occur (Fig.6 A). Other paramagnetic signals are observed around 20 ppm (g andh), as well as in the upfield shifted region between −10 and −40 ppm (i–m, see Fig. 6 B). Signal g is an exchangeable proton"
https://openalex.org/W1984758622,"Heparinases are bacterial enzymes that are powerful tools to study the physiological roles of heparin-like complex polysaccharides. In addition, heparinases have significant therapeutic applications. We had proposed earlier that cysteine 135 and histidine 203 together form the catalytic domain in heparinase I. We had also identified a heparin binding domain in heparinase I containing two positively charged clusters HB-1 and HB-2 in a primary heparin binding site and other positively charged residues in the vicinity of cysteine 135. In this study, through systematic site-directed mutagenesis studies, we show that the alteration of the positive charge of the HB-1 region has a pronounced effect on heparinase I activity. More specifically, site-directed mutagenesis of K199A (contained in HB-1) results in a 15-fold reduction in catalytic activity, whereas a K198A mutation (also in HB-1) results in only a 2- to 3-fold reduction in heparinase I activity. A K132A mutation, in close proximity to cysteine 135, also resulted in reduced (8-fold) activity. Heparin affinity chromatography experiments indicated moderately lowered binding affinities for the K132A, K198A, and the K199A mutant enzymes. The above results, taken together with our previous observations, lead us to propose that the positively charged heparin binding domain provides the necessary microenvironment for the catalytic domain of heparinase I. The dominant effect of lysine 199 suggests an additional, more direct, role in catalysis for this residue.

Heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs) 1The abbreviations used are: HLGAG, heparin-like glycosaminoglycan; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; r-heparinase I (-L), recombinant heparinase I and -L. play an intricate role in the extracellular matrix, regulating a wide variety of biological functions (1Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 2Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellén L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). HLGAGs are highly sulfated, complex, acidic polysaccharides consisting of alternating uronic acid (l-iduronic or d-glucuronic acid) andd-glucosamine residues connected through 1–4 linkages. Variations in the degree and distribution of sulfation result in a high degree of chemical heterogeneity in HLGAGs. Three enzymes that degrade HLGAGs (heparin and heparan sulfate), viz. heparinases I, II, and III from Flavobacterium heparinum, recognize unique sequences of sulfation and uronic acid epimerization in HLGAGs with a high degree of specificity (3Lohse D.L.

Heparinases have important clinical applications such as in the monitoring of heparin levels in blood (approved by the FDA) (6Tejidor L. Oman D. Zimmermann J. Russo A. Rose M. Borzhemskaya L. Pelzer H. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1993; 69: 866Google Scholar), neutralization of heparin in blood (in phase III clinical trials), and in production of low molecular weight heparins for use in humans. In addition, heparinases I and III are potent inhibitors of neovascularization (7Sasisekharan R. Moses M.A. Nugent M.A. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). More importantly, heparinases have proven to be useful tools in understanding the important physiological roles of HLGAGs (8Ernst S.E. Langer R.S. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 9Binari R. Staveley B. Johnson W. Godavarti R. Sasisekharan R. Manoukian A.

Our group has cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli the genes for heparinases I, II, and III from F. heparinum (10Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc.

We subsequently carried out extensive biochemical studies to investigate structure-activity relationships of heparinase I and to understand the mechanism of heparin degradation (14Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6846-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Earlier we showed that cysteine 135, in a highly positively charged environment, is catalytically active in heparinase I (14Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We proposed that one possible role of the positively charged active site would be to lower the pK a of the cysteine such that it is present as a thiolate anion in the enzyme active site. As an anion, cysteine 135 could initiate catalysis by acting as a base for proton abstraction from the substrate heparin. In another study, using a combination of chemical and proteolytic digests of heparinase I in direct binding and competition assays, we identified and mapped a primary heparin binding site in heparinase I spanning residues 196–221 of the heparinase I primary sequence (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This region contains two positively charged clusters (residues 197–204 and 207–212) as well as a calcium binding consensus motif (residues 207–220) (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these positively charged clusters conform to the Cardin-Weintraub heparin binding consensus sequence (17Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a parallel study we showed that histidine 203, contained in one of the positive clusters of the primary heparin binding site, is critical for catalytic activity in heparinase I (16Godavarti R. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6846-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This provided compelling evidence for the positively charged heparin binding site being in close proximity to the active-site cysteine 135, and hence we proposed that cysteine 135 and histidine 203 together form part of the catalytic domain in heparinase I (16Godavarti R. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6846-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The above taken together raises the question as to the specific role(s) of the positively charged clusters in heparinase I. Potentially, the basic clusters in the heparin binding site could either provide the necessary charge complimentarity for specific heparin binding and/or bias the active-site reactivity (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Alternatively, given the proximity of these residues to cysteine 135 and histidine 203, specific residue(s) within the putative heparin binding site could play a more direct role in catalysis. In this study we address the role of positive charge in the primary heparin binding site in heparinase I activity using extensive site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa, average molecular mass of 12 kDa and activity of 157 USP units/mg) was from Hepar (Franklin, OH). Urea, dithiothreitol, and acetonitrile were from Allied Chemicals (Deerfield, IL). Other chemicals were from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works (Chesterfield, MO). Molecular mass standards were obtained from Life Technologies. E. coli BL21(DE3) host was from Novagen, WI. Molecular biology reagents and their sources are listed in the appropriate sections below. Heparinase I from F. heparinum was purified as described previously (10Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Yang V.C. Linhardt R.J. Bernstein H. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1849-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified heparinase I was collected and lyophilized (VirTis freeze mobil model 12; VirTis Inc., NY). Heparinase I used for activity measurements was extensively desalted using a Centricon P-30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Protein concentration was determined using Micro BCA reagent (Pierce) relative to a bovine serum albumin standard. The recombinant and mutant heparinases I were expressed without the putative F. heparinum leader sequence, i.e.as a construct ([-L] r-heparinase I) that reads Met-Glu22-Glu23- (10Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To facilitate purification, the heparinase I gene was expressed using the pET-15b system (Novagen). This construct has a polyhistidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site in a 21-amino acid N-terminal leader sequence (14Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced via 12-cycle polymerase chain reaction, as described previously by the method of Higuchi (19Higuchi R. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990Google Scholar). All the mutant genes were cloned into pET-15b and were sequenced to verify the mutations, as described previously (14Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and the proteins were purified as described previously (14Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using precast 12% gels and a Mini Protean II apparatus and stained with the Silver Stain Plus kit (14Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The UV 232-nm assay was performed essentially as described previously (10Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Bernstein H. Yang V.C. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 137: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was directly measured from the increase in absorbance at 232 nm as a function of time. All assays were performed at 30 °C, and the heparin concentration was fixed at 2 mg/ml (100 mm MOPS buffer, 5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0). Activity is expressed as IU (μmol of product formed/min using ε = 3,800m−1). Heparin (2 mg/ml) was incubated with native heparinase I from F. heparinum, r-heparinase I, and mutant enzymes in 100 mm MOPS, 5 mm calcium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, for 18 h. The reaction was then subjected to anion-exchange HPLC to resolve the oligosaccharide products, as described (10Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). About 30–40 μg of -L r-heparinase I and the various mutant enzymes were injected into a heparin-POROS (4.6 × 100 mm) column (PerSeptive BioSystems, Framingham, MA) connected to a BioCAD system (PerSeptive BioSystems). Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–1-m NaCl in 10 min (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) and monitored at 210 nm. EDTA was added to chelate any calcium ions that may be present in the buffers. The primary heparin binding site of heparinase I (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) contains two basic clusters, HB-1 (F197KKNIAHD204) and HB-2 (E207KKDKD212). The basic cluster HB-2 conforms to a XBBXBX heparin binding consensus sequence (21Cardin A.D. Demeter D.A. Weintraub H.J.R. Jackson R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 203: 556-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas HB-1 partially conforms to theXBBBXXBX consensus sequence. Further, HB-2 also is part of a putative calcium binding site, suggesting that a ternary complex of heparin and calcium with heparinase I may primarily involve HB-2. In addition, the primary sequence of heparinase I contains another basic cluster HB-3 (K331NKKPQK337) in the C terminus (10Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that resembles a Cardin-Weintraub consensus sequence. Fig. 1 describes the different mutations in heparinase I made in this study. To map the residues critical for heparinase I activity, the primary heparin binding site (residues 196–221) and tryptic peptide 4 (residues 132–141) that bound heparin in our earlier study (15Sasisekharan R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were chosen as targets for mutagenesis studies. The positive charge in the primary heparin binding site was altered in the following manner. Basic residues from the two consensus sequences, lysines 198 and 199 (HB-1) and lysines 208 and 209 (HB-2), were first jointly altered to alanines (neutral), aspartic acids (negative charge), and arginines (positive charge); lysine 211 (HB-2) was changed to an alanine, whereas catalytically active histidine 203 (HB-1) was altered to an alanine in an earlier study (16Godavarti R. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6846-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). If a double mutation had an effect on catalytic activity, the lysines were individually changed to alanines to examine the possibility of one of the residues having a dominant effect on enzyme activity. Asparagine 200 was changed to a lysine to investigate the effect of increasing the net positive charge in HB-1 and to an alanine to probe the functionality of asparagine 200. A possible role for the C-terminal basic cluster (HB-3) was addressed by jointly altering lysines 333 and 334 to alanines. Furthermore, lysines in the vicinity of HB-1 and HB-2 in the heparin binding site were altered to alanines to probe the functionality of these basic residues. Finally, the role of the two positively charged residues, lysine 132 and arginine-141 in tryptic peptide 4 (K132GIC … R141, which contains the active-site cysteine 135) (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), was examined by individually altering each residue to alanine. All mutant r-heparinases were constructed in the pET-15b expression system (Novagen, WI) and expressed in the BL21(DE3) host as described previously (14Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The level of protein expression for all the r-heparinases was identical in the BL21(DE3) host (data not shown). Kinetic parameters k cat and K m were determined for all the mutants as described previously (11Ernst S.E. Venkataraman G. Winkler S. Godavarti R. Langer R. Cooney C. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The product profiles of heparin degradation were characterized using anion-exchange HPLC (POROS) to resolve the oligosaccharide products as described (10Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Table I lists the kinetic parameters obtained for wild-type r-heparinase I and all the mutant enzymes. When lysine 198 and lysine 199 from HB-1 of the heparin binding site were jointly altered to alanines (creating a double mutant K198A/K199A), the enzyme activity was drastically affected, with a 20-fold reduction in k cat. A similar effect was observed for the K198D/K199D double mutant enzyme. Interestingly, when the lysines 198 and 199 were jointly changed to arginines (K198R/K199R), the enzyme activity remained unaltered, as observed by the k cat value (Table I), suggesting that the positive charge of these residues is important for heparinase I activity. When the heparin degradation reactions of the double mutants K198A/K199A and K198D/K199D were allowed to go to completion and the products were resolved using anion-exchange HPLC, the product profiles were altered when compared with the control r-heparinase I product profile (Fig. 2,a–c); a significant fraction of higher order fragments were observed. The heparin degradation product profile of the K198R/K199R double mutant (Fig. 2 d) was similar to the wild-type enzyme.Table IKinetic constants and heparin affinities of r-heparinase I and mutant enzymesEnzymekcatKmNaCl concentrationsec −1μmmm-L9210.2 (±2.2)480 (±4)K198A/K199A4.75.4 (±1.6)448K198D/K199D4.94.2 (±1.5)445K198R/K199R908.4 (±1.8)475N200A918.9 (±1.8)472N200KND1-aND, Not determined due to very little activity.ND469K198A358.0 (±2.0)448K199A67.6 (±1.9)452K208A/K209A689.6 (±1.4)468K208D/K209D909.2 (±1.5)472K208R/K209R949.1 (±1.5)476K132A128.1 (±1.8)460R141A827.8 (±1.7)4761-a ND, Not determined due to very little activity. Open table in a new tab Since the joint alteration of lysines 198 and 199 affected heparinase I activity, we investigated the effect of individually altering these residues to alanine to examine whether one mutation had a more pronounced effect than the other on heparinase I activity. When lysine 198 was altered to alanine, the activity (k cat) was reduced only by about 2–3-fold (Table I), and the product profile was similar to the wild-type enzyme (Fig.3 b). However the K199A mutation resulted in an approximately 15-fold drop in activity (k cat) when compared with wild-type r-heparinase I (Fig. 3 c). This suggests that lysine 199 in HB-1 plays a dominant role in modulating the enzymatic activity of heparinase I and raises the question of a potential role of this residue in catalysis (see below). Since the positive charge of lysines 198 and 199 were important, the effect of increasing the overall charge in HB-1 (KKNIAH) was investigated by creating a N200K mutation. Furthermore, it must be pointed out that HB-1 does not strictly conform to the Cardin-Weintraub heparin binding consensus sequence. Hence an N200K mutation would result in this region (HB-1) conforming to the ideal Cardin-Weintraub heparin binding consensus sequence and would also result in increased overall positive charge density in the region. The N200K mutation resulted in enzyme activity being diminished to below the sensitivity of our assay (Fig. 4 b). Importantly, an N200A mutation resulted in unchanged enzyme activity, suggesting a nonfunctional role for asparagine 200 (Fig.4 c). These results, coupled with the results of heparin affinity chromatography presented below, indicate that the inability of N200K to perform catalysis is not due to the fact that it binds heparin more tightly, inhibiting turnover. A likely explanation for the N200K result is that the added positive charge topologically interferes with the activities of the neighboring residues or with catalysis. When lysines 208 and 209 were jointly changed to alanines, the enzyme activity (k cat) was reduced by less than 1.5-fold (TableI), and the product profile was similar to wild-type heparinase I (Fig.5). However, neither the K208R/K209R nor the K208D/K209D double mutations altered the activity and product profiles of the mutant enzymes relative to wild-type heparinase I (Fig.5). Further, the K211A mutation (HB-2) did not affect the enzyme activity and product profile (Fig. 3 d). Thus, compared with HB-1, the positive charge in HB-2 of the heparin binding site, within the limits of this study, does not seem to play a significant role in heparinase I activity. However, it must be pointed out that other residues of HB-2 are part of the putative calcium binding site in heparinase I (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the effect of this region in chelating calcium and exploring the role of different residues from the calcium binding consensus sequence in modulating heparinase I activity. Earlier we had shown that the tryptic peptide containing cysteine 135 (tryptic peptide 4) bound heparin, and we had postulated that the heparin binding site (residues 195–221) and the basic residues (lysine 132 and arginine 141) close to cysteine 135 together constitute a heparin binding domain in heparinase I (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hence we sought to investigate the role of two positively charged residues, lysine 132 and arginine 141, in enzyme activity. Although the R141A mutation had no effect, the K132A mutation resulted in lowered enzyme activity (approximately 8-fold reduction in k cat) (TableI; Fig. 6, b and c), suggesting that lysine 132 could also be important in heparinase I activity. More specifically, lysine 132, being in close proximity to cysteine 135, could be integral to enzymatic activity through heparin binding or by activating catalytic residues (see below). The effect of the other basic residue (lysine 205) in the primary heparin binding site in the vicinity of basic cluster HB-1 was also investigated. Mutation K205A (Fig. 6 d) did not affect the activity of the enzyme. In addition, a K333A/K334A mutation in the C-terminal Cardin-Weintraub consensus sequence (HB-3) also resulted in the enzyme activity and product profile being unchanged, suggesting that this region does not play a role in enzyme activity (Fig.4 d). As pointed out earlier (14Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the positive cluster around the catalytic site of heparinase I could play a role either in biasing the reactivity of the active-site residues or in binding to the anionic substrate heparin through charge interactions. To further delineate the role of the positive charge, we performed heparin affinity chromatography experiments with the various mutants as discussed below. We have shown previously that, in the absence of calcium, native heparinase I from F. heparinum binds a heparin-POROS column and can be eluted at a salt concentration of about 500 mm (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that compared with other heparin-binding proteins, such as lipoprotein lipase or fibroblast growth factor, which elute at much higher salt concentrations of about 0.9–1.5 m NaCl (22Klagsbrun M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar,23Hata A. Ridinger D. Sutherland S. Emi M. Shuhua Z. Myers R. Ren K. Cheng T. Inoue I. Wilson D. Iverius P. Lalouel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8447-8457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), heparinase has a lower affinity for heparin (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We used heparin-POROS chromatography to investigate whether the mutations affected heparin binding and hence altered the elution profile. As shown in Table I, wild-type r-heparinase I elutes at a salt concentration of about 480 mm. The K198A/K199A and the K198D/K199D double mutants eluted at lower salt concentrations of about 448 and 445 mm, respectively. The individual mutants K198A and K199A also eluted at lower salt concentrations of about 448 and 452 mm, respectively. Furthermore, the K132A mutation eluted at a moderately lower salt concentration of about 460 mm. The K198/199R double mutant, however, eluted at about 475 mm, similar to wild-type enzyme. The HB-2 mutant enzymes (K208/209A, K208/209D, and K208/209R) also eluted at salt concentrations comparable to wild-type r-heparinase I (Table I). Increasing the positive charge in HB-1 (N200K) did not result in tighter heparin binding, with the mutant eluting at about 469 mm salt concentration. Heparin binding to heparinase is a relatively weak interaction, and the observed effects on heparin binding upon mutagenesis also is not dramatic. Under the experimental conditions tested, relative to wild-type heparinase I, the respective differences in heparin binding observed for the K132A, K198A, and K199A mutations are not as substantial as the differences observed in their respective catalytic activities. This suggests that the observed differences in catalytic activity cannot be explained by lowered heparin binding alone. It is possible that in addition to heparin binding, these residues play a role in maintaining the overall positively charged nature of the environment, which is essential to the catalytic domain. The data presented in this study leads us to postulate that lysine 199 is important for catalysis and raises interesting possibilities for the role of lysine 199 in catalysis. It has been proposed as a general mechanism for polysaccharide lyases (24Gacesa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-202Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar) that an important step in the catalytic mechanism is the neutralization of the negative charge on the C-6 carboxylate anion of the uronate in heparin. This function is most likely performed by a lysine residue by the formation of a salt bridge. Based on the above and the data presented here, it is possible that lysine 199 acts as an acid to stabilize the negative charge developing on the carboxylate of the uronate in heparin. We previously showed that the active-site environment around cysteine 135 is positively charged and hypothesized that the role of the positively charged residues could be to activate the thiol group for catalysis by lowering its pK a (14Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, it is interesting to note that for protein-tyrosine phosphatases (25Zhang Z. Dixon J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which, like heparinases, cleave highly polyanionic substrates, the active-site cysteine is stabilized as a thiolate anion by surrounding positively charged residues. The positively charged environment causes a dramatic reduction in pK a of the active-site cysteine residue (26Stuckey J. Schubert H. Fauman E. Zhang Z. Dixon J. Saper M. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). It is possible that lysine 199 could be one of the residues in heparinase I involved in stabilizing the thiol group of cysteine 135, as observed for the protein-tyrosine phosphatases. The involvement of a cysteine and histidine in the heparinase I active site resembles other enzymatic depolymerization reactions for which the enzymology is much more established. Serine proteases such as chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin (acting on peptide bonds) have been shown to be members of a super gene family whose activity depends on a so-called “charge relay system” involving a catalytic triad of serine, histidine, and aspartic acid (27DiPersio L. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4033-4036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine proteases rely on a similar charge relay system with cysteine, histidine, and asparagine or aspartate (28Lewis S.D. Johnson F.A. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus the mechanism involving a catalytic triad has evolved as a common theme for hydrolases (which catalyze reactions accompanied with the addition of a water molecule), often supported by x-ray crystallographic structure determination. Lyases, on the other hand, catalyze elimination reactions involving removal of a group from or addition of a group to a double bond. Gacesa (24Gacesa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-202Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar) proposed a general mechanism for polysaccharide lyases involving three steps: (i) removal of the negative charge on the carboxylate anion, (ii) a general base-catalyzed abstraction of the C-5 proton from the uronate, (iii) β-elimination of the glycosidic bond and protonation of the leaving group. Three different amino acids are proposed to participate in each of the above three steps. The above taken together and the results presented in this study suggest that cysteine 135, histidine 203, and presumably lysine 199 form the active site in heparinase I. We have shown that the positive charge of the heparin binding site is important for heparinase I activity. Importantly, alteration of lysines 199, 198 (HB-1), and lysine 132 has a more dramatic effect compared with the positive charge of HB-2. Results from heparin affinity chromatography experiments are consistent with our earlier heparin competition experiments (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been observed that in addition to linear heparin binding sequences, protein tertiary and quaternary structures may also control heparin binding (29San Antonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the case of lactoferrin, positively charged residues from two different sequences form a unique structural motif that binds negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (30Wu H. Monroe D. Church F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our results from this study indicate that lysine 132 is possibly brought close to the heparin binding site in the correctly folded structure of heparinase I and all these residues together constitute a heparin binding domain in heparinase I, validating our previous hypothesis (15Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S.E. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we postulate that the positively charged heparin binding domain of heparinase I provides the appropriate microenvironment for activating the catalytic residues (Fig.7). The dominant effect of lysine 199 in heparinase I activity suggests an additional, more direct, role in catalysis for this residue. We propose that lysine 199 could play a role either in stabilizing the negative charge of the uronate of substrate heparin or in stabilizing the thiol group of cysteine 135. We are currently investigating the role of calcium in the catalytic mechanism of heparinase I. Thus, as in hydrolases, heparinase I could also possess a catalytic triad, and hence, this work now lays the foundation to investigate and propose for the first time a catalytic mechanism for heparinase I, in specific, and for polysaccharide degrading lyases in general. We greatly appreciate support, comments and suggestions from Professors Charles Cooney and Robert Langer (Department of Chemical Engineering, MIT) and Professor Phil Robbins (Center for Cancer Research, MIT). We are extremely grateful to Zach Shriver for helpful discussions. We also thank Dr. Ganesh Venkataraman and Steffen Ernst for comments on the manuscript."

Sequence analysis showed that the amino-terminal domain of TPO has a homology with erythropoietin (EPO) that is a member of four-helix bundle cytokine family, but its structure has not been determined either by x-ray diffraction or by NMR. Ligand-induced receptor oligomerization is widely believed to initiate signal transduction for all of the cytokine receptors (8Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cytokine receptors share a conserved extracellular cytokine receptor superfamily module comprising two immunoglobulin-like domains and the characteristic WSXWS box (9Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M.

Some members of this receptor family, such as the human growth hormone (hGH) receptor and EPO receptor, seem to be homodimerized upon ligand stimulation, with each of the two different domains of the cytokine molecule bound to each receptor molecule (12Cunningham B.C.

In the case of the TPO receptor, c-Mpl, the extracellular domain has the two cytokine receptor modules (15Vigon I. Mornon J.P. Cocault L. Mitjavila M.T. Tambourin P. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5640-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), and the activation may also occur through receptor homodimerization (16Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Dunn A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism and the structural information of how the TPO molecule interacts with the receptor molecules is not known. In this study, as a step toward a better understanding of the molecular basis of TPO function, we have identified functionally important regions of TPO by employing two strategies of site-directed mutagenesis based on a three-dimensional model of the amino-terminal domain of TPO and measuring the specific bioactivities of the TPO muteins. First, a limited number of TPO muteins with nonnative N-linked glycosylation sites on the surface region of the amino-terminal domain were prepared and tested, which enabled us to test the TPO model and roughly identify the regions important in interacting with the receptor. Then an alanine replacement scan of the mostly charged residues of the initially identified important regions was performed. We describe here the identification of the functionally important residues in interacting with the receptor. Our result is different from that of the recent report on the mutational analysis of TPO (17Pearce Jr., K.H. Potts B.J. Presta L.G. Bald L.N. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20595-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that showed that alanine substitutions at Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Arg136, Lys138, and Arg140 caused the greatest reduction in receptor binding affinity. The possible reasons for the discrepancies between our result and their result are discussed. A 1.06-kilobase cDNA corresponding to the complete coding sequence of TPO was synthesized by PCR from human liver cDNA library (Stratagene) using 5′ and 3′ primers containingHindIII and EcoRV sites at each end, respectively. The resulting cDNA was subcloned intoHindIII and EcoRV sites of mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to yield TPO expression plasmid. The nucleotide sequence of the TPO cDNA cloned into the plasmid was completely sequenced using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the protocol suggested by the supplier. Mutations were created by an overlap extention PCR method (18Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two partial TPO cDNAs encoding each TPO mutein were separately synthesized by PCR from the wild type TPO cDNA using overlapping antisense or sense oligonucleotides and the 5′ or 3′ primer. The two PCR products were mixed, then the second PCR was performed using the 5′ and 3′ primers. The product was digested with HindIII and EcoRV and subcloned into the HindIII and EcoRV sites of pcDNA3. Each mutant cDNA was completely sequenced to confirm the intended mutation. COS7 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence before transfection. Five μg of each plasmid DNA in 300 μl of Opti-MEMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) in 300 μl of Opti-MEMI medium were mixed and added to the cells. After a 6–12-h incubation at 37 °C, the transfection medium was replaced with 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After an additional 48-h culture, the supernatant was removed for the quantitation of TPO and cell proliferation assay. The amount of TPO secreted into the culture supernatant of the transfected COS7 cells was determined by a sandwich ELISA using goat anti-human TPO polyclonal antibody (R & D Systems) and the biotinylated anti-human TPO polyclonal antibody. Biotinylation of the polyclonal antibody was performed using an Amersham biotinylation kit. To detect the TPO proteins present in the culture medium, the supernatant was diluted 1:100 and added to each well (which had been coated with 1 μg of anti-human TPO polyclonal antibody). After washing, 100 μl of the biotinylated anti-human TPO polyclonal antibody (1:300 v/v) and streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000 v/v; Sigma) were sequentially added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, 100 μl of 0.2 mcitrate-PO4 buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.04%o-phenylenediamine (Life Technologies) and 0.03% H2O2 was added and incubated for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2.5 mH2SO4, and the optical density was measured at 492 nm on a TiterTek ELISA reader. To determine the concentration of secreted TPO, the purified recombinant human TPO (R & D Systems) was used to generate a standard curve. The quantity of wild type or mutant TPO was determined as the mean of duplication in three separate ELISAs. The cell proliferation activity of wild type or mutant TPO was assayed using a recombinant murine BaF3 cell line expressing human c-Mpl (BaF3-Mpl) (1de Sauvage F.J. Philip E.H. Spencer S.D. Malloy B.E. Gurney A.L. Spencer S.A. Darbonne W.C. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Kuang W.J. Oles K.J. Hultgren B. Solberg Jr L.A. Goeddel D.V. Eaton D.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 24Park H. Hong H.J. Mol. Cells. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). The BaF3-mpl cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well, and after 22 h of incubation, the cell growth was determined by a colorimetric MTT assay according to Mosmann (19Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46513) Google Scholar), with some modification (24Park H. Hong H.J. Mol. Cells. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; Sigma) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 5 mg/ml and filtered to sterilize. At the indicated times, the MTT solution (10 μl/100 μl of medium) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The dark blue crystals of MTT formazan formed in the living cells were solubilized by adding 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Pierce). After mixing at room temperature for 10 min, the optical density was measured at 540 nm in an ELISA reader. The optical density at 540 nm in the absence of any source of TPO (nonspecific background) was subtracted from each experimental point. Any nonspecific effect of other substances in the COS7 cell supernatants on the growth of cells has not been identified in the bioassay. The activity of each mutein was determined as the mean optical density of triplicates. Since the three-dimensional structure of TPO is not known, site-directed mutagenesis of TPO was based on the model of the three-dimensional structure of the amino-terminal domain. 2J.-S. Song, H. Park, H. J. Hong, M.-H. Yu, and S.E. Ryu, submitted for publication. The structural model of the amino-terminal domain shows that the domain is comprised of four α-helices arranged with an up-up-down-down topology, and the four helices are located at residues 9–29 (helix A), 56–77 (helix B), 85–107 (helix C), and 127–147 (helix D). To identify the functionally important regions of TPO, a comprehensive alanine replacement scan of TPO would be appropriate, but it would require the preparation and testing of a large number of muteins, which are labor intensive and time consuming. Therefore, to reduce the number of required replacements and also to test the TPO model, 12 novelN-linked glycosylation sites, predicted to be on the external surface of the molecule and scattered almost evenly on the four helices and loops AB and CD, were separately introduced into the amino-terminal domain of the molecule. This was based on the assumption that sugar chains protruding on the surface of the molecule would prevent the adjacent amino acids in primary and/or tertiary structure from interacting with their receptor, and thus this mutation would have a more broad and powerful effect than alanine substitution. Next, the alanine replacement scan was focused on the regions that had been identified to be functionally important by theN-glycosylation replacement scan. Forty-four alanine replacements at mostly surface residues were constructed. All the replacements are presented in Fig. 1. A whole molecule of wild type or mutant TPO was transiently expressed in COS7 cells. The TPO protein secreted into the culture medium by the cells was analyzed for the specific bioactivity, i.e. biological activity/unit mass of protein. The amount of the secreted TPO was determined by a sandwich ELISA using anti-human TPO polyclonal antibody and the biotinylated polyclonal antibody, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown). For the measurement of the biological activity, a stable recombinant BaF3 cell line expressing human c-Mpl was constructed, and the cell proliferation in response to each mutein as well as wild type TPO was measured by colorimetric MTT assay. The bioactivities of the wild type or mutant TPO at different concentrations (0.1–100 ng/ml) are shown in Figs. 2 and3. The cell proliferation stimulated by wild type TPO increased with the increase in the TPO concentration, and thus, it was almost saturated at the highest tested concentration (100 ng/ml). However, some muteins showed moderate or basal activities at the tested TPO concentrations. The other muteins with normal activity showed the same dose-dependent curve as displayed by wild type TPO (data not shown). The specific bioactivity of the wild type or mutant TPO was calculated as the biological activity at 100 ng/ml TPO concentration.Figure 3Dose-dependent proliferation of alanine replacement muteins showing the decreased bioactivity.Dose-dependent proliferation assay was carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In choosing the sites to introduce N-linked glycosylations, we searched for the amino acid residues that are exposed to the surface and upstream of a serine or threonine residue by two amino acids to create the consensus sequence forN-linked glycosylation without disrupting much of the structure. Two sites per each helix or loop AB or CD were mutated, and thus, a total of 12 muteins, each with a single novelN-linked glycosylation site, were prepared, as shown in Fig.1. Control muteins were prepared when charged residues were replaced by asparagine or when double mutations (R98N/L100T and R136N/K138T) were required to create the consensus sequence. The specific bioactivity of each mutein was compared with that of wild type TPO and expressed as a percentage of wild type TPO-specific bioactivity. The data are summarized in Table I.Table IBioactivity of TPO muteins with novel N-linked glycosylationDomainMuteinSpecific bioactivityControl muteinSpecific bioactivity% wild type% wild typeHelix AR17N60.1R17A99.7R25N92R25A96Loop ABD45N45.6D45A90.8W51N14Helix BE56N97.3E56A93.6A66N70.2Helix CQ92N104.6R98N 1-aDouble mutation (R98N, R98N/L100T; R136N, R136N/K138T).12.0R98A98.0L100T57.6Loop CDL108N113R117N100.5R117A96.9Helix DF128N2.8F128A8.6R136N 1-aDouble mutation (R98N, R98N/L100T; R136N, R136N/K138T).0R136A97.5K138T1.81-a Double mutation (R98N, R98N/L100T; R136N, R136N/K138T). Open table in a new tab (a) In predicted helix A, replacement of Arg17by asparagine (R17N) resulted in a considerably impaired specific bioactivity (60.1%), but the control mutein R17A had normal bioactivity, suggesting that the amino acid residues near the Arg17, but not the Arg17 itself, may be involved in receptor binding. In contrast, R25N and R25A muteins retained almost normal activity. (b) In predicted loop AB, D45N had decreased activity (45.6%), whereas D45A had nearly normal activity. Also, mutein W51N had abolished activity (14.0%). These results suggest that areas nearby these residues are important in the receptor binding. (c) In predicted helix B, A66N showed somewhat impaired bioactivity (70.2%), but E56N and E56A had normal activity. (d) In predicted helix C, mutein R98N/L100T had abolished bioactivity (12.0%), whereas control muteins R98A and L100T had normal and considerably impaired activity (57.6%), respectively. These data suggest that Arg98 is not involved in the receptor binding, but nearby residues in the primary or tertiary structure may be involved in the binding. As far as the L100T mutein is concerned, Leu100 is predicted to reside internally on this helix.2 Therefore, it is presumed that the replacement of Leu100 by threonine may partially disrupt the hydrophobic interaction of the helices and affected the activity. (e) In predicted loop CD, two muteins, L108N and R117N, had normal activity. (f) In predicted helix D, R136N/K138T and K138T showed complete loss of bioactivity, whereas R136A as a control mutein had normal bioactivity, suggesting that Lys138, but not Arg136, is directly involved in the receptor binding. Also two muteins, F128N and F128A, had impaired activity. In the model, Phe128 is predicted to be inside this helix, suggesting that Phe128 is very important for the hydrophobic interaction to stabilize its structure. The bioactivities of the tested muteins at a wide (0.1–100 ng/ml) range of TPO concentration are shown in Fig. 2. The four muteins (R17N, D45N, A66N, L100T) showed moderate activities and five muteins (W51N, R98N/L100T, F128N, R136N/K138T, K138T) did not show any activity at the tested TPO concentrations. Taken together, mutations at the five surface residues (R17N, D45N, A66N, R98N and K138T) significantly reduced the activity. These residues mapped to helix A, loop AB, helix B, helix C, and helix D, suggesting that these regions may be involved in receptor binding. An alanine replacement scan of surface residues on the four helices and loop AB was performed. A total of 44 alanine replacement muteins, including the previous eight control muteins for the N-linked glycosylation scan, were prepared as shown in Fig. 1. The specific bioactivities of the muteins are summarized in Table II.Table IIBioactivities of alanine substitution muteinsDomainMuteinSpecific activity% wild typeHelix AR10A11.3K14A78.9R17A99.7D18A107.8H20A108.7H23A103.1R25A96Loop ABP30A102.4E31A93.6H33A104.4P34A106P36A106.6T37A106.2P38A88.6P42A6.6D45A90.8F46A24.9S47A110.7E50A0K52A98.9Helix BE56A93.6E57A95.5K59A103.1D62A101.9G65A108.7L69A104.7E72A—2-aMuteins not quantitated by ELISA.G73A106.7Loop BCR78A96.6Helix CR98A98.0Q105A94.0Loop CDR117A96.9H121A102.2K122A101.4D123A90.9Helix DI127A94.3F128A8.6F131A—2-aMuteins not quantitated by ELISA.Q132A94.6H133A103.4R136A97.5K138A0R140A90.1F141A89.62-a Muteins not quantitated by ELISA. Open table in a new tab (a) In predicted helix A, seven muteins were tested. Among them R10A was nearly inactive (11.3%), and K14A was somewhat inactive (78.9%), whereas the others were active, indicating that the positively charged residues Arg10 and Lys14 may be important for the function. (b) In predicted loop AB, 13 muteins were tested. P42A, F46A, and E50A had completely or considerably decreased bioactivity, whereas the other muteins retained the full activities. According to the TPO model, Phe46 is not predicted to be exposed to the surface. Therefore, Pro42 and Glu50 may be important for the function. (c) In predicted helix B, eight muteins were tested. None of them affected the activity, suggesting that helix B may not be directly involved in the receptor binding. The reduced bioactivity of A66N may be due to the steric hindrance or indirect effect induced by the protruding N-linked sugar. (d) In predicted helix C, there is only one charged residue (Arg98). Alanine replacement of the residue was shown to have no effect on the activity, and the mutein Q105A also had normal bioactivity. The other surface residues in helix C may need to be tested. However, considering that R98N had impaired bioactivity, helix C may be slightly or indirectly involved in receptor binding. (e) In predicted helix D, out of the tested eight muteins, the K138A and F128A showed almost completely abolished activity, and the other mutations did not affect the activity significantly. In the case of the Lys138, replacement by threonine (K138T) also abolished the activity in the N-linked glycosylation scan analysis (Table I). Therefore, Lys138 seems to be very important in receptor binding. In the case of the Phe128, since this residue is predicted to be buried in helix D, it is presumed that this mutation affects backbone conformation of the helices of the amino-terminal domain and thus resulted in the loss of activity. In the case of other regions (loops BC and CD), alanine replacement of charged residues Arg78, Arg117, His121, Lys122, and Asp123 had no significant effect on the bioactivity. E72A and F131A were not secreted well by COS7 cells, as determined by ELISA and therefore could not be assayed for the bioactivity. The six alanine replacement muteins (R10A, P42A, F46A, E50A, F128A, and K138A) that showed nearly abolished bioactivity were assayed using a wide range of TPO concentrations. As shown in Fig. 3, the result was in good agreement with the previous result. Overall, we concluded that Arg10 and Lys14 of helix A, Pro42 and Glu50 of loop AB, and Lys138 of helix D are important functionally in receptor binding.

The amino-terminal domain of TPO was reported to bind to the receptor and stimulate human megakaryopoiesis in vitro and was predicted to have a four-helix bundle structure like EPO (1de Sauvage F.J.

Nature. 1994; 369: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanism and detailed structural information of how the TPO molecule interacts with its receptor are unknown. In this study, to identify functionally important residues that are involved in receptor binding, we constructed a series of site-directed mutants of TPO in which amino-terminal domains had single N-linked glycosylation additions or alanine substitutions based on the three-dimensional model of the amino-terminal domain, and the specific bioactivity of each TPO mutein in the whole molecule was analyzed. Our study identified that Arg10 and Lys14 of helix A, Pro42and Glu50 of loop AB, and Lys138 of helix D are functionally important in the receptor binding. Since these residues are predicted to be on the surface of the molecule, alanine substitutions at these residues are not likely to affect the stability or folding. The functional residues are presented on the three-dimensional model of TPO, as shown in Fig.4. Sequence comparison between human TPO and other mammalian TPO showed that the identified residues (Arg10, Lys14, Pro42, Glu50, and Lys138) are identical among species, suggesting that the critical residues may be conserved evolutionally. The functionally important residues of TPO are analogous to the previously identified receptor binding sites of hGH (22de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar) and EPO (23Caravella J.A. Lyne P.D. Richards W.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). hGH and EPO have two separated regions that interact with two identical receptor molecules. The interaction site I resides in helix D and loop AB, whereas the interaction site II resides in helix A and helix C. The receptor-ligand interactions of both hGH and EPO are mediated mainly by the charged residues in helices A and D. In the case of helix A, Arg16 and Arg19 of hGH and Arg10and Arg14 of EPO are essential for the interaction with their receptors. In case of helix D, Arg167, Lys168, and Asp171 of hGH and Arg143, Arg150, and Lys154 of EPO were shown to be in contact with their receptors. An analogy is also observed in TPO. The Arg10 and Lys14 of helix A and Lys138 of helix D of TPO were shown to be involved in the receptor binding (Table II). On considering that the receptors for hGH, EPO and TPO are homodimerized upon ligand stimulation and all the three cytokines have the functionally important positively charged amino acids in their helices A and D, the interaction of TPO with its receptor is highly likely to occur in the same fashion as hGH and EPO. Taken together, we propose that Lys138 of helix D and Pro42 and Glu50 of loop AB may constitute one functional region, whereas Arg10 and Lys14 of helix A may constitute the other functional region in interacting with two identical receptor molecules. Very recently it was reported by Pearce et al. (17Pearce Jr., K.H. Potts B.J. Presta L.G. Bald L.N. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20595-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that alanine substitutions of TPO at Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Lys59, Arg136, Lys138, and Arg140 caused the greatest reduction in receptor binding affinity. On comparing their data with ours, the localized overall functional regions (helices A and D and loop AB) are the same as our result, but the functionally important residues identified are different, except Lys14 and Lys138. Unlike their results, the specific bioactivities of alanine replacement mutants at Lys52, Lys59, Arg136, and Arg140 were all active in our system. Also, the receptor binding affinity (about 16%) of their K14A mutant is different from the specific bioactivity (78%) of ours. We did not test alanine substitution at Asp8. This discrepancy may be due to the differences in the forms of TPO molecule and the assay systems used in these two studies. They expressed the amino-terminal domain of TPO fused to the gene III coat protein of M13 bacteriophage in Escherichia coli, and the resulting TPO phage was directly used to bind to recombinant Mpl-IgG in an indirect ELISA. The binding affinities of the TPO mutants for the Mpl-IgG were determined by competitive ELISA using soluble TPO receptor as a competitor. We used the whole molecule of wild type or mutant TPO that had been expressed in mammalian cells and secreted by the cells to stimulate the c-Mpl-expressing responsive cells for the determination of the specific bioactivity. In conclusion, we identified the functionally important regions and residues of human TPO that are involved in receptor binding and found that the receptor binding regions are analogous to those of the same cytokine family such as hGH and EPO. This information provides a better understanding of the molecular basis of TPO-receptor interaction. Also, our analysis system will be useful in elucidating a more detailed mechanism of the molecular interaction. Moreover, since TPO has great potential of treating thrombocytopenia that results from chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, this information will be useful in the development of more effective thrombopoietic agents."

N., Bost, K. L., and Blalock, J. E. (1990)J. Biol. Chem. 265, 158–165). In this report we have cloned the full-length cDNA encoding rat SPN and have identified the tissue distribution of SPN expression. The cDNA of SPN is 1882 nucleotides with a 1488-base coding region and 55 and 339 nucleotides of 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences, respectively. Northern gel analysis of rat pituitary mRNA showed a single hybridizing species at ∼2 kilobases. Sequence analyses showed that the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of SPN are novel and unrelated to any known vertebrate inhibitors of proliferation. However, the deduced amino acid sequence of SPN contains two domains that have extensive sequence identity with a recently cloned transcription activator inDrosophila, deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1 (DEAF-1, see Gross, C. T., and McGinnis, W. (1996) EMBO J.15, 1961–1970) suggesting that SPN represents a vertebrate cognate of deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the SPN mRNA and the SPN protein are expressed in every tissue examined including testis, spleen, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, heart, and brain suggesting that SPN may be involved in the control of proliferation in a variety of cell types. Suppressin (SPN) is an inhibitor of cell proliferation that was originally identified and purified to homogeneity from bovine pituitaries (LeBoeuf, R. D., Burns, J. N., Bost, K. L., and Blalock, J.

Burns J.N. Bost K.L. Blalock J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial immunologic and species-specificity studies indicated that SPN was a structurally conserved molecule. Specifically, (i) anti-SPN antibodies prepared against purified bovine SPN cross-reacted with human, mouse, and rat SPN (1LeBoeuf R.D. Burns J.N. Bost K.L. Blalock J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ban E.M. Propst S.M. Blalock J.E. LeBoeuf R.D.

Sci. 1990; 594: 393-395Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and (ii) purified bovine SPN was active on mouse, rat, and human cells. Other cross-species activities could also be shown for SPN (e.g. human SPN was active on rat cells). In the rat pituitary, SPN production is restricted to five hormone-secreting cell phenotypes (somatotrophs, lactotrophs, corticotrophs, thyrotrophs, and mammosomatotrophs) in the anterior pituitary (2Ban E.M. Propst S.M. Blalock J.E. LeBoeuf R.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The primary biological activity, inhibition of cell proliferation, has been most extensively studied in vitro in murine and human lymphocytes (1LeBoeuf R.D. Burns J.N. Bost K.L. Blalock J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Carr D.J. Blalock J.E. Green M.M. LeBoeuf R.D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 30: 179-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The inhibition of cell proliferation by SPN does not occur by either a cytotoxic mechanism or by increasing the rate of apoptosis (1LeBoeuf R.D. Burns J.N. Bost K.L. Blalock J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of cell cycle analyses on SPN-treated lymphocytes have shown that SPN arrests cells in G0 or early G1 stages of the cell cycle (3Carr D.J. Blalock J.E. Green M.M. LeBoeuf R.D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 30: 179-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Suppressin also inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells. The addition of exogenous SPN to cultures of leukemia, lymphoma, and thymoma cells and tumor cells from brain, adrenal, breast, and pituitary resulted in markedly reduced proliferation (4LeBoeuf R.D. Blalock J.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 594: 393-395Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The results of metabolic labeling have shown that SPN is synthesized and secreted as an active molecule by human and mouse lymphocytes and GH3 cells (1LeBoeuf R.D. Burns J.N. Bost K.L. Blalock J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Carr D.J. Blalock J.E. Green M.M. LeBoeuf R.D. J.

Moreover, neutralization of secreted SPN in culture supernatants by anti-SPN antibodies (Ab) increases proliferation in the absence of exogenous growth factors (6Ban E.M. LeBoeuf R.D. Immunol. Res. 1995; 13: 1-9Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) showing that SPN acts as an autocrine/paracrine inhibitor of entry into the cell cycle. Collectively, the results of our studies show that SPN is a fundamental component of a regulatory circuit that functions to maintain cells in a nondividing state. To understand the structure, function, and regulation of SPN, we cloned, sequenced and characterized the full-length SPNcDNA from the rat pituitary. The molecular cloning of SPN was accomplished by immunoscreening a pituitary cDNA library with an anti-SPN Ab, by DNA hybridization screening of cDNA libraries with a partial SPN cDNA, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using rat pituitary mRNA. The results of sequence analyses and comparisons showed that SPN is a novel vertebrate regulatory molecule. However, SPN is highly homologous to DEAF-1, a recently cloned molecule fromDrosophila (7Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, we provide results from studies on the tissue distribution of SPN expression, on structural characteristics of SPN, and on the expression of recombinant SPN. Whole pituitaries were surgically removed from male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan) as described previously (2Ban E.M. Propst S.M. Blalock J.E. LeBoeuf R.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate/cesium chloride method (8Chirgwin J. Przybyla R. MacDonald R. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16608) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ mRNA was obtained by two rounds of chromatography over oligo(dT)-cellulose type 7 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described previously (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA (10–20 μg) or poly(A+) mRNA (1–5 μg) was denatured in 50% (v/v) formamide and 2.2 m formaldehyde and resolved by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, and the gel was transferred to Biotrans (ICN, Irvine, CA) nylon membranes by capillary diffusion in 10 × SSC using standard procedures (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Membranes were baked for 2 h at 80 °C in a vacuum oven and prehybridized and hybridized in the following buffer (0.5 m NaHPO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin).32P-Labeled SPN cDNA probes were prepared from gel-purified cDNAs using a Nick Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont). For hybridization, radiolabeled SPN cDNA probes were added at 2 × 106 cpm/ml. Pre-hybridization (4–6 h) and hybridization (10–12 h) were done at 42 °C in 50% formamide in 5 × SSC, and membranes were washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C followed by two washes in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. The membrane was then exposed to Kodak XAR film at −70 °C for 10–20 h. Slot blot analyses were performed with total rat RNA, and the membranes were prehybridized, hybridized, and washed as described above except the temperature for these procedures was 45 °C. Two oligodeoxynucleotides were used as probes as follows: one that was complementary to the cDNA sequence containing the largest open reading frame (5′-TGATGGCTTCTCAGTAGAG-3′), and the complement to this oligodeoxynucleotide that is homologous to the cDNA sequence containing the open reading frame. Both oligodeoxynucleotides were labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase by standard procedures (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An oligo(dT) adaptor-primed unidirectional rat pituitary cDNA library was constructed from rat pituitary poly(A)+ mRNA using a Uni-Zap XR/Gigapack Cloning system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This cDNA library was immunoscreened (1 × 106individual plaque-forming units) using a previously characterized (1LeBoeuf R.D. Burns J.N. Bost K.L. Blalock J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) monospecific polyclonal anti-SPN Ab and Ab-positive clonal plaques detected using a BioStain Super ABC alkaline-phosphatase immunodetection kit (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). After tertiary replating, the Ab-positive clonal plaques were analyzed for clonality and cDNA insert size by PCR with vector-specific primers that flank the XhoI/EcoRI cloning site in the Uni-Zap XR vector as described previously (10LeBoeuf R.D. Green M.M. Berecek K.H. Swords B.H. Blalock J.E. Neth. J. Med. 1991; 39: 295-305PubMed Google Scholar). The largest cDNA insert (691 bp) was direct-sequenced and then used as a probe to rescreen the rat pituitary Uni-Zap XR cDNA library. After tertiary replating, one larger clone was obtained by nucleic acid hybridization screening, with an insert of 924 bp corresponding exactly to the SPN 691-bp cDNA sequence but extended at its 5′ end. The SPN 924-bp cDNA was subcloned in M13mp18 and mp19 by standard methods (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the sequence of this cDNA was determined in both orientations. DNA sequencing was performed using the Sanger dideoxy sequencing method with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence analyses were performed with the Genepro program (Riverside Scientific, Bainbridge Island, WA). Homology searches and protein structure analyses were performed using the GCG programs (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) against all available public sequence data bases. The partial SPN cDNA sequence (924 bp) was used to designSPN-specific reverse transcriptase (RT) and PCR primers for use in a 5′-RACE system (Life Technologies Inc.) to obtain the full-length cDNA sequence of SPN. Briefly, an antisense SPN-specific primer (SSP-1) that was approximately 100 bp downstream from the 5′ end of the 924-bp SPN cDNA sequence was used in a reverse transcription reaction (RT) with one μg of rat pituitary poly(A)+ mRNA. An oligo(dC) anchor sequence was added to the 3′ end of RT reaction products with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The oligo(dC)-tailed cDNA was amplified by PCR using a nested antisense SPN-specific primer (SSP-2) that was approximately 50 bp upstream of SSP-1 and the anchor primer provided in the 5′-RACE system. PCR was performed for 50–60 cycles with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase under standard reaction conditions (10LeBoeuf R.D. Green M.M. Berecek K.H. Swords B.H. Blalock J.E. Neth. J. Med. 1991; 39: 295-305PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and selected products were excised from the gel and purified using a Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The purified cDNA was cloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and both strands of the cDNA insert were completely sequenced. Four iterations of this procedure were required to obtain the complete cDNA sequence of the SPN transcript. Once the complete SPN cDNA sequence was obtained, a 5′ sense SPN primer (5′-CGGGATCCCATGGCGGCCGAATCTG-3′) which contained aBamHI site and a 3′ antisense SPN primer (5′-TGATGGCTTCTCAGTAGAG-3′) which contained a Bpu1102I site were synthesized and used in PCR with oligo(dT)-primed cDNA synthesized from rat pituitary poly(A)+ mRNA as template. For these reactions the thermostable proofreading DNA polymerase Pfu (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used in PCR. This reaction yielded a 1583-bp SPN cDNA that contained the complete coding sequence beginning with the first in-frame start codon and 40 bp of 3′-untranslated region. This cDNA was cloned in the pGEM-T vector, and both strands from three independent clones were sequenced. The 120-amino acid peptide deduced from the 691-bp cDNA was analyzed for highly antigenic regions using the Hoop and Woods hydropathy index to predict antigenic regions within this peptide. One such region, a nonapeptide NH2-QRKVWKDHQ-COOH, was synthesized, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a carrier immunogen (2.5 mg of peptide + 2.5 mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin) using a standard glutaraldehyde coupling protocol (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and then used to immunize a New Zealand White rabbit (500 μg/injection). The rabbit received booster injections at 10-day intervals. The presence of anti-peptide antibodies was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the peptide covalently linked to a 96-well COBIND microtiter plate and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary Ab. Thirty days after immunization, serum was obtained from the rabbit, and the Ig fraction of the sera was purified by protein G-Sepharose affinity chromatography (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To determine if the Abs in the postimmune Ig fraction would specifically recognize SPN, homogeneous pituitary SPN was covalently attached to COBIND microtiter wells and assayed for specific binding by the Abs in the Ig fraction using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BamHI and Bpu1102I endonuclease restriction sites flanking the coding region of the SPN cDNA were constructed by PCR using the 1583-bp SPN cDNA in pGEM-T as template and Pfu polymerase. The reaction product was sequentially digested with BamHI and Bpu1102I, gel purified, and ligated in-frame in the BamHI/Bpu1102I site of expression vector pET-15b (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting fusion protein contained six consecutive histidine residues (His-Tag) on its amino terminus. The orientation and sequence of the SPN cDNA in the pET plasmid were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The SPN cDNA was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE53, pLysS) by growing the bacterial cells at 30 °C and following an induction protocol previously described (11Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar); the recombinant protein was purified by metal chelation chromatography (12Hoffman A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+mRNA from several rat tissues were obtained commercially (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). mRNA (250 ng) from each tissue was used as template in an oligo(dT)-primed first-strand cDNA synthesis with Superscript RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Each reaction was treated with DNase I before the addition of RT and cDNA synthesis using a standard protocol (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A replicate first-strand cDNA reaction in which RT was not added was performed for each tissue as a control for the presence of genomic DNA. One-tenth of the first-strand cDNA synthesis reaction was used as template with a sense SPN primer (5′-TGGAGATGTCAGAGCATCG-3′) and an antisense SPN primer (5′-TGATGGCTTCTCAGTAGAG-3′) that will amplify a 402-bp target sequence of the SPN cDNA. The products from each set (with and without RT) of PCR reactions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Restriction analysis was performed on part of each reaction and yielded the expected restriction fragments for the SPN target sequence (data not shown). Rat tissues were collected and fixed in 5% glacial acetic acid in 95% ethanol at −20 °C for 24 h before embedding in paraffin. Serial sections 4 μm thick were cut and stained on glass slides. Staining for SPN expression was performed using an anti-SPN monoclonal antibody (mAb) (3F10; Ref. 2Ban E.M. Propst S.M. Blalock J.E. LeBoeuf R.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The specificity of this anti-SPN mAb has been previously demonstrated on intracellular SPN in rat pituitary cells (2Ban E.M. Propst S.M. Blalock J.E. LeBoeuf R.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). 3F10 binding to intracellular SPN from rat pituitary cells is specifically blocked by preincubation of the mAb with pure native SPN (2Ban E.M. Propst S.M. Blalock J.E. LeBoeuf R.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Sections were stained in PBS containing 10% goat serum/Tween 0.05% and 2 μg/ml of anti-SPN mAb. The levels of background staining (negative control) were obtained by incubating the sections with an irrelevant isotype-matched (IgM) mAb (UAB mAb Core Facility). After incubation with the mAb (1.5 h at room temperature), the slides were washed three times in PBS and incubated with PBS/Tween 0.05% containing a biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgM (μ-chain specific) antibody (5 μg/ml) (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Slides were washed three times in PBS and incubated with streptavidin coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate at the concentration of 1 μg/ml in PBS/Tween 0.05% for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, the slides were mounted in ethanol and photographed using a Leitz Diaplan microscope (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany). GH3 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were cultured in RPMI, 10% horse serum. PBMC were cultured in RPMI, 5% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Supernatants were collected and concentrated 40 times using CENTRIPREP 30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Cell extracts were prepared from 108 cells with standard procedures (7Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and proteins were separated by electrophoresis using a 4–20% continuous gradient Tris-HCl acryl/bisacryl gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting under 30 mV for 16 h at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in Tris borate saline (TBS), 3% casein, 10% goat serum, washed, and then incubated with the 3F10 mAb (2.5 μg/ml) for 1.5 h at room temperature. After three washes, membranes were incubated with a biotinylated goat antibody against mouse immunoglobulin (H + L) (0.2 μg/ml), washed again 3 times and then incubated with avidin conjugated to horse peroxidase (1 μg/ml). Membranes were washed before a 60-s incubation with the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Corp.) and exposed for 5 min to autoradiographic film. Two hundred ng of affinity purified native rat SPN was analyzed for the presence of Asn-linked oligosaccharides by digestion with the glycosidase, PNGase F, according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Glyko Inc., Novato, CA). A parallel reaction in which fetuin was digested with PNGase F served as a positive control for enzyme activity. PNGase F and control reactions (without PNGase F) were performed for SPN and the control glycoprotein, fetuin, and the reaction products were analyzed under reducing conditions on 10% SDS-PAGE (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar), and protein bands were stained with silver (14Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.A. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). A polyclonal anti-SPN antibody (Ab) prepared against purified bovine SPN (1LeBoeuf R.D. Burns J.N. Bost K.L. Blalock J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to screen a rat pituitary cDNA library. This Ab cross-reacts with bovine, human, mouse, and rat SPN (1LeBoeuf R.D. Burns J.N. Bost K.L. Blalock J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Carr D.J.

Sci. 1990; 594: 393-395Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The initial screening (1 × 106 clones) yielded 10 independent clones after tertiary replating, and Southern analysis indicated that all clones were related. Both strands of the largest clone (clone 12) were sequenced, and it had an insert size of 691 bp. One strand of the clone 12 cDNA contained a poly(A) tail, two polyadenylation signal sequences within 50 nucleotides of the poly(A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 120-amino acid peptide. The results from Northern gel analyses using rat pituitary mRNA and the clone 12 cDNA as a probe showed that this cDNA hybridized to a single mRNA species that was ∼2 kilobases (Fig.1). To identify the coding strand of clone 12, two 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to each strand were synthesized and used as probes in slot analysis with rat pituitary total RNA. Only the oligodeoxynucleotide that was complementary to the sequence with the poly(A) tail and the ORF hybridized to pituitary total RNA showing that this was the coding strand of the SPN cDNA (Fig.2). At this point we also showed that the clone 12 cDNA sequence was an authentic partial clone of theSPN cDNA. Antibodies prepared to a synthetic peptide derived from the deduced 120-amino acid ORF of clone 12 specifically bound pure native SPN in a solid phase assay (TableI).Figure 2Slot blot RNA analysis with SPN oligodeoxynucleotides. Rat total RNA was probed with two complementary oligodeoxynucleotides from the same region of the cDNA. One oligodeoxynucleotide was complementary to the sequence of the cDNA strand that contained the largest open reading frame (A) and one was complementary to the opposite strand of the cDNA.

One larger clone was isolated in the second round of screening with an insert size of 924 bp. This cDNA was sequenced in both directions, and it was identical to the 691-bp sequence of clone 12 and provided an additional 233 bp of new nucleotide sequence that extended the size of the ORF to 195 amino acids. Preparation of new rat pituitary cDNA libraries and nucleic acid hybridization screening of these libraries failed to produce any larger SPN cDNA clones. The inability to clone larger SPN cDNAs from these libraries using the clone 12 cDNA as a probe was unexpected, because the quality (recombinant titer and average size) of all libraries used were normal, and these libraries have been used to clone cDNAs of similar size to the size of SPN cDNA. It may be that the SPN transcript contains structural features that lead to the generation of truncated transcripts or that SPN recombinants are unstable, and their proportion in the library is reduced. To overcome this problem, PCR and 5′-RACE were used to obtain the remaining sequence of the SPN cDNA. The sequences obtained were used to generate the full-length SPN cDNA sequence and to design primers that were then used to PCR amplify from the 5′ end of the sequence through the complete ORF. This PCR product was cloned in pGEM-T, and three independent clones were sequenced in both directions to obtain the complete cDNA sequence of SPN. The rat full-length SPN cDNA isolated is 1882 nucleotides (Fig.3), and the size of this cDNA agrees with estimates of the size of the SPN mRNA obtained by Northern gel analysis. The complete SPN cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1488 nucleotides that extends from the first translation consensus sequence (15Kozak M. Nucleic Acid Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar) of an initiation codon at position 56 to the first termination codon at position 1545. The entire cDNA contains 55 and 339 nucleotides of 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences, respectively. Translation of the cDNA results in a predicted protein of 496 amino acids with a relative M r of 53,113 (Fig.4), which is less than the molecular mass previously observed for native SPN (∼63 kDa) by SDS-PAGE analysis. Differences in the actual molecular mass of a protein and its electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE analysis could be due to either post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation and/or phosphorylation) and/or to specific regions that bind SDS anomalously and affect electrophoretic mobility (16Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Query C.C. Bentley R.C. Keene J.D. Cell. 1989; 57: 89-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The results of bacterial expression studies using the SPN coding sequence (Fig.5) suggest that the SPN protein contains structural regions that apparently bind SDS anomalously and affect its electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5). The expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli typically leads to the production of proteins that are not modified post-translationally. Therefore, analyses of the mass of recombinant forms by SDS-PAGE reveals proteins of lower molecular weight compared with native proteins that are post-translationally modified. However, SDS-PAGE analysis of SPN produced by E. coli (Fig. 5) showed that it migrated at molecular mass higher (∼63 kDa) than predicted by the deduced amino acid sequence (∼53 kDa). Consistent with the idea of structural features of SPN as a major cause of anomalous electrophoretic mobility are the results fr"
https://openalex.org/W2053386892,"We previously identified a protein from rat liver that binds CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT). We have now purified this protein (cytidylyltransferase-binding protein (CTBP)) from rat liver. The purification involved precipitation at pH 5 and extraction of the precipitate with buffer, followed by sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and butyl-agarose. Final purification was accomplished by either preparative electrophoresis or hydroxylapatite chromatography. Amino acid sequences from six peptides derived from pure CTBP matched sequences in transcytosis-associated protein (TAP) with 98% identity. Thus, CTBP was positively identified to be TAP. Purified CTBP increased the activity of purified CT measured with phosphatidylcholine (PC)/oleic acid. In the absence of PC/oleic acid, CTBP did not stimulate CT activity. Dilution of CT to reduce the Triton X-100 concentration produced a loss of CT activity. The lost activity was recovered by the addition of CTBP plus PC/oleic acid to the assay, but not by the addition of either PC/oleic acid or CTBP alone. Removal of CTBP from purified preparations by immunoprecipitation with CTBP antibodies eliminated the activation of CT. Both CT and CTBP were shown to bind to PC/oleic acid liposomes. The formation of complexes between CT and CTBP in the absence of PC/oleic acid liposomes could not be demonstrated. These results suggest that CTBP functions to modify the interaction of CT with PC/oleic acid liposomes, resulting in an increase in the catalytic activity perhaps by the formation of a ternary complex between CT, CTBP, and lipid. Overall, these results suggest that CTBP (TAP) may function to coordinate the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine with vesicle transport.

CT exists intracellularly in inactive and active forms. Regulation of CT involves interconversion of these forms. There is abundant evidence indicating that the active form of CT is associated with membranes (reviewed in Refs. 1Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 3Kent C. Prog.

A variety of mechanisms have been suggested to explain the activation of CT in response to a variety of stimulatory treatments. These include changes in the state of CT phosphorylation (4Watkins J.D.

The involvement of other cellular proteins in the overall regulation of CT is an additional possibility that has not been fully explored. The identification of a 110-kDa protein that binds CT (17Feldman D.A. Weinhold P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3127-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led us to consider in more detail the potential involvement of this protein in the regulation of CT. We subsequently found that complexes between CT and the cytidylyltransferase-binding protein (CTBP) were formed by incubation of liver cytosol with oleic acid (18Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Further insight into the function of this protein required the isolation of purified protein. We have now purified CTBP from rat liver cytosol. Amino acid sequences from six peptides derived from pure CTBP matched sequences in transcytosis-associated protein (TAP) from rat liver (19Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Studies on the effects of purified CTBP on the activity of CT suggested that CTBP enhances the activation of CT by lipids. We obtained [methyl-14C]phosphocholine from American Radiolabeled Corp. Protogel (30% acrylamide and 0.8% bisacrylamide) purchased from National Diagnostics, Inc. was used to prepare polyacrylamide gels. The ECL reagent was purchased from Amersham Corp. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and a minipreparative electrophoresis cell were purchased from Bio-Rad. DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and butyl-agarose were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP) was from Bio-Rad. Peflabloc was from Boehringer Mannheim. Phosphatidylcholine, oleic acid, sodium oleate, CTP, phosphocholine, protease inhibitors, and all other biochemicals were from Sigma. Antiserum (N-1) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of CT was provided by Dr. Claudia Kent (University of Michigan) (20Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5686-5692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The production and preparation of antiserum (AS-II) that detects CTBP were described previously (17Feldman D.A. Weinhold P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3127-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures of Sf9 insect cells infected with baculovirus cloning vector carrying the full-length coding sequence for CT (21MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Claudia Kent and Joel Clement (University of Michigan). We purified cytidylyltransferase from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells using the method previously reported for rat liver (21MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Weinhold P.A. Rounsifer M.E. Feldman D.A. J. Biol.

Cytidylyltransferase activity was determined as described previously (24Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Assays contained 1.6 mm [14C]phosphocholine (1000 dpm/nmol), 6 mm CTP (adjusted to pH 7.0), 24 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. All assays contained 100 μmphosphatidylcholine/oleic acid (1:1 molar ratio) unless otherwise indicated. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 10% polyacrylamide slab gels (12 cm × 16 cm × 1.5 mm) using a Bio-Rad Protean II system as described previously (17Feldman D.A. Weinhold P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3127-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples contained 2% SDS and 5% mercaptoethanol and were boiled for 5 min. Silver stain analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gels was performed using the method of DeMorenoet al. (25DeMoreno M.R. Smith J.F. Smith R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Molecular mass standards (Sigma M-5505) were used to calibrate the gels. SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels were stained overnight using 0.1% Amido Black prepared in 30% methanol and 1.0% acetic acid. The gel was destained in 30% methanol and 0.3% acetic acid. We detected CTBP immunologically on either Western blots or slot blots. Proteins separated by SDS gel electrophoresis were transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (17Feldman D.A. Weinhold P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3127-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For slot blots, 10–50-μl aliquots were diluted to 200 μl with TBS (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl) and applied to nitrocellulose membranes using a microfiltration manifold (Bio-Rad). The detection of CTBP in glycerol and sucrose gradients was done by direct application of 5–10 μl to nitrocellulose membranes. The dried membrane was submerged briefly in 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with TBS, and dried. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS for 3 h at room temperature. The blot was probed overnight at 4 °C with N-1 or AS-II antiserum diluted in TBS containing 3% nonfat milk, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20. For all subsequent procedures, we used glass roller bottles in a Techne hybridizer oven. The blot was washed four times with 100 ml of TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. We probed the blot with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution) in TBS containing 3% nonfat milk, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. We washed the blot three times with 100 ml of TBS containing 0.3% Tween 20 and three times with 100 ml of TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL reagent. We measured the relative optical densities and areas of the bands on a microcomputer imaging device (Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada). We defined a scan density unit as the relative optical density multiplied by the area of the band. Male rats (200–250 g) were anesthetized with chloral hydrate, and livers were perfused with 0.9% NaCl. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. We used 80–100 g of liver for each preparation. In the purification described below, we used 80 g of liver. Livers were homogenized at 4 ml/g of liver in Buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.025% sodium azide, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm Peflabloc, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml α-aminobenzamidine, and 1.0 μg/ml antipain)). The cytosol was isolated by sequential centrifugation at 17,000 × gfor 20 min and at 125,000 × g for 60 min. We diluted the cytosol to 8 mg/ml protein with Buffer A. The pH of the cytosol was reduced to 5.0 by the addition of 1.0 m acetic acid. We stirred the mixture on ice for 20 min and centrifuged the suspension at 12,500 × g for 20 min. We extracted the precipitate in a volume of Buffer A equal to the volume of the original cytosol. After stirring at 4 °C for 20 min, we centrifuged the mixture at 17,000 × g for 20 min to recover the soluble extract. Under these conditions, nearly all of the CTBP was solubilized along with ∼35% of the CT activity. A DEAE-Sepharose column (2.2 × 12 cm) was packed and equilibrated with Buffer A at a flow rate of 90 ml/h. The extract from the pH 5.0 precipitate (350 mg of protein in 320 ml) was applied to the column at a flow rate of 45 ml/h. The column was washed with 250 ml of Buffer A. The column was eluted with a 500-ml gradient of NaCl (150–400 mm) prepared in Buffer A. CTBP coeluted with a small peak of protein at ∼300 mm NaCl. A large protein peak eluted just before CTBP. Fractions containing CTBP were pooled from the DEAE-Sepharose column. The pool (19 mg of protein in 100 ml) was adjusted to 800 mm phosphate by adding 2.0 m ammonium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmDTT, and protease inhibitors. All subsequent phosphate buffers contained 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. The sample was applied to a butyl-agarose column (1.6 × 12 cm) equilibrated with 800 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 7.4. The column was then washed with 100 ml of 800 mmammonium phosphate, pH 7.4. CTBP was eluted from the column with a 250-ml gradient (800 to 20 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 7.4). The gradient was followed by 100 ml of 20 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 7.4. CTBP was eluted at ∼100 mm phosphate. More than 90% of the applied protein and the remaining CT were eluted ahead of CTBP. CTBP-containing fractions from the butyl-agarose column were pooled and concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration in a 30K Macrosep (Filtron Technology Corp.). We changed the buffer content of the CTBP preparation by repeatedly concentrating the preparation after dilution with 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8. The final concentrated pool contained 2.7 mg of protein in 1.3 ml. Preparative native electrophoresis was performed using a Bio-Rad minipreparative cell. The lower gel (7.5 cm) contained 4% polyacrylamide and 0.376 m Tris, pH 8.8. The upper gel (1.25 cm) contained 4% polyacrylamide and 0.124 m Tris, pH 6.8. The electrode and elution buffers contained 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3. The sample buffer contained 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8. A 450-μl sample (900 μg of protein) of concentrated CTBP was mixed with 75 μl (v/v) of 25% glycerol and bromphenol blue tracking dye in 0.30 m Tris, pH 6.8. This mixture was applied to the gel column. Electrophoresis was conducted at voltage and current limits of 300 V and 2.5 mA, respectively. The elution flow rate was 4.8 ml/h. The majority of the contaminating protein eluted with the dye front after ∼10 h. The elution of CTBP was complete after ∼22 h. The combined fractions contained 110 μg of protein. Hydroxylapatite chromatography, which was used by Waters et al. (26Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) to purify p115, proved to be a useful alternative to preparative native electrophoresis for the final purification step of CTBP. This method was used after CTBP was found to be identical to p115. CTBP from the butyl-agarose column was concentrated 20-fold by centrifugal ultrafiltration in a 30K Macrosep. A Bio-Gel HTP column (1.2 × 7 cm) was packed and equilibrated with Buffer B (200 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors). Concentrated CTBP (1.5 mg of protein) was diluted 10-fold with Buffer B and applied to the Bio-Gel HTP column at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. The column was washed with 12 ml of Buffer B. CTBP was eluted from the column with an 80-ml gradient of sodium phosphate (10–500 mm) in Buffer B. CTBP was eluted from the Bio-Gel HTP column at ∼90 mm phosphate. The combined fractions contained 630 μg of protein. We used preparative electrophoresis in the presence of SDS to isolate the 110-kDa form of CTBP. CTBP-containing fractions from the butyl-agarose column were pooled and concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration in a 30K Macrosep. We changed the buffer content of the CTBP preparation by repeatedly concentrating the preparation after dilution with 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8. CTBP was recovered from the concentrator using 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS. Preparative SDS electrophoresis was performed using the Bio-Rad minipreparative cell. The lower gel (7.5 cm) contained 6% polyacrylamide, 0.1% SDS, and 0.376 m Tris, pH 8.8. The upper gel (1.25 cm) contained 4% polyacrylamide, 0.1% SDS, and 0.124m Tris, pH 6.8. The electrode buffer contained 0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris, and 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3. The sample buffer contained 2% SDS and 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8. We applied a 450-μl sample of CTBP (900 μg of protein) to the gel. Electrophoresis was conducted at voltage and current limits of 300 V and 2.5 mA, respectively. The elution flow rate was 4.8 ml/h. Protein was determined with a modification (27Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar) of the procedure of Lowry et al. (42Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin was used as standard. The protein composition of the final preparation was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (Fig.1). The major protein component migrated to a position just beyond the 116-kDa protein standard, corresponding to a molecular mass of 110 kDa. This protein band was detected by CTBP antiserum (AS-II) on a Western blot. There was a small amount of a 95-kDa protein contaminant. The 95-kDa protein was not detected by CTBP antiserum, suggesting that it was not a product of proteolytic digestion of CTBP. The overall purity of CTBP from the hydroxylapatite column was similar to that obtained by native gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). The hydroxylapatite preparation contained a small amount of a 50-kDa protein, but did not contain the 95-kDa protein that was present in the native electrophoresis preparation. The CTBP preparations did not contain CT activity or CT detected by CT antiserum on Western blots.Figure 2SDS gel analysis of CTBP purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography.

Lane A, 9 μg of butyl-agarose preparation; Lane B, 2 μg of hydroxylapatite preparation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For sequence analysis, we prepared CTBP by gel column electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. The purity of this CTBP preparation is shown in Fig.3. Silver staining of SDS gels indicated a small amount of contaminating protein that migrated slightly above and below the band of CTBP. Immunostain analysis with CTBP antiserum revealed only one immunoreactive band. CTBP migrated to a position just ahead of the 116-kDa protein standard, with a calculated molecular mass of 110 kDa. A 50-μl sample of the CTBP preparation, containing 25 μg of protein, was applied to one lane on an SDS-8% polyacrylamide slab gel. After electrophoresis, we detected the band of CTBP by staining the gel with Amido Black. We then excised the band with a scalpel. We submitted the gel segment to the Protein Sequencing Facility at the University of Michigan. Peptide fragments were prepared by cyanogen bromide cleavage. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed on six different peptides. As shown in Fig. 4, the sequences from each peptide (18–31 amino acids) generated from CTBP matched regions in the sequence of TAP from rat liver (19Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The six peptide sequences of CTBP contained a total of 164 amino acids, and 161 amino acids were identical to the corresponding region in TAP. The calculated molecular mass of TAP was 107,161 Da (19Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This value closely matches the molecular mass of CTBP (110 kDa) obtained by SDS gel electrophoresis. Barroso et al. (19Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) found that TAP was 92% identical to a vesicular transport protein (p115) from bovine brain (28Sapperstein S.K. Walter D.M. Grosvenor A.R. Heuser J.E. Waters M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In these experiments, we used purified CT. We store purified CT at −40 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 200 mm ammonium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.025% sodium azide, and 0.03–0.06% Triton X-100, pH 7.5. Under these conditions, CT is stable, and the activity remains constant for many months. Since purified CT contained high activity, it was necessary to dilute the preparation for routine experimental use. We diluted purified CT 1:40 either in Buffer C (50 mm Tris, 200 mm ammonium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.025% sodium azide, pH 7.5) or in Buffer C containing 0.06% Triton X-100. Dilution of CT in Buffer C without Triton X-100 resulted in a 70–80% decrease in CT activity, measured with optimal concentrations of PC/oleic acid. The addition of purified CTBP to the assay produced an increase in CT activity (Fig.5 A). Thus, the addition of CTBP resulted in the recovery of the CT activity that was lost by the dilution. Dilution of CT with Buffer C containing 0.06% Triton X-100 did not produce a decrease in CT activity (Fig. 5 B). Under these conditions, CTBP increased CT activity to values that were nearly 70% higher than in the original undiluted CT preparation. Half-maximal activation was obtained with 10 ng of CTBP. Maximal stimulation of CT activity, in the presence of 100 μm PC/oleic acid, was obtained at an ∼1:1 molar ratio of CTBP to CT, assuming that both CT and CTBP were present as homodimers. CT activity after dilution in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 was not increased by ovalbumin, thyroglobulin, or bovine serum albumin (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, the effect was specific for CTBP. CTBP produced a similar increase in CT activity in the original undiluted preparation (Fig. 5 C). These assays contained 16 times more CT than the dilution experiments. Maximal activation was obtained with ∼16 times more CTBP. Thus, the molar ratios of CT to CTBP required for optimal activation were similar to those for diluted CT. The results shown in Fig. 5 were obtained with CTBP purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Similar results were obtained using CTBP purified by native polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Each preparation contained >80% CTBP. However, the population of contaminating proteins was different in the two preparations. The similarity in the results obtained with the two preparations suggested that the contaminating protein(s) were not responsible for the stimulatory activity. To obtain direct evidence that CTBP was responsible for the activation of CT, we specifically removed CTBP from the preparation with CTBP antibodies. Two separate approaches were used. In the first, we used protein A-Sepharose to isolate IgG fractions from CTBP antiserum and preimmune serum. IgG recovered from each was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Treatment of CTBP preparations with Affi-Gel containing CTBP antibodies removed CTBP (determined by dot-blot assay). The immunodepleted preparation produced an 8% increase in CT activity. Treatment of the CTBP preparation with Affi-Gel containing preimmune IgG did not remove CTBP. The treated CTBP preparation retained the ability to activate CT (45% increase in CT activity). In the second set of experiments, CTBP (150 ng) was incubated with protein A-Sepharose containing IgG from either CTBP antiserum or preimmune antiserum. A third incubation contained buffer in place of the protein A-Sepharose. After removal of the Sepharose by centrifugation, an aliquot of the supernatant was used to activate diluted CT. CT activity was increased by 30.5 ± 2.1% with the untreated CTBP preparation. The preparation treated with protein A-Sepharose containing preimmune IgG produced a 29.9 ± 2.2% increase in CT activity compared with an 8.8 ± 3.4% increase with the preparation treated with protein A-Sepharose containing CTBP IgG. Western blot analysis of the supernatants indicated that protein A-Sepharose containing CTBP IgG removed CTBP. Protein A-Sepharose containing preimmune IgG did not remove CTBP. Thus, CTBP IgG specifically adsorbs the activating protein in preparations of purified CTBP. Taken together, these results indicated that CTBP/TAP specifically activates CT. The activation of CT by CTBP was dependent upon the presence of PC/oleic acid in the assay (Fig.6 A). CTBP did not increase CT activity in the absence of PC/oleic acid. In the presence of PC/oleic acid, CT activity was activated by CTBP to nearly 80% of the activity in the undiluted preparation (Fig. 6 A). This was nearly a 4-fold increase in activity over the activity obtained with PC/oleic acid alone. When we diluted CT in the presence of 0.06% Triton X-100, ∼80% of the activity was recovered with assays containing PC/oleic acid (Fig. 6 B). The addition of CTBP to the assays increased CT activity to values nearly 50% higher than in the original undiluted preparation. This is consistent with the results shown in Fig.5 B. CTBP alone did not increase CT activity in the presence of Triton X-100. The PC/oleic acid dependence for CT activity and for CTBP stimulation was similar for undiluted CT and for CT diluted with Triton X-100 in the dilution buffer (Fig. 6, compare C withB). Since CTBP activated CT only in the presence of PC/oleic acid, it seemed likely that CTBP may enhance or stabilize the binding of CT to PC/oleic acid liposomes. To assess the effect of CTBP on the binding of CT to PC/oleic acid liposomes, we incubated CT, CTBP, or CT plus CTBP with PC/oleic acid. We then separated proteins bound to PC/oleic acid from the unbound proteins by flotation of the PC/oleic acid liposomes to the top of a sucrose gradient (29Feldman D.A. Rounsifer M.E. Weinhold P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 429: 429-437Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The results from these experiments indicated that both CT and CTBP bind to PC/oleic acid liposomes (Fig.7 A). All of the CTBP was bound to PC/oleic acid, but a portion of the CT (∼25%) did not bind to PC/oleic acid and remained at the bottom of the gradient. CTBP appeared to bind to the CT at the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 7 A, compare ▴ and ▵). The amount of CT bound to PC/oleic acid was not increased by CTBP (Fig. 7 A, compare ♦ and ⋄). The activity of CT bound to PC/oleic acid in the absence of CTBP was measured with and without the addition of CTBP to the assay. The addition of CTBP stimulated CT activity (Fig. 7 B, compare ▪ and •). When CT was incubated with CTBP and PC/oleic acid, the activity of CT bound to PC/oleic acid was increased (Fig. 7, compareB (•) and C (•)). The increase in CT activity appeared to be due to activation by CTBP because the mass of CT bound to PC/oleic acid was not increased (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, CT activity was not increased by the addition of more CTBP to the assay (Fig. 7 C, compare ▪ and •). These results suggested that CT, CTBP, and PC/oleic acid formed a relatively stable complex in which CT was optimally active. To assess the ability of CT to form complexes with CTBP in the absence of lipid, we incubated purified CT with purified CTBP. A mixture of CT and CTBP and samples of CT and CTBP alone were then subjected to glycerol density centrifugation. CT sedimented in the glycerol gradient to a position corresponding to a molecular mass of 90–100 kDa (Fig.8, A (activity) and C (immunoassay)). There was no evidence for the formation of a stable complex between CT and CTBP because incubation of CT with CTBP did not change the position of CT in the gradient (Fig. 8 B). Interestingly, CT that was sedimented alone was nearly inactive (Fig.8 A). The addition of CTBP to the assay produced a 4–5-fold increase in activity. When CT was sedimented with CTBP, the recovery of CT activity was increased (Fig. 8 B). Furthermore, CT activity was not increased appreciably when CTBP was added to the assay. This was likely due to the fact that CTBP sedimented to approximately the same position as CT in the gradient (Fig.8 D). Therefore, CTBP would have been present in the assay along with CT. In previous studies, we identified a protein (CTBP) with a subunit molecular mass of 110–112 kDa that binds CT, forming heterogeneous complexes (17Feldman D.A. Weinhold P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3127-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present study, we purified CTBP from rat liver. Amino acid sequences from six peptides derived from purified CTBP exactly matched sequences in TAP that had previously been isolated from rat liver and sequenced (19Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The reported sequence of TAP is 90% identical to p115, a vesicular transport factor isolated from bovine liver (28Sapperstein S.K. Walter D.M. Grosvenor A.R. Heuser J.E. Waters M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). TAP/p115 is homologous to Uso1p, a protein involved in vesicular transport in yeast (31Nakajima H. Hirata A. Ogawa Y. Yonehara T. Yoda K. Yamasaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of TAP/p115 indicated an elongated structure consisting of two subunits that interact, forming an N-terminal head and a C-terminal coiled-coil tail that terminates in an acidic domain (19Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Sapperstein S.K. Walter D.M. Grosvenor A.R. Heuser J.E. Waters M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). TAP/p115 appears to be located on Golgi membranes as a peripheral protein that is rather easily extracted by salt-containing buffers (26Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The precise function of TAP/p115 in vesicular transport has not been conclusively identified. Current evidence suggests that it likely functions in the targeting or fusion stage of the vesicular transport cycle (19Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Sapperstein S.K. Walter D.M. Grosvenor A.R. Heuser J.E. Waters M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Barroso et al. (19Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) proposed that TAP may interact with target membranes and hold the vesicular and target membranes in proximity. Recent studies on the disassembly and reassembly of the Golgi apparatus during cell division provided additional evidence for a function of TAP/p115 in the docking of vesicles to target membranes (32Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Kieckbusch R.H. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17304-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purified CTBP stimulated CT activity under a variety of conditions. The increase in CT activity occurred after dilution in the presence of Triton X-100 or without Triton X-100. Dilution of CT without maintaining the Triton X-100 concentration resulted in a loss of CT activity, measured under optimal concentrations of PC/oleic acid. However, the addition of CTBP to the assay increased CT activity to the original activity measured before dilution. With both undiluted CT and CT diluted with Triton X-100, the activity of CT was increased by CTBP to levels 50–60% higher than those obtained with PC/oleic acid alone. Under all conditions, stimulation of CT activity by CTBP occurred only when PC/oleic acid was present. CTBP did not stimulate CT activity in the absence of PC/oleic acid. Both CT and CTBP bound to PC/oleic acid liposomes. The isolated complexes contained active CT, but the activity was increased when CTBP was present. Complexes between CT and CTBP were not formed in the absence of lipid, in agreement with the observation that CTBP alone did not stimulate CT activity. These results are in general agreement with our previous observations that oleic acid or PC/oleic acid promoted the formation of complexes between CT and CTBP in liver cytosol (17Feldman D.A. Weinhold P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3127-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Overall, the results indicted that the coincident binding of CT and CTBP to PC/oleic acid formed a ternary complex in which CT activity was increased above the activity achievable with PC/oleic acid. At present, the mechanism for this cooperative effect is unknown. The finding that CTBP is identical to TAP/p115, together with the results suggesting a role of CTBP in the regulation of CT activity leads to the interesting possibility that this protein enables communication between phosphatidylcholine synthesis and vesicular transport. Conceptually, this dual function would allow the rate of vesicular transport to be coordinated with the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine needed for the production of membrane vesicles. There is some relevant information in the literature to support a connection between vesicular transport and phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Cytidylyltransferase has been reported to be present in Golgi membranes (33Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Higgins J.A. Fieldsend J.K. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 268-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies by Slomiany et al. (35Slomiany A. Greelinska E. Kasinahian C. Yamaki K. Palecz D.

Cell Res. 1992; 201: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) on the biogenesis of endoplasmic reticulum transport vesicles in gastric mucosal tissue suggested that CT was associated with the transport vesicle. Indirect evidence led the authors to speculate that the formation of vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum may be regulated by the activity of cytidylyltransferase. The results suggesting that CT is located in the nucleus (6Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Watkins J.D. Kent C. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are difficult to reconcile with a function of CT in vesicular transport. However, the subcellular localization of CT is not completely established. For example, recent studies by Houweling et al. (37Houweling M. Cui Z. Anfuso C.D. Bussiere M. Chen M.H. Vance D.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar), using immunofluorescence, immunogold electron microscopy, and biochemical techniques, indicate that CT is not exclusively located in the nucleus in all cells. For example, CT was found to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm in isolated rat hepatocytes. A series of genetic studies with Saccharomyces cerevisiaeprovided independent evidence for a regulatory connection between cytidylyltransferase and Golgi function. Sec14p, a phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein, is bound peripherally to Golgi membranes and is required for transport from Golgi compartments (38Novick P. Field C. Shekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 39Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J.

Skinner et al. (41Skinner H.B. McGee T.P. McMaster C.R. Fry M.R. Bell R.M. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) provided both in vitro and in vivo evidence that Sec14p decreases the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis by inhibiting cytidylyltransferase. Furthermore, the data suggest that Sec14p is inhibitory when in the phosphatidylcholine-bound form. This provides a potential feedback process to regulate the amount of phosphatidylcholine in Golgi membranes. Thus, it is possible that a Sec14p-type action and the effects of CTBP/TAP are both examples of a complex mechanism to coordinate the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine with membrane formation required for vesicular transport. Full recognition of the importance of CTBP/TAP in regulating cytidylyltransferase activity requires both a detailed understanding of the mechanisms for the cooperative effect of CTBP on CT activity and in vivo demonstration of the effects of CTBP on CT."

This study adapts a stable isotope technique (Kuwae, T., Schmid, P. C., Johnson, S. B., and Schmid, H. O. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5002–5007) to quantitatively determine the minimal proportion of PLP molecules which undergo palmitoylation. In these experiments, brain white matter slices from 20-day-old rats were incubated for up to 6 h in a physiological buffer containing 50% H218O. The uptake of 18O into the carbonyl groups of fatty acids derived from PLP, phospholipids, and the free fatty acid pool was measured by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of the respective methyl esters. Palmitic acid derived from PLP acquired increasing amounts of 18O, ending with 2.9% 18O enrichment after 6 h of incubation.18O incorporation into myelin free palmitic acid also increased over the course of the incubation (67.2% 18O enrichment). After correcting for the specific activity of the18O-enriched free palmitic acid pool, 7.6% of the PLP molecules were found to acquire palmitic acid in 6 h. This value is not only too large to be the result of the palmitoylation of newly synthesized PLP molecules, it was also unchanged upon the inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. 18O enrichment in less actively myelinating 60-day-old rats was significantly reduced. In conclusion, our experiments suggest that a substantial proportion of PLP molecules acquire palmitic acid via an acylation/deacylation cycle and that this profile changes during development.

A number of integral membrane proteins are modified after their synthesis by the covalent attachment of long-chain fatty acids (mostly palmitic acid) to one or more cytoplasmically oriented cysteine residues (for review, see Refs. 1Towler D.A.

In the majority of the cases, the chemically bound acyl chains turn over much faster than the protein backbone, implying that palmitoylation is a regulatory modification. In fact, fatty acylation of this and other types of proteins has been shown to be modulated by physiological (7James G. Olson E.N. J. Biol.

To date, the metabolic features of palmitoylation have only been studied by labeling cultured cells with [3H]palmitic acid, and the half-life of the palmitate has been estimated from the disappearance of the protein-bound radioactivity after isotopic dilution with the unlabeled fatty acid. Unfortunately, labeling experiments using [3H]palmitic acid are difficult to interpret, particularly when considering the possibility that exogenous and endogenous palmitate may not have equal access to the fatty acid donor pools. Furthermore, since the specific radioactivity of the donor pool of palmitate used for protein palmitoylation cannot be estimated, it is not possible to determine the number of protein molecules participating in such rapid deacylation-reacylation cycles. Consequently, the radioactivity that becomes associated with a polypeptide during the course of an experiment could either represent the periodic repair of thioester linkages on a few protein molecules or the physiologically relevant exchange of the fatty acids on many molecules.In the central nervous system, proteolipid protein (PLP) 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, myelin proteolipid protein; GLC, gas-liquid chromatography; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; MS, mass spectrometry; FFA, free fatty acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine. 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, myelin proteolipid protein; GLC, gas-liquid chromatography; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; MS, mass spectrometry; FFA, free fatty acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine. accounts for more than 50% of the total myelin protein (15Lees M.B. Macklin W.B. Marangos P.J. Campbell I.C. Neuronal and Glial Proteins: Structure, Function and Clinical Applications. Academic Press, New York1988: 267-294Google Scholar). Although the specific function of this tetraspan membrane protein is unclear, its physiological importance is demonstrated by the requirement of normal PLP synthesis during myelination (16Hudson L.D. Nadon N.L. Martenson R. Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 677-702Google Scholar). PLP contains between 2 and 3 mol of fatty acids, mainly palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid (17Stoffyn P. Folch J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which are bound to several intracellular cysteine residues via labile thioester linkages (18Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1986-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. Evans J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Studies employing [3H]palmitate have shown that the attachment of fatty acid to the polypeptide backbone takes place close to or within the myelin membrane (21Townsend L.E. Agrawal D. Benjamins J.A. Agrawal H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9745-9750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bizzozero O.A. Soto E.F. Pasquini J.M. Neurochem. Int. 1983; 5: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The half-life of the palmitate bound to PLP measured in vivo was found to be approximately 3 days, a value significantly smaller than that of the protein backbone (t½ > 30 days) (23Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17092-17098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, pulse-chase experiments in cell-free systems have shown that PLP-bound palmitate turns over within a few minutes (23Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17092-17098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The occurrence of dynamic palmitoylation of PLP in myelin is also supported by the presence of substantial levels of PLP acylesterase activity in this subcellular fraction (24Bizzozero O.A. Leyba J. Nuñez D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7886-7894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the occurrence of PLP in a metabolically stable membrane such as myelin makes it difficult to envision the function that such a dynamic modification may have, and therefore it raises questions as to how many molecules do indeed participate in deacylation-reacylation cycles.To specifically address the question regarding the number of fatty acids being incorporated into PLP during a period of time, we used the elegant technique of H218O exchange initially developed by Schmid and co-workers (25Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Schmid P.C. Johnson S.B. Schmid H.H.O. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1988; 46: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Johnson S.B. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5002-5007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to determine phospholipid acyl chain turnover in macrophages. In this study, we incubated rat brain white matter slices in medium containing H218O, a molecule that readily equilibrates into the cells and participates in all normal hydrolytic reactions. As fatty acyl-esters in phospholipids are hydrolyzed in the presence of H218O, the isotopic oxygen becomes either the hydroxyl or the carbonyl oxygen of the resultant free fatty acid (FFA) (Fig. 1). The carbonyl 18O-labeled fatty acids are then activated to fatty acyl-CoA, and reesterified creating phospholipids and acylproteins with the stable isotope incorporated at the carbonyl oxygen of the newly formed oxyester and thioester linkage, respectively. The incorporation of these 18O-labeled fatty acids into PLP and lipids is quantitatively determined via GLC/MS of the methyl esters released by alkaline methanolysis. Using this technique, we found that a significant proportion of the palmitate (7.6%) and stearate (2.5%) in PLP from 20-day-old animals are incorporated during the course of 6 h. These values cannot be attributed to changes in the stoichiometry of acylation or to the acylation of newly synthesized protein, but to the replacement of unlabeled fatty acids for 18O-labeled fatty acids. The value of this approach is also evident when considering that, whereas significant amounts of radioactivity are incorporated into PLP in the adult (60-day-old) animal when [3H]palmitic acid is used as tracer (23Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17092-17098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only a minute proportion of PLP molecules are palmitoylated when using endogenously generated 18O-labeled fatty acids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the metabolism of acyl chains in palmitoylated proteins has been studied with a stable isotope technique.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have determined the minimal amount of fatty acids that are incorporated into myelin PLP in a particular period of time. These experiments are novel in that they assess the palmitoylation of a protein utilizing the endogenous fatty acids, thus eliminating the problems associated with the entry of the [3H]palmitic acid into cells, its equilibration with specific metabolic pools, and its interconversion into other radiolabeled metabolites. We have found that an amount close to 3% of palmitate and 1% of the stearate bound to PLP is incorporated in 6 h and 4 h, respectively. These are minimal rates of incorporation since they do not include adjustments for the specific activity of the donor fatty acid pool. When these values are corrected by changes in the specific activity of the myelin FFAs, the incorporation of palmitic and stearic acid into PLP increased to approximately 7.6% and 2.6%, respectively. Since PLP has six potential acylation sites (20Weimbs T. Stoffel W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12289-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the amount of fatty acids incorporated into the protein cannot be equated to the number of protein molecules that are being acylated. Consequently, it was not possible to distinguish whether only 7.6% of PLP molecules exchange all of their palmitate or whether a larger proportion of the molecules becomes palmitoylated to a lesser extent.Both this study and those using [3H]palmitic acid (21Townsend L.E. Agrawal D. Benjamins J.A. Agrawal H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9745-9750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Bizzozero O.A. Soto E.F. Pasquini J.M. Neurochem. Int. 1983; 5: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have shown that acylation of myelin PLP is not affected by cycloheximide. The persistence of normal levels of palmitate incorporation long after the arrest of the protein synthesis can be attributed to: (a) palmitoylation occurring at a site temporally distant from the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the oligodendroglial cell, where PLP synthesis takes place; (b) an increase in the stoichiometry of acylation; or (c) fatty acid turnover. The first of these possibilities is rather unlikely since the rate of PLP acylation with 18O-labeled fatty acids exceeds by at least 5-fold the rate at which the newly synthesized protein molecules are accumulated into myelin. The second alternative can also be ruled out because the amount of fatty acids covalently bound to PLP remains unchanged during the incubation and throughout development. Thus, the data can solely be explained by exchange of unlabeled fatty acids for 18O-fatty acids. Interestingly, the amount of [18O]palmitic acid incorporated into PLP did not decrease upon replacement of H218O by H216O, indicating that the half-life of the protein-bound palmitate is greater than that of free palmitic acid (t½ ∼ 2 h). Because of this relatively low turnover rate, incubation for 6 h was insufficient to achieve isotopic equilibrium between the PLP-bound palmitic acid and the myelin free [18O]palmitic acid. However, the rate of uptake of 18O into PLP-derived palmitic acid showed a gradual decrease during the course of the incubation. Assuming that this decline was caused by the approach to the equilibrium, it is possible to calculate both the maximal number of fatty acids that can be incorporated and the half-life of the protein-bound palmitic acid. When the corrected 18O incorporation values shown in Fig. 2 C were fitted to a first-rate equation, the curve reached a limit at 12–14%18O enrichment with a half-life of 4–5 h.Profound differences in the incorporation of 18O-labeled fatty acids into PLP were observed between young and adult animals. The % 18O enrichment in palmitic and stearic acid derived from PLP was greatly diminished in the older, slowly myelinating animals. This reduction is too large to be only explained by the 3-fold increase in the concentration of PLP, and therefore protein-derived16O-fatty acids, that occurs between 20 and 60 days of age (40Agrawal H.C. Fujimoto K. Burton R.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Consequently, the age-associated changes are, to a large extent, due to a reduction in the number of PLP molecules undergoing palmitoylation with age. The limited incorporation of [18O]palmitic acid into PLP in the older animal was an unexpected finding since there are no noticeable developmental differences in acylation of PLP with [3H]palmitic acid (23Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17092-17098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possibility is that the presence of exogenously added palmitic acid may have influenced the normal fatty acid metabolism. However, we found that the addition of [18O]palmitic acid to an incubation medium containing 50% H218O does not change the % 18O enrichment of PLP-derived palmitic acid (data not shown). This result also suggests that the radioactivity normally incorporated into PLP in the adult, slowly myelinating animal represents almost negligible amounts of palmitate. In light of this new finding and contrary to our original view (23Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17092-17098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is fair to hypothesize that PLP palmitoylation plays some role in myelin formation and/or compaction rather than in the maintenance of this membrane.Little is known regarding the subcellular site of protein palmitoylation, and it appears to depend upon the protein in question. Initial studies have shown that acylation of viral and cellular membrane glycoproteins occurs in membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi complex (41Schmidt M.F.G. Schlesinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3334-3339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dolci E.D. Palade G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10728-10735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Schmidt J.W.

However, for proteins that participate in rapid deacylation-reacylation cycles, the attachment of the fatty acid is likely to take place at the plasma membrane, where the presence of protein acyltransferase activity has been recently demonstrated (45Kinet J.P. Quatro R. Perez-Montfort R. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7342-7348Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 46Staufenbiel M. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23269-23276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the case of PLP, studies involving biosynthetic labeling with [3H]palmitic acid and cellular fractionation have suggested that acylation occurs at a locus close to or within the myelin membrane (22Bizzozero O.A. Soto E.F. Pasquini J.M. Neurochem. Int. 1983; 5: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17092-17098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the dynamic nature of PLP acylation and the finding that palmitoylation is reduced in adult animals suggest that the reaction is likely to occur in specialized regions of the myelin sheath, such Schmidt-Lantermann incisures; inner, outer, and paranodal loops; and the network of cytoplasmic channels, where PLP may be accessible to the acylating/deacylating machinery as well as fatty acyl-CoA. Experiments combining 18O labeling and fractionation of the myelin membranes are being undertaken to localize more precisely the subcompartment(s) where acylation takes place.In this study, we also showed that a significant proportion of the acyl chains in myelin phospholipids acquire 18O during the course of the incubation. No attempts were made to determine whether the uptake of 18O into phospholipid-derived fatty acids takes place by the de novo synthesis through the acylation of glycerophosphate and/or via deacylation-reacylation reactions. However, the high levels of isotope incorporation relative to the proportion of membrane lipids synthesized during incubation suggests that the exchange of fatty acids on preexisting phospholipid molecules constitutes a major mechanism. In general, 18O enrichment profiles of PLP-fatty acids resemble those of the major myelin phospholipids. In both cases, the incorporation of 18O was time-dependent, unaffected by cycloheximide, and greatly reduced in the adult animal. At present, the reason(s) for the similarities in the metabolic behavior of PLP and phospholipid acyl chains are unknown. The possibility, however, that phospholipids could be contaminating the PLP preparations can be safely excluded based on the following observations. (a) Addition of tritiated phospholipids, glycolipids, or palmitic acid to unlabeled PLP prior to chromatography on Sephadex LH-60 does not result in the appearance of radioactivity in the protein peak (30Bizzozero O.A. Besio-Moreno M. Pasquini J.M. Soto E.F. Gomez C.J. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 227: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); (b) chemical analysis of isolated PLP yields less than 0.035% (w/w) lipid phosphorous (30Bizzozero O.A. Besio-Moreno M. Pasquini J.M. Soto E.F. Gomez C.J. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 227: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); (c) incubation of isolated PLP with phospholipase A2 does not remove the protein-bound fatty acid (24Bizzozero O.A. Leyba J. Nuñez D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7886-7894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (d) the fatty acid composition of PLP does not resemble that of any myelin lipids (34Lees M.B. Bizzozero O.A. Odykirk T. McGarry J.F. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 195Google Scholar).As mentioned above, a benefit of the H218O method developed by Schmid and co-workers (25Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Schmid P.C. Johnson S.B. Schmid H.H.O. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1988; 46: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Johnson S.B. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5002-5007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is that it eliminates the problems associated with the slow entry of [3H]palmitic acid into cells and its equilibration with specific metabolic pools. This becomes evident when considering recent findings revealing that some fatty acid stores in the cell are resistant to labeling upon incubation with radiolabeled fatty acids (51Chilton F.H. Connell T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5260-5265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our opinion, the major advantage of this stable isotope technique is that it allows one to estimate the minimal number of molecules being modified during the course of an experiment. Knowledge of acylation rates and the proportion of protein molecules that undergo palmitoylation is critical when making biological assumptions regarding the function of the modification. Consequently, it would be of considerable interest to extend this approach to study the palmitoylation of other proteins. Although the use of H218O to conduct a systematic study of protein palmitoylation is somewhat limited by the necessity for substantial amounts of purified protein (nanomoles), with the advent of effective expression systems in eukaryotic cells, heavy isotope labeling should become increasingly feasible. A number of integral membrane proteins are modified after their synthesis by the covalent attachment of long-chain fatty acids (mostly palmitic acid) to one or more cytoplasmically oriented cysteine residues (for review, see Refs. 1Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schultz A.M. Henderson L.E. Oroszlan S. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In the majority of the cases, the chemically bound acyl chains turn over much faster than the protein backbone, implying that palmitoylation is a regulatory modification. In fact, fatty acylation of this and other types of proteins has been shown to be modulated by physiological (7James G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20998-21006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Huang E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1011: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Jochen A. Hays J.

To date, the metabolic features of palmitoylation have only been studied by labeling cultured cells with [3H]palmitic acid, and the half-life of the palmitate has been estimated from the disappearance of the protein-bound radioactivity after isotopic dilution with the unlabeled fatty acid. Unfortunately, labeling experiments using [3H]palmitic acid are difficult to interpret, particularly when considering the possibility that exogenous and endogenous palmitate may not have equal access to the fatty acid donor pools. Furthermore, since the specific radioactivity of the donor pool of palmitate used for protein palmitoylation cannot be estimated, it is not possible to determine the number of protein molecules participating in such rapid deacylation-reacylation cycles. Consequently, the radioactivity that becomes associated with a polypeptide during the course of an experiment could either represent the periodic repair of thioester linkages on a few protein molecules or the physiologically relevant exchange of the fatty acids on many molecules. In the central nervous system, proteolipid protein (PLP) 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, myelin proteolipid protein; GLC, gas-liquid chromatography; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; MS, mass spectrometry; FFA, free fatty acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine. 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, myelin proteolipid protein; GLC, gas-liquid chromatography; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; MS, mass spectrometry; FFA, free fatty acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine. accounts for more than 50% of the total myelin protein (15Lees M.B. Macklin W.B. Marangos P.J. Campbell I.C. Neuronal and Glial Proteins: Structure, Function and Clinical Applications. Academic Press, New York1988: 267-294Google Scholar). Although the specific function of this tetraspan membrane protein is unclear, its physiological importance is demonstrated by the requirement of normal PLP synthesis during myelination (16Hudson L.D. Nadon N.L. Martenson R. Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 677-702Google Scholar). PLP contains between 2 and 3 mol of fatty acids, mainly palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid (17Stoffyn P. Folch J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which are bound to several intracellular cysteine residues via labile thioester linkages (18Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. J.

Studies employing [3H]palmitate have shown that the attachment of fatty acid to the polypeptide backbone takes place close to or within the myelin membrane (21Townsend L.E. Agrawal D. Benjamins J.A.

Int. 1983; 5: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The half-life of the palmitate bound to PLP measured in vivo was found to be approximately 3 days, a value significantly smaller than that of the protein backbone (t½ > 30 days) (23Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17092-17098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, pulse-chase experiments in cell-free systems have shown that PLP-bound palmitate turns over within a few minutes (23Bizzozero O.A. Good L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 26"
