Here, we present evidence that VgrG-3 of the Vibrio cholerae T6SS has both structural and toxin activity. Specifically, we demonstrate that the C-terminal extension of VgrG-3 acts to degrade peptidoglycan and hypothesize that this assists in the delivery of accessory T6SS toxins of V. cholerae. To avoid self-intoxication, V. cholerae expresses an anti-toxin encoded immediately downstream of vgrG-3 that inhibits VgrG-3-mediated lysis through direct interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1974349185,"π-stacking interactions unique between residues of PUMA and Bcl-xL, which lead to the unfolding of Bcl-xL via an allosteric mechanism, are required to disrupt p53–Bcl-xL interaction and induce apoptosis. This is the first example of regulated protein unfolding for signal transmission. Following DNA damage, nuclear p53 induces the expression of PUMA, a BH3-only protein that binds and inhibits the antiapoptotic BCL-2 repertoire, including BCL-xL. PUMA, unique among BH3-only proteins, disrupts the interaction between cytosolic p53 and BCL-xL, allowing p53 to promote apoptosis via direct activation of the BCL-2 effector molecules BAX and BAK. Structural investigations using NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography revealed that PUMA binding induced partial unfolding of two α-helices within BCL-xL. Wild-type PUMA or a PUMA mutant incapable of causing binding-induced unfolding of BCL-xL equivalently inhibited the antiapoptotic BCL-2 repertoire to sensitize for death receptor–activated apoptosis, but only wild-type PUMA promoted p53-dependent, DNA damage–induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that PUMA-induced partial unfolding of BCL-xL disrupts interactions between cytosolic p53 and BCL-xL, releasing the bound p53 to initiate apoptosis. We propose that regulated unfolding of BCL-xL provides a mechanism to promote PUMA-dependent signaling within the apoptotic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2046378854,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones that coordinate fundamental developmental programs in plants. In this study we show that in addition to the well established roles of BRs in regulating cell elongation and cell division events, BRs also govern cell fate decisions during stomata development in Arabidopsis thaliana. In wild-type A. thaliana, stomatal distribution follows the one-cell spacing rule; that is, adjacent stomata are spaced by at least one intervening pavement cell. This rule is interrupted in BR-deficient and BR signaling-deficient A. thaliana mutants, resulting in clustered stomata. We demonstrate that BIN2 and its homologues, GSK3/Shaggy-like kinases involved in BR signaling, can phosphorylate the MAPK kinases MKK4 and MKK5, which are members of the MAPK module YODA-MKK4/5-MPK3/6 that controls stomata development and patterning. BIN2 phosphorylates a GSK3/Shaggy-like kinase recognition motif in MKK4, which reduces MKK4 activity against its substrate MPK6 in vitro. In vivo we show that MKK4 and MKK5 act downstream of BR signaling because their overexpression rescued stomata patterning defects in BR-deficient plants. A model is proposed in which GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of MKK4 and MKK5 enables for a dynamic integration of endogenous or environmental cues signaled by BRs into cell fate decisions governed by the YODA-MKK4/5-MPK3/6 module."

Dysregulated autophagy is implicated as a contributor in neurodegenerative diseases; however, the role of autophagy in retinal degeneration remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the photo-activated visual chromophore, all-trans-retinal, modulated autophagosome formation in ARPE19 retinal cells. Increased formation of autophagosomes in these cells was observed when incubated with 2.5 μm all-trans-retinal, a condition that did not cause cell death after 24 h in culture. However, autophagosome formation was decreased at concentrations, which caused cell death. Increased expression of activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4), which indicates the activation of oxidative stress, was recorded in response to light illumination in retinas of Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice, which showed delayed clearance of all-trans-retinal after light exposure. Expression of autophagosome marker LC3B-II and mitochondria-specific autophagy, mitophagy, regulator Park2, were significantly increased in the retinas of Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice after light exposure, suggesting involvement of autophagy and mitophagy in the pathogenesis of light-induced retinal degeneration. Deletion of essential genes required for autophagy, including Beclin1 systemically or Atg7 in only rod photoreceptors resulted in increased susceptibility to light-induced retinal damage. Increased photoreceptor cell death was observed when retinas lacking the rod photoreceptor-specific Atg7 gene were coincubated with 20 μm all-trans-retinal. Park2−/− mice also displayed light-induced retinal degeneration. Ultra-structural analyses showed mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum impairment in retinas of these model animals after light exposure. Taken together, these observations provide novel evidence implicating an important role of autophagy and mitophagy in protecting the retina from all-trans-retinal- and light-induced degeneration.

Taken together, these observations provide novel evidence implicating an important role of autophagy and mitophagy in protecting the retina from all-trans-retinal- and light-induced degeneration. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process involving lysosome-mediated intracellular degradation (1Yang Z. Klionsky D.J. Eaten alive. A history of macroautophagy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Autophagy occurs at a basal level mainly to maintain homeostatic function during protein and organelle turnover. Under various pathophysiological stress conditions, autophagy can be up-regulated to supply the increased demand for intracellular nutrients and energy, meet the needs of developmentally related structural remodeling, and eliminate intracellular misfolded or long-lived proteins, superfluous or damaged organelles, and invading microorganisms. Although morphological features of autophagy have been documented for decades, the functional significance of autophagy in pathophysiological conditions has only recently been appreciated due to the molecular regulators and functional analyses of autophagy-related genes (Atgs) being reported. The significance of the prosurvival function of autophagy in human disease was discovered by using mouse models that lacked genes essential for autophagosome formation, including, Beclin1, Atg5, or Atg7 (2Pickford F.

Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). Autophagy has thus emerged as an important player in the pathophysiology in a variety of disorders such as neurodegeneration, cancer, and immune disorders (5Mizushima N. Komatsu M. Autophagy. Renovation of cells and tissues.Cell. 2011; 147: 728-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The presence of autophagy occurring in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 2The abbreviations used are: RPEretinal pigment epitheliumatRALall-trans-retinalRDH8retinol dehydrogenase 8SD-OCTspectral domain-optic coherence tomographyABCA4ATP binding cassette transporter 4ONLouter nuclear layerAbantibody. cells and photoreceptors was first described in ground squirrels under active and hibernating conditions (6Remé C.E. Young R.W. The effects of hibernation on cone visual cells in the ground squirrel.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1977; 16: 815-840PubMed Google Scholar). Further study confirmed that autophagy occurs ubiquitously in RPE and in photoreceptor cells under normal conditions in various species (6Remé C.E. Young R.W. The effects of hibernation on cone visual cells in the ground squirrel.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1977; 16: 815-840PubMed Google Scholar). Autophagosomes in retinal cells contain all types of cytoplasmic constituents and invariably display the same range of morphological features regardless of cell type or species. These observations suggest that autophagy is part of a basal cellular process common to both RPE and photoreceptor cells. Namely, autophagic events were also found to be enhanced by light stimulation after light-induced damage in RPE and photoreceptor cells, although the exact biological significance of this light-induced autophagy up-regulation was unclear (7Remé C.E. Wolfrum U. Imsand C. Hafezi F. Williams T.P. Photoreceptor autophagy. Effects of light history on number and opsin content of degradative vacuoles.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Light signal is converted to electrical signal in the retina allowing visual perception, and the initial step of this conversion is photo-isomerization of the visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal (atRAL) (8von Lintig J. Kiser P.D. Golczak M. Palczewski K. The biochemical and structural basis for trans-to-cis isomerization of retinoids in the chemistry of vision.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 400-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Production of atRAL is essential for vertebrate vision; however, excess amounts of atRAL may cause retinal cell death. Delayed clearance of atRAL in Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice, which are deficient in both ATP binding cassette transporter 4 (ABCA4) and retinol dehydrogenase 8 (RDH8), key enzymes for atRAL clearance from photoreceptors, causes light-dependent retinal degeneration (9Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Palczewski K. Retinopathy in mice induced by disrupted all-trans-retinal clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26684-26693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), indicating the important role of atRAL as an inducer of photodamage. In the present study we showed that the protein levels of autophagosome marker LC3B-II and mitophagy regulator Park2 were significantly increased in response to light exposure at a dose able to cause retinal degeneration in Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice. These mice provide a model for acute light-induced retinopathy (9Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Palczewski K. Retinopathy in mice induced by disrupted all-trans-retinal clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26684-26693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), thus indicating that the processes of autophagy and mitophagy are associated with light-induced retinal degeneration. Genetically modified mouse models displaying deficiencies in autophagy and mitophagy were further examined to clarify the role of autophagy in retinal degeneration. Increased susceptibility to light-induced retinal degeneration was exhibited in two different mouse lines defective in autophagy. The first line was deficient in Beclin1, whereas the second line contained a rod photoreceptor-specific deletion of Atg7. A similar retinal phenotype was observed in mice with a deficiency in the mitophagy essential gene, Park2. Our findings demonstrate inadequate autophagy and mitophagy could result in light-induced retinal degeneration, thus supporting an important role for autophagy and mitophagy in protecting the retina from photo-oxidative stress. Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice were generated as previously described (9Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Palczewski K. Retinopathy in mice induced by disrupted all-trans-retinal clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26684-26693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and Beclin1+/− mice were originally generated by Dr. Beth Levine (UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX) and re-derived at Case Western Reserve University (10Portillo J.A.

Park2−/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were genotyped by established methods, and only those with Leu-450 in RPE65 (12Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P.

Mice were housed in the animal facility at the School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, where they were maintained either in the dark or under a 12-h light (∼10 lux)/12-h dark cycle. Manipulations in the dark were done under dim red light transmitted through a Kodak No. 1 safelight filter (transmittance >560 nm). All animal procedures and experiments were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) and conformed to recommendations of both the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and the Association of Research for Vision and Ophthalmology. Six-week-old mice were dark-adapted for 48 h before exposure to light. Light damage was induced by eye exposure to diffuse white fluorescent light (150 watt spiral lamp, Commercial Electric) at the indicated intensity for indicated time periods. Before such light exposure, pupils of mice were dilated with 1% tropicamide, and after exposure animals were kept in the dark until evaluation. Ultra-high resolution SD-OCT (Bioptigen) was employed for in vivo imaging of mouse retinas. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture (20 μl/g of body weight) containing ketamine (6 mg/ml) and xylazine (0.44 mg/ml) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 100 mm NaCl. Pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide. Four pictures acquired in the B-scan mode were used to construct each final averaged SD-OCT image. Human-derived RPE cells, ARPE19 cells, were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). LC3B-GFP vector is a generous gift from Dr. N. Mizushima (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). LC3B-GFP vector was stably transfected with FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). ARPE19 cells were cultured with DMEM (Thermo Scientific Hyclone, Logan, UT) with 10% fetal bovine serum. atRAL was purchased from Sigma. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor for lysosome degradation, was purchased from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). Histological and immunohistochemical procedures employed were well established (14Chen Y. Okano K. Maeda T. Chauhan V. Golczak M. Maeda A. Palczewski K. Mechanism of all-trans-retinal toxicity with implications for stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration.J. Biol.

Molday (University of British Columbia, Vancouver CA). Peanut agglutinin and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Invitrogen. Eyecups for histology were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for embedding in Epon. Sections were cut at 1 μm and stained with toluidine blue. Electron microscopic analyses were performed as previously described (15Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Alekseev A. Bronson J.D. Zhang H. Zhu L. Sun W. Saperstein D.A. Rieke F. Baehr W.

SDS-PAGE was performed using 12.5 or 15% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA in 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and incubated for 3–16 h with primary antibody. A secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline-phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI) was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Ab binding was detected by incubation with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega). Anti-Beclin1, Park2, Atg5, Atg7, and β-actin antibodies were purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and anti-β-tubulin antibody was obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DHSB) at the University of Iowa. Total RNA was isolated using a RiboPure kit (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX), and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScriptTMII Reserve Transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Choice-TaqDNA Polymerase (Denville Scientific Inc., Metuchen, NJ) was used for PCR amplification. Primer sequences are the following: mBeclin1L (5′-atgtggaaaagaaccgcaag-3′) and mBeclin1R (5′-actccagctgctgctgcctttta-3′); mAtg5L (5′-ggagagaagaggagccaggt-3′) and mAtg5R (5′-gctgggggacaatgctaata-3′); mAtg7L (5′-accatgcagggagctagaga-3′) and mAtg7R (5′-ccactgaggttcaccatcct-3′). Real-time PCR amplification was performed using iQTM SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Primers were designed using web tool Primer 3 and synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon (Hunstville, AL). Relative expression of genes was normalized by housekeeping gene Gapdh. Primer sequences are the following: mAtf4L (5′-tcctgaacagcgaagtgttg-3′) and mAtf4R (5′-acccatgaggtttcaagtgc-3′); mGapdhL (5′-gtgttcctacccccaatgtg-3′) and mGapdhR (5′-ggagacaacctggtcctcag-3′). Eyes were enucleated, washed with penicillin-streptomycin solution (Sigma), and rinsed with Hanks' balanced solution (Hyclone, Waltham, MA). Eye cups were prepared, and they were flattened by making retinal flaps. The flattened retina was transferred onto filter paper, and the retina was gently peeled away from the RPE/choroid. These procedures were performed under a surgical microscopy. Each retina on the filter paper was placed in each well of a 12-well plate filled with 0.5 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, and retinas were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Retinas were washed with 0.5 ml of fresh DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum twice. These retinas were further incubated with/without 20 μm atRAL for 6 h at 37 °C. Lactate dehydrogenase assay was performed for calculating cell death rates (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). The percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated as ((a retina with atRAL − a retina without atRAL)/(lysis control − a retina without atRAL)) × 100. Data representing the means ± S.D. for the results of at least three independent experiments were compared by the one way analysis of variance test. To examine the autophagy machinery in the retina, expression of genes essential for autophagy was examined in 6-week-old wild-type (WT) mice. The mRNA expression of autophagy-related genes including Atg5, Atg7, and Beclin1 was detected in the retina of WT mice by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Autophagy in the retina was further examined biochemically by analyzing the expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3B). Nascent LC3B (proLC3B) is undetectable under normal conditions because it is processed by ATG4 into LCB3-I right after synthesis (16Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). LC3B-I is localized in the cytosol, and when it is conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine and converted to LC3-II, the latter is present on isolated membranes and autophagosomes and much less on autolysosomes (16Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). Therefore, the amount of LC3B-II is closely correlated with the number of autophagosomes and is widely used as a molecular marker to monitor autophagic activity (16Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical examination showed that LC3B was ubiquitously expressed in the retina of WT mice predominantly in RPE, photoreceptor inner segments (IS), outer plexiform layer (OPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and ganglion cells (GC) (Fig. 1Ba). Western blotting revealed that LC3B was abundantly expressed in the retina of WT mice in the form of both LC3B-I and LC3B-II (Fig. 1Bb), providing biochemical evidence supporting the presence of autophagosomes in the retina. Electron microscopy (EM) was performed to validate the finding that autophagy is commonly present in mouse RPE and photoreceptor cells. Autophagosomes were detected in RPE cells and displayed various contents; for instance, a portion of plasma membrane included in an autophagic vacuole (Fig. 1Ca), an autophagic vacuole enclosing dilated endoplasmic reticulum and a small portion of plasma membrane (Fig. 1Cb), and an autophagosome enwrapping membranous material and a melanosome (Fig. 1Cc). Similar to the observation made in other species, autophagic events were also frequently encountered in photoreceptor inner segments in the retinas of WT mice (Fig. 1C, d and e), which showed an autophagosome enclosing a portion of plasma membrane, an autophagic vacuole containing a damaged mitochondrion, and an autophagosome wrapping up partially degraded membranous material, respectively. Taken together, our data indicate that autophagic events are present in the retina of WT mouse, particularly in RPE and photoreceptors. Photo-activated visual chromophore atRAL is cytotoxic and a potent inducer of light damage through mitochondrial impairment (17Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Chou S. Desai A. Hoppel C.L. Matsuyama S.

ARPE19 cells, human-derived RPE cells, display mitochondria-associated apoptosis induced by atRAL (17Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Chou S. Desai A. Hoppel C.L. Matsuyama S. Palczewski K. Involvement of all-trans-retinal in acute light-induced retinopathy of mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15173-15183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of autophagy in retinal cells, expression of LC3B was examined in ARPE19 cells in the presence or absence of atRAL. ARPE19 cells with stably expressed LC3B-GFP showed autophagosomes as GFP-positive intracellular vesicles in the absence of atRAL (Fig. 2A). Increased autophagosome formation was observed when ARPE19 cells were challenged with 2.5 μm atRAL for 24 h, whereas this formation was decreased under coincubation with either 5 or 10 μm this retinoid. Western blotting also showed increased expression of LC3B-II in ARPE19 cells incubated with 2.5 μm atRAL for 24 h but decreased LC3B-II levels at 5 and 10 μm retinoid (Fig. 2B, left). Furthermore, although increased LC3B-II in ARPE19 cells was caused by 50 nm bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor for lysosome degradation, this increase was not observed when cells were treated with 10 μm atRAL (Fig. 2B, right), indicating the primary cause for decreased autophagosomes and LC3B-II expression after atRAL coincubation is the impaired autophagy and not a result of increase autophagic flux. atRAL-induced ARPE19 cell death was detected at concentrations of 5 μm and higher using a cytotoxicity assay that measures lactate dehydrogenase when cells were incubated for 24 h (Fig. 2C). These data revealed a dynamic change of autophagic events that inversely correlated with the dose-dependent cytotoxicity of atRAL, suggesting that impaired autophagy is implicated in atRAL-induced cytotoxicity. This further suggests that autophagy is mechanistically involved in retinal degeneration, especially light-induced retinopathy given that atRAL is an important mediator of retinal cell death during retinal photo-oxidative stress (9Maeda A.

The photoreceptor began to display distinct reflection in the photoreceptor outer nuclear layer (ONL) in SD-OCT images. These reflections could be associated with early changes in light-induced photoreceptor damage (Fig. 3A). Rapid and significant up-regulation of mRNA levels of activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) in response to light exposure was observed (Fig. 3B), indicating the activation of oxidative stress by light exposure (18Lange P.S. Chavez J.C. Pinto J.T. Coppola G. Sun C.W. Townes T.M. Geschwind D.H. Ratan R.R. ATF4 is an oxidative stress-inducible, prodeath transcription factor in neurons in vitroin vivo.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1227-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Destructive retinal changes were hardly detected 24 h after light exposure, when SD-OCT displayed abnormal reflection, by conventional retinal histological analysis, and decreased ONL thickness was detected 7 days after light exposure (Fig. 3C). Levels of LC3B-II and protein expression of Atg7 were examined in the retinas of Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice. Retinas of 6-week-old Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice were collected either 3 or 24 h after light exposure at 10,000 lux for 30 min, which caused abnormal OCT changes and increased level of Atf4 (Fig. 3). Although the level of LC3B-II was maintained 3 h after light exposure, an increase in LC3B-II conversion was observed 24 h after light (Fig. 4A). In opposition to this finding, Atg7 protein expression was unchanged before and after light exposure (Fig. 4B), and similar observations were seen in Beclin1 protein expression (supplemental Fig. S1). Additionally, a significant increase in LC3B-II level was observed before the massive loss of the photoreceptor cells, which occurs 3–7 days after light exposure in Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice (19Maeda A. Golczak M. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Limited roles of Rdh8, Rdh12, and Abca4 in all-trans-retinal clearance in mouse retina.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

As indicated above, changes in autophagic events are associated with light-induced retinal degeneration; however, it remains to be clarified whether autophagy is prosurvival or promoting cell death during light-induced retinal degeneration. To further address the functional consequence of autophagy during light-induced retinal degeneration, autophagy gene-deficient mouse model Beclin1+/− mouse was employed to examine the role of autophagy in light-induced retinal degeneration.

The homo-bifunctional cross-linker (1,6-bismaleimidohexane) was employed to detect dynamic protein interaction during the SERCA cycle. Our studies reveal that SLN differs significantly from PLB: 1) SLN primarily affects the Vmax of SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake but not the pump affinity for Ca2+; 2) SLN can bind to SERCA in the presence of high Ca2+, but PLB can only interact to the ATP-bound Ca2+-free E2 state; and 3) unlike PLB, SLN interacts with SERCA throughout the kinetic cycle and promotes uncoupling of the SERCA pump. Using SERCA transmembrane mutants, we additionally show that PLB and SLN can bind to the same groove but interact with a different set of residues on SERCA.

https://openalex.org/W2080075851,"Degradation of ubiquitinated proteins by 26 S proteasomes requires ATP hydrolysis, but it is unclear how the proteasomal ATPases are regulated and how proteolysis, substrate deubiquitination, degradation, and ATP hydrolysis are coordinated. Polyubiquitinated proteins were shown to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by purified proteasomes, but only if the proteins contain a loosely folded domain. If they were not ubiquitinated, such proteins did not increase ATPase activity. However, they did so upon addition of ubiquitin aldehyde, which mimics the ubiquitin chain and binds to 26 S-associated deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs): in yeast to Ubp6, which is essential for the ATPase activation, and in mammalian 26 S to the Ubp6 homolog, Usp14, and Uch37. Occupancy of either DUB by a ubiquitin conjugate leads to ATPase stimulation, thereby coupling deubiquitination and ATP hydrolysis. Thus, ubiquitinated loosely folded proteins, after becoming bound to the 26 S, interact with Ubp6/Usp14 or Uch37 to activate ATP hydrolysis and enhance their own destruction."
https://openalex.org/W1986606610,"Streptococcus pneumoniae infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore a detailed understanding and characterization of the mechanism of host cell colonization and dissemination is critical to gain control over this versatile pathogen. Here we identified a novel 72-kDa pneumococcal protein endopeptidase O (PepO), as a plasminogen- and fibronectin-binding protein. Using a collection of clinical isolates, representing different serotypes, we found PepO to be ubiquitously present both at the gene and protein level. In addition, PepO protein was secreted in a growth phase-dependent manner to the culture supernatants of the pneumococcal isolates. Recombinant PepO bound human plasminogen and fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner and plasminogen did not compete with fibronectin for binding PepO. PepO bound plasminogen via lysine residues and the interaction was influenced by ionic strength. Moreover, upon activation of PepO-bound plasminogen by urokinase-type plasminogen activator, generated plasmin cleaved complement protein C3b thus assisting in complement control. Furthermore, direct binding assays demonstrated the interaction of PepO with epithelial and endothelial cells that in turn blocked pneumococcal adherence. Moreover, a pepO-mutant strain showed impaired adherence to and invasion of host cells compared with their isogenic wild-type strains. Taken together, the results demonstrated that PepO is a ubiquitously expressed plasminogen- and fibronectin-binding protein, which plays role in pneumococcal invasion of host cells and aids in immune evasion."
https://openalex.org/W2009275373,"Background Sweet taste receptor is expressed not only in taste buds but also in nongustatory organs such as enteroendocrine cells and pancreatic beta-cells, and may play more extensive physiological roles in energy metabolism. Here we examined the expression and function of the sweet taste receptor in 3T3-L1 cells. Methodology/Principal Findings In undifferentiated preadipocytes, both T1R2 and T1R3 were expressed very weakly, whereas the expression of T1R3 but not T1R2 was markedly up-regulated upon induction of differentiation (by 83.0 and 3.8-fold, respectively at Day 6). The α subunits of Gs (Gαs) and G14 (Gα14) but not gustducin were expressed throughout the differentiation process. The addition of sucralose or saccharin during the first 48 hours of differentiation considerably reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα at Day 2, the expression of aP2 at Day 4 and triglyceride accumulation at Day 6. These anti-adipogenic effects were attenuated by short hairpin RNA-mediated gene-silencing of T1R3. In addition, overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant of Gαs but not YM-254890, an inhibitor of Gα14, impeded the effects of sweeteners, suggesting a possible coupling of Gs with the putative sweet taste-sensing receptor. In agreement, sucralose and saccharin increased the cyclic AMP concentration in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells and also in HEK293 cells heterologously expressing T1R3. Furthermore, the anti-adipogenic effects of sweeteners were mimicked by Gs activation with cholera toxin but not by adenylate cyclase activation with forskolin, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Gαs had the opposite effects. Conclusions 3T3-L1 cells express a functional sweet taste-sensing receptor presumably as a T1R3 homomer, which mediates the anti-adipogenic signal by a Gs-dependent but cAMP-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2089721105,"Genome-wide association studies have been able to identify disease associations with many common variants; however most of the estimated genetic contribution explained by these variants appears to be very modest. Rare variants are thought to have larger effect sizes compared to common SNPs but effects of rare variants cannot be tested in the GWAS setting. Here we propose a novel method to test for association of rare variants obtained by sequencing in family-based samples by collapsing the standard family-based association test (FBAT) statistic over a region of interest. We also propose a suitable weighting scheme so that low frequency SNPs that may be enriched in functional variants can be upweighted compared to common variants. Using simulations we show that the family-based methods perform at par with the population-based methods under no population stratification. By construction, family-based tests are completely robust to population stratification; we show that our proposed methods remain valid even when population stratification is present."

They are related to cell envelope complexes, which are involved in assembly of surface appendages or transport of solutes.

The Hcp protein is related to the T4 bacteriophage tail tube protein gp19, whereas VgrG proteins structurally resemble the gp27/gp5 puncturing device of the phage. The tube and spike of the phage are pushed through the bacterial envelope upon contraction of a tail sheath composed of gp18. In Vibrio cholerae it was proposed that VipA and VipB assemble into a tail sheathlike structure. Here we confirm these previous data by showing that HsiB1 and HsiC1 of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa H1-T6SS assemble into tubules resulting from stacking of cogwheel-like structures showing predominantly 12-fold symmetry. The internal diameter of the cogwheels is ∼100 Å, which is large enough to accommodate an Hcp tube whose external diameter has been reported to be 85 Å. The N-terminal 212 residues of HsiC1 are sufficient to form a stable complex with HsiB1, but the C terminus of HsiC1 is essential for the formation of the tubelike structure.

In P. aeruginosa, three gene clusters encoding T6SS components have been identified in most sequenced strains to date.

A more general observation is that bacterial T6SS genes are mostly expressed during host contact/colonization and thus are not suitable for in vitro studies (5Filloux A. Hachani A. Bleves S.

The IcmF, DotU, and Lip proteins are likely to form a cell envelope platform. In the T6SS of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, it was shown that IcmF (TssM) and DotU (TssL) are inner membrane proteins interacting with each other, whereas IcmF also interacts with the outer membrane lipoprotein Lip (TssJ) (10Aschtgen M.S.

In enteroaggregative E. coli, an additional component called SciZ or TagL anchors the complex to the peptidoglycan (13Aschtgen M.S. Gavioli M. Dessen A. Lloubès R. Cascales E. The SciZ protein anchors the enteroaggregative Escherichia coli type VI secretion system to the cell wall.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 75: 886-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This component is not present in all T6SSs described so far, but some DotU-like proteins, as in the case of the H1-T6SS DotU1, carry a peptidoglycan-binding domain at their C terminus, thus performing this anchoring function. It is noteworthy that the DotU and IcmF protein families have been shown to be involved in the type IV secretion system (14Sexton J.A. Miller J.L. Yoneda A. Kehl-Fie T.E. Vogel J.P. Legionella pneumophila DotU and IcmF are required for stability of the Dot/Icm complex.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5983-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but these are the sole components conserved between T6SS and the type IV secretion system, and all other T6SS components described are system-specific. Although not finding further similarities with the type IV secretion system, it was shown earlier that the T6SS shares extensive similarities with the tail of contractile bacteriophages, such as the T4 phage. Most remarkably, the VgrG protein family structurally resembles the gp27-gp5 complex, which forms the puncturing device of the bacteriophage (15Pukatzki S. Ma A.T. Revel A.T. Sturtevant D. Mekalanos J.J. Type VI secretion system translocates a phage tail spike-like protein into target cells where it cross-links actin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This complex is made of two trimers, gp273-gp53 with the gp5 trimer assembling into a rigid helix of β-strands, which is the spike of the device and is required for puncturing the bacterial outer membrane. VgrG proteins form a trimer with structural resemblance to the gp273-gp53 complex, although one domain, which corresponds to a lysozyme domain within gp5 (16Hachani A. Lossi N.S. Hamilton A. Jones C.

In the T4 phage, the puncturing device sits at the tip of the tail tube, which is made of the gp19 protein (18Pukatzki S. McAuley S.B. Miyata S.T. The type VI secretion system: translocation of effectors and effector-domains.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It was reported that despite weak amino acid sequence similarities the structure of the Hcp1 protein could be superimposed with the structure of the tail tube protein of the phage λ, gpV (17Leiman P.G. Basler M. Ramagopal U.A. Bonanno J.B. Sauder J.M. Pukatzki S. Burley S.K. Almo S.C. Mekalanos J.J.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4154-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Hcp1 structure is seen as a hexamer with an external diameter of 85 Å, and this structure could be nicely fitted onto the top of a gp27 trimer, thus mimicking the connection between gp27 and the gp19 tail tube. Thus, it is clear that T6SS and bacteriophage tail components evolved from a common ancestor, but the poor amino acid sequence similarities suggest that they diverged a very long time ago. Thus, it is expected that other T6SS components may be related to phage components, but such similarity might only be observable when comparing resolved or predicted protein structures. This has been the case for example with the baseplate phage protein gp25 and the H1-T6SS component HsiF1 (TssE) (19Lossi N.S. Dajani R. Freemont P. Filloux A. Structure-function analysis of HsiF, a gp25-like component of the type VI secretion system, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Microbiology. 2011; 157: 3292-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and should be expected for HsiB1 (TssB) (20Lossi N.S.

In Vibrio cholerae, the VipA and VipB proteins, members of the TssB and TssC family, respectively, have been shown to form tubule-like structures that could be compared with the tail sheathlike structure of contractile bacteriophages (21Basler M.

In the present study, we showed that the HsiB1 and HsiC1 proteins could be co-purified and as in V. cholerae form exquisite tubule and cogwheel structures. We demonstrated which domains of these proteins are required for interaction and which are essential for formation of the tubules. This interaction is highly specific, and heterocomplex formation between components of the H1-T6SS and the H2-T6SS was not observed. The similarity was also established using bioinformatics approaches and suggests that the C terminus of HsiC1 shows resemblance with phage tail sheath proteins, known as gp18 in the case of the bacteriophage T4 (24Aksyuk A.A.

https://openalex.org/W2003928828,"Objective Mobility has long been associated with high HIV prevalence. We sought to assess sex differences in the relationship between mobility and risk for HIV infection among married couples in the fishing communities. Methods We conducted 1090 gender-matched interviews and rapid HIV testing with 545 couples proportionally representing all the different sizes of the fish-landing beaches in Kisumu County. We contacted a random sample of fishermen as our index participants and asked them to enrol in the study together with their spouses. The consenting couples were separated into different private rooms for concurrent interviews and thereafter reunited for couple rapid HIV counselling and testing. In addition to socio-economic and behavioural data, we collected information on overnight travels and divided couples in 4 groups as follows both partners not mobile, both partners mobile, only woman mobile, and only man mobile. Other than descriptive statistics, we used X2 and U tests to compare groups of variables and multivariate logistic regression to measure association between mobility and HIV infection. Results We found significant differences in the number of trips women travelled in the preceding month (mean 4.6, SD 7.1) compared to men (mean 3.3, SD 4.9; p<0.01) and when the women did travel, they were more likely to spend more days away from home than their male partners (mean 5.2 [SD 7.2] versus 3.4 SD 5.6; p = 0.01). With an HIV prevalence of 22.7% in women compared to 20.9% among men, mobile women who had non-mobile spouses had 2.1 times the likelihood of HIV infection compared to individuals in couples where both partners were non-mobile. Conclusion The mobility of fishermen’s spouses is associated with HIV infection that is not evident among fishermen themselves. Therefore, interventions in this community could be a combination of sex-specific programming that targets women and combined programming for couples."
https://openalex.org/W1965705716,"Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are important inhibitors of apoptosis in human cancer and are targets for novel anticancer agents such as the Bcl-2 antagonists, ABT-263 (Navitoclax), and its analog ABT-737. Unlike Bcl-2, Mcl-1 is not antagonized by ABT-263 or ABT-737 and is considered to be a major factor in resistance. Also, Mcl-1 exhibits differential regulation when compared with other Bcl-2 family members and is a target for anticancer drug discovery. Here, we demonstrate that BAG3, an Hsp70 co-chaperone, protects Mcl-1 from proteasomal degradation, thereby promoting its antiapoptotic activity. Using neuroblastoma cell lines, with a defined Bcl-2 family dependence, we found that BAG3 expression correlated with Mcl-1 dependence and ABT-737 resistance. RNA silencing of BAG3 led to a marked reduction in Mcl-1 protein levels and overcame ABT-737 resistance in Mcl-1-dependent cells. In ABT-737-resistant cells, Mcl-1 co-immunoprecipitated with BAG3, and loss of Mcl-1 after BAG3 silencing was prevented by proteasome inhibition. BAG3 and Mcl-1 were co-expressed in a panel of diverse cancer cell lines resistant to ABT-737. Silencing BAG3 reduced Mcl-1 protein levels and overcame ABT-737 resistance in several of the cell lines, including triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB231) and androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer (PC3) cells. These studies identify BAG3-mediated Mcl-1 stabilization as a potential target for cancer drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2068465610,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates angiogenesis by binding to VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) on endothelial cells (ECs). Downstream activation of the extracellular related kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) is important for angiogenesis to proceed. Receptor internalization has been implicated in VEGFR2 signaling, but its role in the activation of ERK1/2 is unclear. To explore this question we utilized pitstop and dynasore, two small molecule inhibitors of endocytosis. First, we confirmed that both inhibitors block the internalization of VEGFR2 in ECs. We then stimulated ECs with VEGF in the presence and absence of the inhibitors and examined VEGFR2 signaling to ERK1/2. Activation of VEGFR2 and C-Raf still occurred in the presence of the inhibitors, whereas the activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 was abrogated. Therefore, although internalization is not required for activation of either VEGFR2 or C-Raf in ECs stimulated with VEGF, internalization is necessary to activate the more distal kinases in the cascade. Importantly, inhibition of internalization also prevented activation of ERK1/2 when ECs were stimulated with other pro-angiogenic growth factors, namely fibroblast growth factor 2 and hepatocyte growth factor. In contrast, the same inhibitors did not block ERK1/2 activation in fibroblasts or cancer cells stimulated with growth factors. Finally, we show that these small molecule inhibitors of endocytosis block angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, receptor internalization may be a generic requirement for pro-angiogenic growth factors to activate ERK1/2 signaling in human ECs, and targeting receptor trafficking may present a therapeutic opportunity to block tumor angiogenesis."

However, its effect on platelets and the receptor by which fucoidan induces cellular processes has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that fucoidan induces platelet activation in a concentration-dependent manner. Fucoidan-induced platelet activation was completely abolished by the pan-Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor, PP2, or when Syk is inhibited. PP2 abolished phosphorylations of Syk and Phospholipase C-γ2. Fucoidan-induced platelet activation had a lag phase, which is reminiscent of platelet activation by collagen and CLEC-2 receptor agonists. Platelet activation by fucoidan was only slightly inhibited in FcRγ-chain null mice, indicating that fucoidan was not acting primarily through GPVI receptor. On the other hand, fucoidan-induced platelet activation was inhibited in platelet-specific CLEC-2 knock-out murine platelets revealing CLEC-2 as a physiological target of fucoidan. Thus, our data show fucoidan as a novel CLEC-2 receptor agonist that activates platelets through a SFK-dependent signaling pathway.

However, the effect of fucoidan on platelet aggregation, which regulates bleeding times, has not been studied. GPVI signaling in platelets depends on FcRγ chain activation leading to tyrosine kinase pathways resulting in the activation of Syk and PLCγ2 (10Tsuji M. Ezumi Y. Arai M. Takayama H.

In the present study, we show that fucoidan causes platelet activation, leading to αIIbβ3-mediated aggregation. We show that fucoidan signals through a tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathway downstream of CLEC-2 receptor and propose that this contributes to a decrease in bleeding time in hemophilia animal models. These results support the notion that decreased bleeding times can be achieved in hemophilia patients through activation of platelets. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Temple University (Philadelphia, PA). Platelet specific CLEC-2 knock-out mice were produced as described previously (50Finney B.A. Schweighoffer E. Navarro-Núñez L. Bénézech C. Barone F. Hughes C.E. Langan S.A. Lowe K.L. Pollitt A.Y.

Briefly, the CLEC-2 gene (CLEC1b) was flanked with LoxP sites, and this mouse was cross-bred with a PF4-Cre expressing mouse to drive excision of the gene in only the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage. Apyrase (type VII), acetylsalicylic acid, fucoidan (80% pure, with the major contaminant being fucose), and indomethacin were obtained from Sigma.

Monoclonal mouse anti-CLEC-2 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. FITC-labeled PAC-1 and mouse IgG isotype control antibodies were obtained from BD Technologies (Franklin Lakes, NJ). P-selectin-PE antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Blood was collected from informed healthy volunteers in to one-sixth volume of acid/citrate/dextrose (2.5 g of sodium citrate, 2 g of glucose, and 1.5 g of citric acid in 100 ml deionized water). Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 250 × g for 20 min at ambient temperature and incubated with 1 mm aspirin for 30 min at 37 °C. Platelets were isolated from plasma by centrifugation at 980 × g for 10 min at ambient temperature and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer, pH 6.5 (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm PIPES (pH 6.5) containing 20 nm PGE1, 10 μm indomethacin, 500 μm EGTA, and 0.2 units/ml apyrase,). Platelets were isolated from Tyrode's buffer, pH 6.5, by centrifugation at 980 × g for 10 min and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4 (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.2 units/ml apyrase, pH 7.4). The platelet count was adjusted to 2–2.5 × 108/ml. Approval was obtained from the institutional review board of Temple University for these studies. Informed consent was provided prior to blood donation. All mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility, and animal procedures were carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines after the Temple University Animal Care and Use Committee approved the study protocol, or they were performed under UK Home Office Project license (PPL 40/2803). Fccer1g (FcRγ knock-out) or γ-chain-deficient mice were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY). Age- and gender-matched wild-type mice were used as controls. Blood was drawn via cardiac puncture into one-tenth volume of 3.8% sodium citrate. Blood was spun at 100 × g for 10 min, and the platelet rich plasma (PRP) was separated. Red blood cells were mixed with 400 μl of 3.8% sodium citrate and spun for a further 10 min at 100 × g. Resulting platelet rich plasmas (PRPs) were combined, and 1 μm PGE1 added and centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × g. Platelet-poor plasma was removed, and the platelet pellet was resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 units/ml apyrase. Platelet counts were determined using a Hemavet 950FS blood cell counter (Drew Scientific Inc., Dallas, TX). For aggregation studies, a density of 2 × 108 platelets/ml was used. Platelet aggregation was measured using a lumi-aggregometer (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA) at 37 °C under stirring conditions. A 0.5-ml sample of aspirin-treated washed platelets was stimulated with different agonists, and change in light transmission was measured. Platelets were preincubated with different inhibitors where noted before agonist stimulation. The chart recorder was set for 0.2 mm/s. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 5 μm Fura-2/AM and 1 mm aspirin for 45 min at 37 °C. Platelets were prepared as described above, and fluorescence was measured in a Perkin-Elmer apparatus with excitation set at 340 nm and emission set at 510 nm. Fluorescence measurements were converted to Ca2+ concentrations using the equation as reported (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. A new generation of Ca2+ indicators with greatly improved fluorescence properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Washed and aspirin-treated human platelets were used to measure agonist-dependent levels of αIIβb3-activated receptor by PAC-1-FITC antibody and CD62P-PE antibody. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of washed platelet suspension in Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2 were preincubated with the indicated concentration of inhibitors for 5 min at 37 °C. Prior to the activation with fucoidan, an aliquot containing 106 platelets was gently mixed with 40 μl of antibody mixture and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the dark. Platelets were identified and gated according to the forward and side scatter signals. As control for immunolabeling, platelets were incubated with non-immuno-IgG isotype control antibody. To fix the platelets, 1% parafarmaldehyde dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline was added. A total of 10,000 platelet events were acquired per sample, and the percentage of positive gated cells was analyzed. All determinations were performed on a FACS Caliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Washed human platelets (1 × 109/ml) were stimulated with rhodocytin (50 nm) or fucoidan (50 μg/ml). Reactions were terminated by adding equal volume of 2× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm PMSF, 5 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Antibodies against CLEC-2 (5 μg/ml) or control IgG were added to the resultant supernatant and incubated overnight with protein A Sepharose. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with the 4G10 antibody. Platelets were stimulated with agonists in the presence of inhibitors or vehicles for the appropriate time under stirring conditions at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.6 n HClO4. The resulting acid precipitate was collected and kept on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 4 min followed by resuspending in 0.5 ml of deionized water. The protein was again pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 4 min. The protein pellets were solubilized in sample buffer containing 0.1 m Tris, 2% SDS, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 100 mm DTT and then boiled for 10 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman Protran). Membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer for 1 h at ambient temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with the desired primary antibody, and then washed four times with TBS-T. Membranes were then incubated with appropriate secondary infrared dye-labeled antibody for 60 min at room temperature and washed four times with TBS-T. Membranes were examined with a Li-Cor Odyssey infrared imaging system. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. with number of observations (n). Data were analyzed using KaleidaGraph software. Significant differences were determined using Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. As fucoidan reduced bleeding times in hemophilia animal models (8Liu T. Scallan C.D. Broze Jr., G.J. Patarroyo-White S. Pierce G.F. Johnson K.W.

Efficacy and safety of a new-class hemostatic drug candidate, AV513, in dogs with hemophilia A.Blood. 2008; 111: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether fucoidan can cause platelet activation. Fucoidan caused aggregation of washed human platelets in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Fucoidan caused only shape change at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, whereas maximum aggregation was achieved at 50 μg/ml (Fig. 1A). We also evaluated the effects of fucoidan on other platelet functional responses, including integrin activation (Fig. 1B), dense granule secretion (Fig. 1C), P-selectin expression (Fig. 1D), and thromboxane generation (Fig. 1E) in human platelets. These results show that fucoidan causes platelet activation. Many platelet surface receptors, which mediate positive functional responses, are coupled to either Gq-dependent or tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways (25Brass L. Understanding and evaluating platelet function.Hematology Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program. 2010; : 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine the signaling mechanism involved in fucoidan-induced platelet activation, we used the selective Gq inhibitor YM-254890 (26Uemura T. Kawasaki T. Taniguchi M. Moritani Y. Hayashi K. Saito T. Takasaki J. Uchida W. Miyata K. Biological properties of a specific Gα q/11 inhibitor, YM-254890, on platelet functions and thrombus formation under high-shear stress.Br. J.

[Pharmacological properties of a specific Gq/11 inhibitor, YM-254890].Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi. 2006; 128: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) or the pan SFK inhibitor PP2 (28Li Z. Zhang G. Liu J. Stojanovic A. Ruan C. Lowell C.A. Du X. An important role of the SRC family kinase Lyn in stimulating platelet granule secretion.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12559-12570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Platelets pretreated with YM-254890 had only a minimum reduction in aggregation in comparison with the full inhibition of aggregation to AYPGKF (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the Gq pathway plays a minimal role in the activation of platelets by fucoidan, presumably through the feedback action of TxA2. As shown in Fig. 2B, fucoidan-induced platelet activation was completely abolished by PP2 but not by its inactive analog, PP3. These data demonstrate that SFK-dependent pathways are required for fucoidan-induced platelet activation. It is known that SFK-mediated signaling pathways involve activation and phosphorylation of Syk and Lat in platelets (29Speich H.E. Grgurevich S. Kueter T.J. Earhart A.D. Slack S.M. Jennings L.K. Platelets undergo phosphorylation of Syk at Y525/526 and Y352 in response to pathophysiological shear stress.Am. J. Physiol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8326-8334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of Syk and Lat following stimulation of platelets with fucoidan. As shown in Fig. 3A, Syk and Lat phosphorylations occurred as early as 15 s and dephosphorylated in a time-dependent manner. Fucoidan-induced Syk and Lat phosphorylations were abolished by pretreatment of platelets with PP2 (Fig. 3B). These data support our observation that fucoidan-mediated signaling pathways involve Syk and Lat activation downstream of SFKs. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was also measured in response to fucoidan in the presence of the pan SFK inhibitor PP2. PP2 completely blocked calcium mobilization compared with control (PP3) platelets (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that fucoidan activates a SFK-dependent pathway leading to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. The functional role of Syk in signaling by fucoidan was investigated by pretreating platelets with the Syk inhibitors OXSI-2 or Go6976 (31Getz T.M. Mayanglambam A. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P.

https://openalex.org/W2026768644,"The Na,K-ATPase is specifically inhibited by cardiotonic steroids (CTSs) like digoxin and is of significant therapeutic value in the treatment of congestive heart failure and arrhythmia. Recently, new interest has arisen in developing Na,K-ATPase inhibitors as anticancer agents. In the present study, we compare the potency and rate of inhibition as well as the reactivation of enzyme activity following inhibition by various cardiac glycosides and their aglycones at different pH values using shark Na,K-ATPase stabilized in the E2MgPi or in the E2BeFx conformations. The effects of the number and nature of various sugar residues as well as changes in the positions of hydroxyl groups on the β-side of the steroid core of cardiotonic steroids were investigated by comparing various cardiac glycoside compounds like ouabain, digoxin, digitoxin, and gitoxin with their aglycones. The results confirm our previous hypothesis that CTS binds primarily to the E2-P ground state through an extracellular access channel and that binding of extracellular Na(+) ions to K(+) binding sites relieved the CTS inhibition. This reactivation depended on the presence or absence of the sugar moiety on the CTS, and a single sugar is enough to impede reactivation. Finally, increasing the number of hydroxyl groups of the steroid was sterically unfavorable and was found to decrease the inhibitory potency and to confer high pH sensitivity, depending on their position on the steroid β-face. The results are discussed with reference to the recent crystal structures of Na,K-ATPase in the unbound and ouabain-bound states."
https://openalex.org/W1972657237,"Rarely human communities coexist in harmony with large predators. Most often communities suffer due to predation on their stock while large carnivores suffer losses and at times extirpation due to retaliation. We examine the mechanisms permitting the coexistence of Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) and pastoral communities (Maldharis) in the Gir forests, India. We monitored six Maldhari settlements between 2005 and 2007 to quantify seasonal livestock holding, density and losses due to predation and other causes. Lion density, estimated by mark recapture, was 15±0.1 SE/100 km2. Livestock density, estimated by total counts, ranged between 25/km2–31/km2 with buffaloes being most abundant. Average livestock holding of Maldhari families was 33±3 SE. Lions predated mostly on unproductive cattle (30%). Scat analysis (n = 165), predation events (n = 180) and seven continuous monitoring sessions of 1,798 hours on four radio-collared lions estimated livestock to contribute between 25 to 42% of lions’ biomass consumptions, of which only 16% was predated; rest scavenged. With free grazing rights within Gir forests, Maldharis offset 58±0.2 SE% of annual livestock rearing cost in comparison to non-forest dwelling pastoralists. With government compensation scheme for livestock predation, this profit margin augmented to 76±0.05 SE%. Lion density was higher in areas with Maldhari livestock in comparison to areas without livestock. Thus, the current lifestyles and livestock holdings of Maldharis seem to be beneficial to both lions and local pastoralists. We conclude that a combination of strict protection regime for lions, Maldharis’ traditional reverence towards lions and the livelihood economics permit the delicate balance of lion-Maldhari coexistence. Indefinite increase in human and livestock population within Gir might upset this equilibrium undermining the conservation objectives. We see no end to compensation programs worldwide as they constitute a crucial element needed for human-carnivore coexistence."
https://openalex.org/W2023068286,"Sex chromosomes are an ideal system to study processes connected with suppressed recombination. We found evidence of microsatellite expansion, on the relatively young Y chromosome of the dioecious plant sorrel (Rumex acetosa, XY1Y2 system), but no such expansion on the more ancient Y chromosomes of liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha) and human. The most expanding motifs were AC and AAC, which also showed periodicity of array length, indicating the importance of beginnings and ends of arrays. Our data indicate that abundance of microsatellites in genomes depends on the inherent expansion potential of specific motifs, which could be related to their stability and ability to adopt unusual DNA conformations. We also found that the abundance of microsatellites is higher in the neighborhood of transposable elements (TEs) suggesting that microsatellites are probably targets for TE insertions. This evidence suggests that microsatellite expansion is an early event shaping the Y chromosome where this process is not opposed by recombination, while accumulation of TEs and chromosome shrinkage predominate later."

BOLD responses were measured with a hemodynamic impulse response (HRF) obtained from the spin-echo (SE) and gradient-echo (GE) BOLD contrast using very short stimuli (0.25 s) and a fast event-related functional paradigm. We show that the onset (∼1.25 s) and the rising slope of the GE and SE HRFs are strikingly similar for voxels in deep gray matter presumably containing the most metabolically demanding neurons (layers III–IV). This finding provides a strong indication that the onset of the GE HRF in deep gray matter is predominantly associated with microvasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2037056861,"Identification of cell type-specific enhancers is important for understanding the regulation of programs controlling cellular development and differentiation. Enhancers are typically marked by the co-transcriptional activator protein p300 or by groups of cell-expressed transcription factors. We hypothesized that a unique set of enhancers regulates gene expression in human erythroid cells, a highly specialized cell type evolved to provide adequate amounts of oxygen throughout the body. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing, genome-wide maps of candidate enhancers were constructed for p300 and four transcription factors, GATA1, NF-E2, KLF1, and SCL, using primary human erythroid cells. These data were combined with gene expression analyses, and candidate enhancers were identified. Consistent with their predicted function as candidate enhancers, there was statistically significant enrichment of p300 and combinations of co-localizing erythroid transcription factors within 1-50 kb of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of genes highly expressed in erythroid cells. Candidate enhancers were also enriched near genes with known erythroid cell function or phenotype. Candidate enhancers exhibited moderate conservation with mouse and minimal conservation with nonplacental vertebrates. Candidate enhancers were mapped to a set of erythroid-associated, biologically relevant, SNPs from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalogue of NHGRI, National Institutes of Health. Fourteen candidate enhancers, representing 10 genetic loci, mapped to sites associated with biologically relevant erythroid traits. Fragments from these loci directed statistically significant expression in reporter gene assays. Identification of enhancers in human erythroid cells will allow a better understanding of erythroid cell development, differentiation, structure, and function and provide insights into inherited and acquired hematologic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2026661170,"The mammalian retina has more diversity of neurons than scientists had once believed in order to establish complicated vision processing. In the monkey retina, morphological diversity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) besides dominant midget and parasol cells has been suggested. However, characteristic subtypes of RGCs in other species such as bistratified direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGC) have not yet been identified. Increasing interest has been shown in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) monkey as a “super-model” of neuroscientific research. Here, we established organotypic tissue culture of the adult marmoset monkey retina with particle-mediated gene transfer of GFP to survey the morphological diversity of RGCs. We successfully incubated adult marmoset monkey retinas for 2 to 4 days ex vivo for transient expression of GFP. We morphologically examined 121 RGCs out of more than 3240 GFP-transfected cells in 5 retinas. Among them, we identified monostratified or broadly stratified ganglion cells (midget, parasol, sparse, recursive, thorny, and broad thorny ganglion cells), and bistratified ganglion cells (recursive, large, and small bistratified ganglion cells [blue-ON/yellow-OFF-like]). By this survey, we also found a candidate for bistratified DSGC whose dendrites were well cofasciculated with ChAT-positive starburst dendrites, costratified with ON and OFF ChAT bands, and had honeycomb-shaped dendritic arbors morphologically similar to those in rabbits. Our genetic engineering method provides a new approach to future investigation for morphological and functional diversity of RGCs in the monkey retina."
https://openalex.org/W2023020566,"Cytokine-mediated regulation of T-cell activity involves a complex interplay between key signal transduction pathways. Determining how these signaling pathways cross-talk is essential to understanding T-cell function and dysfunction. In this work, we provide evidence that cross-talk exists between at least two signaling pathways: the Jak3/Stat5 and cAMP-mediated cascades. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (Fsk) significantly increased intracellular cAMP levels and reduced proliferation of the human T-cells via inhibition of cell cycle regulatory genes but did not induce apoptosis. To determine this inhibitory mechanism, effects of Fsk on IL-2 signaling was investigated. Fsk treatment of MT-2 and Kit 225 T-cells inhibited IL-2-induced Stat5a/b tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding activity. Fsk treatment also uncoupled IL-2 induced association of the IL-2Rβ and γc chain, consequently blocking Jak3 activation. Interestingly, phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that Fsk-treated cells resulted in elevated serine phosphorylation of Jak3 but not Stat5, suggesting that Fsk can negatively regulate Jak3 activity possibly mediated through PKA. Indeed, in vitro kinase assays and small molecule inhibition studies indicated that PKA can directly serine phosphorylate and functionally inactivate Jak3. Taken together, these findings suggest that Fsk activation of adenylate cyclase and PKA can negatively regulate IL-2 signaling at multiple levels that include IL-2R complex formation and Jak3/Stat5 activation."

CCX-CKR is an atypical chemokine receptor with high affinity for CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 chemokines, but is not known to activate intracellular signaling pathways. However, CCX-CKR acts as decoy receptor and efficiently internalizes these chemokines, thereby preventing their interaction with other chemokine receptors, like CCR7 and CCR9. Internalization of fluorescently labeled CCL19 correlated with β-arrestin2-GFP translocation. Moreover, recruitment of β-arrestins to CCX-CKR in response to CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 was demonstrated using enzyme-fragment complementation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer methods.

The 19 known human chemokine receptors and their ∼50 endogenous peptide ligands form a complex system in which many chemokine receptors can bind multiple chemokines, and many chemokines can bind more than one receptor (1.Scholten D.J. Canals M. Maussang D. Roumen L. Smit M.J. Wijtmans M. de Graaf C. Vischer H.F. Leurs R. Pharmacological modulation of chemokine receptor function.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 165: 1617-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Chemokine receptors signal predominantly via heterotrimeric Gi proteins, resulting in an inhibition of cAMP production by adenylyl cyclases and induction of intracellular calcium mobilization (2.O'Hayre M. Salanga C.L. Handel T.M. Allen S.J. Chemokines and cancer. Migration, intracellular signalling and intercellular communication in the microenvironment.Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the chemokine receptors D6, DARC, CCX-CKR, CXCR7, and CCRL2 bind chemokines with high affinity, but ligand binding does not result in G protein-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization or chemotaxis (3.Ulvmar M.H. Hub E. Rot A. Atypical chemokine receptors.Exp. Cell Res. 2011; 317: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Rather, these atypical chemokine receptors act as decoy receptors to regulate chemokine availability. Upon internalization, the receptor-bound chemokines are either targeted for lysosomal degradation or transported across the cell to be subsequently exposed or released on the other side of the cell (i.e. transcytosis) (3.Ulvmar M.H. Hub E. Rot A. Atypical chemokine receptors.Exp. Cell Res. 2011; 317: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CCX-CKR is a high affinity receptor for the chemokines CCL19/ELC, CCL21/SLC, and CCL25/TECK (4.Gosling J. Dairaghi D.J. Wang Y. Hanley M. Talbot D. Miao Z. Schall T.J. Cutting edge.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 2851-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These chemokines are important for the development of acquired immunity by activating CCR7 or CCR9. CCL19 and CCL21 recruit CCR7-expressing dendritic and T cells into the T cell compartments of secondary lymphoid organs (5.Förster R. Davalos-Misslitz A.C. Rot A. CCR7 and its ligands. Balancing immunity and tolerance.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). CCL25, on the other hand, recruits antigen-experienced lymphocytes to the small intestine by activating CCR9 (6.Pabst O. Ohl L. Wendland M. Wurbel M.A. Kremmer E. Malissen B. Förster R. Chemokine receptor CCR9 contributes to the localization of plasma cells to the small intestine.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Mouse CCX-CKR knock-out models demonstrated that CCX-CKR is important for steady-state homing of dendritic cells to skin-draining lymph nodes, T cell differentiation, and immune response kinetics in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, by regulating local chemokine levels (7.Heinzel K.

Moreover, CCR7 and CCR9 have been shown to play a role in various cancers (9.Lazennec G. Richmond A. Chemokines and chemokine receptors. New insights into cancer-related inflammation.Trends Mol. Med. 2010; 16: 133-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). CCX-CKR scavenges CCL19 and CCL21 both in vitro and in vivo, thereby decreasing the free concentration of these chemokines (7.Heinzel K. Benz C. Bleul C.C.

Additionally, CCX-CKR has been suggested to mediate CCL19 and CCL21 transcytosis across lymphatic endothelium, although direct evidence is still lacking (12.Haraldsen G. Rot A. Coy decoy with a new ploy. Interceptor controls the levels of homeostatic chemokines.Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 1659-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). CCX-CKR is expressed in many tissues, including heart, lung, and intestine, as well as by stromal cells of skin-draining lymph nodes, thymic epithelial cells, and a number of hematopoietic cell types (4.Gosling J.

Following or alternative to G protein coupling, activated GPCRs can also recruit β-arrestin upon phosphorylation of their intracellular domains. β-Arrestin bound to the GPCR may then act as a scaffold protein for receptor internalization and G protein-independent signaling to, for example, extracellular stimulus-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt (protein kinase B) (17.Rajagopal S.

However, a more recent study provided evidence that β-arrestin was not necessarily involved in D6 internalization but increased receptor stability (21.McCulloch C.V. Morrow V. Milasta S. Comerford I.

In the present study, however, we demonstrate for the first time the concentration-dependent recruitment of β-arrestins to the atypical chemokine receptor CCX-CKR upon stimulation with CCL19, CCL21, or CCL25 using three different methodologies in various transfected cell lines. Moreover, we provide evidence that Gi proteins impair CCX-CKR-mediated signaling to CRE. These new aspects of CCX-CKR signaling provide additional avenues through which the role of CCX-CKR may be further explored.

U2OS-β-arr2-GFP, U2OS-PTHR1, or U2OS-CCX-CKR cells were seeded in clear-bottom 96-well plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 15,000 cells/well in 90 μl of assay medium (DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin) and cultured overnight. The following day, medium was replaced with 45 μl of assay medium. Five microliters of assay medium containing chemokines was added and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (BioConnect, Huissen, The Netherlands) and incubated with 1 μm Hoechst (Invitrogen) in PBS for 30 min. Plates were analyzed on an Operetta automated fluorescence microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were seeded in 384-well CulturPlates (PerkinElmer) at 10,000 cells/well in 15 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 1% (v/v) bovine calf serum (assay medium). The next day, cells were stimulated with 10 μl of chemokine in assay medium and then returned to the incubator for 90 min. Cells were disrupted using 12 μl of substrate-containing lysis buffer from the PathHunter Detection Kit in the formulation specified by the supplier (DiscoveRx). Plates were incubated in the dark for 90 min at room temperature before measurement of β-galactosidase activity (luminescence) on an Envision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer). One day after transfection, HEK293T cells were transferred to poly-l-lysine-coated white 96-well plates. Growth medium contained 100 ng/ml of PTX (Sigma) where applicable. The next day, medium was replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 100 ng/ml of PTX where applicable and fluorescence was measured on a Victor3 multilabel plate reader (excitation 485 nm; emission 535 nm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Ten minutes after addition of coelenterazine-h (5 μm final concentration; Promega, Madison, WI), ligand solutions in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.05% BSA were added in the stated concentrations and incubated for an additional 5 min. BRET (emission 535 nm) and Rluc expression (emission 460 nm) were measured with a Victor3 multilabel plate reader. Baseline-corrected BRET ratios were calculated by first dividing BRET by Rluc emission values, followed by subtraction of the BRET ratio of cells expressing CCX-CKR-Rluc alone. cAMP measurements in CHO-CCX-CKR cells were performed with a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence kit from Cisbio (Gif-sur-Yvette, France) essentially as described previously (27.van Der Lee M.M. Bras M. van Koppen C.J. Zaman G.J. β-Arrestin recruitment assay for the identification of agonists of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor EDG1.J. Biomol.

Briefly, chemokines diluted in 10 μl of dilution buffer either containing forskolin (0.5 μm final concentration) or DMSO control were dispensed in 384-well OptiPlates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Subsequently, 7,500 CHO-CCX-CKR cells in 10 μl of assay medium (DMEM/F-12 containing 5 μg/ml of apo-transferrin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml of insulin, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin) were added and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Cells were disrupted by addition of 10 μl of cAMP-XL665 conjugate and 10 μl of Europium-labeled anti-cAMP antibody diluted in lysis buffer (all provided with the kit). Plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 60 min before measurement of time-resolved fluorescence at 615 and 665 nm on an Envision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Absolute cAMP concentrations were calculated from a cAMP standard. Inositol phosphate measurements in CHO-CCX-CKR cells were performed using a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence kit from Cisbio (Gif-sur-Yvette, France). CHO-CCX-CKR cells were plated in 384-well proxiPlates with 10,000 cells/well in 20 μl of assay medium (DMEM/F-12 containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin) and were allowed to adhere overnight. Medium was aspirated and cells were stimulated with 14 μl of chemokine in stimulation buffer (provided in the kit) containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min before the addition of 3 μl of IPone-XL665 conjugate and 3 μl of Europium-labeled anti-IPone antibody diluted in lysis buffer (all provided with the kit). Plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 60 min before measurement of time-resolved fluorescence at 615 and 665 nm on an Envision multilabel plate reader. Absolute IPone concentrations were calculated from an IPone standard. Isolation of CHO-CCX-CKR lysates and Western blotting was performed as described previously (25.Van Lith L.H. Oosterom J.

The following antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions: mouse anti-β-actin, 1:5000 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK); rabbit anti-total Akt, 1:1000; rabbit anti-phospho-Ser473; Akt, 1:1000; rabbit anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK1/2, 1:2000 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); mouse anti-total ERK1/2, 1:2000 (Invitrogen); anti-mouse HRP conjugate, 1:2000; and anti-rabbit HRP conjugate, 1:2000 (Promega). One day after transfection, HEK293T cells were transferred to poly-l-lysine-coated white 96-well plates. Where required, growth medium contained 100 ng/ml of PTX. The following day, growth medium was replaced with serum-free medium supplemented with 0.05% BSA and 100 ng/ml of PTX, 1 μm forskolin (FSK), and/or ligands, as indicated. After 6 to 8 h incubation at 37 °C, stimulation medium was removed and cells were incubated for 5 min with 25 μl of substrate solution (39 mm Tris·H3PO4, pH 7.8, 39% glycerol, 2.6% Triton X-100, 860 μm dithiothreitol, 18 mm MgCl2, 825 μm ATP, 77 μm disodium pyrophosphate, 230 μg/ml of beetle luciferin) (Promega). Luminescence was measured using a Victor3 multilabel plate reader. Changes in cAMP levels were detected using a BRET-based cAMP sensor in a similar manner as the BRET-based β-arrestin recruitment assay, except that cells were rinsed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and incubated with fresh Hanks' balanced salt solution for 30 min before being stimulated. In addition, the nonspecific phosphodiesterase 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was added simultaneously with coelenterazine-h to a final concentration of 40 μm (23.Scholten D.J. Canals M.

Protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is exquisitely sensitive to energy supply and amino acid sources because deficiencies impair luminal protein folding and consequently trigger ER stress signaling. Following ER stress, many cell types arrest within the G1 phase, although recent studies have identified a novel ER stress G2 checkpoint. Here, we report that ER stress affects cell cycle progression via two classes of signal: an early inhibition of protein synthesis leading to G2 delay involving CHK1 and a later induction of G1 arrest associated both with the induction of p53 target genes and loss of cyclin D1. We show that substitution of p53/47 for p53 impairs the ER stress G1 checkpoint, attenuates the recovery of protein translation, and impairs induction of NOXA, a mediator of cell death. We propose that cell cycle regulation in response to ER stress comprises redundant pathways invoked sequentially first to impair G2 progression prior to ultimate G1 arrest.

Failure to maintain proteostasis, the state of healthy protein maturation, underlies the pathology of many diseases including diabetes and cancer (1Balch W.E. Morimoto R.I. Dillin A. Kelly J.W. Adapting proteostasis for disease intervention.Science. 2008; 319: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar).

Herein, we show that ER stress affects cell cycle progression via two classes of signal: an early inhibition of protein synthesis leading to G2 delay mediated by CHK1 and a later induction of G1 arrest associated with both the induction of p53 target genes and loss of cyclin D1. We show that substitution of p53/47 for p53 impairs the ER stress G1 checkpoint, attenuates the recovery of protein translation, and impairs induction of NOXA, a mediator of cell death. We propose that cell cycle regulation in response to ER stress comprises redundant pathways invoked sequentially first to impair G2 progression prior to ultimate G1 arrest. The coding sequence of p53/p47 was subcloned from pcDNA3.1.p53/p47ΔIRES (a gift from Prof. Robin Fahraeus, INSERM, France) into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) between HindIII and SalI restriction sites.

Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was taken as the cytosolic fraction. Nuclei were washed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 EGTA, 1 mm DTT with protease inhibitors, and then soluble nuclear proteins were extracted in 4 pellet volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT with protease inhibitors by vortexing for 15 min at 4 °C.

Cells were recovered by trypsinization; fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol; and incubated with PBS, RNase (5 mg/ml) (MP Biomedicals, Illkirch Cedex, France), and propidium iodide (20 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were analyzed using a CyAn fluorescence-activated cell sorting instrument (Dako, Stockport, UK) using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).

For gene silencing in Drosophila, all RNAi lines used were obtained from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center, Austria: grp RNAi line v12680, atm/tefu RNAi line v22502, atr/mei-41 line v11251, and chk2/lok lines v44981 and v44980. For expression in the eye imaginal disc posterior to the morphogenetic furrow, the GMR-Gal4 line BL1104 was purchased from the Bloomington Stock Center. All stocks were in a w1118 background and maintained at 18 °C using standard techniques unless otherwise stated. All crosses were set up at 18 °C. HCT116 cells were grown in 6-well plates for 16 h at 37 °C 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours prior to lysis, the cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of a UPR response element (p5×ATF6-Luc) and 50 ng of pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase) transfection efficiency control reporter plasmids (both kind gifts from Dr. Timothy Weaver, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH). The cells were transfected for 6 h and then induced with 500 nm thapsigargin for the designated time periods. Transfected cells were lysed and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). Both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a GloMax luminometer (Promega), and firefly luciferase activity was calculated relative to Renilla luciferase activity. All measurements were performed in triplicate and repeated on at least three independent occasions. To determine the rate of new protein synthesis, cells were grown in DMEM in the presence of 500 nm thapsigargin for the designated time points. The cells were then washed in PBS and metabolically labeled with 1.3 MBq of [35S]Met/Cys for 15 min in DMEM. Cells were then rinsed and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1× CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Twenty micrograms of cell lysate were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and quantified by autoradiography using a Cyclone phosphorimaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following primers were purchased from Invitrogen: cyclin D1: forward, 5′-TGT TCG TGG CCT CTA AGA TGA AG-3′; reverse, 5′-AGG TTC CAC TTG AGC TTG TTC AC-3′; p21: forward, 5′-ATG TGT CCT GGT TCC CGT TTC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAT TGT GGG AGG AGC TGT GA-3′; GADD34: forward, 5′-ATG TAT GGT GAG CGA GAG GC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCA GTG TCC TTA TCA GAA GGC-3′; CHOP: forward, 5′-ACC AAG GGA GAA CCA GGA AAC G-3′; reverse, 5′-TCA CCA TTC GGT CAA TCA GAG C-3′; actin: forward, 5′-CTC TTC CAG CCT TCC TTC CT-3′; reverse, 5′-AGC ACT GTG TTG GCG TAC AG-3′. For each reaction, 2× Qiagen SYBR Green PCR reagent, 1.2 mm forward primer, and 1.2 mm reverse primer were used in a total volume of 24 μl with RNase-free water. To each reaction, 1 μl of cDNA (diluted 1:100) was added to make a final volume of 25 μl. The qPCR was performed on an ABI 2000 analyzer with the following program: 95 °C for 15 min; then 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s repeated for 40 cycles; and 4 °C for 10 min. Absolute changes in transcription (Ct) were measured, and further analyses were performed based on primer efficiency in accordance with Pfaffl calculations (30Pfaffl M.W.

https://openalex.org/W2064576491,"A large-scale subjective survey was conducted in six shopping malls in Harbin City, China, to determine the influence of social and behavioural characteristics of users on their evaluation of subjective loudness and acoustic comfort. The analysis of social characteristics shows that evaluation of subjective loudness is influenced by income and occupation, with correlation coefficients or contingency coefficients of 0.10 to 0.40 (p<0.05 or p<0.01). Meanwhile, evaluation of acoustic comfort evaluation is influenced by income, education level, and occupation, with correlation coefficients or contingency coefficients of 0.10 to 0.60 (p<0.05 or p<0.01). The effect of gender and age on evaluation of subjective loudness and acoustic comfort is statistically insignificant. The effects of occupation are mainly caused by the differences in income and education level, in which the effects of income are greater than that of education level. In terms of behavioural characteristics, evaluation of subjective loudness is influenced by the reason for visit, frequency of visit, and length of stay, with correlation coefficients or contingency coefficients of 0.10 to 0.40 (p<0.05 or p<0.01). Evaluation of acoustic comfort is influenced by the reason for visit to the site, the frequency of visit, length of stay, and also season of visit, with correlation coefficients of 0.10 to 0.30 (p<0.05 or p<0.01). In particular, users who are waiting for someone show lower evaluation of acoustic comfort, whereas users who go to shopping malls more than once a month show higher evaluation of acoustic comfort. On the contrary, the influence of the period of visit and the accompanying persons are found insignificant."
https://openalex.org/W2065209232,"We have mapped a Jagged/Serrate-binding site to specific residues within the 12th EGF domain of human and Drosophila Notch. Two critical residues, involved in a hydrophobic interaction, provide a ligand-binding platform and are adjacent to a Fringe-sensitive residue that modulates Notch activity. Our data suggest that small variations within the binding site fine-tune ligand specificity, which may explain the observed sequence heterogeneity in mammalian Notch paralogues, and should allow the development of paralogue-specific ligand-blocking antibodies. As a proof of principle, we have generated a Notch-1-specific monoclonal antibody that blocks binding, thus paving the way for antibody tools for research and therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2074384047,"Obesity is a major disease condition, in turn leading to pathological changes collectively recognized as metabolic syndrome. Recently angiotensin receptor AT(2)R has been associated negatively with body weight (BW) gain in male mice. However, the gender differences in AT(2)R and BW changes have not been studied. To understand the gender based role of AT(2)R involving BW changes, we fed male and female wild type (WT) and AT(2)R knock out (AT(2)KO) mice with C57BL6 background with high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. The male AT(2)KO had higher HFD calorie intake (WT: 1280±80; AT(2)KO:1680±80 kcal) but gained less BW compared with the WT (WT: 13; AT(2)KO: 6 g). Contrary to the male animals, the female AT(2)KO mice with equivalent caloric intake (WT: 1424±48; AT(2)KO:1456±80 kcal) gained significantly more BW than the WT mice (WT: 9 g; AT(2)KO: 15 g). The male AT(2)KO on HFD displayed lower plasma insulin level, less impaired glucose tolerance (GT), and higher plasma T3 compared with WT males on HFD; whereas the female AT(2)KO mice on HFD showed elevated levels of plasma insulin, more impaired GT, lower plasma T3 and higher free fatty acid and hepatic triglycerides compared with WT females on HFD. Interestingly, compared with WT, AT(2)KO female mice had significantly lower estrogen, which was further reduced by HFD. These results suggest that AT(2)R in female mice via potentially regulating estrogen may have protective role against BW gain and impaired glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2082639360,"Muscle side population (SP) cells are rare multipotent stem cells that can participate in myogenesis and muscle regeneration upon transplantation. While they have been primarily studied for the development of cell-based therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, little is known regarding their non-muscle lineage choices or whether the dystrophic muscle environment affects their ability to repair muscle. Unfortunately, the study of muscle SP cells has been challenged by their low abundance and the absence of specific SP cell markers. To address these issues, we developed culture conditions for the propagation and spontaneous multi-lineage differentiation of muscle SP cells. Using this approach, we show that SP cells from wild type muscle robustly differentiate into satellite cells and form myotubes without requiring co-culture with myogenic cells. Furthermore, this myogenic activity is associated with SP cells negative for immune (CD45) and vascular (CD31) markers but positive for Pax7, Sca1, and the mesenchymal progenitor marker PDGFRα. Additionally, our studies revealed that SP cells isolated from dystrophic or cardiotoxin-injured muscle fail to undergo myogenesis. Instead, these SP cells rapidly expand giving rise to fibroblast and adipocyte progenitors (FAPs) and to their differentiated progeny, fibroblasts and adipocytes. Our findings indicate that muscle damage affects the lineage choices of muscle SP cells, promoting their differentiation along fibro-adipogenic lineages while inhibiting myogenesis. These results have implications for a possible role of muscle SP cells in fibrosis and fat deposition in muscular dystrophy. In addition, our studies provide a useful in vitro system to analyze SP cell biology in both normal and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2090592122,"Procedures for cryopreserving embryos vary considerably, each having its specific advantages and disadvantages in terms of technical feasibility, embryo survival yield, temperature permissibility and species- or strain-dependent applicability. Here we report a high osmolality vitrification (HOV) method that is advantageous in these respects. Cryopreservation by vitrification is generally very simple, but, unlike slow freezing, embryos should be kept at a supercooling temperature (below -130°C) to avoid cryodamage. We overcame this problem by using an HOV solution containing 42.5% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 17.3% (w/v) Ficoll and 1.0 M sucrose. This solution is more viscous than other cryopreservation solutions, but easy handling of embryos was assured by employing a less viscous equilibration solution before vitrification. Most (>80%) embryos cryopreserved in this solution survived at -80°C for at least 30 days. Normal mice were recovered even after intercontinental transportation in a conventional dry-ice package for 2-3 days, indicating that special containers such as dry shippers with liquid nitrogen vapor are unnecessary. The HOV solution could also be employed for long-term storage in liquid nitrogen, as with other conventional cryoprotectants. Finally, we confirmed that this new vitrification method could be applied successfully to embryos of all six strains of mice we have tested so far. Thus, our HOV method provides an efficient and reliable strategy for the routine cryopreservation of mouse embryos in animal facilities and biomedical laboratories, and for easy and cheap transportation."
https://openalex.org/W1978560084,"Clostridium thermocellum produces the prototypical cellulosome, a large multienzyme complex that efficiently hydrolyzes plant cell wall polysaccharides into fermentable sugars. This ability has garnered great interest in its potential application in biofuel production. The core non-catalytic scaffoldin subunit, CipA, bears nine type I cohesin modules that interact with the type I dockerin modules of secreted hydrolytic enzymes and promotes catalytic synergy. Because the large size and flexibility of the cellulosome preclude structural determination by traditional means, the structural basis of this synergy remains unclear. Small angle x-ray scattering has been successfully applied to the study of flexible proteins. Here, we used small angle x-ray scattering to determine the solution structure and to analyze the conformational flexibility of two overlapping N-terminal cellulosomal scaffoldin fragments comprising two type I cohesin modules and the cellulose-specific carbohydrate-binding module from CipA in complex with Cel8A cellulases. The pair distribution functions, ab initio envelopes, and rigid body models generated for these two complexes reveal extended structures. These two N-terminal cellulosomal fragments are highly dynamic and display no preference for extended or compact conformations. Overall, our work reveals structural and dynamic features of the N terminus of the CipA scaffoldin that may aid in cellulosome substrate recognition and binding."
https://openalex.org/W2099769238,"Nalbuphine, an agonist-antagonist kappa-opioid, produces brief analgesia followed by enhanced pain/hyperalgesia in male postsurgical patients. However, it produces profound analgesia without pain enhancement when co-administration with low dose naloxone. To examine the effect of nalbuphine or nalbuphine plus naloxone on activity in brain regions that may explain these differences, we employed pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) in a double blind cross-over study with 13 healthy male volunteers. In separate imaging sessions subjects were administered nalbuphine (5 mg/70 kg) preceded by either saline (Sal-Nalb) or naloxone 0.4 mg (Nalox-Nalb). Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation maps followed by contrast and connectivity analyses revealed marked differences. Sal-Nalb produced significantly increased activity in 60 brain regions and decreased activity in 9; in contrast, Nalox-Nalb activated only 14 regions and deactivated only 3. Nalbuphine, like morphine in a previous study, attenuated activity in the inferior orbital cortex, and, like noxious stimulation, increased activity in temporal cortex, insula, pulvinar, caudate, and pons. Co-administration/pretreatment of naloxone selectively blocked activity in pulvinar, pons and posterior insula. Nalbuphine induced functional connectivity between caudate and regions in the frontal, occipital, temporal, insular, middle cingulate cortices, and putamen; naloxone co-admistration reduced all connectivity to non-significant levels, and, like phMRI measures of morphine, increased activation in other areas (e.g., putamen). Naloxone pretreatment to nalbuphine produced changes in brain activity possess characteristics of both analgesia and algesia; naloxone selectively blocks activity in areas associated with algesia. Given these findings, we suggest that nalbuphine interacts with a pain salience system, which can modulate perceived pain intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2129688534,"Current inhibitors of angiogenesis comprise either therapeutic antibodies (e.g. bevacicumab binding to VEGF-A) or small molecular inhibitors of receptor tyrosin kinases like e.g. sunitinib, which inhibits PDGFR and VEGFR. We have recently identified cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) as novel alternative and pharmacologically accessible target in the context of angiogenesis. In the present work we demonstrate that trisubstituted pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidines constitute a novel class of compounds which potently inhibit angiogenesis. All seven tested compounds inhibited endothelial cell proliferation with IC50 values between 1 and 18 µM. Interestingly, this seems not to be due to cytotoxicity, since none of them showed acute cytotoxic effects on endothelial cells at a concentration of 10 µM,. The three most potent compounds (LGR1404, LGR1406 and LGR1407) also inhibited cell migration (by 27, 51 and 31%, resp.), chemotaxis (by 50, 70 and 60% in accumulative distance, resp.), and tube formation (by 25, 60 and 30% of total tube length, resp.) at the non-toxic concentration of 10 µM. Furthermore, angiogenesis was reduced in vivo in the CAM assay by these three compounds. A kinase selectivity profiling revealed that the compounds prevalently inhibit Cdk2, Cdk5 and Cdk9. The phenotype of the migrating cells (reduced formation of lamellipodia, loss of Rac-1 translocation to the membrane) resembles the previously described effects of silencing of Cdk5 in endothelial cells. We conclude that especially LGR1406 and LGR1407 are highly attractive anti-angiogenic compounds, whose effects seem to largely depend on their Cdk5 inhibiting properties."

We performed log-binomial regression to identify patient and referral characteristics associated with poor referral outcomes.Among 593 TB patients, 23% failed linkage to TB treatment and 30.3% of the 77.0% who linked to care arrived late. Among 486 (86.9%) HIV-infected TB patients, 38.3% failed linkage to HIV care, and 32% of the 61.7% who linked to care presented late. One in six HIV-infected patients failed linkage to both TB and HIV care. Only 20.2% of HIV-infected patients were referred to a single clinic for integrated care. A referral letter was present in 90.3%, but only 23.7% included HIV status and 18.8% CD4 cell count. Lack of education (RR 1.85) and low CD4 count (CD4≤50 vs. >250cells/mm(3); RR 1.66) were associated with failed linkage to TB care. Risk factors for failed linkage to HIV care were antiretroviral-naïve status (RR 1.29), and absence of referral letter with HIV or CD4 cell count (RR1.23).Linkage to TB/HIV care should be strengthened by communication of HIV and CD4 results, ART initiation during hospitalization and TB/HIV integration at primary care."
https://openalex.org/W2135365388,"Glycans are essential regulators of protein function and are now in the focus of research in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. There are numerous modes of regulating their biosynthesis, including epigenetic mechanisms implicated in the expression of glyco-genes. Since N-glycans located at the cell membrane define intercellular communication as well as a cellular response to a given environment, we developed a method to preferentially analyze this fraction of glycans. The method is based on incorporation of living cells into polyacrylamide gels, partial denaturation of membrane proteins with 3 M urea and subsequent release of N-glycans with PNGase F followed by HPLC analysis. Using this newly developed method, we revealed multiple effects of epigenetic inhibitors Trichostatin A, sodium butyrate and zebularine on the composition of N-glycans in human cells. The induced changes were found to be reversible after inhibitor removal. Given that many epigenetic inhibitors are currently explored as a therapeutic strategy in treatment of cancer, wherein surface glycans play an important role, the presented work contributes to our understanding of their efficiency in altering the N-glycan profile of cancer cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2069326314,"Membrane fusion for exocytosis is mediated by SNAREs, forming trans-ternary complexes to bridge vesicle and target membranes. There is an array of accessory proteins that directly interact with and regulate SNARE proteins. PRIP (phospholipase C-related but catalytically inactive protein) is likely one of these proteins; PRIP, consisting of multiple functional modules including pleckstrin homology and C2 domains, inhibited exocytosis, probably via the binding to membrane phosphoinositides through the pleckstrin homology domain. However, the roles of the C2 domain have not yet been investigated. In this study, we found that the C2 domain of PRIP directly interacts with syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 but not with VAMP2. The C2 domain promoted PRIP to co-localize with syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 in PC12 cells. The binding profile of the C2 domain to SNAP-25 was comparable with that of synaptotagmin I, and PRIP inhibited synaptotagmin I in binding to SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1. It was also shown that the C2 domain was required for PRIP to suppress SDS-resistant ternary SNARE complex formation and inhibit high K+-induced noradrenalin release from PC12 cells. These results suggest that PRIP inhibits regulated exocytosis through the interaction of its C2 domain with syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25, potentially competing with other SNARE-binding, C2 domain-containing accessory proteins such as synaptotagmin I and by directly inhibiting trans-SNARE complex formation.

Therefore, female KO mice exhibited impaired reproduction, probably attributed to the hypersecretion of gonadotropins. 6M. Matsuda, M. Kotani, and M. Hirata, manuscript in preparation. We subsequently investigated the molecular mechanism by which PRIP inhibited dense core vesicle exocytosis. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is required for vesicle exocytosis (20Hay J.C. Martin T.F.

Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and we found that PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding to its PH domain was required for PRIP to suppress exocytosis. By binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2, PRIP localizes to sites of exocytosis and competes with other molecules such as CAPS (Ca2+-activated protein for secretion) for PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding required for exocytosis. 7H. Takeuchi, J. Gao, Z. Zhang, D. James, T. Martin, and M. Hirata, manuscript in preparation. In the course of these experiments, however, we noticed that other mechanisms besides PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding of the PH domain are also needed for PRIP to exert full inhibition. In this study, we investigate the role of the PRIP-C2 domain in the inhibition of exocytosis in light of the many reports that a variety of proteins with C2 domains participate in exocytosis (23Walter A.M.

How does synaptotagmin trigger neurotransmitter release?.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 615-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We found that the PRIP-C2 domain showed little interaction with phospholipids but interacted with t-SNARE proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The C2 domain was required for the co-localization of PRIP with t-SNAREs in cells. Moreover, the C2 domain also had direct inhibitory effects on ternary SNARE complex formation and on the participation of synaptotagmin. Thus, we propose that PRIP is a new member of C2 domain-containing proteins that regulate membrane traffic by its negative regulation of exocytosis through a combination of PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding by its PH domain7 and t-SNARE binding by its C2 domain. [3H]Noradrenalin (NA) was obtained from GE Healthcare. The Duolink in situ kit for proximity ligation assay (PLA) was from Olink Bioscience (Uppsala, Sweden). The antibodies used were as follows: SNAP-25 (Sigma-Aldrich), VAMP2 (Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), Munc18 (BD Transduction Laboratories), and syntaxin 1, synaptotagmin I, GFP and GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit antibody was from Invitrogen. Cy3 anti-mouse antibody, normal rabbit and mouse globulins were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Anti-PRIP-1 mouse monoclonal antibody (2F9) and antigen-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody were prepared in this laboratory as described previously (11Kanematsu T. Jang I.S. Yamaguchi T. Nagahama H.

Both the 5′- and 3′-end regions corresponding to outside the C2 domain of PRIP-1 were amplified by PCR, and the HindIII/SalI fragment of the 5′-end region was first subcloned into HindIII/SalI-digested vector, pEGFP-C3 (Clontech), followed by subcloning the XhoI/SalI fragment of 3′-end region into SalI site of the plasmid prepared as above. The resulting construct was used to express PRIP-1 lacking the residues 714–850 (PRIPΔC2). PRIP, whose Arg at position 134 was replaced with Gln to produce the mutants of R134Q and R134Q/ΔC2 for diminishing PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding, was prepared from the templates, EGFP-PRIP-WT and EGFP-PRIPΔC2, respectively, using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (26Gao J.

The membranes were air-dried overnight at 4 °C and then were immersed in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20, and 3% bovine serum albumin) to reduce background, followed by an incubation with purified GST or GST-fused PRIP-C2, PLCδ-PH, or Syt (synaptotagmin)-C2A at 10 μg/ml in blocking buffer containing free Ca2+ of 10 μm. After extensive washing with the buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20, and 10 μm CaCl2), the membranes were immunoblotted for bound GST-C2 or PH proteins using anti-GST antibody. Preparation of t-SNARE-incorporated liposomes and the floatation assays were performed as described previously (28James D.J. Kowalchyk J. Daily N. Petrie M. Martin T.F.

All of the phospholipids used in this study were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The cerebrum of wild type or PRIP-KO mouse was homogenized in the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 1.7 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μm 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with antibody of interest or control immunoglobulin at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with protein G beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Then the beads were washed with the lysis buffer four times, and the proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Merck-Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking, the membrane was blotted with the appropriate antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare), and detected for chemiluminescent signals using an LAS-3000 mini gel documentation system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Digital images were analyzed with Image Gauge software (Fujifilm) or National Institutes of Health Image J software to measure the density of each band. The handling of mice and all of the procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Kyushu University, which follows the guidelines of the Japanese Council on Animal Care. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were maintained and used to establish stable cell lines expressing wild type or several mutants of PRIP as described previously (29Gao J. Takeuchi H. Zhang Z. Fukuda M. Hirata M. Phospholipase C-related but catalytically inactive protein (PRIP) modulates synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) phosphorylation and exocytosis.J. Biol.

The cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate and subjected to immunofluorescent observation as described elsewhere (30Gao J. Takeuchi H. Umebayashi H. Zhang Z. Matsuda M. Hirata M. Assay of dense-core vesicle exocytosis using permeabilized PC12 cells.Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2010; 50: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 24 h after transfection, the cells were plated onto glass coverslips as described above. In situ PLA was performed using a Duolink in situ kit following to the manufacturer's protocol, but the cells were prepared, permeabilized, and blocked in the same manner as for immunofluorescent studies. Briefly, two molecules present in permeabilized cells were recognized by respective primary antibody raised in mouse or rabbit, respectively, and secondary antibody to mouse or rabbit Ig conjugated with an unique short DNA strand was then added, followed by ligation of these secondary antibodies and amplification of the ligates. When two molecules are close within 40 nm, successful ligation and amplification are performed for further analysis. The confocal images were obtained using LSM510 META (Carl Zeiss) and analyzed using Duolink Image Tool (Olink Bioscience) to obtain objective quantification of PLA signals. PC12 cell lysate was prepared by homogenizing in the lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. Cell lysate or recombinant SNARE proteins whose GST tags had been removed by thrombin digestion were mixed with GST alone or GST-fused C2 domain at an equal molar ratio in the binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Then glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with appropriate buffer was added to the mixture and incubated at 4 °C for another 1 h. At the end of the incubation, the beads were washed with the same buffer four times, boiled in a sample buffer for 5 min, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Similar experiments in a reverse mode using GST-fused SNARE protein and His-tagged PRIP protein were performed in the same condition as described above. The internal standard sample with known protein concentration was included in each blot and used to calculate the amount of protein of interest by fitting to the standard curve. To examine the effect of Ca2+ on the binding of the C2 domains to syntaxin 1 (Stx) or SNAP-25, the pulldown assay was performed in the same binding buffer as above for that in the presence of the calculated amount of Ca2+ to give the free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm or the buffer containing 1 mm EGTA. The mixture of 10 pmol (equivalent to 0.2 μm) each of the purified GST-SNAP-25, StxΔC-His, and His-VAMP2ΔC were incubated overnight in 48 μl of the binding buffer. At the end of incubation, the mixture was either boiled or incubated in 37 °C for 5 min in a SDS sample buffer and immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies indicated in the figures. Additional proteins were included in the mixture of SNAREs during the incubation period. To test the effect of Ca2+ on the SNARE complex formation, the mixture was incubated in the binding buffer containing calculated amounts of CaCl2 to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm with 1 mm EGTA.

In particular, during the process of protein disaggregation, single polypeptide chains are translocated through the central pore of the hexameric Hsp104/ClpB ring, which is believed to be the active unit (5.Weibezahn J.

It has been shown that low concentrations of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) inhibit the activity of Hsp104, causing two effects in vivo: (a) impaired thermotolerance and (b) so-called “prion curing,” the loss of prion-related yeast phenotypes (16.Tuite M.F.

Richter K. Imhof A. Buchner J. Walter S. The prion curing agent guanidinium chloride specifically inhibits ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104.J. Biol.

A conserved aspartate (Asp-184 in Hsp104 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has been proposed to be essential for the Hsp104-related yeast prion propagation and the inhibition of Hsp104 by GdmCl (19.Jung G. Jones G. Masison D.C. Amino acid residue 184 of yeast Hsp104 chaperone is critical for prion-curing by guanidine, prion propagation, and thermotolerance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Here, we present a detailed mechanistic study elucidating the role of the prion curing agent GdmCl in Hsp100 chaperone inhibition using the Hsp104 homolog ClpB from Thermus thermophilus, which is the only Hsp100 chaperone with high resolution structural data available. The three-dimensional structure of the ClpB monomer from T. thermophilus is shown in Fig. 1 (21.Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.-H. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. The structure of ClpB: a molecular chaperone that rescues proteins from an aggregated state.Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). It possesses two nucleotide binding domains, NBD1 and NBD2, bearing the characteristic Walker A and B motifs essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis. In between them, a long coiled coil domain is inserted. This so-called M domain is essential for the disaggregation activity (22.Watanabe Y.H. Nakazaki Y. Suno R. Yoshida M.

Acta. 2012; 1823: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain, which is involved in substrate binding, however, is not essential (24.Beinker P. Schlee S. Groemping Y. Seidel R. Reinstein J. The N terminus of ClpB from Thermus thermophilus is not essential for the chaperone activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47160-47166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Like other AAA+ proteins, Hsp100 chaperones form hexameric ringlike structures, which were studied extensively by cryo-EM (25.Lee S. Choi J.-M. Tsai F.T.

Cryo electron microscopy structures of Hsp100 proteins: crowbars in or out?.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 88: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous studies utilized shorter ClpB constructs bearing just one of the two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) each, allowing a more detailed mechanistic characterization (27.Beinker P. Schlee S. Auvula R. Reinstein J. Biochemical coupling of the two nucleotide binding domains of ClpB: covalent linkage is not a prerequisite for chaperone activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37965-37973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The construct NBD1-M(141–519), carrying the first NBD, was inactive in isolation, whereas NBD2(520–854), carrying the second NBD, could bind and hydrolyze ATP on its own. Both constructs mixed in solution were shown to reassemble into a functional oligomer with chaperone activity (28.Werbeck N.D. Zeymer C. Kellner J.N. Reinstein J. Coupling of oligomerization and nucleotide binding in the AAA+ chaperone ClpB.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the slightly longer construct NBD1-M(141–534) is nucleotide binding-competent and active in ATP hydrolysis, demonstrating that NBD1 also is a fully functional ATPase in isolation once the 15 additional C-terminal amino acids that complete the helical small domain are present. With this new construct in hand, we show that only NBD1, but not NBD2, is affected by GdmCl. Based on both structural and kinetic data, we derive a molecular mechanism of the inhibition of Hsp100 chaperones by the prion curing agent GdmCl. Construct design for ClpB, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE from T. thermophilus as well as the ClpB variants NBD1-M(141–519) and NBD2(520–854) was described previously (27.Beinker P. Schlee S. Auvula R.

The ClpB construct NBD1-M(141–534) was generated in the same manner by PCR using the pRS-ClpB plasmid, coding for full-length ClpB, as the template. The PCR product was purified and subcloned into an NdeI/EcoRI-digested pET28a vector that is used for proteins with an N-terminal, cleavable His tag. The mutation E209A was introduced by QuikChange PCR according to the QuikChange protocol (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Sequences were verified by DNA sequencing performed by Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). All proteins were expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) RIL.

The protein NBD1-M(141–534) was stored in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EDTA). Crystals of ClpB NBD1-M(141–534) were grown in a hanging drop vapor diffusion setup at 20 °C. The protein solution (10 mg/ml in buffer A) was supplemented with 3 mm ADP and 10 mm GdmCl and mixed 1:1 with the reservoir solution, which contained 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 m LiCl, 18% PEG 6000, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm GdmCl. Needle-shaped crystals grew within 5 days. The cryoprotectant solution consisted of the reservoir solution supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol, 3 mm ADP, and 100 mm GdmCl. Crystals were passed quickly through the cryoprotectant solution and cryocooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the synchrotron beamline X10SA at the Swiss Light Source (Villingen, Switzerland) with the crystals kept at 100 K. The program XDS was used for data processing (32.Kabsch W. Automatic processing of rotation diffraction data from crystals of initially unknown symmetry and cell constants.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). Phasing was done by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (33.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl.

Further model building and refinement were done in iterative cycles using the programs Coot (34.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Structure illustrations were prepared with PyMOL (38.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2010Google Scholar). Transient kinetics experiments were performed with a BioLogic SFM-400 stopped flow instrument in single mixing configuration at 25 °C (BioLogic Science Instruments, Claix, France). The fluorescently labeled nucleotides MANT-ADP and MANT-dADP were purchased from BIOLOG (Bremen, Germany). The excitation wavelength was set to 296 nm, and the fluorescence signal was observed using a 400 nm long pass filter (400FG03-25, LOT Oriel Group). This setup allows a selective excitation of protein-bound MANT-nucleotides via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the initially excited tryptophan residues of the protein. Measurements were performed in buffer A. For measurements in the presence of GdmCl, 10 mm GdmCl was added to buffer A. Kinetic traces were recorded as triplicates and averaged. Data analysis was performed using the program GraphPad Prism 5.0. Kinetic traces from direct binding experiments (2 μm ClpB NBD1-M(141–534) mixed with 10–50 μm MANT-nucleotide) were fitted to exponential functions. The extracted rate constants were plotted against the nucleotide concentration, leading to a linear function. The on-rates for MANT-nucleotide binding were obtained from the slope of this linear function. Kinetic traces from dissociation experiments (2 μm ClpB NBD1-M(141–534) incubated with 20 μm MANT-nucleotide and subsequently chased with 10 mm ADP) were fitted to exponential functions. The extracted rate constant corresponds to the off-rate of MANT-nucleotide binding. The KD was calculated from the ratio of off- and on-rates. Dissociation experiments were also performed under high salt and varied pH conditions. The buffers contained 300 mm KCl (high salt) or 50 mm CHES, pH 9.5 (high pH) or sodium acetate, pH 5.5 (low pH), respectively. Fluorescence displacement titrations to determine KD(ADP) and KD(ATP) were performed at 25 °C in buffer A using a Jasco FP-8500 fluorescence spectrometer (Jasco Germany GmbH). The excitation wavelength was set to 296 nm. The MANT fluorescence signal was monitored at 441 nm. 2 μm ClpB NBD1-M(141–534) was incubated with 20 μm MANT-dADP and subsequently titrated with ADP or ATP. ATP titrations were performed in the presence of 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 0.01 mg/ml pyruvate kinase (Roche Applied Science) as an ATP-regenerating system. For measurements in the presence of GdmCl, 10 mm GdmCl was added to the buffer. The data were corrected for dilution effects and analyzed with a cubic equation for competing ligands using the initial concentrations of protein and MANT-dADP as well as the KD(MANT-dADP) from the stopped flow experiments as input values to determine KD(ADP) and KD(ATP) (39.Thrall S.H.

The program GraFit 5.0 was used for data fitting. To assess nucleotide binding affinities at higher protein concentration, 20 μm NBD1-M(141–534) was incubated with 40 or 50 μm MANT-dADP and titrated with ADP or ATP, respectively. In this case, the reference KD(MANT-dADP) for the data analysis was determined in a separate titration against MANT-dADP. Steady state ATPase activity was measured in a coupled colorimetric assay at 25 °C using a Jasco V-650 spectrophotometer (Jasco Germany GmbH). ClpB NBD1-M(141–534) was incubated at 25 °C in assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithioerythritol, 0.4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.4 mm NADH, 0.1 g/liter BSA, 4 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 6 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 7 mm MgCl2). Different protein concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 μm were used. The reaction was started by adding ATP (0.1–5 mm). The decreasing absorption at 340 nm was monitored over time, and the maximal slope was used to determine the ATPase turnover rate per molecule. The data were analyzed with the Hill equation (Equation 1) using the program GraphPad Prism 5.0. k=kcat·[ATP]nKmn+[ATP]n(Eq. 1) Experiments to characterize the influence of GdmCl on the steady state ATPase activity were performed in the same manner using 20 μm ClpB NBD1-M(141–534), 10 μm NBD2(520–854), or 10 μm ClpB full-length. The assay buffer was supplemented with 0–15 mm GdmCl. 2 mm ATP or dATP was used to start the reaction. The ATPase rates were calculated as before from the slope of the decreasing A340 signal. Control experiments were performed to verify that the coupled reactions catalyzed by pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase are not rate-limiting in the presence of GdmCl and/or deoxynucleotides. ATPase activity assays were also performed under high salt and varied pH conditions. The buffers contained 300 mm KCl (high salt) or 50 mm CHES, pH 9.5 (high pH) or sodium acetate, pH 5.5 (low pH), respectively. Gel filtration experiments were performed on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column connected to a refractive index detector (2414 from Waters, Milford, MA), a photodiode array detector (2996 from Waters), and a multiangle light scattering (MALS) detector (Dawn Heleos, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) in buffer A. The buffer was either nucleotide-free or supplemented with 2 mm ADP or 2 mm ATP. In the case of ATP, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 0.01 mg/ml pyruvate kinase (Roche Applied Science) were present as an ATP-regenerating system. The experiments were performed both in the absence or presence of 10 mm GdmCl. 40 μl of 100 μm NBD1-M(141–534) were injected, resulting in a final concentration of about 2 μm at the detector due to a 1:50 dilution during the experiment. Molecular weight values were extracted from the MALS data using the ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology). DLS experiments were performed at 10–50 μm protein concentration in buffer A that was either nucleotide-free or supplemented with 2 mm ADP or 2 mm ATP, respectively. In the case of ATP, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 0.01 mg/ml pyruvate kinase (Roche Applied Science) were present as an ATP-regenerating system. The measurements were performed with a Viscotek 802DAT DLS instrument (Viscotek, Waghäusel, Germany). 40 scans with a measuring time of 5 s per scan were recorded. The OmniSIZE 3.0 software package was used for data analysis. The assay was used to characterize the influence of GdmCl on the chaperone activity of ClpB. 0.2 μm α-glucosidase from Bacillus stearothermophilus was denatured for 8 min at 75 °C in reaction buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 0–12 mm GdmCl. Chaperones were added prior to refolding at 55 °C. The total chaperone concentrations were [ClpB] = 1.0 μm, [DnaK] = 1.6 μm, [DnaJ] = 0.5 μm, and [GrpE] = 0.2 μm. Samples were taken after 30, 60, and 120 min, and the α-glucosidase activity was measured at 40 °C using a microplate spectrophotometer (Varioskan, Thermo Electron, Vantaa, Finland). The samples were diluted into assay buffer containing 50 mm KPi, pH 6.8, 2 mm para-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 15 mm GdmCl. The measurement was performed in transparent 96-well plates (3641 from Corning). The average rate of absorption increase at 405 nm was monitored and normalized against a positive control containing α-glucosidase that was not heat-aggregated. Samples supplemented with either only ClpB or only DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE were used as negative controls. Protein unfolding experiments with GdmCl were performed as a control to show that the low concentrations of GdmCl used in the activity assays and nucleotide binding measurements did not influence the stability of ClpB NBD1-M(141–534). 5 μm ClpB NBD1-M(141–534) was incubated with various concentrations of GdmCl (0–6 m) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EDTA. Circular dichroism spectra were measured with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Germany GmbH) using quartz cuvettes of 0.1-cm path length. Five spectra were averaged. The measured ellipticity at 222 nm was used to generate the denaturation curve, which was fitted using the equation for a two-state transition"
https://openalex.org/W2046341493,"MicroRNAs are involved in phenotypic switching of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Brg1-containing SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes also play an important role in controlling the phenotype of SMCs. We thus determined whether Brg1 influences the transcription of microRNAs in SMCs. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of smooth muscle from mice harboring smooth muscle-specific deletion of Brg1 revealed altered expression of several microRNAs, including miRs-143/145 and miR-133. Ablation of Brg1 in SMCs in vitro either by expression of dominant negative Brg1 or Brg1 knock-out attenuated miRs-143/145 expression. Knockdown of serum response factor (SRF) in SMCs significantly reduced the expression levels of miRs-143/145 and miR-133, whereas knockdown of myocardin only attenuated miRs-143/145 expression. Myocardin induced expression of miRs-143/145 and miR-133a and increased SRF binding to these genes in 10T1/2 cells. This myocardin-mediated induction was attenuated by dominant negative Brg1. In Brg1-null SW13 cells, miRs-143/145 were dramatically induced by myocardin only in the presence of Brg1, whereas miR-133 was not induced by myocardin in a Brg1-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that in the presence of Brg1, myocardin increased SRF binding to both the miRs-143/145 and miR-133a loci. Together, these data suggest a mechanism in which Brg1-containing SWI/SNF complexes are required for myocardin to induce expression of miRs-143/145 in smooth muscle cells. In contrast, miR-133 expression appears to be regulated by Brg1-containing chromatin remodeling complexes in a partially SRF-dependent, although largely myocardin-independent manner. SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling thus regulates the phenotype of smooth muscle by affecting expression of protein-coding genes and microRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2056419281,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form a kinase tier module in which MAPK, MAP2K, and MAP3K are held by scaffold proteins. The scaffold proteins serve as a protein platform for selective and spatial kinase activation. The precise mechanism by which the scaffold proteins function has not yet been fully explained. WDR62 is a novel scaffold protein of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Recessive mutations within WDR62 result in severe cerebral cortical malformations. One of the WDR62 mutant proteins found in a patient with microcephaly encodes a C-terminal truncated protein that fails to associate efficiently with JNK and MKK7β1. The present article shows that the WDR62 C-terminal region harbors a novel dimerization domain composed of a putative loop-helix domain that is necessary and sufficient for WDR62 dimerization and is critical for its scaffolding function. The loop-helix domain is highly conserved between orthologues and is also shared by the JNK scaffold protein, JNKBP1/MAPKBP1. Based on the high sequence conservation of the loop-helix domain, our article shows that MAPKBP1 homodimerizes and heterodimerizes with WDR62. Endogenous WDR62 and MAPKBP1 co-localize to stress granules following arsenite treatment, but not during mitosis. This study proposes another layer of complexity, in which coordinated activation of signaling pathways is mediated by the association between the different JNK scaffold proteins depending on their biological function."

We evaluated implementation of NPIs during fall 2009 in response to H1N1 pandemic influenza (pH1N1) by New York City (NYC) public schools.From January 25 through February 9, 2010, an online survey was sent to all the 1,632 NYC public schools and principals were asked to participate in the survey or to designate a school nurse or other school official with knowledge of school policies and characteristics to do so.Of 1,633 schools, 376(23%) accessed and completed the survey. Nearly all respondents (99%) implemented at least two NPIs. Schools that had a Flu Response Team (FRT) as a part of school emergency preparedness plan were more likely to implement the NPI guidelines recommended by NYC public health officials than schools that did not have a FRT. Designation of a room for isolating ill students, for example, was more common in schools with a FRT (72%) than those without (53%) (p<0.001).Implementing an NPI program in a large school system to mitigate the effects of an influenza outbreak is feasible, but there is potential need for additional resources in some schools to increase capacity and adherence to all recommendations. Public health influenza-preparedness plans should include school preparedness planning and FRTs."
https://openalex.org/W2086522105,"The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is the major substrate for the polysialyltransferases (polySTs), ST8SiaII/STX and ST8SiaIV/PST. The polysialylation of NCAM N-glycans decreases cell adhesion and alters signaling. Previous work demonstrated that the first fibronectin type III repeat (FN1) of NCAM is required for polyST recognition and the polysialylation of the N-glycans on the adjacent Ig5 domain. In this work, we highlight the importance of an FN1 acidic patch in polyST recognition and also reveal that the polySTs are required to interact with sequences in the Ig5 domain for polysialylation to occur. We find that features of the Ig5 domain of the olfactory cell adhesion molecule (OCAM) are responsible for its lack of polysialylation. Specifically, two basic OCAM Ig5 residues (Lys and Arg) found near asparagines equivalent to those carrying the polysialylated N-glycans in NCAM substantially decrease or eliminate polysialylation when used to replace the smaller and more neutral residues (Ser and Asn) in analogous positions in NCAM Ig5. This decrease in polysialylation does not reflect altered glycosylation but instead is correlated with a decrease in polyST-NCAM binding. In addition, inserting non-conserved OCAM sequences into NCAM Ig5, including an “extra” N-glycosylation site, decreases or completely blocks NCAM polysialylation.

Significance: A two-domain polysialyltransferase recognition site may be required for all polysialylated proteins. Proteins that co-translationally enter the endoplasmic reticulum and progress through the secretory pathway often become glycosylated on N- or O-glycans.

They were the first to demonstrate that polySia binds neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, and growth factors, and their work suggests that the presence of polySia can modulate signaling by these molecules. In addition, these investigators showed that a single point mutation in the polysialyltransferase ST8SiaII/STX in schizophrenic patients leads to a decrease in enzyme activity and the polymerization of shorter polySia chains on NCAM (15.Isomura R.

There are three main isoforms of NCAM, which arise from alternative splicing of a single gene. NCAM-140 and NCAM-180 are type I transmembrane proteins that differ in the length of their cytosolic tail, whereas NCAM-120 is linked to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (33.Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J.

The three isoforms share a common extracellular structure consisting of five immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and two fibronectin type III repeats (FN1 and FN2).

The olfactory cell adhesion molecule, OCAM, is mainly expressed in neural tissue such as the brain, olfactory epithelium, and the retina (36.Paoloni-Giacobino A. Chen H. Antonarakis S.E.

A new member of the neural cell adhesion molecule family related to zone-to-zone projection of olfactory and vomeronasal axons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5830-5842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like NCAM, OCAM has been shown to form homophilic trans interactions (37.Yoshihara Y. Kawasaki M. Tamada A. Fujita H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. OCAM. A new member of the neural cell adhesion molecule family related to zone-to-zone projection of olfactory and vomeronasal axons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5830-5842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse knock-out studies have suggested a role for OCAM in intraglomerular compartmental organization (38.Walz A. Mombaerts P. Greer C.A. Treloar H.B. Disrupted compartmental organization of axons and dendrites within olfactory glomeruli of mice deficient in the olfactory cell adhesion molecule, OCAM.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 32: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that OCAM is highly expressed in androgen-dependent prostrate cancer cell lines and estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell lines, whereas it is expressed only at low levels in normal prostrate cell lines (39.Takahashi S. Kato K. Nakamura K. Nakano R. Kubota K. Hamada H. Neural cell adhesion molecule 2 as a target molecule for prostate and breast cancer gene therapy.Cancer Sci. 2011; 102: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of OCAM, a transmembrane and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored form, and they both share the same extracellular domain as NCAM, with five Ig domains and two fibronectin type III repeats (37.Yoshihara Y. Kawasaki M. Tamada A. Fujita H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. OCAM.

Interestingly, OCAM Ig5 has consensus N-glycosylation sites at the same positions as ASN5 and ASN6 of NCAM (ASN6 and ASN7 in OCAM). Although the expression pattern of OCAM can overlap with that of NCAM, OCAM is not polysialylated (37.Yoshihara Y. Kawasaki M. Tamada A. Fujita H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. OCAM. A new member of the neural cell adhesion molecule family related to zone-to-zone projection of olfactory and vomeronasal axons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5830-5842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we generated a chimeric protein in which the FN1 domain of NCAM was replaced with that of OCAM (35.Foley D.A. Swartzentruber K.G. Thompson M.G. Mendiratta S.S. Colley K.J. Sequences from the first fibronectin type III repeat of the neural cell adhesion molecule allow O-glycan polysialylation of an adhesion molecule chimera.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35056-35067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We anticipated that this chimera would not be polysialylated and that we would be able to reconstitute polysialylation by inserting specific NCAM FN1 residues. Surprisingly, ST8SiaIV/PST could polysialylate the NCAM-OCAM chimera, indicating that OCAM FN1 is recognized by the polySTs, enabling them to polysialylate glycans located on NCAM Ig5. The polysialylation of the chimera was not as efficient as NCAM polysialylation, suggesting that although ST8SiaIV/PST can engage OCAM FN1, recognition/binding is not optimal (35.Foley D.A. Swartzentruber K.G. Thompson M.G. Mendiratta S.S. Colley K.J. Sequences from the first fibronectin type III repeat of the neural cell adhesion molecule allow O-glycan polysialylation of an adhesion molecule chimera.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35056-35067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These results suggested that other factors either within FN1 itself or adjacent domains of NCAM could have a role in stabilizing polyST recognition and binding. In this study, we performed domain swap experiments and compared the sequences and structures of NCAM and OCAM Ig5 domains to evaluate the factors preventing OCAM polysialylation and, conversely, the requirements for NCAM polysialylation. We found that replacing the OCAM Ig5 domain with NCAM Ig5 allows polysialylation of an OCAM-NCAM chimera, suggesting that aspects of OCAM Ig5 were preventing its polysialylation. To this end, we found that an “extra” N-glycan located within OCAM Ig5 did prevent the polysialylation of NCAM when present, but it is not the only factor preventing OCAM polysialylation. We also found that two large basic residues located near OCAM ASN6 and ASN7, which are replaced by smaller more neutral residues in NCAM Ig5, function to block polysialylation when inserted into NCAM Ig5. The presence of these large basic residues in NCAM does not alter the glycosylation pattern of Ig5 but instead serves to decrease polyST-substrate binding. These results suggest that the polySTs make contact with residues in both the FN1 and Ig5 domains in the process of Ig5 N-glycan polysialylation.

The full-length mouse OCAM sequence was PCR-amplified using PCR supermix and the following primers: 5′-AAGCTTGTCCTGAACATGAGCCTCCTCC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGATGCCTTTATGTCATCTTCTTTAGACTGG-3′. These primers specifically introduced a HindIII and XbaI site at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the amplified OCAM sequence, respectively. The OCAM PCR product and empty pcDNA3.1 V5/HisB expression vector were digested with HindIII and XbaI. After gel purification, the OCAM PCR product was ligated into the expression vector. A frameshift mutation, introduced during cloning near the XbaI site, was corrected by mutagenesis using the following primers: 5′-GATGACATAAAGGCAGGTCTAGAGGGCCCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGGCCCTCTAGACCTGCCTTTATGTCATC-3′. To generate the chimeric proteins, BamHI and XbaI restriction sites, flanking the Ig5, FN1, or Ig5-FN1 domains, were inserted into the full-length OCAM or NCAM cDNAs by site-directed mutagenesis, and the domains were subsequently removed by restriction enzyme digestion. The OCAM FN1 domain, NCAM Ig5 domain, NCAM FN1 domain, or NCAM Ig5-FN1 domain was PCR-amplified using the following primers that inserted BamHI and XbaI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNAs, respectively: 5′-GGATCCGATGTCCCCTCTAGTCCCCATG-3′/5′-TCTAGAGGCTCACGGACTGGCAGTGTC-3′, 5′-GGATCCTATGCCCCAAAGCTACAGGGC-3′/5′-TCTAGAGCTGCTTGAACAAGGATGAATTC-3′, 5′-GGATCCGACACCCCCTCTTCACCATCC-3′/5′-TCTAGAGCTTCCCCTTGGACTGGCTGCGTC-3′, and 5′-GGATCCTATGCCCCAAAGCTACAGGGC-3′/5′-TCTAGAGCTTCCCCTTGGACTGGCTGCGTC-3′. The PCR products were cut with BamHI and XbaI and ligated in frame into NCAM lacking FN1, OCAM lacking Ig5, OCAM lacking FN1, and OCAM lacking Ig5-FN1, to generate NCAM-OCAM FN1, OCAM-NCAM Ig5, OCAM-NCAM FN1, and OCAM-NCAM Ig5-FN1, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1988438683,"Factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) is a circulating protease involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, calcification, and fibrotic processes. To understand how FSAP controls the balance of local growth factors, we have investigated its effect on the regulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). BMP-2 is produced as a large pro-form and secreted as a mature heparin-binding growth factor after intracellular processing by pro-protein convertases (PCs). In this study, we discovered that FSAP enhances the biological activity of mature BMP-2 as well as its pro-form, as shown by osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. These findings were complemented by knockdown of FSAP in hepatocytes, which revealed BMP-2 processing by endogenous FSAP. N-terminal sequencing indicated that pro-BMP-2 was cleaved by FSAP at the canonical PC cleavage site, giving rise to mature BMP-2 (Arg(282)↓Gln(283)), as well as in the N-terminal heparin binding region of mature BMP-2, generating a truncated mature BMP-2 peptide (Arg(289)↓Lys(290)). Similarly, mature BMP-2 was also cleaved to a truncated peptide within its N-terminal region (Arg(289)↓Lys(290)). Plasmin exhibited a similar activity, but it was weaker compared with FSAP. Thrombin, Factor VIIa, Factor Xa, and activated protein C were not effective. These results were further supported by the observation that the mutation of the heparin binding region of BMP-2 inhibited the processing by FSAP but not by PC. Thus, the proteolysis and activation of pro-BMP-2 and mature BMP-2 by FSAP can regulate cell differentiation and calcification in vasculature and may explain why polymorphisms in the gene encoding for FSAP are related to vascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2028847481,"It has been argued that when an observer moves, a contingent retinal-image motion of a stimulus would strengthen the perceived glossiness. This would be attributed to the veridical perception of three-dimensional structure by motion parallax. However, it has not been investigated whether the effect of motion parallax is more than that of retinal-image motion of the stimulus. Using a magnitude estimation method, we examine in this paper whether cross-modal coordination of the stimulus change and the observer's motion (i.e., motion parallax) is essential or the retinal-image motion alone is sufficient for enhancing the perceived glossiness. Our data show that a retinal-image motion simulating motion parallax without head motion strengthened the perceived glossiness but that its effect was weaker than that of motion parallax with head motion. These results suggest the existence of an additional effect of the cross-modal coordination between vision and proprioception on glossiness perception. That is, motion parallax enhances the perception of glossiness, in addition to retinal-image motions of specular surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2172235443,"In vivo, collagen I, the major structural protein in human body, is found assembled into fibrils. In the present work, we study a high concentrated collagen sample in its soluble, fibrillar, and denatured states using one and two dimensional {(1)H}-(13)C solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We interpret (13)C chemical shift variations in terms of dihedral angle conformation changes. Our data show that fibrillogenesis increases the side chain and backbone structural complexity. Nevertheless, only three to five rotameric equilibria are found for each amino acid residue, indicating a relatively low structural heterogeneity of collagen upon fibrillogenesis. Using side chain statistical data, we calculate equilibrium constants for a great number of amino acid residues. Moreover, based on a (13)C quantitative spectrum, we estimate the percentage of residues implicated in each equilibrium. Our data indicate that fibril formation greatly affects hydroxyproline and proline prolyl pucker ring conformation. Finally, we discuss the implication of these structural data and propose a model in which the attractive force of fibrillogenesis comes from a structural reorganization of 10 to 15% of the amino acids. These results allow us to further understand the self-assembling process and fibrillar structure of collagen."
https://openalex.org/W2009747537,"Endoglin is a transmembrane auxiliary receptor for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) that is predominantly expressed on proliferating endothelial cells. It plays a wide range of physiological roles but its importance on energy balance or insulin sensitivity has been unexplored. Endoglin deficient mice die during midgestation due to cardiovascular defects. Here we report for first time that heterozygous endoglin deficiency in mice decreases high fat diet-induced hepatic triglyceride content and insulin levels. Importantly, these effects are independent of changes in body weight or adiposity. At molecular level, we failed to detect relevant changes in the insulin signalling pathway at basal levels in liver, muscle or adipose tissues that could explain the insulin-dependent effect. However, we found decreased triglyceride content in the liver of endoglin heterozygous mice fed a high fat diet in comparison to their wild type littermates. Overall, our findings indicate that endoglin is a potentially important physiological mediator of insulin levels and hepatic lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1972667724,"The biosynthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans is tightly regulated by multiple feedback mechanisms, which support robust developmental systems. One of the regulatory network systems controlling heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis is sulfation compensation. A previous study using Drosophila HS 2-O- and 6-O-sulfotransferase (Hs2st and Hs6st) mutants showed that loss of sulfation at one position is compensated by increased sulfation at other positions, supporting normal FGF signaling. Here, we show that HS sulfation compensation rescues both Decapentaplegic and Wingless signaling, suggesting a universal role of this regulatory system in multiple pathways in Drosophila. Furthermore, we identified Sulf1, extracellular HS 6-O-endosulfatase, as a novel component of HS sulfation compensation. Simultaneous loss of Hs2st and Sulf1 led to 6-O-oversulfation, leading to patterning defects, overgrowth, and lethality. These phenotypes are caused at least partly by abnormal up-regulation of Hedgehog signaling. Thus, sulfation compensation depends on the coordinated activities of Hs2st, Hs6st, and Sulf1."

Here, we wished to determine whether and how Gαo affects this channel. Using transfected HEK 293 cells and retinal tissue, we showed that Kir2.4 interacts with Gαo, and this interaction is stronger with the GDP-bound form of Gαo. Using two-electrode voltage clamp, we recorded from oocytes that were injected with Kir2.4 mRNA and a combination of G-protein subunit mRNAs. We found that the wild type and the inactive mutant of Gαo reduce the Kir2.4 basal current, whereas the active mutant has little effect. Other pertussis-sensitive Gα subunits also reduce this current, whereas Gαs increases it. Gβγ increases the current, whereas m-phosducin, which binds Gβγ without affecting the state of Gα, reduces it. We then tested the effect of G-protein subunits on the surface expression of the channel fused to cerulean by imaging the plasma membranes of the oocytes. We found that the surface expression is affected, with effects paralleling those seen with the basal current. This suggests that the observed effects on the current are mainly indirect and are due to surface expression. Similar results were obtained in transfected HEK cells.

https://openalex.org/W1971019484,"Objective Serotonin transporter gene polymorphism (5-HTTLPR polymorphism) predicts the degree of structural and functional connectivity in the brain, and less consistently the degree of vulnerability for anxiety and depressive disorders. It is less known how 5-HTTLPR polymorphism influences on the coupling between brain and neuronal cardiovascular control. The present study demonstrates the impact of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on the relations between heart rate (HR) corrected cardiac repolarization interval (QTc interval) and the brain 5-HTT binding. Material and Methods Thirty healthy young adults (fifteen monozygotic twin pairs) (mean age 26±1.3 years, 16 females) were imagined with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using iodine-123 labeled 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (nor-β-CIT). Continuous ECG recording was obtained from each participant at supine rest. Signal averaged QTc interval on continuous ECG was calculated and compared with the brain imaging results. Results In the two groups [l homozygotes (n = 16, 10 females), s carriers (n = 14, 8 female)] HR and the length of QTc interval were not influenced by 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. There were no significant relations between HR and 5-HTT binding in the brain. There were significant associations between QTc interval and nor-β-CIT binding in the brain in l homozygotes, but not in s carriers (correlations for QTc interval and nor-β-CIT binding of striatum, thalamus and right temporal region were −0.8–−0.9, (p<0.0005), respectively). Conclusion The finding of longer QTc interval with less 5-HTT binding availability in major serotonergic binding sites in l homozygotes, but not in s carriers, implicate to differentiated control of QTc interval by 5-HTTLPR polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2060414616,"Cognitive processes do not occur in isolation. Interactions between cognitive processes can be observed as a cost in performance following a switch between tasks, a cost that is greatest when the cognitive requirements of the sequential tasks compete. Interestingly, the long-term mnemonic goals associated with specific cognitive tasks can also directly compete. For example, encoding the sequential order in which stimuli are presented in the commonly-utilised 2-Back working memory (WM) tasks is counter-productive to task performance, as this task requires the continual updating of the contents of one's current mental set. Performance of this task consistently results in reduced activity within the medial temporal lobe (MTL), and this response is believed to reflect the inhibitory mnemonic component of the task. Conversely, there are numerous cognitive paradigms in which participants are explicitly instructed to encode incoming information and performance of these tasks reliably increases MTL activity. Here, we explore the behavioural cost of sequentially performing two tasks with conflicting long-term mnemonic goals and contrasting neural profiles within the MTL. We hypothesised that performing the 2-Back WM prior to a hippocampal-dependent memory task would impair performance on the latter task. We found that participants who performed the 2-Back WM task, prior to the encoding of novel verbal/face-name stimuli, recollected significantly fewer of these stimuli, compared to those who had performed a 0-Back control task. Memory processes believed to be independent of the MTL were unaffected. Our results suggest that the inhibition of MTL-dependent mnemonic function persists beyond the cessation of the 2-Back WM task and can alter performance on entirely separate and subsequently performed memory tasks. Furthermore, they indicate that performance of such tasks may induce a temporarily-sustained, virtual lesion of the hippocampus, which could be used as a probe to explore cognitive processes in the absence of hippocampal involvement."
https://openalex.org/W1991468893,"Background Analysis of ancient DNA has provided invaluable information on past ecologies, ancient populations, and extinct species. We used a short snippet of highly variable mitochondrial control region sequence from New Zealand’s moa to characterise a large number of bones previously intractable to DNA analysis as well as bone fragments from swamps to gain information about the haplotype diversity and phylogeography that existed in five moa species. Methodology/Principal Findings By targeting such ‘snippets’, we show that moa populations differed substantially in geographic structure that is likely to be related to population mobility and history. We show that populations of Pachyornis geranoides, Dinornis novaezealandiae, and Dinornis robustus were highly structured and some appear to have occupied the same geographic location for hundreds of thousands of years. In contrast, populations of the moa Anomalopteryx didiformis and Euryapteryx curtus were widespread, with specific populations of the latter occupying both the North and South Islands of New Zealand. We further show that for a specific area, in this case a North Island swamp, complete haplotype diversity and even sex can be recovered from collections of small, often discarded, bone fragments. Conclusions/Significance Short highly variable mitochondrial ‘snippets’ allow successful typing of environmentally damaged and fragmented skeletal material, and can provide useful information about ancient population diversity and structure without the need to sample valuable, whole bones often held by museums."

The defect in catalysis, due to the mutations, is specifically due to an effect on V(max) and not due to altered substrate affinity (or K(m)). We propose a general acid-base pair mechanism to explain our results."
