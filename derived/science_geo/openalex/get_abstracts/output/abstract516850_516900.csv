Most antibiotics were produced by screening soil microorganisms, but this limited resource of cultivable bacteria was overmined by the 1960s. Synthetic approaches to produce antibiotics have been unable to replace this platform. Uncultured bacteria make up approximately 99% of all species in external environments, and are an untapped source of new antibiotics. We developed several methods to grow uncultured organisms by cultivation in situ or by using specific growth factors. Here we report a new antibiotic that we term teixobactin, discovered in a screen of uncultured bacteria. Teixobactin inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to a highly conserved motif of lipid II (precursor of peptidoglycan) and lipid III (precursor of cell wall teichoic acid). We did not obtain any mutants of Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to teixobactin. The properties of this compound suggest a path towards developing antibiotics that are likely to avoid development of resistance."

Antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV-1 infection: despite drug treatment, most patients still have latent reservoirs of the virus. This study of immune cells isolated from 30 HIV-1-infected patients who had been on antiretroviral therapy for at least two years and had maintained undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, shows that these viral reservoirs are dominated by viruses with cytotoxic T lymphocyte escape mutations. This finding implies that future directions in therapeutic vaccine design may need to focus on boosting broad cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 persists in a stable latent reservoir1,2, primarily in resting memory CD4+ T cells3,4. This reservoir presents a major barrier to the cure of HIV-1 infection. To purge the reservoir, pharmacological reactivation of latent HIV-1 has been proposed5 and tested both in vitro and in vivo6,7,8. A key remaining question is whether virus-specific immune mechanisms, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), can clear infected cells in ART-treated patients after latency is reversed. Here we show that there is a striking all or none pattern for CTL escape mutations in HIV-1 Gag epitopes. Unless ART is started early, the vast majority (>98%) of latent viruses carry CTL escape mutations that render infected cells insensitive to CTLs directed at common epitopes. To solve this problem, we identified CTLs that could recognize epitopes from latent HIV-1 that were unmutated in every chronically infected patient tested. Upon stimulation, these CTLs eliminated target cells infected with autologous virus derived from the latent reservoir, both in vitro and in patient-derived humanized mice. The predominance of CTL-resistant viruses in the latent reservoir poses a major challenge to viral eradication. Our results demonstrate that chronically infected patients retain a broad-spectrum viral-specific CTL response and that appropriate boosting of this response may be required for the elimination of the latent reservoir."

Their optical variability is stochastic, can be due to a variety of physical mechanisms, and is well-described statistically in terms of a damped random walk model. The recent availability of large collections of astronomical time series of flux measurements (light curves) offers new data sets for a systematic exploration of quasar variability. Here we report on the detection of a strong, smooth periodic signal in the optical variability of the quasar PG 1302-102 with a mean observed period of 1,884 $\pm$ 88 days. It was identified in a search for periodic variability in a data set of light curves for 247,000 known, spectroscopically confirmed quasars with a temporal baseline of $\sim9$ years. While the interpretation of this phenomenon is still uncertain, the most plausible mechanisms involve a binary system of two supermassive black holes with a subparsec separation. Such systems are an expected consequence of galaxy mergers and can provide important constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1989548729,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) are ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine kinases involved in a plethora of functions ranging from the control of glycogen metabolism to transcriptional regulation. We recently demonstrated that GSK3 inhibition triggers JNK-cJUN-dependent apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells. However, the comprehensive picture of downstream GSK3-regulated pathways/functions remains elusive. Herein, counterbalancing the death signals, we show that GSK3 inhibition induces prosurvival signals through increased activity of the autophagy/lysosomal network. Our data also reveal a contribution of GSK3 in the regulation of the master transcriptional regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, transcription factor EB (TFEB) in pancreatic cancer cells. Similarly to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, GSK3 inhibitors promote TFEB nuclear localization and leads to TFEB dephosphorylation through endogenous serine/threonine phosphatase action. However, GSK3 and mTOR inhibition impinge differently and independently on TFEB phosphorylation suggesting that TFEB is regulated by a panel of kinases and/or phosphatases. Despite their differential impact on TFEB phosphorylation, both GSK3 and mTOR inhibitors promote 14-3-3 dissociation and TFEB nuclear localization. Quantitative mass spectrometry analyses further reveal an increased association of TFEB with nuclear proteins upon GSK3 and mTOR inhibition suggesting a positive impact on TFEB transcriptional function. Finally, a predominant nuclear localization of TFEB is unveiled in fully fed pancreatic cancer cells, whereas a reduction in TFEB expression significantly impairs their capacity for growth in an anchorage-independent manner. In addition, TFEB-restricted cells are more sensitive to apoptosis upon GSK3 inhibition. Altogether, our data uncover new functions under the control of GSK3 in pancreatic cancer cells in addition to providing key insight into TFEB regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2034123367,"Curcumin is a dietary anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive agent consisting of two methoxyphenol rings connected by a conjugated heptadienedione chain. Curcumin is unstable at physiological pH and rapidly degrades in an autoxidation reaction to a major bicyclopentadione product in which the 7-carbon chain has undergone oxygenation and double cyclization. Early degradation products (but not the final bicyclopentadione) mediate topoisomerase poisoning and possibly many other activities of curcumin, but it is not known how many and what autoxidation products are formed, nor their mechanism of formation. Here, using [14C2]curcumin as a tracer, seven novel autoxidation products, including two reaction intermediates, were isolated and identified using one- and two-dimensional NMR and mass spectrometry. The unusual spiroepoxide and vinylether reaction intermediates are precursors to the final bicyclopentadione product. A mechanism for the autoxidation of curcumin is proposed that accounts for the addition and exchange of oxygen that have been determined using 18O2 and H218O. Several of the by-products are formed from an endoperoxide intermediate via reactions that are well precedented in lipid peroxidation. The electrophilic spiroepoxide intermediate formed a stable adduct with N-acetylcysteine, suggesting that oxidative transformation is required for biological effects mediated by covalent adduction to protein thiols. The spontaneous autoxidation distinguishes curcumin among natural polyphenolic compounds of therapeutic interest; the formation of chemically diverse reactive and electrophilic products provides a novel paradigm for understanding the polypharmacological effects of curcumin.

The diphenol curcumin, extracted from the rhizomes of the turmeric plant, is used as a coloring agent and preservative in the spice mix curry. In addition to culinary uses, curcumin shows antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer bioactivities in vitro (1.Esatbeyoglu T. Huebbe P. Ernst I.M. Chin D. Wagner A.E. Rimbach G. Curcumin-from molecule to biological function.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2012; 51: 5308-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Curcumin is considered a “polypharmacological” agent because of the plethora of in vitro cellular effects, with review articles listing in excess of 100 distinct targets (2.Anand P. Sundaram C. Jhurani S. Kunnumakkara A.B. Aggarwal B.B. Curcumin and cancer: an “old-age” disease with an “age-old” solution.Cancer Lett. 2008; 267: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). In animal models, dietary curcumin significantly reduced the incidence and size of colonic tumors and glioblastoma, as well as joint inflammation (3.Huang M.T. Lou Y.R. Ma W. Newmark H.L. Reuhl K.R.

After encouraging and promising in vitro data, animal studies, and apparently safe use as a dietary agent for centuries, curcumin is currently being tested in over 100 clinical trials. The polypharmacology of curcumin has been linked to its keto-ene moiety acting as a Michael acceptor (8.Balogun E. Hoque M. Gong P. Killeen E. Green C.J. Foresti R. Alam J. Motterlini R.

Torti S.V. Curcumin, a cancer chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent, is a biologically active iron chelator.Blood. 2009; 113: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and the phenolic hydroxyl as a H-donor/antioxidant (11.Masuda T. Hidaka K. Shinohara A. Maekawa T. Takeda Y. Yamaguchi H. Chemical studies on antioxidant mechanism of curcuminoid: analysis of radical reaction products from curcumin.J. Agric.

Pharmacol. 2007; 59: 1673-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Whether these structural features are sufficient to account for the multitude of diverse biological effects in vitro is debatable. Thus, to rationalize the polypharmacology as well as the discrepancy of low plasma levels of curcumin with the observed in vivo effects, a hypothesis emerged that biological effects are mediated, at least in part, by metabolites (Fig. 1) (13.Shen L. Ji H.F. The pharmacology of curcumin: is it the degradation products?.Trends Mol. Med. 2012; 18: 138-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A similar hypothesis has been suggested for ellagitannins and their urolithin metabolites (14.Giménez-Bastida J.A. González-Sarrías A. Larrosa M. Tomás-Barberán F. Espín J.C. García-Conesa M.T. Ellagitannin metabolites, urolithin A glucuronide and its aglycone urolithin A, ameliorate TNF-α-induced inflammation and associated molecular markers in human aortic endothelial cells.Mol. Nutr.

Biotransformation of green tea polyphenols and the biological activities of those metabolites.Mol. Pharm. 2007; 4: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In contrast to the bioactivity of the ellagitannin and catechin metabolites, however, the known reduced, conjugated, or cleaved metabolites of curcumin are inactive or less active than the parent curcumin (16.Ireson C. Orr S. Jones D.J. Verschoyle R. Lim C.K. Luo J.L. Howells L. Plummer S. Jukes R. Williams M. Steward W.P. Gescher A.

Food Res. 2011; 55: 1646-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel transformation of curcumin was discovered and identified as an autoxidation reaction leading to oxygen incorporation and the formation of a bicyclopentadione derivative of curcumin (20.Griesser M. Pistis V. Suzuki T. Tejera N. Pratt D.A. Schneider C. Autoxidative and cyclooxygenase-2 catalyzed transformation of the dietary chemopreventive agent curcumin.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1114-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Autoxidative transformation is the major pathway of degradation of curcumin at physiological pH in vitro (21.Gordon O.N. Schneider C. Vanillin and ferulic acid: not the major degradation products of curcumin.Trends Mol. Med. 2012; 18: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Biological relevance for this transformation was found in the topoisomerase poisoning activity of curcumin (22.Martín-Cordero C. López-Lázaro M. Gálvez M. Ayuso M.J. Curcumin as a DNA topoisomerase II poison.J. Enzyme Inhib. Med. Chem. 2003; 18: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23.López-Lázaro M. Willmore E. Jobson A. Gilroy K.L. Curtis H.

Topoisomerase poisoning is the therapeutic mechanism of many anticancer drugs in clinical use (24.Deweese J.E. Osheroff N. The DNA cleavage reaction of topoisomerase II: wolf in sheep's clothing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 25.Nitiss J.L. Targeting DNA topoisomerase II in cancer chemotherapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 338-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase poisoning by curcumin required oxidative transformation to an active compound with short half-life (26.Ketron A.C. Gordon O.N. Schneider C. Osheroff N. Oxidative metabolites of curcumin poison human type II topoisomerases.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that unstable oxidative transformation products are an active principle rather than the parent curcumin. The oxidative transformation to the bicyclopentadione is intriguing, but crucial mechanistic questions about the double cyclization and oxygenation reaction remain to be elucidated (20.Griesser M. Pistis V. Suzuki T. Tejera N. Pratt D.A. Schneider C. Autoxidative and cyclooxygenase-2 catalyzed transformation of the dietary chemopreventive agent curcumin.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1114-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, for a complete evaluation of the biological relevance of oxidative transformation, it is necessary to identify all reaction products and to develop methods for the isolation of unstable reaction intermediates. Here we describe the isolation and identification of unstable spiroepoxide and vinylether intermediates, as well as additional novel products of the autoxidation of curcumin. Isotopic labeling studies were performed to determine their mechanism of formation. The by-products, intermediates, and the final bicyclopentadione comprise a number of diverse structural elements that are likely contributors to the polypharmacology of curcumin. Curcumin was synthesized as previously described (27.Pabon H.J.J. A synthesis of curcumin and related compounds.Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays Bas. 1964; 83: 379-386Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). A 5 mm stock solution of curcumin in ethanol was prepared on the day of the experiments. 18O-Labeled water (97 atom % 18O) was obtained from Isotec. Oxygen-18O2 (99 atom % 18O) was obtained from Sigma. [14C]Methyl iodide (2 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). [d3]Methyl iodide (99.5%) and all other reagents were from Sigma. [14C2]Curcumin and 3′-OCD3,4″-O-methylcurcumin were prepared as described with appropriate modifications (28.Gordon O.N. Graham L.A. Schneider C. Facile synthesis of deuterated and [14C]labeled analogs of vanillin and curcumin for use as mechanistic and analytical tools.J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. 2013; 56: 696-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Autoxidation of [14C2]curcumin (30 μm; 4 mCi/mmol) was conducted in 500 μl of 10 mm NH4OAc buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature. After 45 min, 250 μl of the reaction mixture were analyzed without extraction using RP-HPLC. 2The abbreviations used are: RPreversed phaseESIelectrospray ionizationNAcN-acetylcysteine. reversed phase electrospray ionization N-acetylcysteine. For preparative isolation of the autoxidation products, four reactions (50 ml of 10 mm NH4OAc buffer, pH 7.4, 50 μm curcumin) were conducted in parallel. For isolation of 6 and 7, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 or 60 min, respectively, followed by extraction without acidification. For all other products a reaction time of 3 h was used. Samples were extracted using a preconditioned 2 g Waters HLB cartridge and eluted with two aliquots of 2 ml of acetonitrile. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the sample was dissolved in acetonitrile/water 1:1 for RP-HPLC analysis. 1H NMR (CD3OD, 600 MHz): δH 6.59 (2H, dd, J = 8.1, 1.9 Hz, H6′ and H6″), 6.55 (2H, d, J = 8.1 Hz, H5′ and H5″), 6.41 (2H, d, J = 1.8 Hz, H2′ and H2″), 4.7 (1H, H4), 3.76 (2H, d, J = 3.2 Hz, H1 and H7), 3.62 (6H, s, OCH3), 3.34 (2H, d, J = 3.2 Hz, H2 and H6). 13C NMR (CD3OD, 150 MHz): δC 206 (2, C3 and C5), 147 (2, C3′ and C3″), 144 (2, C4′ and C4″), 132 (2, C1′ and C1″), 120 (2, C2′ and C2″), 114 (2, C6′ and C6″), 112 (2, C5′ and C5″), 54.8 (2, OCH3), 47 (2, C2 and C6), 46 (2, C1 and C7). 1H NMR (CD3OD, 600 MHz): δH 6.69 (1H, d, J = 1.2 Hz, H2′), 6.67 (1H, d, J = 7.9 Hz, H5′), 6.65 (1H, dd, J = 8.1, 1.6 Hz, H6′), 6.61 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz, H5″), 6.59 (1H, d, J = 1.6 Hz, H2″), 6.52 (1H, dd, J = 8.1, 1.7 Hz, H6″), 4.51 (1H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H1), 4.34 (1H, d, J = 3.4 Hz, H7), 3.84 (1H, s, H4), 3.79 (3H, s, OCH3), 3.74 (3H, s, OCH3), 2.52, (1H, dd, J = 3.9, 2.8 Hz, H6), 2.30 (1H, dd, J = 8.9, 2.9 Hz, H2). 13C NMR (CD3OD, 150 MHz): δC 207 (C3), 119 (C6′), 118 (C6″), 114 (2, C5′ and C5″), 109 (2, C2′ and C2″), 77 (C1), 73, C7), 55 (2, OCH3), 52 (C6), 51 (C2);

For LC-MS analyses, reactions were conducted in 1 ml of NH4OAc buffer, pH 7.4, made from a 1:1 mixture of H2O and H218O. For NMR analysis of incorporation of 18O from H218O into 8, two 50-ml reactions were conducted. After 20 min (when 6 is the major product present), the reactions were extracted (2 g HLB cartridge) and eluted with MeOH. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the sample was redissolved in 500 μl of H218O buffered at pH 7.4 with 10 mm NH4OAc. After 3 h, the reaction was acidified and combined with a similar scale reaction conducted in H2O in parallel. Product 8 was isolated using RP-HPLC and prepared for 13C NMR analysis. For autoxidation under 18O2 atmosphere two 50-ml aliquots of buffer were degassed and saturated with 18O2. Curcumin, 500 μl from a 5 mm stock solution in ethanol was added. After 3 h, the reaction mixture was acidified and extracted, and 8a was isolated using RP-HPLC. For 13C NMR analysis, the sample was mixed 1:1 with 8a prepared using O2. Products 6a and 6b were isolated from a 2-ml curcumin autoxidation reaction that was terminated at 20 min by injection on RP-HPLC. The products were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 10 mm NH4OAc buffer, pH 7.4, and aliquots were analyzed by LC-MS using run times of 15 min. Thus, aliquots were analyzed in blocks of three consecutive injections from each of the two reactions for a total of 7 h. RP-HPLC isolated 6 (a mixture of 6a and 6b; 5 μm final concentration) was added to 1 ml of 20 mm NH4OAc buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 μm N-acetylcysteine. The reaction was stopped after 2 min by freezing on dry ice followed by LC-MS analysis. In parallel, an autoxidation of curcumin (50 μm) was conducted in the presence of 500 μm NAc in 1 ml of 20 mm NH4OAc buffer, pH 8.0. After 30 min, 5 milliunits of horseradish peroxidase and H2O2 (10 μm) were added. The sample was analyzed at 1 min before the addition of horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 and 10 min after the addition of horseradish peroxidase/H2O2. Guaiacol (2 mg, 0.02 mmol) was dissolved to a final concentration of 16 mm in 1 ml 10 mm pyrophosphate buffer containing H2O2 (0.35 mm), GSH (1.6 mg, 5 mm), and manganese acetate (0.04 mg, 1 mm) (29.Forrester I.T.

The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 12 h before extraction on a preconditioned 50-mg Waters HLB cartridge eluted with MeOH. The sample was concentrated and analyzed using RP-HPLC and LC-MS. Reactions were analyzed using a Waters Atlantis T3 5-μm column (4.6 × 250 mm) eluted with 10% acetonitrile in 10 mm NH4OAc, pH 7.4, for 10 min. After 10 min, a linear gradient to 80% acetonitrile within 20 min was used. For isolation of products 1-4, the solvent was 2% acetonitrile in 10 mm NH4OAc, pH 7.4. Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the products were monitored using an Agilent 1200 diode array detector coupled to a Radiomatic A100 radioactive flow detector. LC-MS analysis was conducted using a Thermo Finnigan LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI interface. The instrument was operated in the negative ion mode, and mass spectra were acquired at a rate of 2 s/scan. The settings for the heated capillary (300 °C), spray voltage (4.0 kV), spray current (0.22 μA), auxiliary (37 mTorr), and sheath gas (16 mTorr) were optimized using direct infusion of a solution of curcumin (20 ng/μl) in acetonitrile/water 95/5 (v/v), containing 10 mm NH4OAc. Samples were introduced into the instrument using a Waters Symmetry Shield C18 3.5-μm column (2.1 × 100 mm) eluted with acetonitrile containing 10 mm NH4OAc (3/97 isocratic and then a linear gradient to 95/5 from 5 to 10 min) at 0.2 ml/min. Thiol adducts were analyzed using a Thermo Vantage triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated ESI source. The settings were: heated capillary (300 °C), vaporizer (275 °C), spray current (0.22 μA), auxiliary (10 mTorr), and sheath gas (60 mTorr). Samples were introduced using a Waters Symmetry Shield C18 3.5-μm column (2.1 × 100 mm) eluted with acetonitrile containing 10 mm NH4OAc (3/97 isocratic and then a linear gradient to 95/5 from 2 to 6 min) at 0.25 ml/min. Samples were dissolved in 150 μl of methanol-d4 or acetonitrile-d3 in 3-mm-inner diameter sample tubes. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker DRX 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe at 284 K. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to residual nondeuterated solvent (δ 3.30 for methanol-d4 and 1.94 ppm for acetonitrile-d3). Pulse frequencies for the H,H-COSY, heteronuclear single quantum coherence, and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiments were taken from the Bruker library. Carbon chemical shifts were determined from the heteronuclear single quantum coherence and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiments. Curcumin (λmax 425 nm) degraded in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) within a 10-min reaction time (Fig. 2A). Products with λmax at 263 nm were formed in parallel. The absorbance at 263 nm reached a maximum at 10 min and decreased slowly over the next 30 min (Fig. 2B). Thus, the spectrophotometric analyses confirmed that curcumin degrades rapidly at physiological pH (20.Griesser M. Pistis V. Suzuki T. Tejera N. Pratt D.A. Schneider C.

At 45-min reaction time, an aliquot of the reaction was directly injected on RP-HPLC with diode array and in-line radioactivity detection. The chromatogram in Fig. 3A shows elution of products 1-9 followed by unreacted curcumin as the last peak. The most polar of the products (1-4) were collected as a group and further resolved into five distinct peaks (Fig. 3B). The UV-visible spectra recorded during the HPLC analyses (Fig. 3C) showed that the increase in absorbance at 263 nm during autoxidation (Fig. 2) was caused by formation of 6; the local maximum at ∼360 nm was due to 7.

https://openalex.org/W2115878657,"Common dolphins, Delphinus sp., are one of the marine mammal species tourism operations in New Zealand focus on. While effects of cetacean-watching activities have previously been examined in coastal regions in New Zealand, this study is the first to investigate effects of commercial tourism and recreational vessels on common dolphins in an open oceanic habitat. Observations from both an independent research vessel and aboard commercial tour vessels operating off the central and east coast Bay of Plenty, North Island, New Zealand were used to assess dolphin behaviour and record the level of compliance by permitted commercial tour operators and private recreational vessels with New Zealand regulations. Dolphin behaviour was assessed using two different approaches to Markov chain analysis in order to examine variation of responses of dolphins to vessels. Results showed that, regardless of the variance in Markov methods, dolphin foraging behaviour was significantly altered by boat interactions. Dolphins spent less time foraging during interactions and took significantly longer to return to foraging once disrupted by vessel presence. This research raises concerns about the potential disruption to feeding, a biologically critical behaviour. This may be particularly important in an open oceanic habitat, where prey resources are typically widely dispersed and unpredictable in abundance. Furthermore, because tourism in this region focuses on common dolphins transiting between adjacent coastal locations, the potential for cumulative effects could exacerbate the local effects demonstrated in this study. While the overall level of compliance by commercial operators was relatively high, non-compliance to the regulations was observed with time restriction, number or speed of vessels interacting with dolphins not being respected. Additionally, prohibited swimming with calves did occur. The effects shown in this study should be carefully considered within conservation management plans, in order to reduce the risk of detrimental effects on common dolphins within the region."

Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is emerging as a central regulator of cell metabolism, proliferation, and survival. However, its role in folliculogenesis and POF has not been reported. Here, we showed that the signaling activity of mTORC2 is inhibited in a 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD)-induced POF mouse model. Notably, mice with oocyte-specific ablation of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2, demonstrated POF phenotypes, including massive follicular death, excessive loss of functional ovarian follicles, abnormal gonadal hormone secretion, and consequently, secondary subfertility in conditional knock-out (cKO) mice. Furthermore, reduced levels of Ser-473-phosphorylated Akt and Ser-253-phosphorylated Foxo3a and elevated pro-apoptotic proteins, Bad, Bax, and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), were observed in cKO mice, replicating the signaling alterations in 4-VCD-treated ovaries. These results indicate a critical role of the Rictor/mTORC2/Akt/Foxo3a pro-survival signaling axis in folliculogenesis. Interestingly, loss of maternal Rictor did not cause obvious developmental defects in embryos or placentas from cKO mice, suggesting that maternal Rictor is dispensable for preimplantation embryonic development. Our results collectively indicate key roles of Rictor/mTORC2 in folliculogenesis, follicle survival, and female fertility and support the utility of oocyte-specific Rictor knock-out mice as a novel model for POF.

https://openalex.org/W2061943143,"Early intervention may be key to safe and effective therapies in patients with Alzheimer disease. Endosomal dysfunction is an early step in neurodegeneration. Endosomes are a major site of production of Aβ peptide from the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by clipping enzymes (β- and γ-secretases). The β-secretase enzyme BACE1 requires acidic lumen pH for optimum function, and acid pH promotes Aβ aggregation. The Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE6 provides a leak pathway for protons, limiting luminal acidification by proton pumps. Like APP, NHE6 expression was induced upon differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and localized to an endosomal compartment. Therefore, we investigated whether NHE6 expression altered APP localization and processing in a stably transfected cell culture model of human APP expression. We show that co-expression with NHE6 or treatment with the Na(+)/H(+) ionophore monensin shifted APP away from the trans-Golgi network into early and recycling endosomes in HEK293 cells. NHE6 alkalinized the endosomal lumen, similar to monensin, and significantly attenuated APP processing and Aβ secretion. In contrast, Aβ production was elevated upon NHE6 knockdown. We show that NHE6 transcript and protein levels are lowered in Alzheimer brains relative to control. These findings, taken together with emerging genetic evidence linking endosomal Na(+)/H(+) exchangers with Alzheimer disease, suggest that proton leak pathways may regulate Aβ generation and contribute to disease etiology."
https://openalex.org/W2007404536,"Here we report that VEGF-A and IGF-1 differ in their ability to stabilize newly formed blood vessels and endothelial cell tubes. Although VEGF-A failed to support an enduring vascular response, IGF-1 stabilized neovessels generated from primary endothelial cells derived from various vascular beds and mouse retinal explants. In these experimental systems, destabilization/regression was driven by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Because previous studies have established that Erk antagonizes LPA-mediated regression, we considered whether Erk was an essential component of IGF-dependent stabilization. Indeed, IGF-1 lost its ability to stabilize neovessels when the Erk pathway was inhibited pharmacologically. Furthermore, stabilization was associated with prolonged Erk activity. In the presence of IGF-1, Erk activity persisted longer than in the presence of VEGF or LPA alone. These studies reveal that VEGF and IGF-1 can have distinct inputs in the angiogenic process. In contrast to VEGF, IGF-1 stabilizes neovessels, which is dependent on Erk activity and associated with prolonged activation. Here we report that VEGF-A and IGF-1 differ in their ability to stabilize newly formed blood vessels and endothelial cell tubes. Although VEGF-A failed to support an enduring vascular response, IGF-1 stabilized neovessels generated from primary endothelial cells derived from various vascular beds and mouse retinal explants. In these experimental systems, destabilization/regression was driven by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Because previous studies have established that Erk antagonizes LPA-mediated regression, we considered whether Erk was an essential component of IGF-dependent stabilization.

https://openalex.org/W2035298743,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen of periodontal diseases, including periodontitis. We have investigated the effect of P. gingivalis infection on the PI3K/Akt (protein kinase B) signaling pathway in gingival epithelial cells. Here, we found that live P. gingivalis, but not heat-killed P. gingivalis, reduced Akt phosphorylation at both Thr-308 and Ser-473, which implies a decrease in Akt activity. Actually, PI3K, which is upstream of Akt, was also inactivated by P. gingivalis. Furthermore, glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β, mammalian target of rapamycin, and Bad, which are downstream proteins in the PI3K/Akt cascade, were also dephosphorylated, a phenomenon consistent with Akt inactivation by P. gingivalis. However, these events did not require direct interaction between bacteria and host cells and were independent of P. gingivalis invasion into the cells. The use of gingipain-specific inhibitors and a gingipain-deficient P. gingivalis mutant KDP136 revealed that the gingipains and their protease activities were essential for the inactivation of PI3K and Akt. The associations between the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α and membrane proteins were disrupted by wild-type P. gingivalis. Moreover, PDK1 translocation to the plasma membrane was reduced by wild-type P. gingivalis, but not KDP136, indicating little production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate by PI3K. Therefore, it is likely that PI3K failed to transmit homeostatic extracellular stimuli to intracellular signaling pathways by gingipains. Taken together, our findings indicate that P. gingivalis attenuates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via the proteolytic effects of gingipains, resulting in the dysregulation of PI3K/Akt-dependent cellular functions and the destruction of epithelial barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2012520715,"PIEZO1 is a recently cloned eukaryotic cation-selective channel that opens with mechanical force. We found that extracellular protonation inhibits channel activation by ≈90% by increased occupancy in the closed or the inactivated state. Titration between pH 6.3 and 8.3 exhibited a pK of ≈6.9. The steepness of the titration data suggests positive cooperativity, implying the involvement of at least two protonation sites. Whole-cell recordings yielded results similar to patches, and pH 6.5 reduced whole-cell currents by >80%. The effects were reversible. To assess whether pH acts on the open or the inactivated state, we tested a double-mutant PIEZO1 that does not inactivate. Cell-attached patches and whole-cell currents from this mutant channel were pH-insensitive. Thus, protonation appears to be associated with domain(s) of the channel involved with inactivation. pH also did not affect mutant channels with point mutations at position 2456 that are known to exhibit slow inactivation. To determine whether the physical properties of the membrane are altered by pH and thereby affect channel gating, we measured patch capacitance during mechanical stimuli at pH 6.5 and 7.3. The rate constants for changes in patch capacitance were independent of pH, suggesting that bilayer mechanics are not involved. In summary, low pH stabilizes the inactivated state. This effect may be important when channels are activated under pathological conditions in which the pH is reduced, such as during ischemia."

https://openalex.org/W2008034397,"Mutations in the human ChlR1 (DDX11) gene are associated with a unique genetic disorder known as Warsaw breakage syndrome characterized by cellular defects in genome maintenance. The DNA triplex helix structures that form by Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding are examples of alternate DNA structures that can be a source of genomic instability. In this study, we have examined the ability of human ChlR1 helicase to destabilize DNA triplexes. Biochemical studies demonstrated that ChlR1 efficiently melted both intermolecular and intramolecular DNA triplex substrates in an ATP-dependent manner. Compared with other substrates such as replication fork and G-quadruplex DNA, triplex DNA was a preferred substrate for ChlR1. Also, compared with FANCJ, a helicase of the same family, the triplex resolving activity of ChlR1 is unique. On the other hand, the mutant protein from a Warsaw breakage syndrome patient failed to unwind these triplexes. A previously characterized triplex DNA-specific antibody (Jel 466) bound triplex DNA structures and inhibited ChlR1 unwinding activity. Moreover, cellular assays demonstrated that there were increased triplex DNA content and double-stranded breaks in ChlR1-depleted cells, but not in FANCJ−/− cells, when cells were treated with a triplex stabilizing compound benzoquinoquinoxaline, suggesting that ChlR1 melting of triple-helix structures is distinctive and physiologically important to defend genome integrity. On the basis of our results, we conclude that the abundance of ChlR1 known to exist in vivo is likely to be a strong deterrent to the stability of triplexes that can potentially form in the human genome."

We recently showed that the cytokine-mediated apoptotic pathway might be important for the development of intestinal mucositis induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Saireito, the traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) medicine, is widely used to treat diarrhea and various inflammatory diseases in Japan. In the present study, we investigated the effect of saireito on 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis in mice, especially in relation to apoptosis in the intestinal crypt. Male C57BL/6 mice were given 5-FU (50 mg/kg), i.p. once daily for 6 days. Intestinal mucositis was evaluated histochemically. Saireito (100-1000 mg/kg) was administered p.o. twice daily for 6 days. Repeated 5-FU treatment caused severe intestinal mucositis including morphological damage, which was accompanied by body weight loss and diarrhea. Daily administration of saireito reduced the severity of intestinal mucositis in a dose-dependent manner. Body weight loss and diarrhea during 5-FU treatment were also significantly attenuated by saireito administration. The number of apoptotic and caspase-3-activated cells in the intestinal crypt was increased, and was accompanied by up-regulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β mRNA within 24 h of the first 5-FU injection. However, all of these measures were significantly lower after saireito administration. These results suggest that saireito attenuates 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. This action may come from the reduction of apoptosis in the intestinal crypt via suppression of the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, saireito may be clinically useful for the prevention of intestinal mucositis during cancer chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2084356517,"Cytokinins are phytohormones that regulate many developmental and environmental responses. The Medicago truncatula cytokinin receptor MtCRE1 (Cytokinin Response 1) is required for the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia. As several cytokinin signaling genes are modulated in roots depending on different biotic and abiotic conditions, we assessed potential involvement of this pathway in various root environmental responses. Phenotyping of cre1 mutant roots infected by the Gigaspora margarita arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiotic fungus, the Aphanomyces euteiches root oomycete, or subjected to an abiotic stress (salt), were carried out. Detailed histological analysis and quantification of cre1 mycorrhized roots did not reveal any detrimental phenotype, suggesting that MtCRE1 does not belong to the ancestral common symbiotic pathway shared by rhizobial and AM symbioses. cre1 mutants formed an increased number of emerged lateral roots compared to wild-type plants, a phenotype which was also observed under non-stressed conditions. In response to A. euteiches, cre1 mutants showed reduced disease symptoms and an increased plant survival rate, correlated to an enhanced formation of lateral roots, a feature previously linked to Aphanomyces resistance. Overall, we showed that the cytokinin CRE1 pathway is not only required for symbiotic nodule organogenesis but also affects both root development and resistance to abiotic and biotic environmental stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2075436640,"Reconciling the fossil record with molecular phylogenies to enhance the understanding of animal evolution is a challenging task, especially for taxa with a mostly poor fossil record, such as sponges (Porifera). ‘Lithistida’, a polyphyletic group of recent and fossil sponges, are an exception as they provide the richest fossil record among demosponges. Lithistids, currently encompassing 13 families, 41 genera and >300 recent species, are defined by the common possession of peculiar siliceous spicules (desmas) that characteristically form rigid articulated skeletons. Their phylogenetic relationships are to a large extent unresolved and there has been no (taxonomically) comprehensive analysis to formally reallocate lithistid taxa to their closest relatives. This study, based on the most comprehensive molecular and morphological investigation of ‘lithistid’ demosponges to date, corroborates some previous weakly-supported hypotheses, and provides novel insights into the evolutionary relationships of the previous ‘order Lithistida’. Based on molecular data (partial mtDNA CO1 and 28S rDNA sequences), we show that 8 out of 13 ‘Lithistida’ families belong to the order Astrophorida, whereas Scleritodermidae and Siphonidiidae form a separate monophyletic clade within Tetractinellida. Most lithistid astrophorids are dispersed between different clades of the Astrophorida and we propose to formally reallocate them, respectively. Corallistidae, Theonellidae and Phymatellidae are monophyletic, whereas the families Pleromidae and Scleritodermidae are polyphyletic. Family Desmanthidae is polyphyletic and groups within Halichondriidae – we formally propose a reallocation. The sister group relationship of the family Vetulinidae to Spongillida is confirmed and we propose here for the first time to include Vetulina into a new Order Sphaerocladina. Megascleres and microscleres possibly evolved and/or were lost several times independently in different ‘lithistid’ taxa, and microscleres might at least be four times more likely lost than megascleres. Desma spicules occasionally may have undergone secondary losses too. Our study provides a framework for further detailed investigations of this important demosponge group."

A detailed understanding of the replication cycle and pathogenesis of human noroviruses is limited due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system to propagate the virus (13.Duizer, E., Schwab, K.

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and depend on the host translational machinery to produce viral proteins. Viral mRNAs have therefore evolved mechanisms to enable them to compete with the host mRNAs for cellular ribosomes and translation factors. Moreover, translational control enables the cell to adjust rapidly to its environment by regulating the translation rate of selected mRNAs and therefore provides an ideal strategy for delivering the targeted responses required during viral infection. Generally, translational control is exerted at the initiation stage, during which ribosomes are recruited to the 5′ end of the cellular mRNA typically bearing a cap structure 7MeGpppN (18.Hinnebusch, A. G., (2014) The scanning mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 83, 779–812Google Scholar). The interaction between the ribosome and the mRNA is facilitated by the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex consisting of eIF4E; the cap binding protein, eIF4G; a scaffolding protein; and eIF4A, an RNA helicase required to unwind RNA structure during ribosome scanning. Once eIF4F is bound to the cap, it acts as a point of attachment for ribosomes, which then scan the messenger RNA to locate the AUG start codon and initiate translation (18.Hinnebusch, A. G., (2014) The scanning mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 83, 779–812Google Scholar). Viruses can modulate translation by altering the function of eIFs. For example, this may be achieved by site-specific cleavage of eIF4G or the phosphorylation of eIF2α (19.Walsh, D., Mathews, M. B., Mohr, I., (2013) Tinkering with translation: protein synthesis in virus-infected cells. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 5, a012351Google Scholar, 20.Walsh, D., Mohr, I., (2011) Viral subversion of the host protein synthesis machinery. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 9, 860–875Google Scholar). Among the translation factors, eIF4E is thought to be limiting for translation; thus, regulating the activity of eIF4E is critical for cellular function (21.Duncan, R., Milburn, S. C., Hershey, J. W., (1987) Regulated phosphorylation and low abundance of HeLa cell initiation factor eIF-4F suggest a role in translational control: heat shock effects on eIF-4F. J. Biol. Chem. 262, 380–388Google Scholar). The activity of eIF4E is regulated by the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), which inhibit translation initiation by competing with eIF4G for a common binding site on eIF4E (22.Mader, S., Lee, H., Pause, A., Sonenberg, N., (1995) The translation initiation factor eIF-4E binds to a common motif shared by the translation factor eIF-4γ and the translational repressors 4E-binding proteins. Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 4990–4997Google Scholar). The interaction of 4E-BP with eIF4E is prevented when 4E-BP is phosphorylated by mTOR, a downstream kinase within the phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) pathway (23.Clemens, M.

Genes Dev. 15, 2852–2864Google Scholar). Viruses can manipulate this pathway to regulate 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and therefore eIF4E availability (20.Walsh, D., Mohr, I., (2011) Viral subversion of the host protein synthesis machinery. Nat.

J., (2005) Translational control in virus-infected cells: models for cellular stress responses. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 16, 13–20Google Scholar).

Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 9, 860–875Google Scholar). The activity of eIF4E is also controlled by its phosphorylation status. The mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinases Mnk1/2 phosphorylate Ser-209 of eIF4E (27.Waskiewicz, A. J., Flynn, A., Proud, C. G., Cooper, J. A., (1997) Mitogen-activated protein kinases activate the serine/threonine kinases Mnk1 and Mnk2. EMBO J. 16, 1909–1920Google Scholar). The control of eIF4E phosphorylation depends not only on the activation of Mnk1/2 by signaling cascades of the mitogen-associated protein kinases p38 and ERK1/2 (28.Morley, S. J., (1997) Signalling through either the p38 or ERK mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway is obligatory for phorbol ester and T cell receptor complex (TCR-CD3)-stimulated phosphorylation of initiation factor (eIF) 4E in Jurkat T cells.

Infections with herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and human cytomegalovirus both lead to an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF4E, whereas influenza virus, poliovirus, and encephalomyocarditis virus induce eIF4E dephosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 19.Walsh, D., Mathews, M. B., Mohr, I., (2013) Tinkering with translation: protein synthesis in virus-infected cells. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 5, a012351Google Scholar). Although the consequence of eIF4E phosphorylation for its affinity for the cap remains the subject of debate, this has been shown to control the translation of specific mRNAs encoding proteins associated with cell proliferation, inflammation, and interferon production (32.Furic, L., Rong, L., Larsson, O., Koumakpayi, I.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 24, 6539–6549Google Scholar). The calicivirus RNA lacks the canonical cap structure recognized by eIF4E. However, previous studies have shown that the norovirus VPg proteins act as a “cap substitute” to mediate translation by interacting with initiation factors (35.Herbert, T.

Chem. 281, 25315–25325Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that MNV1 VPg directly binds to the eIF4F complex and that this process is mediated by a high affinity interaction between eIF4G and the C-terminal domain of VPg (39.Chung, L., Bailey, D., Leen, E. N., Emmott, E. P., Chaudhry, Y., Roberts, L. O., Curry, S., Locker, N., Goodfellow, I.

Chem. 289, 21738–21750Google Scholar). Although MNV1 VPg also interacts with eIF4E, the role of this interaction remains to be discovered. The depletion of eIF4E or the addition of 4E-BP1 has little to no impact on MNV1 VPg-linked RNA translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates or in cells (38.Chaudhry, Y., Nayak, A., Bordeleau, M.

Chem. 289, 21738–21750Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that eIF4E could play an important role during the norovirus life cycle through the modulation of eIF4E phosphorylation mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To address this possibility, we have investigated the phosphorylation status of eIF4E in cells infected with the only norovirus that can undergo a complete replication cycle in cell culture, namely MNV1. Our results suggest that Mnk1 is responsible for the phosphorylation of eIF4E during MNV1 infection. Furthermore, we show that the activation of Mnk1 by the p38 kinase is important during the viral life cycle because impairment of eIF4E phosphorylation by inhibition of these kinases has a deleterious effect on viral replication. Moreover, using polysomal profile analysis, we show that phosphorylated eIF4E relocates to the polysomes during infection, and we provide evidence that this could induce the translational control of a subset of mRNAs during infection. These results suggest that regulation of eIF4E activity plays a role during MNV1 infection to regulate translation of specific host mRNAs. Mouse leukemic monocyte-macrophage (RAW264.7) cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/liter d-glucose + l-glutamine + pyruvate (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (5000 units ml−1 penicillin G sodium; 5000 μg ml−1 streptomycin sulfate in 0.85% saline (Invitrogen)) at 37°C in 5 % CO2. MNV1 strain CW1, propagated in RAW264.7 cells, was described previously (38.Chaudhry, Y., Nayak, A., Bordeleau, M. E., Tanaka, J., Pelletier, J., Belsham, G. J., Roberts, L. O., Goodfellow, I. G., (2006) Caliciviruses differ in their functional requirements for eIF4F components. J. Biol. Chem. 281, 25315–25325Google Scholar). Virus titers were estimated by determination of the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) units per ml. For a multiplicity of infection (MOI) equal to one, cells were infected with 1 TCID50 unit/cell. The day before infection, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in duplicate in 35-mm dishes at a density of ∼3.5 × 106 cells/dish to obtain confluent monolayers. The RAW264.7 cells were infected with MNV1 at an MOI of 10 TCID50 per cell. Matched cell-free lysates were used for control mock infections. The cells were incubated with 5% carbon dioxide at 37 °C. Two-point time courses for MNV infection were harvested at either 2 and 12 or 6 and 14 hpi. The cells were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS before harvesting the cells in 100 μl of NLB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm disodium β-glycerophosphate, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.5% Nonidet P-40), followed by centrifugation for 3 min at 595 × g in a benchtop centrifuge (Centurian 1000 series, Centurion Scientific; East Preston, UK). Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were adjusted to the same concentration of between 20 and 50 μg of protein and made up to 30 μl with NLB and SDS (3×) sample buffer (New England BioLabs, Hitchin, UK). The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE (Mini Protean TGX gels; Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) Immobilon-P membrane (Merck Millipore) for subsequent immunoblotting using conventional methods (40.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Following incubation with primary antibodies, washes, and incubation with secondary antibodies, the membranes were probed for chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific), and the signal was detected on radiographic film (Fuji RX, Fisher). The Proteome Profiler Human Phospho-MAPK Array (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) was used to analyze activation of ERK and p38 using 300-μg protein samples from lysates of mock- and MNV1-infected RAW264.7 cells isolated at 2 and 12 hpi according to the manufacturer's instructions. The signal was detected on radiographic film (Fuji RX) and quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Antibodies against eIF4E and MNV1 NS7 (41.Willett, M., Flint, S.

Phosphospecific antibodies to eIF4E (Ser-209), 4E-BP1 (Thr-36/47, Ser-65, and Thr-70), eIF2α (Ser-52), Mnk1 (Thr-197/202), and corresponding total antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibody to GAPDH was obtained from Ambion Invitrogen. Secondary antibodies included anti-rabbit HRP and anti-mouse HRP (Dako, Cytomation (Ely, UK)). All antibodies were used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The following chemical inhibitors were used for pathway analysis: SB203580 (Calbiochem, Merck Millipore) targeting p38α/β, SCH772984 (Calbiochem) targeting ERK1/2, and CGP57380 (Tocris bioscience; Abingdon, UK) targeting Mnk1. The inhibitor of the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction, 4E2RCat, was kindly provided by Prof. Jerry Pelletier (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Sodium arsenite was used to induce eIF2α phosphorylation (30 min, 0.5 mm). The CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Southampton, UK) was used to monitor cell viability over the range of concentrations used for each inhibitor according to the manufacturer's instructions. The effect of signaling inhibitors on viral replication was determined by treating confluent monolayers of cells in 35-mm dishes with increasing concentrations of SCH772984 (ERK1/2; 1–20 μm), CGP57380 (Mnk1; 1–20 μm), and SB203580 (p38; 1–25 μm) and incubating them for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 as before. To measure the effect of inhibitors on eIF4E phosphorylation, cells were stimulated with LPS at a concentration of 10 ng μl−1, harvested as before at 2 and 12 h after stimulation, and analyzed by Western blot. To measure the effect of inhibitors on viral replication, the cells were infected at an MOI of 0.3 TCID50/cell with MNV1 for 1 h at room temperature. Following replacement of the virus-containing medium with fresh medium and inhibitor, the cells were incubated for a further 12 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Culture supernatants were retained, and virus titer was estimated by determination of TCID50 as before. Separation of polysomes by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation was carried out as described previously (43.Johannes, G., Sarnow, P., (1998) Cap-independent polysomal association of natural mRNAs encoding c-myc, BiP, and eIF4G conferred by internal ribosome entry sites. RNA 4, 1500–1513Google Scholar). RAW264.7 cells (1–2 × 107), mock- or MNV1-infected (MOI of 6.7 TCID50/cell) for 8 h, were incubated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 10 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were washed on ice with PBS containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, harvested by scraping, and spun at 450 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm sodium chloride, 15 mm magnesium chloride, 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100), and the resulting lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. To separate polysomes, samples were layered onto a 10–50% sucrose gradient in lysis buffer and centrifuged in an SW40Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) at 38,000 rpm for 2 h. Gradients were fractionated into 1-ml fractions using a FoxyR1 collection system (Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln NE), and UV absorbance was monitored at 254 nm. To induce run-off of polysomes, cycloheximide was omitted from the lysis and gradient buffers and replaced with 10 mm EDTA. Total RNA was extracted from cell lysates or polysomal fractions using the ZR RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (1%, 1× TBE). To monitor the localization of p-eIF4E in polysomal fractions, fractions 6–10 from each gradient were pooled and analyzed by immunoblotting against eIF4E and p-eIF4E. Following polysomal fraction separation, each fraction was first added to an exogenous RNA reference, 50 ng of LysA mRNA from Bacillus subtillis, as described before (44.Halbeisen, R. E., Scherrer, T., Gerber, A. P., (2009) Affinity purification of ribosomes to access the translatome. Methods 48, 306–310Google Scholar). Pooled polysomal fractions (typical fractions 5–9) or non-polysomal fractions were first concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (YM-30; Millipore). Total RNA was extracted using ZR Miniprep RNA extraction columns following the manufacturer's instructions and including an on-column TURBO DNase I digestion. Using RNA purified from the total RNA or polysome fractions, first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using equivalent amounts of starting RNA from all samples (first strand cDNA synthesis kit, Roche Applied Science). For PCR analysis, the cDNA was analyzed using the PCR Master Mix (Promega), and the PCR cycle conditions used were 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The primer pairs used are described in Table 1. For qPCR analysis, the cDNA was analyzed with the MESA BLUE qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR (Eurogentec, Southampton, UK) using a Stratagene MX3005 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All samples were prepared in triplicate. The PCR cycle conditions used were 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min, and the Ct values were determined using the MxPro software (Stratagene). The translational state (TS) change was calculated after the abundance of each mRNA in monosomes and polysomes was normalized with respect to the abundance of the added-in control, and then the changes in polysomes were normalized to the changes in monosomes for a given mRNA, and the values were expressed as a function of the TS obtained for mock cells and set to 1.TABLE 1Primer pairs used for PCR or qPCR amplificationName of genePrimer (5′–3′)4EBP1 ForwardTAGCCCTACCAGCGATGAGCCT ReverseGTATCAACAGAGGCACAAGGAGGTAT18S ForwardAGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA ReverseGATCCGAGGGCCTCACTAAACGAPDH ForwardTTCAACGGCACAGTCAAGG ReverseCTCAGCACCGGCCTCACCmTOR ForwardGCAATAAGCGGTCCCGGACAA ReverseGCTTTCTTATGGGCTGGTTCTCCAAeIF4B ForwardATGCGTGGGTGAAGCGAAGCTCT ReverseGCTCAGGCGCAGATCTGGAGTCNfkbia ForwardGACGCAGACCTGCACACCCC ReverseTGGAGGGCTGTCCGGCCATTSRp20 ForwardTGAGGATCCCCGAGATGCT ReverseCTTACACGGCAGCCACACAGTrpS19 ForwardCAGCACGGCACCTGTACCT ReverseGCTGGGTCTGACACCGTTTCrpL32 ForwardCACCAGTCAGACCGATATGTGAAAA ReverseTGTTGTCAATGCCTCTGGGTTTCasp4 ForwardCTCTGAGGCTCTTTCCAACG ReverseTTCCAACACCTTAAGTGGCTTTCdk9 ForwardTGCAAGGGCAGCATCTATC ReverseTCATGTCCCTGTGCAGGATMNV1 ForwardCACGCCACCGATCTGTTCTG ReverseGCGCTGCGCCATCACTC Open table in a new tab Previous studies have demonstrated that the VPg protein of caliciviruses acts as a proteinaceous cap substitute to initiate translation by interacting with eIF4E both in vitro and in vivo (37.Goodfellow, I., Chaudhry, Y., Gioldasi, I., Ger"
https://openalex.org/W2019506237,"Housaku Monogatari (HM) is a plant activator prepared from a yeast cell wall extract. We examined the efficacy of HM application and observed that HM treatment increased the resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa leaves to bacterial and fungal infections. HM reduced the severity of bacterial leaf spot and anthracnose on A. thaliana and Brassica crop leaves with protective effects. In addition, gene expression analysis of A. thaliana plants after treatment with HM indicated increased expression of several plant defense-related genes. HM treatment appears to induce early activation of jasmonate/ethylene and late activation of salicylic acid (SA) pathways. Analysis using signaling mutants revealed that HM required SA accumulation and SA signaling to facilitate resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola and the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum. In addition, HM-induced resistance conferred chitin-independent disease resistance to bacterial pathogens in A. thaliana. These results suggest that HM contains multiple microbe-associated molecular patterns that activate defense responses in plants. These findings suggest that the application of HM is a useful tool that may facilitate new disease control methods."
https://openalex.org/W1986303685,"Human land use tends to decrease the diversity of native plant species and facilitate the invasion and establishment of exotic ones. Such changes in land use and plant community composition usually have negative impacts on the assemblages of native herbivorous insects. Highly specialized herbivores are expected to be especially sensitive to land use intensification and the presence of exotic plant species because they are neither capable of consuming alternative plant species of the native flora nor exotic plant species. Therefore, higher levels of land use intensity might reduce the proportion of highly specialized herbivores, which ultimately would lead to changes in the specialization of interactions in plant-herbivore networks. This study investigates the community-wide effects of land use intensity on the degree of specialization of 72 plant-herbivore networks, including effects mediated by the increase in the proportion of exotic plant species. Contrary to our expectation, the net effect of land use intensity on network specialization was positive. However, this positive effect of land use intensity was partially canceled by an opposite effect of the proportion of exotic plant species on network specialization. When we analyzed networks composed exclusively of endophagous herbivores separately from those composed exclusively of exophagous herbivores, we found that only endophages showed a consistent change in network specialization at higher land use levels. Altogether, these results indicate that land use intensity is an important ecological driver of network specialization, by way of reducing the local host range of herbivore guilds with highly specialized feeding habits. However, because the effect of land use intensity is offset by an opposite effect owing to the proportion of exotic host species, the net effect of land use in a given herbivore assemblage will likely depend on the extent of the replacement of native host species with exotic ones."

Antibodies against PA have been shown to be protective against the disease. Variable domains of camelid heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs) with affinity for PA were obtained from immunized alpacas and screened for anthrax neutralizing activity in macrophage toxicity assays. Two classes of neutralizing VHHs were identified recognizing distinct, non-overlapping epitopes. One class recognizes domain 4 of PA at a well characterized neutralizing site through which PA binds to its cellular receptor. A second neutralizing VHH (JKH-C7) recognizes a novel epitope. This antibody inhibits conversion of the PA oligomer from “pre-pore” to its SDS and heat-resistant “pore” conformation while not preventing cleavage of full-length 83-kDa PA (PA83) by cell surface proteases to its oligomer-competent 63-kDa form (PA63).

Only the PA63 form oligomerizes as heptamers or octamers that provide the binding sites for LF or EF. The oligomer bound to one or more molecules of LF/EF is then rapidly translocated into cells. When recombinant PA83 is intentionally cleaved before exposure to cells or purified as the PA63 polypeptide, it rapidly oligomerizes in solution, and the preformed oligomer can also bind and transport LF/EF into cells. The PA63 oligomer undergoes a conformational change in acidic endosomes to a heat and SDS-stable form that allows the translocation of LF and EF through a central pore into the cytosol. LF and EF can then act on their substrates and manifest toxic effects (for review, see Refs. 1.Liu S. Moayeri M. Leppla S.H.

Cellular and systemic effects of anthrax lethal toxin and edema toxin.Mol. Aspects Med. 2009; 30: 439-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). During anthrax infection the accumulation of anthrax toxins in the blood leads to lethality. Because both toxins require PA for their action, this protein has been the primary target of therapeutics, including antibodies developed for treatment of anthrax (3.Chen Z. Moayeri M. Purcell R. Monoclonal antibody therapies against anthrax.Toxins. 2011; 3: 1004-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The efficacy of the currently licensed anthrax vaccine depends on its induction of antibodies to PA (4.Kaur M. Singh S. Bhatnagar R. Anthrax vaccines: present status and future prospects.Expert Rev. Vaccines. 2013; 12: 955-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The majority of neutralizing antibodies developed against PA act on the receptor binding domain (domain 4) to inhibit interaction of the toxin with cells. A few antibodies have also been identified that neutralize PA by other mechanisms (for review see Ref. 3.Chen Z. Moayeri M. Purcell R. Monoclonal antibody therapies against anthrax.Toxins. 2011; 3: 1004-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Camelid animals produce a heavy chain-only antibody from which the 14-kDa variable domains (called VHHs) are well expressed in bacteria as recombinant proteins that are unusually stable to pH and elevated temperatures (5.Muyldermans S. Nanobodies: natural single-domain antibodies.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 775-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 6.Hassanzadeh-Ghassabeh G. Devoogdt N. De Pauw P. Vincke C. Muyldermans S. Nanobodies and their potential applications.Nanomedicine. 2013; 8: 1013-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). VHHs often target active sites that may be inaccessible to larger conventional antibodies (7.Lauwereys M. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Hölzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S.

We have found that linking two or more neutralizing VHHs recognizing non-overlapping epitopes into heteromultimers (VHH-based neutralizing agents (VNAs)) often provides major improvements in the in vivo protection from toxin exposure as compared with the unlinked component VHHs (11.Mukherjee J.

Infect Dis. 2014; 210: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the identification of a panel of VHHs that recognize PA. Potent toxin-neutralizing VHHs were identified that recognize two non-overlapping epitopes. Characterization of the mechanisms by which these VHHs neutralize anthrax toxin reveals that one VHH class (represented by JIK-B8) binds to the well characterized neutralizing epitope through which PA (both PA83 and PA63 forms) binds to its receptor. A second neutralizing and unique VHH, JKH-C7, inhibits transition of the cell surface-generated PA63 oligomer from pre-pore to the acid and SDS-stable pore-forming conformation in endosomes by blocking endocytosis of cell surface-generated PA63. Linking JIK-B8 and JKH-C7 VHHs into a heterodimeric VNA resulted in an agent with an IC50 of ∼100 pm that proved highly effective in protecting mice from anthrax toxin or spore challenges. This VNA should offer new and cost-effective therapeutic options for treating anthrax exposures. All studies followed protocols approved by the Tufts University and NIAID Animal Care and Use Committees. Work with alpacas was done at Tufts under approved protocol Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine IACUC #G2011-08. All mouse studies were performed at NIAID under approved protocols LPD8E and LPD9E. Endotoxin-free mutant PA proteins, wild type PA83, PA63, and LF were purified from B. anthracis as previously described (17.Park S. Leppla S.H. Optimized production and purification of Bacillus anthracis lethal factor.Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 18: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The PAΔΔ is a mutant in which amino acids 162–167 and 304–317 are deleted such that it cannot be cleaved by furin and accumulates on the cell surface (reported here). PAdFF is a mutant in which phenylalanine residues 313 and 314 have been deleted, making it unable to translocate LF and EF (18.Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Sharma M. Leppla S.H.

Spores of the non-encapsulated, toxigenic Sterne-like strain A35 (19.Pomerantsev A.P. Sitaraman R. Galloway C.R. Kivovich V. Leppla S.H. Genome engineering in Bacillus anthracis using Cre recombinase.Infect Immun. 2006; 74: 682-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) used to infect mice were prepared as previously described (20.Moayeri M.

Rabbit anti-PA83 polyclonal serum #5308 was made in one of our laboratories as was the neutralizing anti-PA mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 14B7, which blocks binding of PA (both PA83 and PA63) to its cellular receptors (21.Rosovitz M.J.

Antibodies against the N terminus of MEK1 (Calbiochem), horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated and non-conjugated anti-E-tag polyclonal antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), and various IR-dye tagged secondary antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals, Pottstown, PA) were purchased. The dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was purchased from Sigma. Three alpacas were immunized with PA83 (100 μg) by five successive multi-site subcutaneous injections at 3-week intervals. For the first immunization, the adjuvant was alum/CpG, whereas subsequent immunizations used only alum. All alpacas achieved ELISA anti-PA titers of 1:1,000,000. Blood was obtained for lymphocyte preparation 7 days after the fifth immunization, and RNA was prepared using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Two VHH-display phage libraries were prepared as described previously (22.Maass D.R. Harrison G.B. Grant W.N. Shoemaker C.B.

The first library (JIG-2) was from peripheral blood lymphocytes of one immunized alpaca and contained ∼1 × 107 independent clones, whereas the second library (JKF-1) was generated from a pool of peripheral blood lymphocytes of the other two alpacas and contained ∼3 × 107 independent clones. Purified VHH agents were serially diluted onto ELISA plates coated with 1 μg/ml different PA proteins, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and then incubated 1 h with HRP-anti-E-tag. Bound HRP was detected using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma), and values were plotted as a function of the input VHH concentration. EC50 values were calculated as the VHH concentration that produced a signal equal to 50% of the maximum signal. Phage library panning, phage recovery, and clone fingerprinting were performed as previously described (11.Mukherjee J. Tremblay J.M. Leysath C.E. Ofori K. Baldwin K. Feng X. Bedenice D. Webb R.P.

The first panning process utilized the JIG-2 VHH-display library and employed purified PA83 or PA63 coated onto Nunc Immunotubes at 10 μg/ml for the first low stringency pan and then 1 μg/ml for the second high stringency pan. After two panning cycles, 70% of random clones selected on each target produced a signal >2× background, and clones producing the strongest “bug supernatant” ELISA (12.Tremblay J.M. Mukherjee J.

All VHHs panned on PA83 or PA63 recognized both PA83 and PA63. VHH coding sequences were determined for 24 clones displaying clearly unique fingerprints (12.Tremblay J.M. Mukherjee J. Leysath C.E. Debatis M. Ofori K. Baldwin K. Boucher C. Peters R. Beamer G. Sheoran A. Bedenice D. Tzipori S. Shoemaker C.B.

Sequence alignments revealed 11 distinct homology groups. Amino acid sequences of clones representing each group are shown in Fig. 1A. A second panning process using the JKF-1 library was performed as for the first panning but using only PA83 as the target. ∼300 colonies were picked randomly and screened by bug supernatant ELISA on replica plates coated with either 1) 0.5 μg/ml PA or 2) 3 μg/ml 14B7 mAb (24.Little S.F. Leppla S.H. Cora E. Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to the protective antigen component of Bacillus anthracis toxin.Infect Immun. 1988; 56: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by 1 μg/ml PA83. Screening on 14B7-captured PA83 was performed to block binding of VHHs recognizing the dominant epitope (C-group 1, Fig. 1B) that was identified after the screening of the first library. ∼70% of clones recognized PA83, whereas only ∼20% recognized 14B7-captured PA83. Based on ELISA data and DNA fingerprinting, ∼70 different VHH coding sequences were obtained. Their alignment permitted the identification of eight new homology groups not previously identified in the first screen (bottom 8 in Fig. 1, A and B). At least one VHH from each homology group was selected for protein expression. Expression and purification of VHHs in Escherichia coli as recombinant thioredoxin fusion proteins containing hexahistidine were performed as previously described (23.Tremblay J.M. Kuo C.L. Abeijon C. Sepulveda J. Oyler G. Hu X. Jin M.M. Shoemaker C.B. Camelid single domain antibodies (VHHs) as neuronal cell intrabody binding agents and inhibitors of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) proteases.Toxicon. 2010; 56: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). VHH heterodimers were engineered to be linked by a 15-amino acid flexible spacer ((GGGGS)3). All VHHs were expressed with a C-terminal E-tag epitope. Competition ELISA analysis was performed as previously described with minor modifications (11.Mukherjee J. Tremblay J.M. Leysath C.E. Ofori K. Baldwin K. Feng X. Bedenice D. Webb R.P. Wright P.M. Smith L.A. Tzipori S. Shoemaker C.B. A novel strategy for development of recombinant antitoxin therapeutics tested in a mouse botulism model.PloS ONE. 2012; 7: e29941Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Studies to assess the kinetic parameters of the VHHs were performed by surface plasmon resonance using either a ProteOn XPR36 Protein Interaction Array System (Bio-Rad; upper antibody set in Fig. 1B) or a Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare; lower antibody set in Fig. 1B). In each case the VHH was immobilized to the chip (GLH for ProteOn, CM5 for Biacore) by amine coupling chemistry, involving sequential, 1) activation of the chip surface with a mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and sulfo-N-hydoxysuccinimide (sulfo-NHS), 2) injection of PA83 at pH 5 (sodium acetate buffer), and 3) deactivation with an ethanolamine injection. For the ProteOn data set, a range of PA concentrations was passed over the chip surface at 100 μl/min for 60 s, and dissociation was recorded for 600 or 1200 s. Running buffer for these studies was 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20. The surface was regenerated between runs with a 30-s injection of 50 mm HCl at 50 μl/min. Data were evaluated with ProteOn Manager software (Version 3.1.0.6) using the Langmuir interaction model to obtain KD values. Reported values are the mean of at least four runs. For the Biacore data set, VHHs were passed over the PA immobilized on the chip surface at 100 nm and 100 μl/min for 60 s, and dissociation was recorded for 600 or 1200 s. Running buffer for these studies was 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20. The surface was regenerated between runs with a 30-s injection of 10 mm glycine, pH 3, at 50 μl/min. Dissociation and association phases of each curve were fit separately using BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare) using the 1:1 Langmuir model to obtain KD values. Reported values are the means of three runs. A series of four runs at 100 nm through 2 μm JKO-B8 resulted in comparable KD values at each concentration. A negative control VHH (anti-EF) did not exhibit any binding to the PA-coated chip. JIK-B8 was run at the beginning and end of the series to provide a point of comparison to the ProteOn data set. RAW264.7 mouse macrophages were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (all purchased from Invitrogen). For neutralization assays PA83 and LF (250 ng/ml) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were incubated with various dilutions of antibody in 96-well plates for 1 h before the addition to RAW264.7 macrophages. Viability was assessed by MTT staining as previously described (25.Chen Z. Moayeri M. Crown D. Emerson S. Gorshkova I. Schuck P. Leppla S.H. Purcell R.H. Novel chimpanzee/human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize anthrax lethal factor, and evidence for possible synergy with anti-protective antigen antibody.Infect Immun. 2009; 77: 3902-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), when >90% of toxin-treated controls were lysed as assessed by light microscopy. In certain experiments PA83 or PA63 (1 μg/ml) were prebound to antibodies or were added to cells at 37 °C or 4 °C followed after 1 h by washing with serum-free DMEM at the same temperature and the addition of medium containing LF or antibodies prepared in LF (1 μg/ml). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 12–16 h. Viability was assessed after this period by MTT staining relative to untreated cell controls. Analyses of PA binding and oligomer formation were performed using CHO-WTP4 cells. Toxin or antibody prebound toxin were prepared in serum-free DMEM and bound to cells for 1 h before washing and lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as previously described (26.Moayeri M. Wickliffe K.E. Wiggins J.F. Leppla S.H. Oxidized ATP protection against anthrax lethal toxin.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 3707-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In parallel experiments, trypsin (0.25% trypsin-EDTA, Invitrogen) was used to detach cells and strip cell surface proteins. Trypsin was inactivated by the addition of 50% fetal calf serum, cells were centrifuged (1000 rpm, 10 min), washed twice with PBS, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Western blot analyses were performed as previously described with loading of equal amounts of cell lysate protein in each lane (26.Moayeri M. Wickliffe K.E. Wiggins J.F. Leppla S.H. Oxidized ATP protection against anthrax lethal toxin.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 3707-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For toxin challenge, Balb/cJ mice (female, 8 weeks old, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were treated with antibody agents by the intravenous route at the doses (molar ratios relative to PA) and times indicated in figure legends. Mice were challenged with LT (45 μg, intravenous) and monitored for 10 days for survival. For spore challenges, C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old, female, The Jackson Laboratory) were challenged with the lethal dose of 2 × 107 spores (subcutaneously, 200 μl) before or after antibody administration (subcutaneously) at various doses or times as noted in figure legends. VHH-display phage libraries were prepared from three alpacas immunized with purified anthrax PA83. Two separate libraries were selected for clones binding to PA83 or, alternatively, to PA83 immobilized on mAb 14B7. The mAb 14B7 is a well characterized neutralizing mAb that binds to an immunodominant epitope through which PA binds to its receptor. A total of 19 “unique” VHHs (with apparently unrelated coding sequences) were identified (Fig. 1A). Competition assays between the various VHHs and with 14B7 and 2D3 mAbs (which bind distinct regions of PA83 (24.Little S.F. Leppla S.H. Cora E. Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to the protective antigen component of Bacillus anthracis toxin.Infect Immun. 1988; 56: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) showed the identified VHHs fall into four distinct competition groups (C-groups designated in Fig. 1B). Thus these antibodies likely bind to four non-overlapping epitopes on PA. Not surprisingly, 10 of 11 VHHs selected by binding to PA83-coated tubes (Fig. 1B, top half) competed with 14B7 (Fig. 2A and C-group 1 in Fig. 1B). Eight unique PA binding VHHs, including six new VHHs that bind PA83 at sites different than 14B7 (Fig. 2A and C-groups 2, 3, and 4 in Fig. 1B) were subsequently selected by binding to 14B7-immobilized (and thereby blocked) PA (Fig. 1B, second half). Binding of one VHH (JIJ-B8) was not blocked by either 14B7 or 2D3 (data not shown), and binding of another (JKO-H2) was inhibited by both (Fig. 2, A and B). All VHHs were characterized for PA affinity by dilution ELISA (for EC50) and by surface plasmon resonance (for KD) (Fig. 1B). A selected VHH representative of each of the four epitope competition groups is shaded in Fig. 1B. These are JIK-B8 (C-group 1), JKH-D12 (C-group 2), JKH-C7 (C-group 3), and JKO-H2 (C-group 4"
https://openalex.org/W2051079045,"Nucleolin is a ubiquitously expressed protein and participates in many important biological processes, such as cell cycle regulation and ribosomal biogenesis. The activity of nucleolin is regulated by intracellular localization and post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, methylation, and ADP-ribosylation. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a category of recently verified forms of post-translational modifications and exerts various effects on the target proteins. In the studies reported here, we discovered SUMOylational modification of human nucleolin protein at Lys-294, which facilitated the mRNA binding property of nucleolin by maintaining its nuclear localization. In response to arsenic exposure, nucleolin-SUMO was induced and promoted its binding with gadd45α mRNA, which increased gadd45α mRNA stability and protein expression, subsequently causing GADD45α-mediated cell death. On the other hand, ectopic expression of Mn-SOD attenuated the arsenite-generated superoxide radical level, abrogated nucleolin-SUMO, and in turn inhibited arsenite-induced apoptosis by reducing GADD45α expression. Collectively, our results for the first time demonstrate that nucleolin-SUMO at K294R plays a critical role in its nucleus sequestration and gadd45α mRNA binding activity. This novel biological function of nucleolin is distinct from its conventional role as a proto-oncogene. Therefore, our findings here not only reveal a new modification of nucleolin protein and its novel functional paradigm in mRNA metabolism but also expand our understanding of the dichotomous roles of nucleolin in terms of cancer development, which are dependent on multiple intracellular conditions and consequently the appropriate regulations of its modifications, including SUMOylation."
https://openalex.org/W2066864616,"Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) exert immune-modulatory effects and support tissue regeneration in various local trauma models. In case of a polytrauma, high amounts of danger-associated molecular patterns are released, leading to a systemic increase of inflammatory mediators. The influence of such a complex inflammatory microenvironment on human MSC is mainly unknown so far. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a defined serum-free polytrauma “cocktail” containing ILͳbeta, IL6, IL8 and the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, in concentrations corresponding to those measured in the blood of polytrauma patients, on human MSC in vitro. The polytrauma cocktail induced directed migration of MSC with C3a representing its major soluble chemoattractive agent. Furthermore, the polytrauma cocktail and IL1beta upregulated the expression of MMP1 indicating a potential role of IL1beta to enhance MSC migration in the tissue context. COX2, PTGES and TSG6 were also found to be upregulated upon stimulation with the polytrauma cocktail or IL1beta, but not through other single factors of the polytrauma cocktail in pathophysiologically relevant concentrations. An RNA expression array of 84 inflammation-related genes revealed that both the polytrauma cocktail and IL1beta induced C3, CSF1, TLR3 and various chemokines without major qualitative or quantitative differences. These results indicate that IL1beta is a crucial mediator of the polytrauma cocktail in terms of immune-modulation and MMP1 expression. Thus, upon encountering the primary sterile, inflammatory milieu of a polytrauma, endogenous or systemically transfused MSC might be able to migrate to sites of injury, secrete TSG6 and PGE2 and to influence macrophage biology as observed in local trauma models."
https://openalex.org/W2014389293,"TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) proteins are heat-activated nonselective cation channels. TRPV1 channels are polymodal in their function and exhibit multifaceted regulation with various molecular compounds. In this regard, phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, are important channel regulators. However, their effects on TRPV1 channel activity have not been conclusively determined. To characterize temperature-induced activation of TRPV1 in the presence of different phospholipids, we purified the TRPV1 protein from HEK-293 cells and incorporated it into planar lipid bilayers. In the presence of 2.5 μm phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, TRPV1 channels demonstrated rapid activation at 33–39 °C and achieved full channel opening at 42 °C. At this temperature range, TRPV1 heat activation exhibited steep temperature dependence (temperature coefficient (Q10) of 18), and the channel openings were accompanied by large changes in entropy and enthalpy, suggesting a substantial conformation change. At a similar temperature range, another phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, also potentiated heat activation of TRPV1, but with much lower efficiency. Negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol could also induce heat activation of TRPV1 channels, although with a small-conductance state. Our data demonstrate that phospholipids, specifically phosphoinositides, are important regulators of TRPV1 and are required for heat-induced channel activity."

We performed molecular analysis to investigate the potential role of SLC22A3 variants in CHD. Our study showed that the common polymorphism rs3088442 G→A, which is localized in the 3' UTR of the SLC22A3 gene, was associated with a decreased risk of CHD in the Chinese population by a case control study. In silico analysis indicated that G→A substitution of SNP rs3088442 created a putative binding site for miR-147 in the SLC22A3 mRNA. By overexpressing miR-147 or inhibiting endogenous miR-147, we demonstrated that SNP rs3088442 G→A recruited miR-147 to inhibit SLC22A3 expression. Moreover, SLC22A3 deficiency significantly decreased LPS-induced monocytic inflammatory response by interrupting NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades in a histamine-dependent manner. Notably, the expression of SLC22A3(A) was also suppressed by LPS stimulus. Our findings might indicate a negative feedback mechanism against inflammatory response by which SLC22A3 polymorphisms decreased the risk of CHD."

We have reported previously that carbonic anhydrase II augments transport activity of MCT1 and MCT4 by a noncatalytic mechanism, while leaving transport activity of MCT2 unaltered. In the present study, we combined electrophysiological measurements in Xenopus oocytes and pulldown experiments to analyze the direct interaction between carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) and MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4, respectively. Transport activity of MCT2-WT, which lacks a putative CAII-binding site, is not augmented by CAII. However, introduction of a CAII-binding site into the C terminus of MCT2 resulted in CAII-mediated facilitation of MCT2 transport activity. Interestingly, introduction of three glutamic acid residues alone was not sufficient to establish a direct interaction between MCT2 and CAII, but the cluster had to be arranged in a fashion that allowed access to the binding moiety in CAII. We further demonstrate that functional interaction between MCT4 and CAII requires direct binding of the enzyme to the acidic cluster 431EEE in the C terminus of MCT4 in a similar fashion as previously shown for binding of CAII to the cluster 489EEE in the C terminus of MCT1. In CAII, binding to MCT1 and MCT4 is mediated by a histidine residue at position 64. Taken together, our results suggest that facilitation of MCT transport activity by CAII requires direct binding between histidine 64 in CAII and a cluster of glutamic acid residues in the C terminus of the transporter that has to be positioned in surroundings that allow access to CAII.

Despite this importance, very little information is available describing how DAN family proteins effectively inhibit BMP ligands. Furthermore, our understanding for how differences in individual DAN family members arise, including affinity and specificity, remains underdeveloped. Here, we present the structure of the founding member of the DAN family, neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1).

Through a mutagenesis-based approach, we were able to correlate the BMP binding epitope in NBL1 with that in PRDC, where introduction of specific PRDC amino acids in NBL1 (A58F and S67Y) correlated with a gain-of-function inhibition toward BMP2 and BMP7, but not GDF5. Although NBL1S67Y was able to antagonize BMP7 as effectively as PRDC, NBL1S67Y was still 32-fold weaker than PRDC against BMP2.

https://openalex.org/W2007344355,"Transcription regulation emerged to be one of the key mechanisms in regulating autophagy. Inhibitors of H3K9 methylation activates the expression of LC3B, as well as other autophagy-related genes, and promotes autophagy process. However, the detailed mechanisms of autophagy regulated by nuclear factors remain elusive. In this study, we performed a drug screen of SMYD2-/- cells and discovered that SMYD2 deficiency enhanced the cell death induced by BIX01294, an inhibitor of histone H3K9 methylation. BIX-01294 induces accumulation of LC3 II and autophagy-related cell death, but not caspase-dependent apoptosis. We profiled the global gene expression pattern after treatment with BIX-01294, in comparison with rapamycin. BIX-01294 selectively activates the downstream genes of p53 signaling, such as p21 and DOR, but not PUMA, a typical p53 target gene inducing apoptosis. BIX-01294 also induces other autophagy-related genes, such as ATG4A and ATG9A. SMYD2 is a methyltransferase for p53 and regulates its transcription activity. Its deficiency enhances the BIX-01294-induced autophagy-related cell death through transcriptionally promoting the expression of p53 target genes. Taken together, our data suggest BIX-01294 induces autophagy-related cell death and selectively activates p53 target genes, which is repressed by SMYD2 methyltransferase."

https://openalex.org/W2021809195,"Mitotic SUMOylation has an essential role in faithful chromosome segregation in eukaryotes, although its molecular consequences are not yet fully understood. In Xenopus egg extract assays, we showed that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is modified by SUMO2/3 at mitotic centromeres and that its enzymatic activity could be regulated by SUMOylation. To determine the molecular consequence of mitotic SUMOylation, we analyzed SUMOylated PARP1-specific binding proteins. We identified Polo-like kinase 1-interacting checkpoint helicase (PICH) as an interaction partner of SUMOylated PARP1 in Xenopus egg extract. Interestingly, PICH also bound to SUMOylated topoisomerase IIα (TopoIIα), a major centromeric small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) substrate. Purified recombinant human PICH interacted with SUMOylated substrates, indicating that PICH directly interacts with SUMO, and this interaction is conserved among species. Further analysis of mitotic chromosomes revealed that PICH localized to the centromere independent of mitotic SUMOylation. Additionally, we found that PICH is modified by SUMO2/3 on mitotic chromosomes and in vitro. PICH SUMOylation is highly dependent on protein inhibitor of activated STAT, PIASy, consistent with other mitotic chromosomal SUMO substrates. Finally, the SUMOylation of PICH significantly reduced its DNA binding capability, indicating that SUMOylation might regulate its DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Collectively, our findings suggest a novel SUMO-mediated regulation of the function of PICH at mitotic centromeres. Background: Mitotic SUMOylation is critical for faithful chromosome segregation in eukaryotes. Results: PICH (Plk1-interacting checkpoint helicase) is a SUMO-interacting protein and a mitotic SUMO substrate. Conclusion: PICH can be regulated by binding to SUMOylated proteins and through its own SUMOylation at mitotic centromeres. Significance: The regulation of PICH by SUMO interaction and SUMOylation reveals a novel role for mitotic SUMOylation in centromeric chromatin organization."

Therefore the amount of any subunit of a heterologous enzyme complex has to be tightly regulated. This can be achieved on the levels of transcription and translation, as well as on the level of proteolysis. Fatty acid synthase is one of the household enzymes of the cell responsible for the de novo synthesis of fatty acids. In yeast it is an enzyme complex of 2.6 MDa composed of six subunits each of two different subunit species, α (Fas2) and β (Fas1). The respective genes FAS1 and FAS2 are unlinked and map on two different chromosomes. Fas1 and Fas2 expression is regulated by several transcriptional activators, as well as by Fas1-mediated autoregulation of Fas2 (4.Burkl G. Castorph H. Schweizer E.

Rabbit Cdc48 antibody was a gift from T. Sommer. Fas2 protein transfer from SDS gel to nitrocellulose was done by wet tank blotting at 200 mA for 3–4 h on ice with prechilled blotting buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% (v/v) methanol, 0.02% (w/v) SDS). Pulse-chase experiments to analyze the degradation of orphan Fas2 were performed as described (18.Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H.

Briefly, cells were grown to mid-log phase in YPD+FA media or in selective YCM+FA (for plasmid selection) media and shifted to starvation media (nonselective or selective CM+FA, without sulfate) for 50 min. 10 A600 of cells were labeled with 20 μl of [35S]methionine (0.37 MBq/μl; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min. Temperature-sensitive strains were grown at 25 °C and shifted to 37 °C, 10 min before radioactive labeling. Upon addition of fatty acid supplemented medium containing an excess of nonradioactive methionine, samples were taken at the indicated time points, and cell extracts were prepared. When not otherwise indicated, plotted data represent the mean values of three independent experiments. The error bars represent the respective standard deviation of the mean. Cycloheximide-chase experiments for monitoring the degradation of orphan Fas2 were performed as described by Park et al. (20.Park S.H. Bolender N. Eisele F. Kostova Z. Takeuchi J. Coffino P.

Cell. 2007; 18: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with the exception that cells were grown in fatty acid supplemented yeast peptone dextrose media (YPD + FA). For detection of ubiquitinated Fas2, 50 A600 of cells of each yeast strain transformed with a His6-Ub expressing plasmid were harvested and resuspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). After lysis using glass beads, the cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. 100 μl of washed Ni-NTA-agarose 4The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPGK3-phosphoglycerate kinase. (Qiagen) were added to each lysate. After 3 h of incubation, the beads were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 1 min and washed two times with lysis buffer and in addition three times with washing buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Proteins were eluted by adding 100 μl of urea sample buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and boiling at 80 °C for 10 min. Each supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE with subsequent immunoblotting. nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. To analyze the solubility of Fas2 substrate in different yeast strains, 20 A600 of exponentially grown cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of sorbitol buffer (0.7 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 1 mm PMSF, and 1.46 μm pepstatin A. Temperature-sensitive strains were shifted to 37 °C for 1 h prior to harvesting. After addition of glass beads, the cells were lysed by vortexing for 15 min at 4 °C. The crude lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. For preparation of the total protein sample (T), 400 μl of the precleared lysate were subjected to TCA precipitation. The pellet was washed once with acetone and solubilized in 60 μl of urea sample buffer (8 m urea, 5% SDS, 200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 1.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) by boiling at 95 °C for 5 min. In addition 400 μl of the crude lysate were centrifuged for 15 min at 21,500 × g. The supernatant fraction (S) was treated like the total protein fraction. The pellet fraction (P) was washed once in sorbitol buffer prior to solubilization in 60 μl of urea sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. All samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Chromosomally C-terminal TAP-tagged Fas2 was purified using Sepharose beads coated with IgGs (IgG SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow, GE Healthcare). When not otherwise indicated, all steps were carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, 150 A600 of exponentially grown cells (A600 1.0) were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with, and incubated for 15 min in 40 ml of 30 mm ice-cold sodium azide on ice. Subsequently, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 2 ml of cold extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 1 mm PMSF, 1.46 μm pepstatin A), and lysed by glass bead beating. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min and retrieved supernatant again centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentration of the obtained supernatant was determined by Bradford assay and if required adjusted with cold extraction buffer. Pellet fraction was washed twice with cold extraction buffer and boiled for 5 min in urea sample buffer, and 0.5% was loaded onto SDS gel. A portion of supernatant proteins were precipitated by TCA and boiled in urea sample buffer, and 0.5% was loaded as input control. For tandem affinity purification-immunoprecipitation (TAP-IP), 1 ml of supernatant was added to 100 μl of equilibrated IgG Sepharose beads and incubated for 3 h on a rotator. Beads were collected and washed three times with 1 ml of cold extraction buffer and two times with 1 ml of cold TEV cleavage buffer (same as extraction buffer but contained in addition 0.01 mm ZnCl2 and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol but only 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Beads were mixed with 100 μl of TEV cleavage buffer plus 3 μl of TEV protease (Roboklon, 8 units/μl) and incubated with gentle agitation for 2 h at 16 °C. Cleaved proteins were collected, precipitated by TCA on ice, washed once with ice-cold acetone, boiled for 5 min in urea sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. Elution of IgG-bound Fas2-TAP, shown in Fig. 4B, was done by boiling IgG beads directly in urea sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. This assay was adapted from Finger et al. (21.Finger A. Knop M.

Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) Briefly, 10 A600 of exponentially grown cells were collected by centrifugation, washed two times with cold water, and lysed with 600 μl of cold cytosolic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 14% glycerol, 100 mm KOAc, and 2 mm MgOAc and 400 μl of glass beads for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min (4 °C), 400 μl of the supernatant was equally split into two Eppendorf tubes. To one tube, trypsin was added at a concentration of 7 μg/μl. The tube without trypsin served as negative control. During incubation at 30 °C, samples were taken (45 μl) at the indicated time points; proteins were immediately TCA-precipitated on ice and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using respective antibodies. 50 A600 of cells were grown to log phase, collected by centrifugation, and washed once with 20 ml of cold water. Cells were resuspended in 520 μl of cold 0.1 m KH2P04/K2HP04 buffer (pH 6.9), 280 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 10 μl of 0.1 m PMSF, and 10 μl of 1.45 mm pepstatin A. After addition of 300 μl of glass beads, cells were lysed by vortexing for 20 min at 4 °C. After preclearing at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, lysate was spun down at 16,200 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. 200 μl of the supernatant was layered on top of a 2-ml linear 10–50% glycerol gradient, which was prepared in 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8. The sample was centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 4 h at 15 °C in a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge using a TLS55 rotor. Fractions of 170 μl were collected from the top, and proteins were precipitated with TCA on ice and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Fatty acid synthase complex, Cdc48, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase served as molecular weight marker proteins. Yeast strains expressing endogenous Fas2-EGFP were grown to early-log phase (A600 0.3) in yeast peptone dextrose media. Fatty acid auxotrophic strain Δfas1 was grown in fatty acid supplemented yeast peptone dextrose media. Three A600 of cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with, and resuspended in 2 ml of PBS buffer (75 mm NaCl, 53 mm Na2HPO4, 13 mm NaH2HPO4). For nuclei staining, 2 μl of Hoechst 33342 (10 mg/ml) was added to the cell suspension and incubated with slight agitation in the dark for 25 min at 30 °C. For cell fixation, 1 ml of the cell suspension was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, and 121 μl of 37% formaldehyde was added (drop by drop) at a final concentration of 4% and incubated in the dark for additional 40 min at 30 °C on a rotator. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with 1 ml and concentrated in 50 μl of IF buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 100 mm KH2P04/K2HP04, pH 6.5). 2 μl of fixed cells were mounted with Mowiol on a microscope slide, covered by a cover slide, and sealed with nail polish. To visualize Hoechst 33432-stained nuclei and Fas2-EGFP by confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM710; Carl Zeiss) fluorophores were excited according to their excitation wavelength with an argon laser (488 nm). Analysis of the obtained data and imaging were performed by AxioVision Rel. 4.8.2 software (Carl Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop CS. Respective yeast strains with untagged Fas2 served as negative control. To be able to follow the fate of an orphan Fas2 protein easily we deleted the FAS1 gene in cells. This left Fas2 as an orphan protein expressed from its wild type gene. The physiological consequence of this deletion, failure to synthesize saturated fatty acids, and thus cessation of growth of cells, was circumvented by the addition of myristic acid and Tween 40 to the growth medium (7.Egner R. Thumm M. Straub M. Simeon A. Schüller H.J. Wolf D.H. Tracing intracellular proteolytic pathways: proteolysis of fatty acid synthase and other cytoplasmic proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27269-27276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a first experiment, we tested the proteinase sensitivity of orphan Fas2 in comparison with the assembled (Fas1)6 (Fas2)6 complex in cell extracts. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, while the hexameric (Fas1)6 (Fas2)6 complex remains stable, orphan Fas2 is rapidly degraded when trypsin is added to cell extracts. This shows an enhanced sensitivity of the orphan protein as compared with its presence in the complex toward proteolysis, suggesting an altered structure of the orphan protein. Subsequently, we followed the fate of Fas2 in vivo via cycloheximide-chase analysis. As shown previously, in contrast to its stability in the assembled hexameric (Fas1)6(Fas2)6 complex (7.Egner R. Thumm M. Straub M. Simeon A. Schüller H.J. Wolf D.H. Tracing intracellular proteolytic pathways: proteolysis of fatty acid synthase and other cytoplasmic proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27269-27276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Fas2 is degraded with a half-life of ∼2 h when its partner Fas1 is missing (Fig. 1B). The fact that this degradation is due to the proteasome, a multimeric proteinase complex (23.Tomko Jr., R.J. Hochstrasser M. Molecular architecture and assembly of the eukaryotic proteasome.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 415-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 24.Wolf D.H. Hilt W. The proteasome: a proteolytic nanomachine of cell regulation and waste disposal.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), was tested using a conditional mutant (cim3-1) defective in the ATPase subunit Rpt6 of the proteasome regulatory particle (25.Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. S. cerevisiae 26S protease mutants arrest cell division in G2/metaphase.Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Orphan Fas2 is nearly completely stabilized in the proteasome mutant cells (Fig. 1B). In wild type cells, the 2.6-MDa fatty acid synthase complex consists of six copies each of Fas1 of 229-kDa mass and Fas2 of 207-kDa mass forming a barrel shape complex. The six Fas2 subunits are organized in a wheel-like structure covered by three Fas1 subunits each above and below the wheel in an axial orientation (26.Lomakin I.B. Xiong Y. Steitz T.A. The crystal structure of yeast fatty acid synthase, a cellular machine with eight active sites working together.Cell. 2007; 129: 319-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The question arose if the Fas2 subunit would still assemble into the wheel-like hexamer of 1.2 MDa in the absence of its partner Fas1 or if unassembled orphan Fas2 subunits of 207 kDa would remain. For this purpose, glycerol step gradient centrifugation with cell extracts of wild type and FAS1 deleted cells was performed (Fig. 2A). As can be seen, the wild type Fas complex is localized in a fraction on the bottom of the gradient. In contrast, orphan Fas2 sedimented in several fractions above the bottom fraction of 2.6 MDa. The Fas2 protein band with highest density resided below the band of highest density of Cdc48 with its molecular mass of 540 kDa. No major 207-kDa Fas2 fraction was found in the range of the marker protein glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase of 240-kDa mass. Thus, orphan Fas2 does not sediment as a single subunit but as a complex in the range between 2.6 MDa and 540 kDa instead, indicating that it may form the 1.2-MDa wheel-like structure or some other high molecular mass complex. For most proteasomal degradation of protein complexes or membrane-associated proteins, the molecular ATPase motor Cdc48 is required, which pulls the entities apart prior to degradation (27.Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Cdc48 (p97): a “molecular gearbox” in the ubiquitin pathway?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 28.Stolz A. Hilt W. Buchberger A. Wolf D.H. Cdc48: a power machine in protein degradation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the involvement of Cdc48 in the degradation of orphan Fas2. Indeed, when following the fate of orphan Fas2 in a conditional Cdc48 mutant (allele cdc48(T413R)) (29.Barbin L. Eisele F. Santt O. Wolf D.H. The Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex is central in ubiquitin-proteasome triggered catabolite degradation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 394: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it can be seen that it is not any more degraded to a considerable extent (Fig. 2B). Next we raised the question of whether Cdc48 acts after or before some ubiquitination event of Fas2. Therefore we performed an ubiquitination assay using a strain containing a temperature-sensitive CDC48 allele. We could not detect any difference in ubiquitination of Fas2 after the switch to the restrictive temperature, indicating an involvement of Cdc48 downstream of ubiquitination of Fas2 (Fig. 2C). Obviously Fas2 is ubiquitinated prior to proteasomal degradation. Proteasomal degradation of a protein in most cases requires polyubiquitination brought about by an enzyme system consisting of an ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2, and an ubiquitin ligase E3 (30.Ciechanover A.

Here we studied in detail the membrane binding properties and protein/protein interactions that govern the assembly of the membrane-associated Spir·FMN complex. Using biomimetic membrane models we show that binding of the C-terminal Spir-2 FYVE-type zinc finger involves both the presence of negatively charged lipids and hydrophobic contributions from the turret loop that intrudes the lipid bilayer. In solution, we uncovered a yet unknown intramolecular interaction between the Spir-2 FYVE-type domain and the N-terminal kinase non-catalytic C-lobe domain (KIND) that could not be detected in the membrane-bound state. Interestingly, we found that the intramolecular Spir-2 FYVE/KIND and the trans-regulatory Fmn-2-FSI/Spir-2-KIND interactions are competitive. We therefore characterized co-expressed Spir-2 and Fmn-2 fluorescent protein fusions in living cells by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. The data corroborate a model according to which Spir-2 exists in two different states, a cytosolic monomeric conformation and a membrane-bound state in which the KIND domain is released and accessible for subsequent Fmn-2 recruitment. This sequence of interactions mechanistically couples membrane binding of Spir to the recruitment of FMN, a pivotal step for initiating actin nucleation at vesicular membranes.

This sequence of interactions mechanistically couples membrane binding of Spir to the recruitment of FMN, a pivotal step for initiating actin nucleation at vesicular membranes. The multiple cellular functions of the dynamic actin cytoskeleton are achieved by targeting actin nucleator complexes at distinct subcellular sites to locally initiate the polymerization of filaments. The organization and regulation of cortical actin at the cell membrane have been extensively studied (1.Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Actin, a central player in cell shape and movement.Science. 2009; 326: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). However, up to now, the molecular mechanisms of cytoskeletal organization at intracellular, vesicular membranes are still poorly characterized. Proteins of the Spir family are cytoskeletal organizers at the crossroad of actin and vesicle processes (2.Dietrich S. Weiß S. Pleiser S. Kerkhoff E.

In mouse oocytes, Spir-1 and Spir-2 proteins cooperate with formin-2 (Fmn-2; FMN subgroup of formins) in the generation of a dynamic actin meshwork, which is thought to originate from the surface of vesicles (3.Pfender S.

Besides a function in actin-dependent long range vesicle transport in oocytes, a role of Spir proteins in exocytic vesicle transport and in transport processes beyond early endosomes was described in somatic cells (7.Kerkhoff E.

In all cell types characterized so far, Spir proteins highly colocalize with Rab11, indicating a close functional relationship of the actin organizer and the small G protein of the Ras superfamily. Rab11 is localized at the trans-Golgi network, post-Golgi vesicles, and recycling endosome and is thought to be a master regulator in the orchestration of cell surface proteins such as growth factor receptors, ion channels, and cell adhesion proteins (9.Welz T. Wellbourne-Wood J. Kerkhoff E. Orchestration of cell surface proteins by Rab11.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). On a molecular level, Spir proteins were shown to interact with FMN-type formins and regulate each other in a mutual fashion (10.Quinlan M.E. Hilgert S. Bedrossian A. Mullins R.D. Kerkhoff E. Regulatory interactions between two actin nucleators, Spire and Cappuccino.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In vitro, Spir proteins alone cannot nucleate the polymerization of profilin-bound actin, which is thought to be the major source for actin filament polymerization in cells (1.Pollard T.D.

However, the Spir·FMN complex is a very potent nucleator of profilin/actin (12.Montaville P. Jégou A. Pernier J. Compper C. Guichard B. Mogessie B. Schuh M. Romet-Lemonne G. Carlier M.F. Spire and Formin 2 synergize and antagonize in regulating actin assembly in meiosis by a ping-pong mechanism.PLoS Biol. 2014; 12: e1001795Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The in vitro data are confirmed by findings in oocytes showing that the vesicle-originated cytoplasmic actin meshwork cannot be formed by one of the nucleators alone but requires the cooperative action of both Spir and Fmn-2 (3.Pfender S.

The cooperation is conserved between mammals and flies as the Drosophila Spir protein and Drosophila FMN-family protein Cappuccino also cooperate in building an oocytic actin meshwork during fly oogenesis (13.Dahlgaard K. Raposo A.A. Niccoli T. St Johnston D.

Direct interaction between two actin nucleators is required in Drosophila oogenesis.Development. 2013; 140: 4417-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The physical interaction of Spir and FMN proteins is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved formin/Spir interaction (FSI) sequence at the C terminus of FMN-type formins and involves the N-terminal kinase non-catalytic C-lobe domain (KIND) of Spir (15.Pechlivanis M.

The complex crystal structure disclosed a large interface of positively charged residues of the formin-2 FSI sequence mediating contacts to an acidic groove at the surface of the Spir-1-KIND domain (18.Zeth K.

The introduction of a positive charge into the acidic groove of the KIND domain (human Spir-1 Y134K and Drosophila Spir Y232K mutations) strongly impaired the Spir/formin interaction in vitro (18.Zeth K. Pechlivanis M. Samol A. Pleiser S. Vonrhein C. Kerkhoff E.

Transgenic expression of Drosophila Spir Y232K mutant protein in flies having a spir mutant background failed to rescue the oocytic actin meshwork (14.Quinlan M.E. Direct interaction between two actin nucleators is required in Drosophila oogenesis.Development. 2013; 140: 4417-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Direct physical interaction of Spir and the formin Cappuccino is therefore required to build up the oocytic actin mesh during fly oogenesis (14.Quinlan M.E. Direct interaction between two actin nucleators is required in Drosophila oogenesis.Development. 2013; 140: 4417-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Targeting of Spir proteins toward vesicle membranes and the assembly of an active membrane-bound Spir·FMN actin nucleator complex can be regarded as essential steps in the regulation of Spir functions. The localization of Spir proteins at intracellular membranes is mediated by a C-terminal FYVE-type zinc finger membrane interaction module, a structural domain that is typically found in proteins involved in membrane trafficking (7.Kerkhoff E. Simpson J.C. Leberfinger C.B. Otto I.M. Doerks T. Bork P. Rapp U.R. Raabe T. Pepperkok R. The Spir actin organizers are involved in vesicle transport processes.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1963-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). FYVE zinc fingers comprise eight cysteine residues, which bind two zinc ions (20.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. Endosomal localization of the autoantigen EEA1 is mediated by a zinc-binding FYVE finger.J. Biol.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate recognition and membrane docking by the FYVE domain.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The structure forms a hydrophobic “turret loop,” which penetrates the membrane (22.Misra S. Hurley J.H. Crystal structure of a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-specific membrane-targeting motif, the FYVE domain of Vps27p.Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 23.Dumas J.J.

Cell. 2001; 8: 947-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A second hallmark of canonical FYVE domain proteins such as EEA1 or the yeast VPS27 proteins is its specific interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, a key component in the integration of cell signaling cascades and vesicle transport processes (24.Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. FYVE fingers bind PtdIns(3)P.Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 25.Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Phosphatidylinositol(3)-phosphate signaling mediated by specific binding to RING FYVE domains.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The Spir FYVE-type domain is different from the canonical FYVE domain in that it lacks the conserved phosphoinositide-binding motifs and has an insertion loop between cysteines 6 and 7 of the FYVE consensus sequence (7.Kerkhoff E. Simpson J.C. Leberfinger C.B. Otto I.M. Doerks T. Bork P. Rapp U.R. Raabe T. Pepperkok R. The Spir actin organizers are involved in vesicle transport processes.Curr.

Biol. 2000; 10: 345-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Other FYVE-type zinc finger proteins have been identified that also share with the canonical FYVE domains the two zinc ion complexing centers and the hydrophobic turret loop but lack the consensus sequences forming the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding pocket. Members of this group are the Rab3 small G protein effectors Rim1, Rim2, Rabphilin-3A, and Noc2 and the Rab11 effector protrudin (27.Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15373-15380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Lipid interaction studies of the protrudin FYVE-type domain revealed that the membrane binding domain preferentially binds phosphatidylinositol bis- and trisphosphates but not monophosphates as the canonical FYVE domains do (29.Gil J.E. Kim E. Kim I.S. Ku B. Park W.S. Oh B.H. Ryu S.H. Cho W. Heo W.D. Phosphoinositides differentially regulate protrudin localization through the FYVE domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 41268-41276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Until now, membrane binding characteristics of the Spir FYVE-type domains have not been addressed. In our aim to understand how the Spir/FMN actin nucleators assemble site-specifically into a functional complex, we investigated the membrane and protein interactions of the Spir-2 FYVE-type domain. Experiments using biomimetic membrane systems showed that the Spir-2 FYVE-type domain promiscuously interacts with negatively charged lipids. Intriguingly, we discovered an interaction of the Spir-2 FYVE-type zinc finger with the N-terminal Spir-2-KIND domain, which could not be detected at membranes. Based on data showing that the full-length Spir-2 protein is a monomer in the cytosol and only weakly interacts with Fmn-2 when released from membranes, we propose a model according to which Spir-2 exists in two different states, a cytosolic backfolded monomer and a membrane-bound state in which the KIND domain is released and accessible for subsequent formin-2 recruitment. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression vectors were generated by standard cloning techniques using Pfu polymerase (Fermentas), restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs), and T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Point mutants were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Stratagene). The sequence of the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing (MWG-Biotech/Eurofins). A description of all constructs used in this study is given in Table 1. Prokaryotic glutathione S-transferase (GST)- and His6-AcGFP-tagged constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3) pLysS/BL21(DE3) pLysS. Bacteria were grown in LB (100 mg/liter ampicillin and 30 mg/liter chloramphenicol) at 37 °C up to an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Recombinant protein expression was induced by 100–300 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and continued at 18–20 °C for 20 h. Bacteria were harvested and lysed by ultrasonication, and soluble proteins were purified using an ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare) using GSH-Sepharose HP-, Ni-NTA FF, Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen), GSH-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare), and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex G200 16/60, GE Healthcare). GST tags were cleaved where indicated by tobacco etch virus protease. Protein concentration was increased by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-4 ultracentrifugation devices with respective molecular weight cutoffs (Millipore).

The proteins were diluted to 100 μm, and the dye (Alexa Fluor 647 C2-maleimide (Invitrogen)) was solved in DMSO and then diluted in PBS. An excess of 5–7 times of the dye was used for the labeling reaction. The reaction took place for 2 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The excess dye was quenched with 2 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature. The non-reacted dye was removed by extensive dialysis (cutoff, 10 kDa) against PBS. The efficiency was determined by absorption measurements and was in the range of 85–98%. HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCSIII, HyClone), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HEK 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding eGFP-tagged constructs by use of LipofectamineTM/Lipofectamine2000TM (Invitrogen). 24 h post-transfection cells were lysed for 40 min in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min to remove insoluble debris. Supernatant was incubated with 50 μg of GST fusion protein coupled to 40 μl of GSH-Sepharose 4B beads (1:1 suspension) for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were washed six times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm dithioerythritol). Bound proteins were eluted by 1× SDS sample buffer and denatured for 10 min at 95 °C. For competition experiments, 5 μm purified Fmn-2-eFSI peptide and Fmn-2-eFSI-K1571A mutant peptide, respectively, was preincubated with GST-Spir-2-KIND coupled to GSH beads for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Subsequent pulldowns were performed as described above. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-eGFP antibody (Aequorea victoria Living Colors®, rabbit polyclonal, 1 μg/ml; Clontech) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000; GE Healthcare) using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, GE Healthcare). The ECL signal was recorded with an ImageQuant LAS4000 system (GE Healthcare). GUVs were prepared by the electroformation method (30.Angelova M.I. Dimitrov D.S. Liposome electroformation.Faraday Discuss. 1986; 81: 303Crossref Google Scholar). Lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids or Sirius Fine Chemicals SiChem and dissolved in chloroform, but phosphoinositides were dissolved in 1:2:0.8 CHCl3:MeOH:H2O. In brief, 5 μl of lipid mixture (1 mg/ml) was spread onto two platinum wire electrodes. After drying the lipid film, the electrodes with the lipid films were placed into a chamber containing 300 mm sucrose solution. Platinum wires were connected to a power generator. Electroformation was performed at 10 Hz and 2.3 V for 1 h at room temperature. The GUVs were released from the electrodes by changing the frequency to 2 Hz for 30 min. 50 μl of GUVs were sedimented in 150 μl of TBS buffer containing up to 200 nm His6-AcGFP-Spir-2-ΔKWL or His6-AcGFP. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, protein binding to the GUVs was analyzed by confocal microscopy. The LUV flotation assay was performed according to Höfer et al. (31.Höfer C.T. Herrmann A. Müller P. Use of liposomes for studying interactions of soluble proteins with cellular membranes.Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 606: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Solutions of 25 and 75% sucrose were prepared in 1× TBS buffer. For the preparation of LUVs, a lipid suspension in 1× TBS was subjected to eight freeze-thaw cycles and extruded 19 times through a 100-nm-diameter polycarbonate filter (Avanti Polar Lipids) using a Mini-Extrud"

https://openalex.org/W2068082435,"Rho GTPases are molecular switches that modulate a variety of cellular processes, most notably those involving actin dynamics. We have previously shown that yeast vacuolar membrane fusion requires re-organization of actin filaments mediated by two Rho GTPases, Rho1p and Cdc42p. Cdc42p initiates actin polymerization to facilitate membrane tethering; Rho1p has a role in the late stages of vacuolar fusion, but its mode of action is unknown. Here, we identified eEF1A as a vacuolar Rho1p-interacting protein. eEF1A (encoded by the TEF1 and TEF2 genes in yeast) is an aminoacyl-tRNA transferase needed during protein translation. eEF1A also has a second function that is independent of translation; it binds and organizes actin filaments into ordered cable structures. Here, we report that eEF1A interacts with Rho1p via a C-terminal subdomain. This interaction occurs predominantly when both proteins are in the GDP-bound state. Therefore, eEF1A is an atypical downstream effector of Rho1p. eEF1A does not promote vacuolar fusion; however, overexpression of the Rho1p-interacting subdomain affects vacuolar morphology. Vacuoles were destabilized and prone to leakage when treated with the eEF1A inhibitor narciclasine. We propose a model whereby eEF1A binds to Rho1p-GDP on the vacuolar membrane; it is released upon Rho1p activation and then bundles actin filaments to stabilize fused vacuoles. Therefore, the Rho1p-eEF1A complex acts to spatially localize a pool of eEF1A to vacuoles where it can readily organize F-actin.

Rho GTPases regulate cellular processes involving membrane dynamics such as cell polarity, mobility, endocytosis, and intracellular vesicular trafficking. They exert many of their functions by modulating membrane-associated actin dynamics (1.Ridley A.J.

Once activated, Rho GTPases recruit downstream effectors, creating membrane-bound signaling complexes where actin dynamics are stimulated and membrane remodeling occurs (1.Ridley A.J.

Rho GTPase activity is down-regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate GTP hydrolysis. Some Rho family proteins can also be dissociated from membrane by binding to RhoGDI (Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor), which sequesters the isoprenyl group in a hydrophobic pocket creating soluble 1:1 complexes (5.Michaelson D.

RhoA (Rho1p in S. cerevisiae) activates Diaphanous-related formins (Bni1p/Bnr1p in S. cerevisiae), which in turn stimulate the nucleation and elongation of nonbranching actin filaments (8.Chesarone M.A. DuPage A.G.

We have used yeast vacuolar membranes to study Rho GTPase/actin-mediated modulation of membrane dynamics during vesicular transport and membrane fusion (9.Wickner W.

Cdc42p is rapidly activated during in vitro fusion reactions and stimulates the rapid polymerization of actin (11.Eitzen G. Thorngren N. Wickner W.

Cdc42p and Rho1p are sequentially activated and mechanistically linked to vacuole membrane fusion.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 394: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rho1p activation kinetically coincides with fusion kinetics; however, further understanding of the action of Rho1p remains unknown. Identifying interacting partners during fusion reactions may provide some insights into this question. Therefore, our aim here was to identify vacuolar Rho1p-binding partners that could potentially be involved in actin remodeling-coupled membrane fusion. In this study, we found that translation elongation factor 1-α (eEF1A or Tef1p in S. cerevisiae) was present in low abundance on isolated vacuoles and associated with Rho1p. eEF1A is a highly abundant cytosolic protein encoded by two sequence-redundant genes, TEF1 and TEF2. eEF1A is a GTPase component of the eukaryotic elongation factor complex (15.Andersen G.R. Nissen P. Nyborg J. Elongation factors in protein biosynthesis.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 434-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the GTP-bound active form, eEF1A binds to and delivers aminoacylated tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes for elongation of nascent polypeptides. The ribosome acts as a GTPase activator (GAP) for eEF1A when a correct codon-anticodon match occurs between the aminoacyl-tRNA and the A-site codon of the ribosome-bound mRNA. The inactive GDP-bound form of eEF1A is released from the ribosome and can be reactivated by its GEF, eEF1Bα, before binding another aminoacyl-tRNA. Intriguingly, eEF1A is a multifunctional protein which, beyond its canonical role in translation elongation, also functions in various cellular processes, including nuclear export and F-actin remodeling (16.Mateyak M.K.

Current models propose that eEF1A is a key factor in regulating cytoskeleton organization by creating tightly packed F-actin cables. Here, we identified eEF1A as a binding partner of Rho1p on yeast vacuolar membranes. The Rho1p-eEF1A interaction likely has functional implication in regulating actin remodeling coupled to vacuolar fusion because actin is enriched at the “vertex ring” of membranes during vacuolar docking, and actin remodeling is required for the terminal step leading to vacuolar membrane fusion (10.Eitzen G.

Therefore, we hypothesize that eEF1A is recruited to vacuoles from the cytosol by Rho1p and may mediate Rho1p signaling for actin reorganization. Here, we characterized the Rho1p-eEF1A interaction, including the binding specificity, the putative binding site, the regulation of interaction, and the functional implication of eEF1A in vacuolar fusion.

Strains with C-terminal 3×HA-tagged eEF1A were constructed by integration of a PCR product generated from pFA6a-3HA-His3MX6 (27.Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A.

Additional modules for versatile and economical PCR-based deletion and modification in Sacchormyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Strains harboring plasmids with N-terminal GFP-tagged and 7×HA-tagged eEF1A (full length and domains) were generated by drop and drag cloning using the plasmids pGREG536 and pGREG576, respectively, and transformed into strain BJ5459 (28.Jansen G. Wu C. Schade B. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Drag & Drop cloning in yeast.Gene. 2005; 344: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Strains were grown at 30 °C in YPDG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1% dextrose, 1% galactose) or YPDG with 40 μg/ml kanamycin for strains harboring plasmids. All tagged eEF1A proteins were expressed in a background that also contained the endogenous proteins. Therefore, it was not determined whether tagged proteins were fully functional. Yeast lysates were prepared by suspending cells in lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1× PIC, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and passing the suspension through an emulsiflex C-3 (Avestin) for 5 min at 25,000 p.s.i. The emulsion was cleared by centrifugation for 45 min at 4 °C and 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. Typical cytosol protein concentrations were 15 mg/ml.TABLE 1S. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceKTY1Matα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, pep4::kanMX, prb1::LEU213.Jones L.

Open table in a new tab GST- and MBP-tagged proteins were cloned by amplifying open reading frames from genomic DNA and ligating fragments into pGEX-4T1 (GE Healthcare) and pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs), respectively. Cdc42p and Rho1p were cloned without the four C-terminal amino acids (−CAAX box, where A is any aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid). Full-length eEF1A was cloned as an MBP fusion protein because the GST fusion protein was insoluble. GST and MBP proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta cells (Novagen) in LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. 1-Liter cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.4–0.6, cooled to room temperature, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (0.5 mm final) to induce protein expression. After 5 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g, washed once in distilled water, and suspended in 20 ml of H-Buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1× PIC). Cells were lysed by running the suspension through an emulsiflex C-3 for 5 min at 15,000 p.s.i. After emulsification, Triton X-100 was added to 0.5% (v/v), and the emulsion was centrifuged for 45 min at 4 °C and 20,000 × g. GST-tagged and MBP-tagged proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) or amylose resin (New England Biolabs), and 15 μl of packed beads were used in pulldown assays. Elution of GST-tagged proteins was in 3 volumes of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 10 mm reduced glutathione; elution of MBP-tagged proteins was in 3 volumes of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm maltose. Protein samples were buffer-exchanged into desired buffers using a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare). Soluble extracts from E. coli strains expressing recombinant proteins were incubated with 15 μl of glutathione or amylose resin per reaction. The resin was washed three times with H-Buffer, and 2 mg of target protein lysate was incubated for 90 min at 4 °C in a total volume of 0.8 ml. The beads were then washed three times with H-Buffer, suspended in 1.2× SSB (72 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2.4% SDS, 12% glycerol, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.012% bromphenol blue), and heated 5 min at 95 °C before being analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. For immunoprecipitation of GFP-eEF1A, 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose resin (Pierce) was incubated with 30 μl of rabbit anti-GFP serum. Antibodies were cross-linked to the resin in 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.8, 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate. The resin was then pre-stripped with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, followed by three washes in H-Buffer. 1 mg of whole cell lysate or 50 μg of vacuoles was added to 15 μl of normal rabbit IgG beads (nonspecific) in 1 ml and nutated for 30 min at 4 °C. The pre-cleared reactions were added to 15 μl of GFP-specific beads and nutated for 2 h at 4 °C. After immunoprecipitation, beads were washed three times with H-Buffer and then eluted using 40 μl of cold 2× SSB without β-mercaptoethanol. 20 μl of 10% β-mercaptoethanol was added before boiling samples for 5 min at 95 °C. 1 mg of resin-bound MBP-Rho1p was used as an affinity ligand to bind Rho1p-interacting proteins from 0.5 mg of detergent-solubilized vacuoles that were preincubated in cytosol and fusion reaction buffer. Interacting proteins were eluted with 10 mm EDTA, run on SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and compared with eluates from resin-bound MBP eluates or mock reactions without vacuoles (−-vac). Unique bands were excised from the gel, and in-gel digestion was performed using an automated MassPREP station. The gel samples were reduced in 10 mm DTT, alkylated in 50 mm iodoacetamide, followed by overnight digestion at 37 °C with 10 ng/ml trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. Peptides were extracted, and nanospray liquid chromatography MS/MS was performed to determine peptide sequence using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to a CapLC capillary HPLC and a nanoelectrospray source (Waters, Milford, MA). Peak lists were developed using a Mascot Distiller (version 1.1.1.0), and the appearance of three or more unique peptide sequences from one protein was used for its identification. At least five specific peptides of 10 or more amino acids were identified for each protein representing at least 15% coverage. Resin-bound GST-Rho1p or MBP-Rho1p was washed three times in H-Buffer without MgCl2. EDTA was added to 3 mm, and GTPγS or GDP was added to 40 μm. Samples were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C, then MgCl2 was added to 10 mm. The resin was washed three times with H-Buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 before incubation with yeast lysates. eEF1A-GFP target lysates were similarly nucleotide-exchanged and then diluted 5-fold in H-Buffer with MgCl2. Immunoblots were scanned and quantified on an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor). Bands of both GST-Rho1p or MBP-Rho1p and eEF1A-GFP were quantified using densitometry software in Odyssey version 1.2. eEF1A-GFP band levels were normalized to the 10% load band. These values were then divided by their corresponding GST, GST-Rho1p or MBP, MBP-Rho1p band value. Nonspecific binding of eEF1A-GFP to GST and MBP was subtracted from the specific binding values. 100% binding levels were set as the binding when no additional proteins or drugs were added. Yeast membranes were isolated from lysates by 100,000 × g centrifugation. Membranes were further analyzed by sucrose density centrifugation using linear gradients of 5–50% sucrose in PS buffer. Yeast vacuoles were purified by flotation on Ficoll density gradients essentially as described previously (29.Haas A. A quantitative assay to measure homotypic fusion in vitro.Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Vacuole fusion assays were done in fusion reaction buffer (FRB: 20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol, 125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm coenzyme A, 1× PIC), and contained 3.5 μg of vacuoles from strains KTY1 and KTY2, an ATG-regenerating system (ATG-regenerating system = 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/ml creatine kinase) and 0.5 mg/ml cytosol with test substances as indicated. Fusion reactions were incubated for 90 min at 27 °C. Levels of activated alkaline phosphatase were assayed, which are indicative of the level of membrane fusion. Vacuole-associated actin polymerization assays were performed as described previously (12.Isgandarova S. Jones L. Forsberg D. Loncar A. Dawson J. Tedrick K. Eitzen G.

For live cell microscopy, overnight cultures were grown in minimal media and then re-inoculated into YPDG + 40 μg/ml kanamycin and grown 3 h to induce protein expression from the GAL1 promoter. Vacuoles were stained by the addition of 1 μl of 4 mm FM4-64 (Invitrogen) to 100 μl of cell culture. Isolated vacuoles were stained by the addition of 1 μl of 0.5 mm FM4-64 dye to 50 μl vacuoles at 0.3 mg/ml and either imaged immediately or exposed to drugs for 30 min at 30 °C prior to imaging. Images were captured using a CoolSnap HQ camera and ImageJ software on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 using a ×100/1.40 NA objective. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop and quantified with ImageJ. Previously, we showed that two Rho proteins, Cdc42p and Rho1p, localize to the yeast vacuolar membrane and were needed for vacuolar membrane fusion (11.Eitzen G. Thorngren N. Wickner W. Rho1p and Cdc42p act after Ypt7p to regulate vacuole docking.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5650-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In reconstituted vacuolar fusion reactions, Cdc42p was rapidly activated, which resulted in the stimulation of membrane-associated actin polymerization (14.Logan M.R. Jones L. Eitzen G.

Rho1p showed much slower activation kinetics, and its role in fusion is unknown. To further define the function of Rho1p in membrane fusion, we searched for vacuole-specific Rho1p-associating proteins. Vacuoles were incubated for 40 min in fusion reaction buffer and cytosol, optimal conditions for Rho1p activation (14.Logan M.R. Jones L. Eitzen G. Cdc42p and Rho1p are sequentially activated and mechanistically linked to vacuole membrane fusion.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 394: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Vacuoles were re-isolated from reactions and then detergent-solubilized and incubated with MBP-Rho1p or MBP bound to amylose beads. A prominent ∼50-kDa protein that was bound specifically to MBP-Rho1p beads was identified as translation elongation factor 1Α, eEF1A (Fig. 1A). eEF1A is a dual-function protein that, in addition to its role in translation, binds and bundles F-actin filaments (18.Condeelis J.

https://openalex.org/W1994626237,"Cell culture systems represent a crucial part in basic prion research; yet, cell lines that are susceptible to prions, especially to field isolated prions that were not adapted to rodents, are very rare. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize a cell line that was susceptible to ruminant-derived prions and to establish a stable prion infection within it. Based on species and tissue of origin as well as PrP expression rate, we pre-selected a total of 33 cell lines that were then challenged with natural and with mouse propagated BSE or scrapie inocula. Here, we report the successful infection of a non-transgenic bovine cell line, a sub-line of the bovine kidney cell line MDBK, with natural sheep scrapie prions. This cell line retained the scrapie infection for more than 200 passages. Selective cloning resulted in cell populations with increased accumulation of PrPres, although this treatment was not mandatory for retaining the infection. The infection remained stable, even under suboptimal culture conditions. The resulting infectivity of the cells was confirmed by mouse bioassay (Tgbov mice, Tgshp mice). We believe that PES cells used together with other prion permissive cell lines will prove a valuable tool for ongoing efforts to understand and defeat prions and prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2046636785,"Plexins (plxns) are transmembrane (TM) receptors involved in the guidance of vascular, lymphatic vessel, and neuron growth as well as cancer metastasis. Plxn signaling results in cytosolic GTPase-activating protein activity, and previous research implicates dimerization as important for activation of plxn signaling. Purified, soluble plxn extracellular and cytosolic domains exhibit only weak homomeric interactions, suggesting a role for the plxn TM and juxtamembrane regions in homooligomerization. In this study, we consider a heptad repeat in the Danio rerio PlxnA3 cytosolic juxtamembrane domain (JM) for its ability to influence PlxnA3 homooligomerization in TM-domain containing constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with the AraTM assay and bioluminescent energy transfer (BRET²) suggest an interface involving a JM heptad repeat, in particular residue M1281, regulates PlxnA3 homomeric interactions when examined in constructs containing an ectodomain, TM and JM domain. In the presence of a neuropilin-2a co-receptor and semaphorin 3F ligand, disruption to PlxnA3 homodimerization caused by an M1281F mutation is eliminated, suggesting destabilization of the PlxnA3 homodimer in the JM is not sufficient to disrupt co-receptor complex formation. In contrast, enhanced homodimerization of PlxnA3 caused by mutation M1281L remains even in the presence of ligand semaphorin 3F and co-receptor neuropilin-2a. Consistent with this pattern of PlxnA3 dimerization in the presence of ligand and co-receptor, destabilizing mutations to PlxnA3 homodimerization (M1281F) are able to rescue motor patterning defects in sidetracked zebrafish embryos, whereas mutations that enhance PlxnA3 homodimerization (M1281L) are not. Collectively, our results indicate the JM heptad repeat, in particular residue M1281, forms a switchable interface that modulates both PlxnA3 homomeric interactions and signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2041655681,"TGF-β-induced antimitotic signals are highly regulated during cell proliferation under normal and pathological conditions, such as liver regeneration and cancer. Up-regulation of the transcriptional cofactors Ski and SnoN during liver regeneration may favor hepatocyte proliferation by inhibiting TGF-β signals. In this study, we found a novel mechanism that regulates Ski protein stability through TGF-β and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Ski protein is distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm of normal hepatocytes, and the molecular mechanisms controlling Ski protein stability involve the participation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Cytoplasmic Ski is partially associated with actin and localized in cholesterol-rich vesicles. Ski protein stability is decreased by TGF-β/Smads, GPCR/Rho signals, and actin polymerization, whereas GPCR/cAMP signals and actin depolymerization promote Ski protein stability. In conclusion, TGF-β and GPCR signals differentially regulate Ski protein stability and sorting in hepatocytes, and this cross-talk may occur during liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2152863826,"We present data that hyaluronan (HA) polysaccharides, about 14–86 monosaccharides in length, are capable of accepting only a single heavy chain (HC) from inter-α-inhibitor via transfer by tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6) and that this transfer is irreversible. We propose that either the sulfate groups (or the sulfation pattern) at the reducing end of the chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain of bikunin, or the core protein itself, enables the bikunin proteoglycan (PG) to accept more than a single HC and permits TSG-6 to transfer these HCs from its relatively small CS chain to HA. To test these hypotheses, we investigated HC transfer to the intact CS chain of the bikunin PG, and to the free chain of bikunin. We observed that both the free CS chain and the intact bikunin PG were only able to accept a single HC from inter-α-inhibitor via transfer by TSG-6 and that HCs could be swapped from the bikunin PG and its free CS chain to HA. Furthermore, a significant portion of the bikunin PG was unable to accept a single heavy chain. We discuss explanations for these observations, including the intracellular assembly of inter-α-inhibitor. In summary, these data demonstrate that the sulfation of the CS chain of bikunin and/or its core protein promote HC transfer by TSG-6 to its relatively short CS chain, although they are insufficient to enable the CS chain of bikunin to accept more than one HC in the absence of other cofactors.

https://openalex.org/W2047254013,"ADAMDEC1 is a proteolytically active metzincin metalloprotease displaying rare active site architecture with a zinc-binding Asp residue (Asp-362). We previously demonstrated that substitution of Asp-362 for a His residue, thereby reconstituting the canonical metzincin zinc-binding environment with three His zinc ligands, increases the proteolytic activity. The protease also has an atypically short domain structure with an odd number of Cys residues in the metalloprotease domain. Here, we investigated how these rare structural features in the ADAMDEC1 metalloprotease domain impact the proteolytic activity, the substrate specificity, and the effect of inhibitors. We identified carboxymethylated transferrin (Cm-Tf) as a new ADAMDEC1 substrate and determined the primary and secondary cleavage sites, which suggests a strong preference for Leu in the P1′ position. Cys392, present in humans but only partially conserved within sequenced ADAMDEC1 orthologs, was found to be unpaired, and substitution of Cys392 for a Ser increased the reactivity with α2-macroglobulin but not with casein or Cm-Tf. Substitution of Asp362 for His resulted in a general increase in proteolytic activity and a change in substrate specificity was observed with Cm-Tf. ADAMDEC1 was inhibited by the small molecule inhibitor batimastat but not by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP)-1, TIMP-2, or the N-terminal inhibitory domain of TIMP-3 (N-TIMP-3). However, N-TIMP-3 displayed profound inhibitory activity against the D362H variants with a reconstituted consensus metzincin zinc-binding environment.

Like other ADAMs, ADAMDEC1 mRNA encodes an N-terminal signal peptide directing secretion and a relatively large (173 residue) prodomain, which is processed during maturation, presumably by a member of the proprotein convertase family (4.Mueller C.G.F.

Here we show that ADAMDEC1 cleaves carboxymethylated transferrin (Cm-Tf) and determine the cleavage sites. We also demonstrate that special features of ADAMDEC1, including an unpaired Cys residue (Cys392) near the active site in the metalloprotease domain and the active site Zn2+-ligating Asp residue, have functional impacts on proteolytic activity, specificity, and effect of inhibitors. Finally, we present a homology-based model of the tertiary structure of mature ADAMDEC1. The FreeStyle 293 Expression System, including all additives, SDS-PAGE, zymography, and Western blot materials (Novex/iBlot System), was from Invitrogen. Azocasein and batimastat (BB-94) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Plasma-derived human α2-macroglobulin (α2M) was a kind gift from Prof. Lars Sottrup-Jensen (Aarhus University) and Henrik Østergaard (Novo Nordisk A/S). TIMP-1, TIMP-2, N-TIMP-3, and Cm-Tf were prepared as described previously (16.Troeberg L. Tanaka M. Wait R. Shi Y.E. Brew K. Nagase H.

A similar expression vector was generated for expression of the murine ADAMDEC1. cDNA encoding murine ADAMDEC1 was purchased from ImaGenes (Berlin, Germany) and cloned into a pCI-neo vector (Promega) using a forward (tacgactcactataggctagcatgctgcctgggact) and reverse (cctcactaaagggaagcggccgctcattctgtgatgtgg) primer. An HPC4 affinity tag inserted 2 amino acids downstream of the furin recognition site (RTSR203 (4.Mueller C.G.F. Cremer I. Paulet P.E. Niida S. Maeda N. Lebeque S. Fridman W.H. Sautès-Fridman C.

Site-directed mutagenesis of C392S in hADAMDEC1 was carried out using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) with mutagenesis primers (ggacttcagcacaagctccagagcccacttcgag and the reverse complementary primer). All primers were purchased from MWG Eurofins (Ebersberg, Germany). For protein expression in HEK293-6E, cells were grown at 37 °C and 8% CO2 in FreeStyle 293 expression medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml G-418 Geneticin and 0.1% (v/v) Pluronic F-68. pCI-neo-based expression plasmid encoding ADAMDEC1 variants were used for transfection according to the FreeStyle 293 protocol (Invitrogen). As a control, the supernatant from non-transfected cells (mock transfection) was collected. When applicable, the HEK293-6E conditioned medium containing ADAMDEC1 variants was concentrated using Amicon Ultra 10,000 molecular weight cut-off centrifugal filters (Millipore). Protein bands were excised from a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel and split into two parts, to one of which was added reducing agent (40 mm DTT final concentration) and to the other buffer. Both samples were alkylated using iodoacetic acid and subjected to in-gel digestion (19.Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3529) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified using C18 StageTips (20.Rappsilber J. Mann M. Ishihama Y. Protocol for micro-purification, enrichment, pre-fractionation and storage of peptides for proteomics using StageTips.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1896-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (2569) Google Scholar) and eluted onto an anchor chip target plate (Bruker) using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix in 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 70% (v/v) acetonitrile. Samples were analyzed on a Bruker Reflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH (Bremen, Germany), Basis-REFLEX SCOUT 384) in reflector mode. External calibration of the mass spectrometer was performed immediately before data acquisition using angiotensin II (Sigma-Aldrich), ACTH clip 18-39 (Sigma-Aldrich), bombesin (Fluka), and somatostatin (Sigma-Aldrich). The relative concentrations of ADAMDEC1 variants were evaluated by densitometric analysis of a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel using the Phoretix 1D software (TotalLab). Proteolysis of human plasma-derived α2M was carried out by incubating 25 nm ADAMDEC1 variant protein with 800 nm α2M in reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 μm ZnCl2) for ∼20 h at 37 °C. Cross-linking of ADAMDEC1 to α2M was visualized by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using 1.3 μg/ml anti-HPC4 tag antibody and 1.0 μg/ml HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for detection or 1.0 μg/ml anti-hADAMDEC1 (Abcam ab57224) with 1.0 μg/ml HRP-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako) for detection. Carboxymethylated transferrin (3.75 mg/ml) was used as a substrate for hADAMDEC1 variants (100–500 nm) in reaction buffer. Samples were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, and densitometry analysis was carried out using Phoretix 1D software (TotalLab). Proteolytic activity against azocasein was measured by incubating 7.8 μm ADAMDEC1 with 94 μm substrate at 37 °C for 72 h. The proteolysis was terminated by the addition of 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) followed by a 30-min incubation on ice and removal of undigested protein by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. 0.26 mm NaOH was added to the supernatants, and the absorbance was measured at 440 nm using a SpectraMax 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). From the absorption data was subtracted the reaction buffer contribution, and the data were compared with the data obtained with supernatant from mock-transfected cells using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's adjustment. Individual sample pairs were additionally compared using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. For casein zymography, 4–16% zymogram blue casein gel and buffers (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. For inhibition of ADAMDEC1 with batimastat (BB-94), the ADAMDEC1 variants were preincubated with a 10–100-fold molar excess of BB-94 for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of substrate. Characterization of TIMP inhibition of ADAMDEC1 was performed by preincubation of ADAMDEC1 with TIMP-1 (5–10-fold molar excess), TIMP-2 (5–10-fold molar excess), or N-TIMP-3 (up to 3-fold molar excess), respectively, for 4 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of substrate. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Individual bands were excised and subjected to Edman amino acid sequence analysis using an Applied Biosystems Procise HT protein sequencer with on-line identification of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives. Amino acid sequences were obtained from the UniProt Knowledgebase and aligned using MUSCLE (21.Edgar R.C. MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30217) Google Scholar). In order to generate a structure model of hADAMDEC1, a homology modeling approach was pursued as implemented in the computer program Modeler (22.Fiser A. Sali A. Modeller: generation and refinement of homology-based protein structure models.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Based on an input sequence alignment between the mature hADAMDEC1 amino acid sequence and template proteins with known structures, a three-dimensional model was generated. Loop regions not resolved in the template protein were predicted by a limited functionality for ab initio structure prediction. In the present study, the template protein was ADAM-8 (PDB entry 4DD8, resolution 2.1 Å (23.Hall T. Shieh H.S. Day J.E. Caspers N. Chrencik J.E. Williams J.M. Pegg L.E. Pauley A.M. Moon A.F.

Commun. 2012; 68: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)) for the metalloprotease domain (residues 204–410) and ADAM-22 (PDB entry 3G5C, resolution 2.36 Å (24.Liu H. Shim A.H.R. He X. Structural characterization of the ectodomain of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-22 (ADAM22), a neural adhesion receptor instead of metalloproteinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29077-29086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) for the disintegrin-like domain structure (residues 411–470) and the relative domain orientation. The resulting model was processed by CHARMM (25.MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K.

All-atom empirical potential for molecular modeling and dynamics studies of proteins.J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11686) Google Scholar). The active site region of hADAMDEC1 WT was modeled after snapalysin (PDB entry 1C7K, resolution 1 Å (26.Kurisu G. Kai Y. Harada S. Structure of the zinc-binding site in the crystal structure of a zinc endoprotease from Streptomyces caespitosus at 1 Å resolution.J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) and relaxed by energy minimization, resulting in close coordination of active site residues to the catalytic zinc ion. Furthermore, N-TIMP-3 was docked in the model based on the structure of the ADAM-17·N-TIMP-3 complex (PDB entry 3CKI, resolution 2.30 Å (27.Wisniewska M. Goettig P. Maskos K. Belouski E. Winters D. Hecht R. Black R. Bode W. Structural determinants of the ADAM inhibition by TIMP-3: crystal structure of the TACE-N-TIMP-3 complex.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)), and a substrate model addressing both the non-prime and prime substrate binding sites was generated inspired by the crystal structure of MMP-9 with bound active site probe (PDB entry 4JQG, resolution 1.85 Å (28.Tranchant I. Vera L. Czarny B. Amoura M. Cassar E. Beau F. Stura E.A. Dive V. Halogen bonding controls selectivity of FRET substrate probes for MMP-9.Chem. Biol. 2014; 21: 408-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). Comparing the amino acid sequences of human and murine ADAMDEC1 with that of the related hADAM-28 and hADAM-8 illustrates a modified Cys pattern of the ADAMDEC1 metalloprotease domain (Fig. 1A). In the majority of the mammalian ADAMs, the metzincin metalloprotease domain contains six Cys residues forming three intrachain disulfide bonds in a C1–C6, C2–C5, C3–C4 pattern (29.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Kress L.F. Bode W. First structure of a snake venom metalloproteinase: a prototype for matrix metalloproteinases/collagenases.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4151-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30.Cerdà-Costa N. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Architecture and function of metallopeptidase catalytic domains.Protein Sci. 2014; 23: 123-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the hADAMDEC1 metalloprotease domain contains only five Cys residues. Cys328, Cys369, Cys374, and Cys407 of hADAMDEC1 align with Cys residues in the related ADAMs, presumably forming the two disulfide bonds corresponding to C1–C6 (Cys328–Cys407) and C3–C4 (Cys369–Cys374) (Fig. 1A). Both human and murine ADAMDEC1 lack Cys residues corresponding to the C2–C5 disulfide bond. However, hADAMDEC1 contains a fifth Cys residue in the metalloprotease domain (Cys392), which we hypothesized to be unpaired. Indeed, hADAMDEC1 wild type (hWT) formed conjugates with thiol-reactive 5-kDa PEG-maleimide, resulting in a decrease in electrophoretic mobility. Furthermore, substitution of Cys392 for a Ser (hC392S) blocked the reaction with the PEG-maleimide (Fig. 1B), strongly suggesting that Cys392 exists as an unpaired and reactive Cys residue. The status of Cys392 was further probed by tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 1, C and D). hADAMDEC1 was excised from a non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel, alkylated under either reducing or non-reducing conditions, and digested with trypsin (Fig. 1C). In the non-reduced alkylated sample, a peptide with a mass corresponding to hADAMDEC1 residues 387–398, containing Cys392 in an alkylated state (MH+ 1513.2/1512.6 (observed/expected)), was observed, demonstrating that Cys392 is not bound to any other Cys residue (Fig. 1D). In addition, we observed a fragment mass in the non-reduced sample consistent with the expected tryptic peptide CPSGSCVMNQYLSSK containing Cys369 and Cys374 engaged in an internal disulfide bond (MH+ 1601.2/1601.7) (Fig. 1D). A peptide equivalent to the same fragment modified by oxidation (ox), presumably affecting the Met residue in the peptide, was also observed. Both of these fragments were absent in the reduced sample, and a new peak appeared, corresponding to the same peptide modified with two carboxymethyl groups (MH+ 1719.3/1717.69) (Fig. 1D). Together, this demonstrates that Cys369 and Cys374 form a disulfide bond corresponding to C3–C4 in other ADAMs. The mass spectrometry analysis was consistent with the presence of a Cys328–Cys407 disulfide bond; however, due to the close proximity of the disintegrin domain Cys residues with no Lys or Arg residues in between, the disulfide bond pattern of this peptide cluster cannot be fully resolved by the method employed (data not shown). Where hADAMDEC1 has an unpaired Cys at position 392, mADAMDEC1 has a Ser residue instead (Fig. 1A). To investigate the possible significance of Cys392 for the proteolytic activity of hADAMDEC1, it was substituted for a Ser residue (hC392S). The reactivity with human α2M was analyzed using an α2M-cross-linking assay, demonstrating a small increase in the activity of hC392S relative to hADAMDEC1 (Fig. 2A). Thus, a Ser residue at position 392 changes the reactivity of hADAMDEC1 toward human α2M. Interestingly, murine ADAMDEC1 (mWT), also with a Ser residue at position 392, exhibits significantly higher reactivity toward human α2M than both hADAMDEC1 and hC392S (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the observation in the α2M-cross-linking assay, the C392S substitution does not impact the caseinolytic activity of hADAMDEC1, measured by the release of TCA-soluble azo-labeled peptides (Fig. 2B). In addition to the two known substrates of ADAMDEC1, Cm-Tf is cleaved into two major products, with apparent molecular masses of 76 and 20 kDa, respectively, when incubated with hADAMDEC1. These products are not present when incubating with supernatant from mock-transfected cells, demonstrating hADAMDEC1-specific cleavage of Cm-Tf at one primary site (Fig. 2C). As with casein, the C392S-substitution does not change the activity toward Cm-Tf. Interestingly, mADAMDEC1 does not display any measurable caseinolytic activity or any observable cleavage of Cm-Tf (data not shown). Substitution of the catalytic Glu353 for an Ala in hADAMDEC1 (hE353A) completely abrogated the catalytic activity against all substrates (Fig. 2, B and C; shown previously (5.Lund J. Olsen O.H. S⊘rensen E.S. Stennicke H.R. Petersen H.H. Overgaard M.T. ADAMDEC1 is a metzincin metalloprotease with dampened proteolytic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 21367-21375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)). We previously demonstrated that reconstruction of the hADAMDEC1 active site by substituting the zinc-binding Asp362 for a His residue (hD362H) increases the proteolytic activity of hADAMDEC1 toward α2M and azocasein (5.Lund J. Olsen O.H. S⊘rensen E.S. Stennicke H.R. Petersen H.H. Overgaard M.T. ADAMDEC1 is a metzincin metalloprotease with dampened proteolytic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 21367-21375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when combining the D362H and C392S substitutions (hD362H/C392S), we observe a synergistic effect on the proteolytic activity toward human α2M relative to hADAMDEC1, hC392S, and hD362H (Fig. 3A). Also, both hD362H and hD362H/C392S demonstrated significantly increased proteolysis of Cm-Tf compared with hADAMDEC1 and hC392S, again with hD362H/C392S being the most active (Fig. 3B). Whereas digestion of Cm-Tf by hADAMDEC1 primarily generated two fragments, hD362H and hD362H/C392S produced a range of fragments under the conditions employed (Fig. 3B). Finally, hD362H/C392S also exhibited significantly increased caseinolytic activity, shown by the proteolysis of azo-labeled casein (Fig. 3C) and further demonstrated by casein zymography (Fig. 3D). In fact, hD362H/C392S is the only variant displaying visible activity in the casein zymogram. As described in the legend to Fig. 2B, proteolysis of Cm-Tf by hC392S generated a cleavage pattern similar to that of hADAMDEC1. The combined molecular mass of the two primary bands (76 and 20 kDa) is in good agreement with the observed mass of the undigested Cm-Tf (95 kDa; marked by a black dot). Thus, the fragment pattern is consistent with a single cleavage event giving rise to the two primary proteolytic fragments. In comparison, hD362H and hD362H/C392S generated multiple cleavage products, i"

All RGK proteins bind to voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel β subunit (Cavβ) subunits in vitro, but the necessity of the interaction for current inhibition remains controversial. This study applies NMR and calorimetric techniques to map the binding site for Rem2 on human Cavβ4a and measure its binding affinity. Our experiments revealed 2 binding surfaces on the β4 guanylate kinase domain contributing to a 156 ± 18 µM Kd interaction: a hydrophobic pocket lined by 4 critical residues (L173, N261, H262, and V303), mutation of any of which completely disrupted binding, and a nearby surface containing 3 residues (D206, L209, and D258) that when individually mutated decreased affinity. Voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel α1A subunit (Cav2.1) Ca(2+) currents were completely inhibited by Rem2 when co-expressed with wild-type Cavβ4a, but were unaffected by Rem2 when coexpressed with a Cavβ4a site 1 (L173A/V303A) or site 2 (D258A) mutant. These results provide direct evidence for a low-affinity Rem2/Cavβ4 interaction and show definitively that the interaction is required for Cav2.1 inhibition."
