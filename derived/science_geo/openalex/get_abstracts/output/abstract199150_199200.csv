https://openalex.org/W2047262034,"THE synthesis of new cytostatic drugs is governed by the attempt to find new substances which unite maximum therapeutic effectiveness with minimum toxicity. For this purpose it seems to be advantageous not to apply the substance in its active form, but by introducing suitable chemical groups to transform it into an inert transport substance which will be reconverted into the active form at the site of therapeutic action in the body. This principle has already proved of value in the treatment of prostatic carcinoma with stilbœstrol diphosphate1."

https://openalex.org/W2042743850,"DURING the systematic study of actinomycetes antagonizing fungi pathogenic in man, a species of Streptomyces (SA-IX/1) was found from desert sand that markedly inhibits growth of Cryptococcus neo-formans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes used for screening1. In laboratory deep fermentation, besides the antifungal antibiotic, an antibacterial one was produced also by this species. A natural stable variant (SA-IX/3) differing morphologically from the original strain isolated was selected that is capable of producing increased quantities of the antifungal and decreased quantities of the antibacterial agent. This proved to be a new species and has been named Streptomyces flavofungini. The antifungal, crystalline antibiotic (Fig. 1) was isolated as a uniform product from the mycelium and fermentation fluid of this asporogenic, chromogenic variant. From its colour and effects, the new antifungal agent has been called ‘flavofungin’."

https://openalex.org/W2064596798,"KINETIN (6-furfurylaminopurine) has been reported to stimulate cell division in excised tobacco pith tissues1, in onion root tips2 and, most recently, in sarcoma tumour cells3. Lettre and Endo4 found no changes in cell division or tumour growth with kinetin in cultures of normal or malignant human and animal cells. They concluded that these tissues either did not possess a kinetin-like trigger for cell division, or contained optimal levels of such a substance."

https://openalex.org/W2143659483,"A RELATIONSHIP between position in the peck order and egg production in the hen was first reported by Sanctuary1 (quoted by Guhl2), who found that the birds in the upper half of the peck order laid more eggs than those composing the lower social level. This observation was confirmed by Guhl2, who obtained a correlation of 0.26 (P, 0.01) between the number of birds pecked in the peck order and the number of eggs laid by 96 White Rock pullets."

https://openalex.org/W2084022492,"THE range of environmental temperature within which rats maintain a stable body temperature increases with age1–3. It is therefore possible that the lack of effect of adrenalectomy on thermoregulation before the sixteenth day after birth4–6 is the result of the relatively very low environmental temperature used (5° C.) at which thermoregulation fails in very young rats. In order to test this hypothesis rats were adrenalectomized under cold anæsthesia on the fourth day after birth. One, two and three days after operation their power of thermoregulation was tested as follows: rectal temperature was taken with a thermocouple immediately before the experiment after removal of infant rats from the nest. The animals were then placed in a Bargeton–Krumm–Heller3 respirometer and oxygen consumption was measured at an environmental temperature of 35° C. for 30 min. Then the external temperature was changed to 30° C. at which readings were continued for a further 60 min. Finally, the rectal temperature was again taken."

https://openalex.org/W2169496393,"THE hair of the rabbit grows from a compound follicle1 which contains one large outercoat hair, a few smaller outercoat hairs of intermediate morphology and numerous fine undercoat hairs. The true compound nature of the follicle is best seen during the growth-phase, when the follicles extend into the dermis forming distinctive groups at their deepest level (Fig. 1). As the hair shafts reach the surface the compound follicle is subdivided by fibrous septa into smaller groups which surround the large outer-coat hair. Each of these smaller groups of undercoat hairs penetrate the skin through a common follicle opening, whereas the outercoat hair has a separate opening."

https://openalex.org/W1983596495,"IT has been reported that a decrease in catalase activity is observed when tubercle bacilli acquire isoniazid resistance1, and later it was demonstrated that haemin is required for growth by some of these resistant strains2. We have found that the amount of a red fluorescent substance in sensitive strains of M. avium (Jucho, Takeo and 607) is smaller in strains resistant to isoniazid: while the sensitive organism contained 5.5 mgm. red compound/kgm. bacteria, those which were resistant to 250γ isoniazid contained only 2.1 mgm. compound/kgm. bacteria. The sensitive and resistant strains discussed in this communication were cultured in a glycerin–bouillon medium containing no isoniazid."

https://openalex.org/W2035437296,"WHILE culturing cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus 1, white cells, resistant to lysozyme, were often produced in liquid media containing relatively high carbohydrate. Resistant cells remained Gram-positive and were not lysed by lysozyme in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid2. Optimal concentrations of cultural sodium chloride for growth improved the yellow colour of the organisms3. These observations suggested a relationship of the yellow pigment to the polysaccharide substrate of lysozyme."
https://openalex.org/W1973655941,"DIVIDING nuclei in the apical groove of Halidrys siliquosa show large numbers of small chromosomes, and at metaphase more than 55 have been counted (Fig. 1c, d, e). Metaphase plates at the first three divisions in developing antheridia have given counts of the order of 30 chromosomes (Fig. 1b), and one at the first division of the oogonium of approximately 28 chromosomes. This indicates that the thallus of H. siliquosa is diploid with meiosis at the first division of the gametangia, as is usual in the Fucales1."

https://openalex.org/W1972863861,"IN several genera of the order Anura supernumerary limbs occur naturally1. They are usually extra hind limbs2. Polymely does not appear to have been reported in the genus Xenopus. The female toad (Xenopus laevis) described here came with a consignment of toads imported from South Africa in 1956. The toad measured 8.0 cm. from snout to vent and weighed 60 gm. and, except for a supernumerary right arm, was quite normal in appearance. The additional forearm was a mirror image of the normal right arm and was the same size as the two normal limbs. It measured 3.2 cm. from the axilla to the tip of the longest digit. The additional limb was attached immediately anterior to, and in the same plane as, the normal right arm. The point of attachment of the two limbs formed a prominent bony lump (Fig. 1). The extra limb was functionally normal and capable of independent movement. Xenopus is aglossate and pushes food into its mouth with both hands. In this specimen the back of the supernumerary hand assisted the normal left hand to carry food to the mouth, and the normal left hand alone was used for pushing food into the mouth. This toad had no difficulty in competing with normal Xenopus for food and was well nourished."

The current passing through the animals was registered by milliammeter. Copper electrodes were attached to the forelegs of mice weighing 20–25 gm., the shaved limbs of which had been moistened by a solution of sodium chloride. The mice were cooled by Giaja's method.

https://openalex.org/W2048127220,"IT seems to be generally agreed that agents capable of enhancing the virulence of bacteria, particularly mucins, do so by interfering with the defences of the host1–3. Recently, it was shown4 that broth or peptone injected intraperitoneally into W-Swiss mice even 1 hr. after a non-lethal saline suspension of group A streptococci converts the non-lethal dose into an LD100, the time-lag pointing again to an action on the host. The present communication brings further evidence in this respect; it also shows that substances bactericidal in vitro can act as virulence-enhancing agents in vivo."

These experiments failed to provide satisfactory evidence for the production in the dog of an experimental model of disseminated lupus erythematosus."
