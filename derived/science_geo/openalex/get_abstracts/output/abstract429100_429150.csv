https://openalex.org/W2165139888,"Emerging evidence suggests environmental chemical exposures during critical windows of development may contribute to the escalating prevalence of obesity. We tested the hypothesis that prenatal air pollution exposure would predispose the offspring to weight gain in adulthood. Pregnant mice were exposed to filtered air (FA) or diesel exhaust (DE) on embryonic days (E) 9-17. Prenatal DE induced a significant fetal brain cytokine response at E18 (46-390% over FA). As adults, offspring were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 wk. Adult DE male offspring weighed 12% more and were 35% less active than FA male offspring at baseline, whereas there were no differences in females. Following HFD, DE males gained weight at the same rate as FA males, whereas DE females gained 340% more weight than FA females. DE-HFD males had 450% higher endpoint insulin levels than FA-HFD males, and all males on HFD showed decreased activity and increased anxiety, whereas females showed no differences. Finally, both DE males and females fed HFD showed increased microglial activation (30-66%) within several brain regions. Thus, prenatal air pollution exposure can ""program"" offspring for increased susceptibility to diet-induced weight gain and neuroinflammation in adulthood in a sex-specific manner."

Recent work suggests that gut microbiota not only provide nutrients, but also involve in the development and maintenance of the host immune system. However, the complexity, dynamics and types of interactions between the insect hosts and their gut microbiota are far from being well understood.To determine the composition of the gut microbiota of two lepidopteran pests, Spodoptera littoralis and Helicoverpa armigera, we applied cultivation-independent techniques based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and microarray. The two insect species were very similar regarding high abundant bacterial families. Different bacteria colonize different niches within the gut. A core community, consisting of Enterococci, Lactobacilli, Clostridia, etc. was revealed in the insect larvae. These bacteria are constantly present in the digestion tract at relatively high frequency despite that developmental stage and diet had a great impact on shaping the bacterial communities. Some low-abundant species might become dominant upon loading external disturbances; the core community, however, did not change significantly. Clearly the insect gut selects for particular bacterial phylotypes.Because of their importance as agricultural pests, phytophagous Lepidopterans are widely used as experimental models in ecological and physiological studies. Our results demonstrated that a core microbial community exists in the insect gut, which may contribute to the host physiology. Host physiology and food, nevertheless, significantly influence some fringe bacterial species in the gut. The gut microbiota might also serve as a reservoir of microorganisms for ever-changing environments. Understanding these interactions might pave the way for developing novel pest control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2042736567,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are the leading cell candidates in the field of regenerative medicine. These cells have also been successfully used to improve skeletal muscle repair/regeneration; however, the mechanisms responsible for their beneficial effects remain to be clarified. On this basis, in the present study, we evaluated in a co-culture system, the ability of bone-marrow MSCs to influence C2C12 myoblast behavior and analyzed the cross-talk between the two cell types at the cellular and molecular level. We found that myoblast proliferation was greatly enhanced in the co-culture as judged by time lapse videomicroscopy, cyclin A expression and EdU incorporation. Moreover, myoblasts immunomagnetically separated from MSCs after co-culture expressed higher mRNA and protein levels of Notch-1, a key determinant of myoblast activation and proliferation, as compared with the single culture. Notch-1 intracellular domain and nuclear localization of Hes-1, a Notch-1 target gene, were also increased in the co-culture. Interestingly, the myoblastic response was mainly dependent on the paracrine release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by MSCs. Indeed, the addition of MSC-derived conditioned medium (CM) to C2C12 cells yielded similar results as those observed in the co-culture and increased the phosphorylation and expression levels of VEGFR. The treatment with the selective pharmacological VEGFR inhibitor, KRN633, resulted in a marked attenuation of the receptor activation and concomitantly inhibited the effects of MSC-CM on C2C12 cell growth and Notch-1 signaling. In conclusion, this study provides novel evidence for a role of MSCs in stimulating myoblast cell proliferation and suggests that the functional interaction between the two cell types may be exploited for the development of new and more efficient cell-based skeletal muscle repair strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2054736535,"Background Differences in pathogenicity between pneumococcal serotypes are important when assessing the potential benefit of different valency vaccines. We investigated the effect of serotype on clinical presentation, outcome, and quality of life lost from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the context of the 7, 10, and 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7, PCV10, PCV13). Method Serotyped IPD cases in England were linked to the national dataset of hospital admissions for April 2002 to March 2011. Based on patients’ diagnostic codes and vital status at the end of the admission, disease focus (meningitis, empyema, sepsis, or respiratory disease) and case fatality rates by serotype and age group (5, 5–64, and 65 years and over) were obtained. Using these data the quality adjusted life years (QALY) lost from the IPD remaining when use of PCV7 stopped in 2010 was estimated for the serotypes covered by higher valency vaccines. Results The linked dataset contained 23,688 cases with information on diagnosis, mortality, and serotype. There were significant differences between serotypes in the propensity to cause meningitis, death, and QALY loss in each of the investigated age groups. As a result, vaccines’ coverage of disease burden differed by endpoint. For example, in children under 5 years in 2009/10, PCV10 covered 39% of meningitis, 19% of deaths and 28% of the QALY loss of attributable to IPD, whereas the respective percentages for PCV13 were 65%, 67%, and 66%. The highest QALY loss per serotype in this age group was for 6A. Non-PCV serotypes causing the highest QALY loss were 22F and 33F in <5 year olds and 31 in older individuals. Conclusion Marked differences exist between serotypes in clinical presentation and outcome, and these should be considered when evaluating the potential impact of higher valency vaccines on overall disease burden and associated QALY loss."
https://openalex.org/W2071042694,"Background Quorum sensing is a term that describes an environmental sensing system that allows bacteria to monitor their own population density which contributes significantly to the size and development of the biofilm. Many gram negative bacteria use N-acyl-homoserine lactones as quorum sensing signal molecules. In this study, we sought to find out if the biofilm formation among clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp. is under the control of autoinducing quorum sensing molecules. Methodology/Principal Findings Biofilm formation among clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp. was assessed and the production of signal molecules were detected with Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 biosensor system. Characterisation of autoinducers was carried out by mass spectrometric analysis. We have also reported the identification of an autoinducer synthase gene, abaΙ among the isolates that produce quorum sensing signal molecules and have reported that the mutation in the abaI gene influences their biofilm forming capabilities. Using a microtitre-plate assay it was shown that 60% of the 50 Acinetobacter spp. isolates significantly formed biofilms. Further detection with the biosensor strain showed that some of these isolates produced long chain signal molecules. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that five of these isolates produced N-decanoyl homoserine lactone and two isolates produced acyl-homoserine lactone with a chain length equal to C12. The abaΙ gene was identified and a tetracycline mutant of the abaΙ gene was created and the inhibition in biofilm formation in the mutant was shown. Conclusions/Significance These data are of great significance as the signal molecules aid in biofilm formation which in turn confer various properties of pathogenicity to the clinical isolates including drug resistance. The use of quorum sensing signal blockers to attenuate bacterial pathogenicity is therefore highly attractive, particularly with respect to the emergence of multi antibiotic resistant bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2078877034,"Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) relies on the detachment of aggressive malignant cells from the primary tumor into the bloodstream and, concordantly, the presence of these Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) is associated with a poor prognosis. In this work, the molecular characterization of CTC from mCRC patients was approached, with the aim of understanding their biology and improving their clinical utility in the management of colorectal cancer patients. For this, EpCAM-based immunoisolation of CTC was combined with whole transcriptome amplification and hybridization onto cDNA microarrays. Gene expression data from mCRC patients, once the background of unspecific immunoisolation from a group of controls had been subtracted, resulted in 410 genes that characterized the CTC population. Bioinformatics were used for the biological interpretation of the data, revealing that CTC are characterized by genes related to cell movement and adhesion, cell death and proliferation, and cell signalling and interaction. RTqPCR on an independent series of mCRC patients and controls was used for the validation of a number of genes related to the main cellular functions characterizing the CTC population. Comparison between primary carcinomas and lung and liver metastases further involved the CTC-genes in the promotion of metastasis. Moreover, the correlation of CTC-gene expression with clinical parameters demonstrated detection and prognosis significance. In conclusion, the molecular characterization of CTC from mCRC patients and the identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers represent an innovative and promising approach in the clinical management of this type of patients."
https://openalex.org/W1994703247,"The symbiotic relationship between cnidarians and their dinoflagellate symbionts, Symbiodinium spp, which underpins the formation of tropical coral reefs, can be destabilized by rapid changes to environmental conditions. Although some studies have concluded that a breakdown in the symbiosis begins with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation within the symbiont due to a decoupling of photosynthesis, others have reported the release of viable symbionts via a variety of host cell derived mechanisms. We explored an alternative model focused upon changes in host cnidarian mitochondrial integrity in response to thermal stress. Mitochondria are often likened to being batteries of the cell, providing energy in the form of ATP, and controlling cellular pathway activation and ROS generation. The overall morphology of host mitochondria was compared to that of associated symbionts under an experimental thermal stress using confocal and electron microscopy. The results demonstrate that hyperthermic stress induces the degradation of cnidarian host mitochondria that is independent of symbiont cellular deterioration. The potential sites of host mitochondrial disruption were also assessed by measuring changes in the expression of genes associated with electron transport and ATP synthesis using quantitative RT-PCR. The primary site of degradation appeared to be downstream of complex III of the electron transport chain with a significant reduction in host cytochrome c and ATP synthase expression. The consequences of reduced expression could limit the capacity of the host to mitigate ROS generation and maintain both organelle integrity and cellular energy supplies. The disruption of host mitochondria, cellular homeostasis, and subsequent cell death irrespective of symbiont integrity highlights the importance of the host response to thermal stress and in symbiosis dysfunction that has substantial implications for understanding how coral reefs will survive in the face of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2086533705,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an antibiotic-resistant strain of S. aureus afflicting hospitals and communities worldwide. Of greatest concern is its development of resistance to current last-line-of-defense antibiotics; new therapeutics are urgently needed to combat this pathogen. Ceftobiprole is a recently developed, latest generation cephalosporin and has been the first to show activity against MRSA by inhibiting essential peptidoglycan transpeptidases, including the β-lactam resistance determinant PBP2a, from MRSA. Here we present the structure of the complex of ceftobiprole bound to PBP2a. This structure provides the first look at the molecular details of an effective β-lactam-resistant PBP interaction, leading to new insights into the mechanism of ceftobiprole efficacy against MRSA."
https://openalex.org/W1996265628,"Data from the 1000 genomes project (1KGP) and Complete Genomics (CG) have dramatically increased the numbers of known genetic variants and challenge several assumptions about the reference genome and its uses in both clinical and research settings. Specifically, 34% of published array-based GWAS studies for a variety of diseases utilize probes that overlap unanticipated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indels, or structural variants. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) block length depends on the numbers of markers used, and the mean LD block size decreases from 16 kb to 7 kb,when HapMap-based calculations are compared to blocks computed from1KGP data. Additionally, when 1KGP and CG variants are compared, 19% of the single nucleotide variants (SNVs) reported from common genomes are unique to one dataset; likely a result of differences in data collection methodology, alignment of reads to the reference genome, and variant-calling algorithms. Together these observations indicate that current research resources and informatics methods do not adequately account for the high level of variation that already exists in the human population and significant efforts are needed to create resources that can accurately assess personal genomics for health, disease, and predict treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2037657593,"Pregnane X Receptor (PXR), a master regulator of drug metabolism and inflammation, is abundantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. Baicalein and its O-glucuronide baicalin are potent anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer herbal flavonoids that undergo a complex cycle of interconversion in the liver and gut. We sought to investigate the role these flavonoids play in inhibiting gut inflammation by an axis involving PXR and other potential factors. The consequences of PXR regulation and activation by the herbal flavonoids, baicalein and baicalin were evaluated in vitro in human colon carcinoma cells and in vivo using wild-type, Pxr-null, and humanized (hPXR) PXR mice. Baicalein, but not its glucuronidated metabolite baicalin, activates PXR in a Cdx2-dependent manner in vitro, in human colon carcinoma LS174T cells, and in the murine colon in vivo. While both flavonoids abrogate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-mediated colon inflammation in vivo, oral delivery of a potent bacterial β-glucuronidase inhibitor eliminates baicalin’s effect on gastrointestinal inflammation by preventing the microbial conversion of baicalin to baicalien. Finally, reduction of gastrointestinal inflammation requires the binding of Cdx2 to a specific proximal site on the PXR promoter. Pharmacological targeting of intestinal PXR using natural metabolically labile ligands could serve as effective and potent therapeutics for gut inflammation that avert systemic drug interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2045231346,"Background Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) have been shown to be suitable in stem cell therapy for resurrecting damaged myocardium, but poor retention of transplanted cells in the ischemic myocardium causes ineffective cell therapy. Hypoxic preconditioning of cells can increase the expression of CXCR4 and pro-survival genes to promote better cell survival; however, it is unknown whether hypoxia preconditioning will influence the survival and retention of CPCs via the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis. Methods and Results CPCs were isolated from adult mouse hearts and purified by magnetic activated cell sorting using c-kit magnetic beads. These cells were cultured at various times in either normoxic or hypoxic conditions, and cell survival was analyzed using flow cytometry and the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), CXCR4, phosphorylated Akt and Bcl-2 were measured by Western blot. Results showed that the expression of pro-survival genes significantly increased after hypoxia treatment, especially in cells cultured in hypoxic conditions for six hours. Upon completion of hypoxia preconditioning from c-kit+ CPCs for six hours, the anti-apoptosis, migration and cardiac repair potential were evaluated. Results showed a significant enhancement in anti-apoptosis and migration in vitro, and better survival and cardiac function after being transplanted into acute myocardial infarction (MI) mice in vivo. The beneficial effects induced by hypoxia preconditioning of c-kit+ CPCs could largely be blocked by the addition of CXCR4 selective antagonist AMD3100. Conclusions Hypoxic preconditioning may improve the survival and retention of c-kit+ CPCs in the ischemic heart tissue through activating the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis and the downstream anti-apoptosis pathway. Strategies targeting this aspect may enhance the effectiveness of cell-based cardiac regenerative therapy."

The present study aimed to measure the prevalence of bullying behaviors among Chinese adolescents and to examine the association of bullying and being bullied with family factors, school factors and indicators of psychosocial adjustment.A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 8,342 middle school students were surveyed in four cities in the Guangdong Province. Self-reports on bullying involvement and information regarding family factors, school factors and psychosocial adjustment were collected. Descriptive statistics and multi-level logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the prevalence of school bullying and explore potentially influential factors.Of the total sample, 20.83% (1,738) reported being involved in bullying behaviors. Of the respondents, 18.99% were victims of bullying, 8.60% were bullies and 6.74% both bullied themselves and bullied others. Factors that were determined to be correlated with bullying behaviors included grade, parental caring, consideration of suicide, running away from home, time spent online per day and being in a physical fight.Bullying was determined to be prevalent among Chinese adolescents. Given the concurrent psychosocial adjustment, family and school factors associated with bullying, as well as the potential long-term negative outcomes for these youth, this issue merits serious attention, both for future research and preventive intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2129015955,"Physiological levels of H2S exert neuroprotective effects, whereas high concentrations of H2S may cause neurotoxicity in part via activation of NMDAR. To characterize the neuroprotective effects of combination of exogenous H2S and NMDAR antagonism, we synthesized a novel H2S-releasing NMDAR antagonist N-((1r,3R,5S,7r)-3,5-dimethyladamantan-1-yl)-4-(3-thioxo-3H-1,2-dithiol-4-yl)-benzamide (S-memantine) and examined its effects in vitro and in vivo. S-memantine was synthesized by chemically combining a slow releasing H2S donor 4-(3-thioxo-3H-1,2-dithiol-4-yl)-benzoic acid (ACS48) with a NMDAR antagonist memantine. S-memantine increased intracellular sulfide levels in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) 10-fold as high as that was achieved by ACS48. Incubation with S-memantine after reoxygenation following oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) protected SH-SY5Y cells and murine primary cortical neurons more markedly than did ACS48 or memantine. Glutamate-induced intracellular calcium accumulation in primary cortical neurons were aggravated by sodium sulfide (Na2S) or ACS48, but suppressed by memantine and S-memantine. S-memantine prevented glutamate-induced glutathione depletion in SH-SY5Y cells more markedly than did Na2S or ACS48. Administration of S-memantine after global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion more robustly decreased cerebral infarct volume and improved survival and neurological function of mice than did ACS48 or memantine.

Hydrogen sulfide has been proposed as a gaseous signaling molecule along with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide (1Olson K.R. The therapeutic potential of hydrogen sulfide: separating hype from hope.Am. J. Physiol. 2011; 301: R297-R312Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).

Gaseous H2S, however, may be difficult to be used clinically because of its characteristic odor and toxicity at high concentrations (1Olson K.R.

N-((1r,3R,5S,7r)-3,5-Dimethyladamantan-1-yl)-4-(3-thioxo-3H-1,2-dithiol-4-yl)-benzamide (S-memantine) was synthesized using the following two steps as shown in Fig. 1B: First, under nitrogen atmosphere, at room temperature, 4-(propan-2-yl)-benzoic acid (0.5 g; 3.05 mmol) and memantine (0.82 g; 4.57 mmol) were mixed in 5 ml of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (2.12 ml; 12.19 mmol) was added. After cooling to room temperature, O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N‘,N‘-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) (1.045 g; 2.75 mmol), dissolved in 5 ml of DMF was gradually added, followed by an overnight stirring at room temperature. After evaporation of DMF, extraction and purification, N-((1r,3R,5S,7r)-3,5-dimethyl-adamantan-1-yl)-4-isopropylbenzamide (Amide 1) was obtained. In the second step, under nitrogen atmosphere, sulfur (5.05 g, 158 mmol) was melted at 140 °C and amide-1 (2.16 g, 13.2 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at 190 °C to form a layer of reddish brown solution. After cooling the reaction mixture back to 140 °C, 100 ml toluene was added followed by further cooling to room temperature. Acetone was added to form a suspension that was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness. The dry residue was purified by flash chromatography. Fractions containing pure S-memantine were dried under vacuum to give 0.678 g (19% yield) of reddish brown crystals. The purity of the final product was greater than 98%.

The cells were seeded into 96 well plates (2 × 104 cells per well) for OGD and measurements of toxicity, 6 cm dishes (5 × 105 cells per dish) for measurements of sulfide and reduced glutathione (GSH), or 10 cm dishes (1 × 106 cells per dish) for measurements of intracellular calcium. Cell culture medium was replaced every 2 days, and the cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were used after reaching 80% confluent. Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from the cortex of embryonic day 15 C57BL6J mice. In brief, brains were harvested and the hemispheres were dissected under a microscope. The cortical neurons were dissociated in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) with B27 supplement (antioxidant plus, Invitrogen). The cells were seeded into 24 well plates coated with poly-d-lysine (Becton Dickinson Labware, 2 × 105 cells per well), followed by the medium-change with fresh one on the next day. The half of culture medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (antioxidant minus) every other day, and the cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were used for experiments 11 days after seeding. ACS48 and S-memantine were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), then, diluted to desired concentration with culture medium. The final concentration of DMSO was adjusted to 1%. We confirmed that 1% DMSO did not affect cell viabilities of SH-SY5Y and primary cortical neurons using lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) method (data not shown). Concentration of free sulfide in SH-SY5Y cells was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (10Tokuda K. Kida K. Marutani E. Crimi E. Bougaki M. Khatri A. Kimura H. Ichinose F. Inhaled hydrogen sulfide prevents endotoxin-induced systemic inflammation and improves survival by altering sulfide metabolism in mice.Antioxidants Redox Signal. 2012; 17: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, SH-SY5Y cells were seeded into 6 cm dishes (5 × 105 cells per dish). After being 80% confluent, 20 μm H2S donor was added to the dish and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 9.5, DTPA 0.1 mm) buffer, scraped, transfered to Eppendorf tubes, and centrifuged. MBB (10 mm in acetonitrile, 50 μl) was added to 100 μl of supernatant. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in dark, 50 μl of 200 mm 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) was added. After centrifugation, supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. For sulfide levels in medium, after centrifugation, supernatant was used for MBB reaction as above. Plasma and brain sulfide levels were measured 90 min after intraperitoneal administration of Na2S, ACS48, or S-memantine. Blood was drawn from left ventricle and centrifuged to collect the plasma. After perfusion with Tris-HCl buffer via left ventricle, brain was harvested, homogenized in Tris-HCl, and centrifuged. Plasma and supernatant of brain homogenate were derivatized with MBB and analyzed by HPLC. OGD for SH-SY5Y was performed by placing cells in a hypoxia chamber (STEMCELL Technologies Inc.) for 15 h, followed by 24 h of reoxygenation as previously reported (Fig. 2A) (11Serra-Pérez A. Verdaguer E. Planas A.M. Santalucía T. Glucose promotes caspase-dependent delayed cell death after a transient episode of oxygen and glucose deprivation in SH-SY5Y cells.J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, medium was replaced with glucose-free RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine (Cellgro by Mediatech, Inc), deoxygenated with anaerobic gas mixture (93% N2-5% CO2-2% H2) for 30 min before using. Cells were then placed in a hypoxia chamber, flushed with anaerobic gas mixture (93% N2-5% CO2-2% H2) and incubated at 37 °C. After 15 h of hypoxia, medium was replaced with DMEM/F12 and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. OGD for primary cortical neurons was performed with the similar protocol as above (Fig. 2B). Briefly, the culture medium was replaced with deoxygenated Neurobasal medium without glucose, and then placed in the hypoxic chamber for 2.5 h. After the OGD, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium with glucose and incubated for 21 h at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Control cells without OGD and reoxygenation were incubated in the fresh Neurobasal medium with glucose and incubated for 21 h at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2, then, used for viability experiment. Microtiter plate containing cells was centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for LDH measurement with LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche). After aspirating medium, remaining cells were washed with PBS, then, 100 μl of 1% Triton-X was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Medium and lysates were used for LDH measurement at wavelength 492 nm. Percentage of released LDH was calculated with following formula {LDH (medium)/LDH (medium + cell) × 100}. The average value of control (cells without OGD) was deducted as background. 10 μl of thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide solution (5 mg/ml in pH 7.4, PBS) was added to each well containing 100 μl of medium and cells, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h in the dark. Isopropanol (100 μl, 0.04 n HCl) was added to dissolve the blue dye. After dissolving completely, absorbance was measured with a plate-reader (Synergy 2, BioTek Instrument) at test wavelength 570 nm and reference wavelength 670 nm. Cell viability was determined by absorbance at 570 nm and reported as ratio to control cells (without OGD). After aspirating culture medium, cells were fixed and stained by 0.5% CV in 95% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, then washed by tap water several times. After taking photographs, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution was added to each well to elute blue dye. Absorbance was measured with a plate reader at 595 nm of wavelength. Values were shown as ratio to control (cells without OGD). Intracellular calcium level was measured by a previously described method using Fura-2/AM with some modifications (12Gao M. Zhang W.C. Liu Q.S. Hu J.J. Liu G.T. Du G.H. Pinocembrin prevents glutamate-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells via decrease of bax/bcl-2 ratio.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 591: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, pelleted, resuspended in the medium, and incubated with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Invitrogen) in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, NaCl 110 mm, KCl 2.6 mm, MgSO4 1 mm, CaCl2 (Fisher Scientific) 1 mm, HEPES 25 mm, and glucose 11 mm) at 37 °C for 40 min, and then washed twice. Cells were resuspended in HEPES buffer and transferred to a cuvette. Na2S, ACS48, memantine or S-memantine at 20 μm was added to the cuvette with or without glutamate (100 μm), respectively. Final cell concentration was 1 × 105 cells/ml. We were not able to examine the effects of higher concentration of S-memantine than 20 μm because of its poor solubility to HEPES buffer. The fluorescence intensity ratio was measured with Spectra Max M5 (Molecular Devices, CA) at a wavelength of λex = 340/380 nm and λem = 510 nm. Intracellular GSH level of SH-SY5Y was measured using HPLC method as previously reported (13Kimura Y. Goto Y. Kimura H. Hydrogen sulfide increases glutathione production and suppresses oxidative stress in mitochondria.Antioxidants Redox Signaling. 2009; 12: 1-13Crossref Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded into 6-cm dishes (5 × 105 cells per dish) and treated with 50 μm H2S donors or memantine w/wo 2 mm glutamate for 8 h, followed by washing with ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped and transferred to an Eppendorf tube and sonicated. Some fraction of lysate was used for protein assay. After centrifugation, 75 μl of supernatant, 26 μl of 2-(cyclohexylamino) ethanesulfonic acid (CHES, 0.5 m, pH 8.4) and 4 μl of 50 μm MBB were mixed and incubated at room temperature in dark for 30 min. Acetic acid (100 μl, 30% v/v) was added, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min after 5 min incubation of the tube on ice. The supernatant was analyzed using HPLC at wavelength of λex = 370 nm and λem = 486 nm. Protein levels in SH-SY5Y were determined by standard immunoblot techniques using primary antibodies (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA) against cleaved caspase-3, caspase-3, phosphorylated Akt at threonine 308, Akt, phosphorylated ERK1/2 at threonine 202, and tyrosine 204, Erk1/2, and β-tubulin. Bound antibody was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody directed against rabbit IgG (1:10,000∼1:25,000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) and was visualized using chemiluminescence with ECL Advance kit (GE Healthcare). After approval by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care, all animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. Male mice (C57BL/6J, 8–9 weeks old) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and given access to food and water ad libitum in our animal facility until the time of experiments. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and xylazine (12 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Body temperature was kept at 37 ± 0.5 °C during whole procedure. Cerebral ischemia was induced by 40 min of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) with microsurgical clips. Na2S, ACS48, S-memantine, or memantine at 25 μmol/kg or vehicle was intraperitoneally administered 1 min after the initiation of reperfusion. After reperfusion and recovery from anesthesia, mice were intraperitoneally given 1 ml of 5% dextrose-enriched lactated Ringer's solution daily for 1 week. Neurological score was evaluated as described previously (14Thal S.C. Thal S.E. Plesnila N. Characterization of a 3-vessel occlusion model for the induction of complete global cerebral ischemia in mice.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2010; 192: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The next eight items were checked and scored to evaluate neurological function: 1) Grasping movement reflex (inducing the catching reflex by running a little rod over the plantar surface of the paw): 0–4 points, 2) stop at the edge of a table: 0 or 1 point, 3) turning the head (turning the head when touching the ear from behind with a little rod): 0–2 points, 4) falling reflex (lifting the mouse at the tail and lowering with the front legs toward the ground): 0 or 1 point, 5) spontaneous motility (moving behavior on a flat surface): 0–2 points, 6) circling behavior (moving behavior on a flat surface): 0 or 2 points, 7) pelt property (appearance of the coat): 0 or 1 point, 8) flight reaction (spontaneous behavior on a flat surface): 0 or 1 point. Total 14 points. The higher score means worse neurological function. ACS48 and S-memantine were dissolved in the corn oil/DMSO (v/v, 95/5) suspension. Na2S was dissolved in saline 5 min before administration. Mice were intraperitoneally given 4 μl/g of these solutions 1 min after reperfusion following 40 min of BCAO. Mice were decapitated and brains were harvested 24 h after BCAO and reperfusion. Coronal sections (2 mm thickness) of the cerebrum were then soaked into 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min. After taking photographs under the same condition, infarct volume was calculated with Image J software ver.1.44. Photographs were gray-scaled, then, brighter area than threshold determined using image J software was calculated as infarct area. Values were shown as ratio of cerebral infarct volume to total volume. The average value of the brighter region volume in control mice was deducted from calculated area as background. All data are presented as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed by ANOVA using Sigmastat 3.01a (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL) and Prism 5 software package (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Newman-Keuls multiple comparison post hoc test or Bonferroni post hoc test were respectively performed for One-way Anova or Two-way Anova test as required. Smaller p values than 0.05 were considered significant. To determine the timing and levels of sulfide release by different sulfide donors, sulfide concentrations after addition of Na2S, ACS48 or S-memantine to the Dulbecco's modification of DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS (without cells) was measured using HPLC as reported (10Tokuda K. Kida K. Marutani E. Crimi E. Bougaki M. Khatri A. Kimura H. Ichinose F. Inhaled hydrogen sulfide prevents endotoxin-induced systemic inflammation and improves survival by altering sulfide metabolism in mice.Antioxidants Redox Signal. 2012; 17: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows time-dependent changes of sulfide concentrations in the medium after addition of 20 μm of each compounds at time 0 at pH 7.4. Although Na2S raised sulfide levels immediately, sulfide levels induced by Na2S decreased rapidly and became lower than sulfide levels induced by ACS48 and S-memantine at 1.5 h and 8 h after addition to the medium, respectively (p < 0.01 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test). ACS48 and S-memantine increased sulfide levels to 3.6 μm and 5.1 μm after 24 h, respectively. Sulfide levels in the medium were higher after addition of S-memantine than ACS48 at all time points examined (∼ 2.1-fold, p < 0.01 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test). Interestingly, both ACS48 and S-memantine released very little sulfide in PBS whereas ACS48 released more sulfide than did S-memantine in Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) and in DMEM/F12 without FBS (supplemental Fig. S1). Incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with Na2S, ACS48, and S-memantine increased intracellular sulfide levels with different magnitude and time course. Intracellular sulfide levels peaked around 1.5 h after addition of Na2S and ACS48 to the medium that disappeared by 8 h (Fig. 3B). In contrast, incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with S-memantine increased intracellular sulfide level more markedly than incubation with ACS48 at all time points after addition (∼10-fold at 4 h, p < 0.001 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test). In a separate experiment, we examined whether or not incubation with memantine itself or incubation with ACS48 and memantine would affect intracellular sulfide levels in SH-SY5Y cells. We found that memantine itself did not affect intracellular sulfide levels in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with or without ACS48 (Fig. 3C). Hence, it was indicated that chemical bonding between ACS48 and memantine would be important for the high intracellular sulfide levels achieved after addition of S-memantine. We examined the effect of Na2S since it has been widely used as a therapeutic compound against neuronal ischemia in vitro. Fifteen hours of OGD followed by 24 h of reoxygenation induced cell death in SH-SY5Y cells as indicated by increased LDH release into the medium (Fig. 4). Addition of Na2S to the culture medium at various time points (pre-OGD or 0.5, 2, 5, and 8 h after the end of OGD) and concentrations (10 and 50 μm) failed to improve cell viability (Fig. 4). We examined whether or not ACS48, memantine, and S-memantine improves viability of SH-SY5Y cells subjected to 15 h of OGD followed by 24 h of reoxygenation. Based on our time- and dose-ranging studies, we determined that 50 μm and at 8 h after the end of OGD were the most effective dose and time point to add ACS48 or S-memantine to improve viability of SH-SY5Y cells after OGD (Fig. 5, A and B). Addition of S-memantine to the medium at 50 μm at 8 h after the end of OGD improved the viability of SH-SY5Y cells more markedly than did addition of ACS48 or memantine at the same dose and time point, as indicated in LDH release, MTT, and CV assays (Fig. 6, A–D).FIGURE 6Effects of H2S donors and memantine on cell viability after OGD. A–D, ACS48, memantine, S-memantine at 50 μm or vehicle was added 8 h after the end of OGD. LDH released in the culture medium was measured 24 h after the end of OGD.

https://openalex.org/W2013679246,"Binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to the histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) mark is a hallmark of establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin. Although genetic and cell biological aspects have been elucidated, the molecular details of HP1 binding to H3K9me3 nucleosomes are unknown. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and biophysical measurements on fully defined recombinant experimental systems, we demonstrate that H3K9me3 works as an on/off switch regulating distinct binding modes of hHP1β to the nucleosome. The methyl-mark determines a highly flexible and very dynamic interaction of the chromodomain of hHP1β with the H3-tail. There are no other constraints of interaction or additional multimerization interfaces. In contrast, in the absence of methylation, the hinge region and the N-terminal tail form weak nucleosome contacts mainly with DNA. In agreement with the high flexibility within the hHP1β-H3K9me3 nucleosome complex, the chromoshadow domain does not provide a direct binding interface. Our results report the first detailed structural analysis of a dynamic protein-nucleosome complex directed by a histone modification and provide a conceptual framework for understanding similar interactions in the context of chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2170490695,"CD36 has been linked to the etiology of insulin resistance and inflammation. We explored its function in regulating adipose tissue lipolysis, which influences fat accumulation by liver and muscle and overall metabolism. Knockdown of CD36 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes decreased lipolysis in response to 10 μM of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (by 42%), 10 μM of the adenyl cyclase activator forskolin (by 32%), and 500 μM of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (by 33%). All three treatments in the knockdown adipocytes were associated with significant decreases of cAMP levels and of the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin phosphorylation. An important role for PDE was supported by the lack of inhibition of the lipolysis induced by the poorly hydrolyzable dibutyryl cAMP analog. An additional contributory mechanism was diminished activation of the Src-ERK1/2 pathway. Regulation of lipolysis and lipolytic signaling by CD36 was reproduced with adipose tissue from CD36–/– mice. The importance of surface CD36 in this regulation was suggested by the finding that the plasma membrane-impermeable CD36 inhibitor sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (20 μM) decreased lipolysis. Interestingly, isoproterenol induced CD36 internalization, and this process was blocked by HSL inhibition, suggesting feedback regulation of adipocyte lipolysis via CD36 trafficking.—Zhou, D., Samovski, D., Okunade, A.

https://openalex.org/W1992204153,"Defined as clinically unexplained hypertrophy of the left ventricle, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is traditionally understood as a disease of the cardiac sarcomere. Mutations in TNNC1-encoded cardiac troponin C (cTnC) are a relatively rare cause of HCM. Here, we report clinical and functional characterization of a novel TNNC1 mutation, A31S, identified in a pediatric HCM proband with multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation and aborted sudden cardiac death. Diagnosed at age 5, the proband is family history-negative for HCM or sudden cardiac death, suggesting a de novo mutation. TnC-extracted cardiac skinned fibers were reconstituted with the cTnC-A31S mutant, which increased Ca(2+) sensitivity with no effect on the maximal contractile force generation. Reconstituted actomyosin ATPase assays with 50% cTnC-A31S:50% cTnC-WT demonstrated Ca(2+) sensitivity that was intermediate between 100% cTnC-A31S and 100% cTnC-WT, whereas the mutant increased the activation of the actomyosin ATPase without affecting the inhibitory qualities of the ATPase. The secondary structure of the cTnC mutant was evaluated by circular dichroism, which did not indicate global changes in structure. Fluorescence studies demonstrated increased Ca(2+) affinity in isolated cTnC, the troponin complex, thin filament, and to a lesser degree, thin filament with myosin subfragment 1. These results suggest that this mutation has a direct effect on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the myofilament, which may alter Ca(2+) handling and contribute to the arrhythmogenesis observed in the proband. In summary, we report a novel mutation in the TNNC1 gene that is associated with HCM pathogenesis and may predispose to the pathogenesis of a fatal arrhythmogenic subtype of HCM."
https://openalex.org/W2022856747,"ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs) are small GTP-binding proteins known for their role in vesicular transport, where they nucleate the assembly of coat protein complexes at sites of carrier vesicle formation. Similar to other GTPases, Arfs require guanine nucleotide exchange factors to catalyze GTP loading and activation. One subfamily of ArfGEFs, the BRAGs, has been shown to activate Arf6, which acts in the endocytic pathway to control the trafficking of a subset of cargo proteins including integrins. We have previously shown that BRAG2 modulates cell adhesion by regulating integrin surface expression. Here, we show that, in addition to Arf6, endogenous BRAG2 also activates the class II Arfs, Arf4 and Arf5, and that surprisingly, it is Arf5 that mediates integrin internalization. We observed that cell spreading on fibronectin is enhanced upon inhibition of BRAG2 or Arf5 but not Arf6. Similarly, spreading in BRAG2-depleted cells is reverted by expression of a rapid cycling Arf5 mutant (T161A) but not by a corresponding Arf6 construct (T157A). We also show that BRAG2 binds clathrin and the AP-2 adaptor complex and that both BRAG2 and Arf5 localize to clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane. Consistent with these observations, depletion of Arf5, but not Arf6 or Arf4, slows internalization of β1 integrins without affecting transferrin receptor uptake. Together, these findings indicate that BRAG2 acts at clathrin-coated pits to promote integrin internalization by activating Arf5 and suggest a previously unrecognized role for Arf5 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of specific cargoes."
https://openalex.org/W1965498287,"Background In a previous report we showed that cognitive training fostering auditory-verbal discrimination and working memory normalized magnetoencephalographic (MEG) M50 gating ratio in schizophrenia patients. The present analysis addressed whether training effects on M50 ratio and task performance are mediated by changes in brain oscillatory activity. Such evidence should improve understanding of the role of oscillatory activity in phenomena such as M50 ratio, the role of dysfunctional oscillatory activity in processing abnormalities in schizophrenia, and mechanisms of action of cognitive training. Methodology/Principal Findings Time-locked and non-time-locked oscillatory activity was measured together with M50 ratio in a paired-click design before and after a 4-week training of 36 patients randomly assigned to specific cognitive exercises (CE) or standard (comparison) cognitive training (CP). Patient data were compared to those of 15 healthy controls who participated in two MEG measurements 4 weeks apart without training. Training led to more time-locked gamma-band response and more non-time-locked alpha-band desynchronization, moreso after CE than after CP. Only after CE, increased alpha desynchronization was associated with normalized M50 ratio and with improved verbal memory performance. Thus, both types of cognitive training normalized gamma activity, associated with improved stimulus encoding. More targeted training of auditory-verbal discrimination and memory additionally normalized alpha desynchronization, associated with improved elaborative processing. The latter presumably contributes to improved auditory gating and cognitive function. Conclusions/Significance Results suggest that dysfunctional interplay of ocillatory activity that may contribute to auditory processing disruption in schizophrenia can be modified by targeted training."

However, how the adaptive ER stress response causes cell death remains enigmatic. We report herein a critical role of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP1) in controlling β-cell survival under ER stress. While both palmitate and palmitoleate induced an overt ER stress response, lipotoxicity was only observed in β-cells exposed to palmitate but not palmitoleate. Interestingly, cells treated with palmitoleate exerted a sustainable level of cIAP1, whereas the protein quickly degraded following palmitate treatment. Enforced overexpression of cIAP1 prevented palmitate-induced cell death. In contrast, siRNA-mediated knockdown of cIAP1 in β-cells or knock-out of cIap1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts not only increased palmitate-induced apoptosis, but also committed cells to death in response to the nontoxic palmitoleate treatment. Of importance, we found that cIAP1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting ubiquitination and degradation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a key mediator of ER stress-induced cell death.

As a prototypical, professional secretory cell type, pancreatic β-cells have a highly developed ER system to facilitate the folding of large amounts of insulin and various glycoproteins for secretion, and thus are vulnerable to ER stress.

For instance, under obese and insulin resistant conditions, β-cells are confronted with a dramatically enhanced demand for insulin production, accompanied by multiple pathological factors such as elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFA). Such insults place a strain on the cell and cause prolonged or chronic activation of the UPR pathways, ultimately leading to β-cell dysfunction and cell death. This has been suggested to be a key pathogenic event contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (2Eizirik D.L. Cardozo A.K. Cnop M.

Overexpression or microinjection of CHOP was reported to induce apoptosis through a mechanism associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2 or increased Bax translocation to the mitochondrial membrane (7Matsumoto M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). In addition, the heterodimer of CHOP with C/EBPα binds directly to an element in the first intron of the gene encoding the BH3-only protein Bim, promoting its expression and leading to apoptosis (9Puthalakath H.

Furthermore, several studies from chop deficient mice indicate that CHOP is required for ER stress-induced apoptosis in a diverse range of cell types, including pancreatic β-cells (6Tabas I. Ron D.

However, while the important role of CHOP in mediating cell death has been clearly documented, the ER stress-induced CHOP expression appears not to uniformly commit cells to death. For instance, perk−/− and eIF2αS51A knock-in cells that are unable to induce CHOP expression, display a hypersensitivity to ER stress-induced apoptosis (12Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H.

Moreover, recent studies suggest that CHOP plays an important protective role to improve the ER protein-folding capacity and help cellular recovery through the transcriptional regulation of target genes or microRNAs, including GADD34 (5Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D.

A CHOP-regulated microRNA controls rhodopsin expression.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The divergent findings that CHOP plays roles in both cellular recovery and cell death, indicate additional mechanisms are responsible for determining cell fate following UPR-induced CHOP production. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP1/birc2) belongs to the IAP family of anti-apoptotic proteins, which is characterized by the presence of baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) motifs (16Srinivasula S.M. Ashwell J.D. IAPs: what's in a name?.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Like other prototypic IAPs, cIAP1 contains a central CARD (caspase-activating recruitment domain) and a C-terminal RING domain that possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. As such, besides the potent anti-apoptotic property, cIAP1 can also act as an E3 ligase to ubiquitylate and regulate target proteins, thereby participating in the regulation of multiple cellular functions (reviewed in Refs. 16Srinivasula S.M. Ashwell J.D. IAPs: what's in a name?.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 17Gyrd-Hansen M. Meier P. IAPs: from caspase inhibitors to modulators of NF-kappaB, inflammation and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 561-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have reported that ER stress increases cIAP1 expression in cancer cells through the UPR pathway (18Hu P. Han Z. Couvillon A.D. Exton J.H.

PERK-dependent regulation of IAP translation during ER stress.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The induction of cIAP1 is suggested to be important for cancerous cell survival under stress conditions (18Hu P. Han Z. Couvillon A.D. Exton J.H.

PERK-dependent regulation of IAP translation during ER stress.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, how cIAP1 promotes ER stress-associated cell survival has not been elucidated and its role in pancreatic β-cells is unknown. In the present study, we have provided substantial evidence showing a critical role of cIAP1 in protecting β-cells against ER stress-mediated lipotoxicity. We found that cIAP1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting ubiquitination and degradation of the pro-apoptotic protein CHOP, thereby preventing cell death. These functional and mechanistic data provide a new insight into the regulation of ER stress-associated cell survival in pancreatic β-cells, and help create a novel strategy for the management of T2D by protecting β-cells against lipotoxicity. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS (except rat INS-1 β-cells in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS). FuGene HD reagent (Roche) was used for transient transfection according to the manufacturer's protocol. siRNA against CHOP and cIAP1 and their control siRNA (purchased from Ambion) were transfected into cells using HiPerFect (Qiagen) as described previously (20Zhang N. Qi Y. Wadham C. Wang L. Warren A. Di W. Xia P. FTY720 induces necrotic cell death and autophagy in ovarian cancer cells: a protective role of autophagy.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 1157-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Palmitate or palmitoleate (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH by heating at 90 °C for 10min, and then prepared a stock solution containing 5 mm FFA coupled with 5% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA. For treatment of cells, the stock FFA solution was added into serum-free medium at the indicated concentrations for a desired time period. C57BL/6 mice were housed under conventional conditions and used for the research according to the protocol approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney. Islets were isolated from adult mice following injection of collagenase through the pancreatic duct as previously described (21Laybutt D.R. Preston A.M. Akerfeldt M.C. Kench J.G. Busch A.K. Biankin A.V. Biden T.J. Endoplasmic reticulum stress contributes to beta cell apoptosis in type 2 diabetes.Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 752-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The islets were allowed to recover for 48 h in a humidified cell culture incubator before use. Cell viability was measured by using colorimetric MTS assay as described previously (22Sukocheva O. Wadham C. Holmes A. Albanese N. Verrier E. Feng F. Bernal A. Derian C.K. Ullrich A. Vadas M.A. Xia P.

For cell death assays, cells were co-stained with propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V-FITC using an Apoptosis and Necrosis Quantification Kit (Biotium), followed by flow cytometry analysis. Standard procedures for Western blotting and immunoprecipitations were followed as previously described (23Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Gamble J.R.

Antibodies used in this study include: anti-ubiquitin, anti-cytochrome C, anti-phospho-eIF2α, anti-CHOP, anti-caspase 3, anti-COX IV, anti-HA tag (all from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-FLAG tag, anti-β-actin (Sigma), and anti-cIAP1 (gift from Dr. John Silke). For in vivo ubiquitination assays, cells were transiently transfected with various combinations of plasmids as indicated and pre-treated with 10 μm MG132. 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) and 10 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) were added to the lysis buffer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and proteins were dissociated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were diluted, immunoprecipitated with anti-CHOP antibodies, anti-cIAP1 antibodies, or anti-Flag-conjugated Sepharose (Sigma), and immunoblotted as indicated. For in vitro ubiquitination assays, the reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in a 20 μl reaction system containing 1× ubiquitin conjugation reaction buffer, 1× PhosSTOP complete phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche), 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm Mg-ATP, 50 μm ubiquitin, 100 nm E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBE1 (Boston Biochem), and 20 μg/ml of various E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (all from Boston Biochem). 0.3 μg of recombinant CHOP protein was used as a substrate in the reaction. 0.3 μg of either full-length or truncated cIAP1 recombinant proteins was added as E3 ligase to the reaction. The reactions were stopped by heating the mix with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer at 80 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blotting as indicated. Data are presented as means ± S.D. from an appropriate number of experiments as indicated in the figure legends, and analyzed with Graph-Pad Prism (Version 5.0). Statistical significance was evaluated with an unpaired two-tailed t test, and differences at values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Lipotoxicity arising from chronic exposure of saturated FFA, such as palmitate, has been shown to cause β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis (24Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Poitout V. Beta-cell glucose toxicity, lipotoxicity, and chronic oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes.Diabetes. 2004; 53: S119-S124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cnop M. Igoillo-Esteve M. Cunha D.A. Ladrière L. Eizirik D.L. An update on lipotoxic endoplasmic reticulum stress in pancreatic beta-cells.Biochem. Soc Trans. 2008; 36: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Treatment of MIN-6 β-cells for 24 h with palmitate resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the unsaturated FFA palmitoleate had no evident cytotoxic effects on β-cells (Fig. 1A). The effects of these FFAs on cell viability were confirmed in INS-1 β-cells (Fig. 1A, right panel). In agreement with previous reports showing that the lipotoxicity was mediated through the apoptotic pathway (21Laybutt D.R. Preston A.M. Akerfeldt M.C. Kench J.G. Busch A.K. Biankin A.V. Biden T.J. Endoplasmic reticulum stress contributes to beta cell apoptosis in type 2 diabetes.Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 752-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 26Karaskov E. Scott C. Zhang L. Teodoro T. Ravazzola M. Volchuk A. Chronic palmitate but not oleate exposure induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, which may contribute to INS-1 pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis.Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), a time-dependent increase in caspase-3 cleavage was observed in β-cells exposed to palmitate, but not palmitoleate (Fig. 1B). In addition, the palmitate-induced apoptotic cell death was confirmed by using flow cytometry analysis of β-cells co-stained with annexin V and propidium iodide (Fig. 1, C and D). A number of studies have demonstrated an essential role for the UPR in mediating lipotoxicity through CHOP production (as reviewed in Ref. 27Eizirik D.L. Cnop M. ER stress in pancreatic beta cells: the thin red line between adaptation and failure.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: pe7Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Chop gene has been reported to prevent apoptosis and improve cellular function in β-cells under ER stress conditions in several diabetic models (10Oyadomari S. Mori M. Roles of CHOP/GADD153 in endoplasmic reticulum stress.Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar, 11Song B. Scheuner D. Ron D. Pennathur S. Kaufman R.J. Chop deletion reduces oxidative stress, improves beta cell function, and promotes cell survival in multiple mouse models of diabetes.J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 3378-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), underlining a critical role of CHOP in ER stress-induced β-cell death. Consistent with this notion, palmitate treatment resulted in a significant increase in the levels of phosphorylated eIF2α and CHOP expression in a time-dependent fashion in MIN6 β-cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that the PERK-eIF2α UPR pathway is activated under this condition. In the presence of a chemical ER chaperone, 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA), palmitate-induced CHOP expression was strikingly attenuated, with a concomitant reduction in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2B), suggesting an important role of UPR-dependent CHOP expression in the lipotoxicity. Furthermore, knockdown of CHOP expression by using its specific siRNA in MIN6 β-cells significantly inhibited palmitate-induced caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2C) and cell death (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data support the notion that CHOP induction plays an important role in ER stress-mediated lipotoxicity in β-cells. Because palmitoleate had no apoptotic effect on β-cells, we thought that this unsaturated FFA might be unable to induce CHOP expression. Surprisingly, palmitoleate was indeed able to activate the PERK-eIF2α UPR pathway, as reflected by an increase in both eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 3A) and CHOP induction (Fig. 3B), albeit to a lower level than that observed in palmitate-treated cells. Remarkably, palmitoleate-induced CHOP expression declined sharply after 24 h treatment, whereas a prolonged increase in CHOP expression was observed after palmitate treatment for at least 24 h (Fig. 3B). These observations suggest that additional factors, dependent or independent of CHOP, are involved in regulating β-cell death following the PERK-eIF2α UPR pathway activation. In an attempt to further elucidate the mechanisms of ER stress-mediated lipotoxicity, we sought to examine the role of cIAP1 that was reportedly up-regulated by ER stress response (19Hamanaka R.B. Bobrovnikova-Marjon E. Ji X. Liebhaber S.A. Diehl J.A. PERK-dependent regulation of IAP translation during ER stress.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of β-cells with palmitate, but not palmitoleate, resulted in a significant decrease in cIAP1 expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, middle panel). The palmitate-induced time-dependent reduction of cIAP1 and a concomitant increase in CHOP expression and cleaved caspase-3 were further confirmed in primary pancreatic islets isolated from mice (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, treatment of MIN6 β-cells with tunicamycin, a known chemical ER stressor, also resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of cIAP1, coinciding with an increase in CHOP expression and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 3D). These data illustrate that cIAP1 degradation is correlated with ER stress-mediated cell death. However, pre-treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk did not prevent cIAP1 reduction, although caspase-3 activation was blocked by the treatment (Fig. 4A), indicating that the loss of cIAP1 was not a consequence of apoptosis in palmitate-treated cells. Strikingly, addition of the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 completely restored cIAP1 levels (Fig. 4B), suggesting that proteasome-mediated degradation is, at least in part, responsible for the palmitate-induced cIAP1 reduction. Because a peptide derived from a mitochondrial protein, Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases, also known as DIABLO), was demonstrated to induce cIAP1 autoubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (28Kandasamy K. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Bryant J.L. Srivastava R.K. Involvement of proapoptotic molecules Bax and Bak in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced mitochondrial disruption and apoptosis: differential regulation of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1712-1721PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yang Q.H. Du C. Smac/DIABLO selectively reduces the levels of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 but not that of XIAP and livin in HeLa cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16963-16970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we asked whether palmitate might activate this pathway. Indeed, treatment of MIN6 β-cells with palmitate resulted in a significant reduction of Smac expression in the mitochondrial fractions and a simultaneous increase in cytosolic levels of the protein (Fig. 4C), showing an ability of palmitate to induce Smac release from mitochondria. We then examined the effect of palmitate on cIAP1 ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 4D, treatment of cells with palmitate caused robust ubiquitination of cIAP1 as determined by in vivo ubiquitination assays. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the Smac/cIAP1 pathway is activated by palmitate treatment and associated with the ER stress-mediated lipotoxicity in β-cells. It was observed that while CHOP expression was induced by ER stressors, including palmitate, palmitoleate, or tunicamycin, high levels of CHOP were sustained under conditions that induced cIAP1 degradation, i.e. palmitate or tunicamycin treatment in either β-cell lines or primary islets (Fig. 3, B, C, and D). To further verify the relationship between cIAP1 and CHOP expression, we manipulated cIAP1 levels by overexpression of the gene or knockdown of the protein expression using specific siRNA. Cells overexpressing cIAP1 exhibited a significant reduction in palmitate-induced CHOP expression (Fig. 5A). This reduction was completely prevented by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, suggesting a post-translational effect of cIAP1 on CHOP expression. In contrast, the palmitate-induced CHOP expression was significantly enhanced by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of cIAP1 in β-cells (Fig. 5B). Moreover, cIap−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited higher levels of CHOP expression in response to palmitate treatment than that in wild-type cells (Fig. 5C). Together, these data suggest that cIAP1 may regulate cellular levels of CHOP following its induction by ER stress. As cIAP1 has been recently identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates ubiquitin- mediated proteasomal degradation of its substrates (17Gyrd-Hansen M. Meier P. IAPs: from caspase inhibitors to modulators of NF-kappaB, inflammation and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 561-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 30Bertrand M.J. Milutinovic S. Dickson K.M. Ho W.C. Boudreault A. Durkin J. Gillard J.W. Jaquith J.B. Morris S.J. Barker P.A. cIAP1 and cIAP2 facilitate cancer cell survival by functioning as E3 ligases that promote RIP1 ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 689-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), we investigated whether CHOP is a substrate of cIAP1. To this end, we transiently co-transfected HEK293 cells with FLAG-tagged cIAP1 and CHOP. Co-expression of CHOP and cIAP1 resulted in a marked increase in the levels of CHOP ubiquitination, as detected by immunoblotting after immunoprecipitation of CHOP (Fig. 6A). In addition, FLAG-tagged cIAP1 was coimmunoprecipitated with CHOP, and conversely, CHOP was detected in the immunocomplex of anti-FLAG (Fig. 6B), indicating an interaction between cIAP1 and CHOP. Furthermore, in vivo ubiquitination assays show that ubiquitinated CHOP was significantly reduced by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of cIAP1 (Fig. 6C), further supporting the role of cIAP1 in CHOP ubiquitination. To directly assess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of cIAP1 toward CHOP, we carried out in vitro ubiquitination assays using recombinant CHOP protein as substrate, in the presence of GST-fused cIAP1, along with different E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. As shown in Fig. 6D, cIAP1 was capable of inducing CHOP ubiquitination in vitro in the presence of UbcH5a, UbcH5b and UbcH6, but not other E2 enzymes, including UbcH7, UbcH8, UbcH10, and UbcH13. Moreover, while the full-length wild-type cIAP1 induced CHOP ubiquitination in the presence of UbcH5a or UbcH6, the truncated cIAP1 mutant (ΔcIAP1) that lacks E3 ligase activity failed to do so (Fig. 6E), indicating that the E3 ligase activity of cIAP1 is required for CHOP ubiquitination. Considering both the known pro-apoptotic activity of CHOP and anti-apoptotic property of cIAP1, the finding that cIAP1 promotes CHOP ubiquitination and degradation led us as to explore the role of cIAP1 in β-cell survival under lipotoxic stress conditions. As expected, overexpression of cIAP1 significantly inhibited palmitate-induced cell death (Fig. 7A), whereas lipotoxicity was enhanced by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of cIAP1 in β-cells (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, cIap1−/− MEFs exhibited significantly more cell death than wild-type cells in response to palmitate treatment (Fig. 7C), underlining an important role of cIAP1 in protecting the ER stress-mediated lipotoxicity. Moreover, the enhanced lipotoxicity in palmitate-treated cIap1−/− MEFs was prevented by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of CHOP (Fig. 7C), further supporting the mechanistic connections between cIAP1 and CHOP in protection against cell death under ER stress. As aforementioned, the unsaturated FFA palmitoleate had no significant cytotoxic effect on β-cells (Fig. 1), although it was capable of inducing the PERK-eIF2α UPR pathway activation and CHOP expression (Fig. 3, A and B). We wanted to further explore the role of cIAP1 in cell survival under this setting. By knocking down cIAP1"
https://openalex.org/W2004807475,"Little is known about the role of chemokines/chemokines receptors on T cells in natural DENV infection. Patients from DENV-2 and -3- outbreaks were studied prospectively during the acute or convalescent phases. Expression of chemokine receptor and activation markers on lymphocyte subpopulations were determined by flow cytometry analysis, plasma chemokine ligands concentrations were measured by ELISA and quantification of CCL5/RANTES(+) cells in liver tissues from fatal dengue cases was performed by immunochemistry. In the acute DENV-infection, T-helper/T-cytotoxic type-1 cell (Th1/Tc1)-related CCR5 is significantly higher expressed on both CD4 and CD8 T cells. The Th1-related CXCR3 is up-regulated among CD4 T cells and Tc2-related CCR4 is up-regulated among CD8 T cells. In the convalescent phase, all chemokine receptor or chemokine ligand expression tends to reestablish control healthy levels. Increased CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL4/MIP-1β but decreased CCL5/RANTES levels were observed in DENV-patients during acute infection. Moreover, we showed an increased CD107a expression on CCR5 or CXCR3-expressing T cells and higher expression of CD29, CD44(HIGH) and CD127(LOW) markers on CCR4-expressing CD8 T cells in DENV-patients when compared to controls. Finally, liver from dengue fatal patients showed increased number of cells expressing CCL5/RANTES in three out of four cases compared to three death from a non-dengue patient. In conclusion, both Th1-related CCR5 and CXCR3 among CD4 T cells have a potential ability to exert cytotoxicity function. Moreover, Tc1-related CCR5 and Tc2-related CCR4 among CD8 T cells have a potential ability to exert effector function and migration based on cell markers evaluated. The CCR5 expression would be promoting an enhanced T cell recruitment into liver, a hypothesis that is corroborated by the CCL5/RANTES increase detected in hepatic tissue from dengue fatal cases. The balance between protective and pathogenic immune response mediated by chemokines during dengue fever will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2036443927,"During proteinuria, renal tubular epithelial cells become exposed to ultrafiltrate-derived serum proteins, including complement factors. Recently, we showed that properdin binds to tubular heparan sulfates (HS). We now document that factor H also binds to tubular HS, although to a different epitope than properdin. Factor H was present on the urinary side of renal tubular cells in proteinuric, but not in normal renal tissues and colocalized with properdin in proteinuric kidneys. Factor H dose-dependently bound to proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) in vitro. Preincubation of factor H with exogenous heparin and pretreatment of PTECs with heparitinase abolished the binding to PTECs. Surface plasmon resonance experiments showed high affinity of factor H for heparin and HS (KD values of 32 and 93 nm, respectively). Using a library of HS-like polysaccharides, we showed that chain length and high sulfation density are the most important determinants for glycosaminoglycan-factor H interaction and clearly differ from properdin-heparinoid interaction. Coincubation of properdin and factor H did not hamper HS/heparin binding of one another, indicating recognition of different nonoverlapping epitopes on HS/heparin by factor H and properdin. Finally we showed that certain low anticoagulant heparinoids can inhibit properdin binding to tubular HS, with a minor effect on factor H binding to tubular HS. As a result, these heparinoids can control the alternative complement pathway. In conclusion, factor H and properdin interact with different HS epitopes of PTECs. These interactions can be manipulated with some low anticoagulant heparinoids, which can be important for preventing complement-derived tubular injury in proteinuric renal diseases. During proteinuria, renal tubular epithelial cells become exposed to ultrafiltrate-derived serum proteins, including complement factors. Recently, we showed that properdin binds to tubular heparan sulfates (HS). We now document that factor H also binds to tubular HS, although to a different epitope than properdin. Factor H was present on the urinary side of renal tubular cells in proteinuric, but not in normal renal tissues and colocalized with properdin in proteinuric kidneys. Factor H dose-dependently bound to proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) in vitro. Preincubation of factor H with exogenous heparin and pretreatment of PTECs with heparitinase abolished the binding to PTECs. Surface plasmon resonance experiments showed high affinity of factor H for heparin and HS (KD values of 32 and 93 nm, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W1965710516,"Nuclear existence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been documented for more than two decades. Resistance of cancer to radiotherapy is frequently correlated with elevated EGFR expression, activity, and nuclear translocation. However, the role of nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) in radioresistance of cancers remains elusive. In the current study, we identified a novel nEGFR-associated protein, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), which possesses 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease activity toward c-MYC mRNA. Knockdown of PNPase increased radioresistance. Inactivation or knock-down of EGFR enhanced PNPase-mediated c-MYC mRNA degradation in breast cancer cells, and also increased its radiosensitivity. Interestingly, the association of nEGFR with PNPase and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK) increased significantly in breast cancer cells after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). We also demonstrated that DNAPK phosphorylates PNPase at Ser-776, which is critical for its ribonuclease activity. The phospho-mimetic S776D mutant of PNPase impaired its ribonuclease activity whereas the nonphosphorylatable S776A mutant effectively degraded c-MYC mRNA. Here, we uncovered a novel role of nEGFR in radioresistance, and that is, upon ionizing radiation, nEGFR inactivates the ribonuclease activity of PNPase toward c-MYC mRNA through DNAPK-mediated Ser-776 phosphorylation, leading to increase of c-MYC mRNA, which contributes to radioresistance of cancer cells.

Inactivation of EGFR attenuates the interaction of EGFR/PNPase/DNAPK and results in enhanced degradation of c-MYC mRNA by PNPase in breast cancer cells. nEGFR-mediated phosphorylation of PNPase at Ser-776 by DNAPK abolishes the ribonuclease activity of PNPase toward c-MYC mRNA and increases its mRNA level. The elevated level of c-MYC mRNA caused by inactivation of PNPase contributes to radioresistance of cancer cells.

Iressa was a gift from Dr. Chia-Jui Yen (National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan). Human cell lines were grown in DME/F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For total cell lysate extraction, cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4), and then lysed in RIPA Buffer (50 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) by sonication. The soluble extraction was collected from the supernatant after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The cytosolic and nuclear fractions were extracted as follows: cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm HEPES at pH 7, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice, ground in a glass dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant is the cytosolic fraction. The nuclear pellet was isolated and washed. The nuclei were lysed in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) by sonication. Both clones of radio-sensitive (231S) and -resistant (231) MDA-MB 231 cell lines were obtained from The Center for Molecular Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. INM and NP purification were performed as described previously with a slight modification (29Klein C. Gensburger C. Freyermuth S. Nair B.C. Labourdette G. Malviya A.N.

The isolated nuclei in the nuclear fractions extracted using cellular fractionation were resuspended in buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture), incubated with 1% (w/v) sodium citrate at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 30 min, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A and digested with DNase I (250 mg/ml; Sigma) at 4 °C for 14 h. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 h, the supernatant was collected as an NP fraction, and the digested pellet was then recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min in a sucrose gradient to obtain purified INM fractions (30Wang Y.N.

Cell lysates were pre-cleared with protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) in NETN buffer with gentle mixing for 1 h at 4 °C. The pre-cleared lysate were added with appropriate antibody and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Afterward, protein A/G-agarose was added into the mixture and incubated with gentle agitation for another 2 h at 4 °C to capture antibody and its associated proteins. For immunoblotting (IB), cell lysates were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and then hybridized with primary antibody with gentle agitation overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBST, the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon) for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive band was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagent (GE Healthcare). The immunoprecipitated nEGFR was confirmed by sequencing (supplemental Fig. S1). Cultured cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and then further incubated with the appropriate secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas red-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes) (1:500 dilution) for 45 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI before mounting. Confocal fluorescence images were captured using a LSM 710 laser microscope (Zeiss). Total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA in a reaction mixture containing 2.5 μm oligo (dT) primer, 0.5 mm dNTP mixture, 200 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase, 40 units of RNaseOUT, an RNase inhibitor (all from Invitrogen). After incubation at 50 °C for 50 min, the reaction mixture was heat inactivated at 85 °C for 5 min and then treated with 2 units of RNase H at 37 °C for 20 min. The quantitative PCR (q-PCR) was performed by detection of the hydrolyzed fluorescent probes from Universal ProbeLibrary (UPL; Roche) using the LightCycler 480 equipment (Roche). Primers and UPL probes were designed using the ProbeFinder software. The primer sets and the matched UPL probe numbers are as following: c-MYC: 5′-CACCAGCAGCGACTCTGA-3′ (forward), 5′-GATCCAGACTCTGACCTTTTGC-3′ (reverse), and UPL probe 34; β-actin (ACTB): 5′-ATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTC-3′ (forward), 5′-GGATGCCACAGGACTCCAT-3′ (reverse), and UPL probe 11. The q-PCR was examined by incubating the cDNA in a reaction mixture containing, 0.5 μm of each primer, 0.1 μm UPL probe, and 1-fold concentration of Probes Master reagent (Roche). The amplification conditions were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 s. The fluorescent signal was detected at 72 °C step of each cycle. The relative quantification of interested gene was normalized by β-actin, and calculated by the value of cross-point (CP) in each fluorescence curve of each gene. For traditional PCR, the reaction mixture containing 2 μl of cDNA, 0.2 mm dNTP mixture, 2 μm of each primers, 1 unit of TaqDNA polymerase, and 1-fold concentration of ThermalPol Buffer (New England BioLabs) was started by denatured 95 °C for 5 min, followed by amplification of indicated cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The numbers of cycles for amplification of c-MYC and β-actin were 35 and 25, respectively. The primer sequences for these genes are as follows: c-MYC: 5′-GGTCCTCAAGAGGTGCCACG-3′ (forward), 5′-TTACGCACAAGAGTTCCGTAGCTG-3′ (reverse), and β-actin: 5′-GCACTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCC-3′ (forward), 5′-TCACCTTCACCGTTCCAGTTTTT-3′ (reverse). Knock-down of genes were performed with the specific shRNAs delivered by the lentivirus system from National RNAi Core Facility (Academia Sinica) according to the protocol. Briefly, to generate the lentivirus containing specific shRNA, 293T cells were co-transfected with 2.25 μg of pCMV-ΔR8.91 plasmid harboring Gag and Pol genes, 0.25 μg of pMD.G plasmid containing VSV-G gene for expression of envelope glycoprotein, and 2.5 μg of pLKO.1 plasmid bearing the specific shRNA for 16 h, and then cultured in growth medium containing 1% BSA for another 24 h. The cultured medium containing lentivirus was collected and stored at −80 °C as aliquots for further use. To deliver the specific shRNA construct, approximate 80% confluent cells were infected with the lentivirus bearing specific shRNA in growth medium containing 8 μg/ml polybrene and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Afterward, cells were sub-cultured and selected with 4 μg/ml puromycin. The specific shRNAs used are as below, EGFR: TRCN0000039633 (shEGFR-1) and TRCN0000039634 (shEGFR-2) corresponding to the sequences, 5′-GCTGAGAATGTGGAATACCTA-3′ and 5′-GCTGGATGATAGACGCAGATA-3′, respectively; PNPase: TRCN0000035908 (shPNPase-2) and TRCN0000312599 (shPNPase-4) corresponding to the sequences, 5′-GCAAGAGACTTCATTACTGAA-3′ and 5′-GCAAGAGACTTCATTACTGAA-3′, respectively; DNAPK: TRCN0000006257 (shDNAPK-1) and TRCN0000006259 (shDNAPK-2) corresponding to the sequences, 5′-CCAGTGAAAGTCTGAATCATT-3′ and 5′-GCAGCCTTATTACAAAGACAT-3′, respectively; c-MYC: TRCN0000039642 (shMYC-2) and TRCN0000174055 (shMYC-5) corresponding to the sequences, 5′-CCTGAGACAGATCAGCAACAA-3′ and 5′-GAATGTCAAGAGGCGAACACA-3′, respectively. The shRNA construct against luciferase (shLuc), TRCN0000072244 referring to the sequence, 5′-ATCACAGAATCGTCGTATGCA-3′ was used as negative control. Tandem mass (MS/MS) experiments were performed with an LTQ-FT ICR MS (Thermo Electron) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (New Objective), an Agilent 1100 Series binary HPLC pump (Agilent Technologies) and a Famos autosampler (LC Packings). Tryptic peptide mixtures were injected at a 10 μl/min flow rate into a self packed pre-column with reverse phase C18 nano-column (75 μm I.D. × 200 mm) that used Magic C18AQ resin (particle size, 5 μm; pore size, 200 Å; Michrom Bioresources). The analytic program was set at a linear gradient from 10 to 50% buffer B with a 60 min running cycle and a split flow rate 300 nl/min. The full-scan survey MS experiment (m/z 320–2000) was executed in FT ICR MS with mass resolution of 100,000 at m/z 400. The top ten most abundant multiply charged ions detected in the scan, which is above a minimum threshold of 1,000 counts, were sequentially isolated for MS/MS by LTQ. Singly charged ions were rejected for MS/MS sequencing. Wild-type PNPase was cloned into the pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). PNPaseS776A or PNPaseS776D mutant was generated by QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instruction manual. To purify recombinant proteins by the bacteria expression system, each construct was subcloned into pET29a vector containing His-tag (Novagen). The constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent cells. The recombinant proteins were induced by 0.2 mm IPTG in bacteria culture. After lysing the bacteria, the recombinant proteins were purified with Ni-NTA resin (Invitrogen). DNAPK was isolated by immunoprecipitation with specific antibody from MDA-MB 468 cells. Each recombinant PNPase protein was incubated with immunoprecipitated DNAPK in the kinase buffer (60 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 3 μm Na3VO4, 1.25 mm DTT, 200 μm ATP) at 30 °C for 30 min. The mixture was then separated on SDS-PAGE. The serine phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody. The in vitro translation was performed with the TNT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In brief, V5-tagged pPNPase, pPNPaseS776A, or pPNPaseS776D plasmid was individually incubated with the reaction mixture containing 20 μm methionine and 1× TNT Quick Master Mix at 30 °C for 90 min. The in vitro mRNA degradation assay was carried out as previously described (32Sarkar D. Park E.S. Emdad L. Randolph A. Valerie K. Fisher P.B. Defining the domains of human polynucleotide phosphorylase (hPNPaseOLD-35) mediating cellular senescence.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Five micrograms of total RNA from MDA-MB 468 cells were incubated with 5 μl of each in vitro-translated or immunoprecipitated PNPase protein in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 mm ATP, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, and 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 0 to 2 h. After incubation, the RNA was purified and the amount of c-MYC mRNA was determined by RT-PCR and q-PCR as aforementioned. The PNPase activity was measured by the relative mRNA intensity of c-MYC/β-actin. The activity of PNPasae in normal cell culture condition was defined as 100%. Cell viability was determined by WST-1 (4-[3-(4-Iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate) assay (Roche). Cells were irradiated with or without indicated dosage of IR. After culturing for another 2 days, one-tenth volume of WST-1 was added at 4 h before harvest, and the absorbance was detected at 450 nm. Cell viability was normalized by the absorbance from the cells without IR exposure. To address the roles of nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) in response to radioresistance in breast cancer, we compared the interactome of EGFR upon ionizing radiation (IR) from cytosolic and nuclear lysates of MDA-MB 468 cells by immunoprecipitation with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. A nuclear EGFR-associated protein around 75 kDa was increased after IR exposure and identified as PNPase by electrospray ionization tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry analysis (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the co-localization of EGFR and PNPase in the nucleus was also increased after IR exposure (Fig. 1B; white spots in inset 4). To further confirm the nuclear location of EGFR-PNPase complexes, we examined the sequential photosections of a nucleus and showed that the EGFR-PNPase complexes were clearly detected in middle sections in MDA-MB 468 cells (planes 10–14, supplemental Fig. S2). We further validated their interaction by immunoblotting against PNPase in the EGFR-immunoprecipitated complexes. As shown in Fig. 1C, the interaction between EGFR and PNPase in the nucleus of MDA-MB 468, MDA-MB 231, and A431 cells (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S3) was reduced by the addition of AG1478, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In addition, we further demonstrated that nEGFR associated with PNPase in the non-membrane-embedded form as their interaction occurred mainly in the nucleoplasm (NP) but not the inner nuclear membrane (INM) fraction (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that EGFR and PNPase interact mainly in the NP, and their interaction requires the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and is enhanced upon IR exposure. From above, we showed that nEGFR interacts with PNPase. Next, to investigate if and how EGFR regulates PNPase activity, we first determined whether EGFR phosphorylates PNPase. The endogenous PNPase protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal anti-PNPase antibody from the nucleus of MDA-MB 468 cells, and its phosphorylation sites in vivo was identified by tandem mass (MS-MS) spectrometric analysis. Although no tyrosine phosphorylation was identified in vivo, we reproducibly identified specific peptides containing phosphorylated serine residue at Ser-776 of PNPase, and this serine residue was conserved among mouse, rat, and human (Fig. 2A), suggesting that Ser-776 phosphorylation of PNPase is an evolutionarily conserved event and associated with important functions. We then used the NetworKIN software (33Linding R. Jensen L.J. Ostheimer G.J. van Vugt M.A. Jørgensen C. Miron I.M. Diella F. Colwill K. Taylor L. Elder K. Metalnikov P. Nguyen V. Pasculescu A. Jin J.

To determine whether ATM or DNAPK phosphorylates Ser-776 of PNPase, we carried out immunoprecipitatio"
https://openalex.org/W2077014402,"Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that shuttles between the cytosol and nucleus. The fine balance between nuclear import and export of TR has emerged as a critical control point for modulating thyroid hormone-responsive gene expression; however, sequence motifs of TR that mediate shuttling are not fully defined. Here, we characterized multiple signals that direct TR shuttling. Along with the known nuclear localization signal in the hinge domain, we identified a novel nuclear localization signal in the A/B domain of thyroid hormone receptor α1 that is absent in thyroid hormone receptor β1 and inactive in the oncoprotein v-ErbA. Our prior studies showed that thyroid hormone receptor α1 exits the nucleus through two pathways, one dependent on the export factor CRM1 and the other CRM1-independent. Here, we identified three novel CRM1-independent nuclear export signal (NES) motifs in the ligand-binding domain as follows: a highly conserved NES in helix 12 (NES-H12) and two additional NES sequences spanning helix 3 and helix 6, respectively. Mutations predicted to disrupt the α-helical structure resulted in a significant decrease in NES-H12 activity. The high degree of conservation of helix 12 suggests that this region may function as a key NES in other nuclear receptors. Furthermore, our mutagenesis studies on NES-H12 suggest that altered shuttling of thyroid hormone receptor β1 may be a contributing factor in resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome. Taken together, our findings provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of the multiple signals that work together to regulate TR shuttling and transcriptional activity, and they provide important insights into nuclear receptor function in general.

Protein transport into and out of the nucleus occurs through nuclear pore complexes embedded in the nuclear envelope. Import and export of proteins through the nuclear pore complexes are mediated by karyopherins, which bind to a nuclear localization signal (NLS) 3The abbreviations used are: NLSnuclear localization signalTRthyroid hormone receptorTRα1thyroid hormone receptor α1TRβ1thyroid hormone receptor β1NESnuclear export signalLMBleptomycin BT3thyroid hormoneDBDDNA-binding domainLBDligand-binding domainGRglucocorticoid receptorARandrogen receptorG3GFP-GST-GFP vectorCRM1chromosome region maintenance 1RTHresistance to thyroid hormoneNnuclearCcytosolicTREthyroid hormone-responsive element. or nuclear export signal (NES) present in the cargo protein. The most well studied NLS sequences are the classical monopartite and bipartite NLS motifs, exemplified by the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T-antigen NLS (PKKKRKV) and nucleoplasmin (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK), respectively (1McLane L.M. Corbett A.H. Nuclear localization signals and human disease.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Other nonclassical NLS motifs have been defined, and it is likely that many more remain uncharacterized. NES motifs have remained difficult to predict, with only the prototypical chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent leucine-rich NES sequence being well characterized (2Kutay U. Güttinger S. Leucine-rich nuclear export signals. Born to be weak.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In recent years the importance of regulated nucleocytoplasmic transport in gene regulation has become apparent, and there is strong interest in identifying novel NLS and NES motifs (3Umemoto T.

Our interest for many years has been in the mechanisms regulating the nuclear import and export of thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1 and NR1A1a), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are encoded by two genes, one for TRα and another for TRβ, which encode the major isoforms of TR, including TRα1, TRα2, TRβ1, and TRβ2. Both TRα1 and TRβ1 shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm; however, they localize primarily to the nucleus at steady state (6Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the thyroid hormone receptor α.Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), where they either activate or repress target gene expression in response to thyroid hormone (7Zhang J. Lazar M.A. The mechanism of action of thyroid hormones.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 8Lazar M.A. Thyroid hormone action. A binding contract.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization is critical for the gene regulatory function of TR. For example, mislocalization of TRα1 to the cytoplasm by its oncogenic homolog v-ErbA may contribute to oncogenic conversion of cells (9Bonamy G.M. Allison L.A. Oncogenic conversion of the thyroid hormone receptor by altered nuclear transport.Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2006; 4: e008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bonamy G.M. Guiochon-Mantel A. Allison L.A. Cancer promoted by the oncoprotein v-ErbA may be due to subcellular mislocalization of nuclear receptors.Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1213-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is clear that a comprehensive understanding of TR trafficking must take into account both nuclear import and export pathways. Nuclear receptors share significant similarity in the DNA-binding domain (DBD), hinge region, and ligand-binding domain (LBD); however, they show variability in their N-terminal A/B domain and in the region C-terminal to the LBD (11Laudet V. Evolution of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Early diversification from an ancestral orphan receptor.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Although an NLS in the hinge domain has been partially characterized for TRs (12Baumann C.T. Maruvada P. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. Nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling by thyroid hormone receptors.J. Biol.

However, a wealth of information regarding NLS motifs is available from other nuclear receptors. For example, the rat constitutive androstane receptor has a ligand-independent NLS in its hinge region, as well as a ligand-dependent NLS in its LBD (17Kanno Y. Suzuki M. Miyazaki Y. Matsuzaki M. Nakahama T. Kurose K. Sawada J. Inouye Y. Difference in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequences of rat and human constitutive active/androstane receptor.Biochim. Biophys.

Highlighting the modular nature of nuclear receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has a bipartite NLS in its DBD and a ligand-dependent NLS in its LBD (19Picard D. Yamamoto K.R.

In contrast, only one NLS located in the DBD has been identified in the retinoid X receptor (24Prüfer K. Barsony J. Retinoid X receptor dominates the nuclear import and export of the unliganded vitamin D receptor.Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Many structural studies of TRα1 have been performed to correlate structural motifs with particular functions of the receptor. For example, the N-terminal A/B domain of nuclear receptors has a random coiled structure (25Kumar R. Thompson E.B. Transactivation functions of the N-terminal domains of nuclear hormone receptors. Protein folding and coactivator interactions.Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the LBD of TRα1 has 12 α-helices and four β-sheets (26Wagner R.L.

Helix 12, in addition to its role in ligand binding, also has a transactivation function termed AF-2 that is necessary for coactivator binding and release of corepressors upon ligand binding (27Baniahmad A.

Similarly, the A/B domain of TR has a transactivation function termed AF-1 (30Tomura H. Lazar J. Phyillaier M. Nikodem V.M.

However, these previous studies did not address the question of whether known structural features of TRα1 include signals for nuclear import and export. Our prior studies have revealed an increasingly complex picture of TRα1 nuclear export, involving multiple pathways and export factors. We have shown that TRα1 uses both the export factor CRM1 in cooperation with calreticulin for its nuclear export and a second CRM1-independent pathway (33Grespin M.E. Bonamy G.M. Roggero V.R. Cameron N.G. Adam L.E. Atchison A.P. Fratto V.M. Allison L.A. Thyroid hormone receptor α1 follows a cooperative CRM1/calreticulin-mediated nuclear export pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25576-25588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, this study did not address the specific sequence determinants involved in nuclear export of TRα1. CRM1 mediates the nuclear export of proteins with leucine-rich NES sequences (34Cook A. Bono F. Jinek M. Conti E. Structural biology of nucleocytoplasmic transport.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Even though some members of the nuclear receptor family have CRM1-independent NES sequences, it is not known what other karyopherins are involved in these alternative export pathways (35Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Mechanisms of receptor-mediated nuclear import and nuclear export.Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). There is some limited information available on the protein cargos exported by these other karyopherins (36Tran E.J. Bolger T.A. Wente S.R. SnapShot. Nuclear transport.Cell. 2007; 131: 420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Fried H. Kutay U. Nucleocytoplasmic transport. Taking an inventory.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar); however, there is limited understanding of the sequence determinants for the export of proteins that use a CRM1-independent pathway. In this report we have identified a novel NLS, designated NLS-2, in the A/B domain of TRα1 that is absent in TRβ1, and a novel, conserved CRM1-independent NES in the AF-2 region of helix 12 in the TRα1 LBD, designated NES-H12. Mutations in this NES markedly reduce both nuclear export and transactivation of thyroid hormone-mediated gene expression. We also provide evidence for additional NES activity in the region spanning helix 3 (NES-H3) and helix 6 (NES-H6) of the TRα1 LBD. The NLS and NES motifs were shown to be sufficient to target a cytosolic protein to the nucleus or a nuclear protein to the cytosol, respectively. In addition, NLS-2 and NES-H12 were shown to be necessary for efficient import or export in the context of the full-length receptor. Conservation of targeting signals among the vertebrate species suggests that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is crucial for the normal function of TRα1. Indeed, our mutagenesis studies point to the intriguing possibility that altered shuttling of TRβ1, due to defective nuclear export, may be a contributing factor in resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome. These findings highlight the complexity of the signals that regulate the shuttling of TR and emphasize the importance of detailed molecular characterization for understanding nuclear receptor function. Rat TRα1 domains, NLS, and NES constructs, chicken TRα1 (cTRα1) A/B domain, and v-ErbA A/B domain (excluding the retroviral Gag sequence) were cloned as PCR products into a GFP-GST-GFP (G3) expression vector (designed by Ghislain Bonamy) as C-terminal tags. Oligonucleotides used for cloning were annealed, digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease, and purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Digested oligonucleotides were ligated into the G3 vector. A/B domain mutations were made using QuikChange® mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Mutagenesis primers were designed using QuikChange® primer design program. GFP-TRα1 and GFP-v-ErbA expression vectors were constructed as described previously (6Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the thyroid hormone receptor α.Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The expression vector for GFP-tagged human TRβ1 (accession number BC106929), cloned into pReceiver-M29 vector, was obtained from Capital Biosciences (Rockville, MD). PCR primers and short oligonucleotides used in cloning were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA). A list of primer pairs along with the cloning sites and the source vector used in this study are presented in supplemental Table S1. Sequences of individual primers and oligonucleotides are listed in supplemental Table S2. HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For transfection, 7.5–8.0 × 105 cells were plated on 40-mm coverslips (Bioptech, Butler, PA) in 60-mm plates. The next day cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were analyzed by live cell imaging. For ligand-dependent nuclear translocation experiments, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with charcoal dextran-stripped FBS. For FRAP analysis (see below), 4.5 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded in 35-mm glass bottom dishes (Mattek, Ashland, MA), followed by transfection with 0.75 μg of GFP-tagged TRα1 or TRβ1 expression plasmids and 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. In addition, cells were treated with 200 ng of cytochalasin D (Sigma) for 16 h (either pre-or post-transfection) to promote nuclear division in the absence of cytokinesis. Subsequently, cells were washed in minimum Eagle's medium to remove residual cytochalasin D for at least 23 h prior to FRAP analysis. Cells were placed in a Focht Chamber System 2 (FCS2 ®, Bioptech) and maintained at 37 °C. MEM without supplements or phenol red was preincubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2, prior to use in live cell imaging experiments. Medium was replaced once per h for experiments lasting more than 1 h. Where indicated, medium contained 9.3 nm LMB (Sigma) and 100 nm T3 (Sigma) to monitor CRM1-dependent nuclear export and ligand-dependent nuclear import. Images were captured using a Nikon Plan apo-60×/1.20 water immersion objective and a CoolSnap HQ2 CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). GFP was visualized using Blue Excitation, B-2E/C filter block (Nikon). Image capturing and analysis were carried out using Nikon NIS-elements Version 3.1. For time lapse imaging experiments, images were captured at 3-min intervals. The intracellular distribution patterns of NES and NLS constructs were visualized by GFP fluorescence in live cells, as described above. NLS constructs were scored in replicate experiments as primarily nuclear (N), nuclear accumulation and a clearly visible cytosolic population (N > C), whole cell (N ≤ C), and primarily cytosolic (C). The efficiency of nuclear import was measured as an increase in the number of cells with a primarily nuclear distribution of the NLS construct. NES constructs were scored in the same categories, except cells scored as N > C and N ≤ C were combined into one category (C). The efficiency of nuclear export was measured as an increase in the number of cells with a cytosolic localization of the NES constructs. Mutations that inhibit nuclear export showed an increase in nuclear retention. The kinetics of shuttling of NES-H12 mutants and wild-type TRα1 and TRβ1 were carried out using FRAP analysis. All FRAP experiments were performed in an Okolab incubation system (Okolab, Italy) for a Nikon Ti-E PFS-A1 confocal system at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and 37% humidity. Imaging was carried out using an Apo LWD 40× WIS DIC N2 objective. One of the two nuclei in a single multinucleated cell was photobleached at 45% laser power for 17 s using the 488 nm line. Fluorescence recovery of the bleached nucleus was monitored every 2 min for 16 min and every 5 min for another 50 min. Protein synthesis was inhibited by 25 μg/ml cycloheximide during the imaging period. Cell plasma membranes were visualized with CellMaskTM deep red plasma membrane stain as per the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). This labeling was used to confirm the presence of more than one nucleus in a single cell. For quantitative analysis of digitized images, fluorescent intensity values were generated using NIS-Elements AR (Nikon). Data were expressed as percent intensity of recovery. For TRβ1, time 0 was set as 2 min, to minimize the contribution of the small cytosolic population (≤ 15%) toward recovery rates. The recovery rate of mutant versus wild-type proteins was plotted for GFP-TRα1 and GFP-TRβ1. HeLa cells were plated at 6.0–7.0 × 105 cells in 100-mm dishes and transiently transfected for 6–7 h with 5 μg of tk-TREp-CAT reporter plasmid containing a synthetic palindromic thyroid hormone-responsive element (TRE), and 5 μg of GFP-TRα1, GFP-TRβ1, or GFP-TRα1 mutant expression plasmids (GFP-TRα1 F401A, GFP-TRα1 F401P, GFP-TRα1 R26H), or 5 μg of empty vector (pCAT®3-Basic Vector). Medium was replaced 12 h post-transfection with MEM containing 10% charcoal-dextran stripped FBS (Invitrogen) supplemented with or without 100 nm T3 (Sigma). After 12 h, cells were lysed, cell extracts prepared, and extracts were used to determine CAT expression levels by ELISA according to the manufacturer's specifications (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined by Nano Drop (ND-1000 Spectrophotometer) and adjusted to the same amount of total protein (600 μg). For each assay, a standard curve utilizing four pure protein standards was prepared, to ensure that CAT concentrations of sample extracts fell within the linear range of the assay. Replicate samples were assayed in each microplate. Prior studies suggest that the hinge region of both TRα1 and TRβ1 contains a classical NLS (13Casas F. Busson M. Grandemange S. Seyer P. Carazo A.

To begin to map the hinge NLS in rat TRα1, we cloned the hinge region into a G3 vector for expression as C-terminal fusion protein with the G3 tag (Fig. 1A). The G3-Hinge fusion protein has a number of important properties; it can be tracked in real time in transiently transfected cells; it is too large for diffusion through the nuclear pore complex, and it serves the purpose of demonstrating that a putative NLS is sufficient to target G3, a cytosolic protein, to the nucleus. The expression vector for G3-Hinge was transfected into HeLa cells, and the fusion protein was analyzed for its ability to localize to the nucleus or cytosol, in comparison with GFP-tagged full-length TRα1 and G3 alone (Fig. 1B). GFP-TRα1 has a predominantly nuclear localization, although G3 is entirely cytosolic. As expected, the hinge domain was sufficient to localize G3 to the nucleus. Based on earlier predictions for the hinge region NLS of TRα1 (38Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Two interdependent basic domains in nucleoplasmin nuclear targeting sequence. Identification of a class of bipartite nuclear targeting sequence.Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), a minimal sequence was cloned into the G3 vector. This minimal sequence of the hinge region, designated NLS-1 (KRVAKRKLIEQNRERRRK), was sufficient to target the G3 fusion protein to the nucleus (Fig. 1B). This bipartite NLS is well conserved in both the oncoprotein v-ErbA and TRβ1 (Fig. 1C). Earlier studies had shown that the hinge region of TRα1 only partially targeted a cytosolic protein to the nucleus (14Lee Y. Mahdavi V.

To determine whether TRα1 does indeed have a second NLS apart from NLS1 in the hinge domain, a G3-tagged TRα1 A/B domain fusion protein was examined for its intracellular distribution (Fig. 2A). In support of our predictions, the A/B domain construct localized to the nucleus, indicating that the A/B domain has an NLS sufficient to direct G3, a cytosolic protein, to the nucleus (Fig. 2B).

Insulin suppresses HGP by phosphorylating CBP and disassembling the CREB-CBP complex from gluconeogenic genes. p300 is closely related to CBP; but in contrast to CBP, p300 binds constitutively to CREB due to the absence of phosphorylation site found in CBP. In a phosphorylation-competent p300(G442S) knock-in mouse model, we demonstrate that HGP is now exquisitely sensitive to insulin suppression. p300(G422S) and hepatic-deleted p300 mice exhibited significant lower blood glucose levels in the fasted and post-prandial states, indicating a role for p300 in maintaining basal HGP."
https://openalex.org/W2003403825,"The hop (Humulus lupulus L.), a component of beer, is a sedative plant whose pharmacological activity is principally due to its bitter resins, in particular to the α-acid degradation product 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol. The mechanism of action of hop resin consists of raising the levels of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter acting in the central nervous system (CNS).To analyze the sedative effect of hops as a component of non-alcoholic beer on the sleep/wake rhythm in a work-stressed population.The experiment was conducted with healthy female nurses (n = 17) working rotating and/or night shifts. Overnight sleep and chronobiological parameters were assessed by actigraphy (Actiwatch®) after moderate ingestion of non-alcoholic beer containing hops (333 ml with 0.0% alcohol) with supper for 14 days (treatment). Data were obtained in comparison with her own control group without consumption of beer during supper.Actigraphy results demonstrated improvement of night sleep quality as regards the most important parameters: Sleep Latency diminished (p≤0.05) in the Treatment group (12.01±1.19 min) when compared to the Control group (20.50±4.21 min), as also did Total Activity (p≤0.05; Treatment group = 5284.78±836.99 activity pulses vs Control = 7258.78±898.89 activity pulses). In addition, anxiety as indexed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) decreased in the Treatment group (State Anxiety 18.09±3.8 vs Control 20.69±2.14).The moderate consumption of non-alcoholic beer will favour night-time rest, due in particular to its hop components, in addition to its other confirmed benefits for the organism."
https://openalex.org/W2044248178,"Septins comprise a conserved family of GTPases important in cytokinesis. These proteins polymerize into filaments from rod-shaped heteromeric septin complexes. Septins interact with one another at two interfaces (NC and G) that alternate within the complex. Here, we show that small mutations at the N terminus greatly enhance the formation of SEPT2 homopolymers. Taking advantage of this mutation to examine polymer formation using SEPT2 alone, we show that both NC and G interfaces are required for filament formation. However, co-expression of wild type SEPT2 with SEPT2 containing mutations at either NC or G interfaces revealed that only the NC mutant suppressed filament formation. NC mutants are able to interact with one another at putative G interfaces, whereas G mutants fail to interact at NC interfaces. In addition, all promiscuous septin pairwise interactions occur at the G interface. These findings suggest that G interface interactions must occur before NC interactions during polymer formation."

However, it remains to be determined how isoflurane interacts with the full ectodomain LFA-1 and modulates its conformation and function. Isoflurane binding sites on the full ectodomain LFA-1 were probed by photolabeling using photoactivatable isoflurane (azi-isoflurane). The adducted residues were determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Separately, docking simulations were performed to predict binding sites. Point mutations were introduced around isoflurane binding sites. The significance of isoflurane's effect was assessed in both intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) binding assays and epitope mapping of activation-sensitive antibodies using flow cytometry. Two isoflurane binding sites were identified using photolabeling and were further validated by the docking simulation: one at the hydrophobic pocket in the ICAM-1 binding domain (the αI domain); the other at the βI domain. Mutagenesis of the α′1 helix showed that isoflurane binding sites at the βI domain were significantly important in modulating LFA-1 function and conformation. Epitope mapping using activation-sensitive antibodies suggested that isoflurane stabilized LFA-1 in the closed conformation. This study suggested that isoflurane binds to both the αI and βI domains allosteric to the ICAM-1 binding site, and that isoflurane binding stabilizes LFA-1 in the closed conformation.—Yuki, K., Bu, W., Xi, J., Sen, M., Shimaoka, M., Eckenhof, R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2016113010,"In influenza, the envelope protein hemagglutinin (HA) plays a critical role in viral entry by first binding to sialic acid receptors on the cell surface and subsequently mediating fusion of the viral and target membranes. In this work, the receptor binding properties of influenza A HA from different subtypes (H1 A/California/04/09, H5 A/Vietnam/1205/04, H5 A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1A/05, and H9 A/Hong Kong/1073/99) have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Using saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR, we find that all HAs bind to the receptor analogs 2,3-sialyllactose and 2,6-sialyllactose, with subtle differences in the binding mode. Using competition STD NMR, we determine the receptor preferences for the HA subtypes. We find that H5-Qinghai and H9-Hong Kong HA bind to both receptor analogs with similar affinity. On the other hand, H1 exhibits a clear preference for 2,6-sialyllactose while H5-Vietnam exhibits a clear preference for 2,3-sialyllactose. Together, these results are interpreted within the context of differences in both the amino acid sequence and structures of HA from the different subtypes in determining receptor preference."
https://openalex.org/W2021291780,"Desert mound springs of the Great Artesian Basin in central Australia maintain an endemic fauna that have historically been considered ubiquitous throughout all of the springs. Recent studies, however, have shown that several endemic invertebrate species are genetically highly structured and contain previously unrecognised species, suggesting that individuals may be geographically 'stranded in desert islands'. Here we further tested the generality of this hypothesis by conducting genetic analyses of the obligate aquatic phreatoicid isopod Phreatomerus latipes. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships amongst P. latipes individuals were examined using a multilocus approach comprising allozymes and mtDNA sequence data. From the Lake Eyre region in South Australia we collected data for 476 individuals from 69 springs for the mtDNA gene COI; in addition, allozyme electrophoresis was conducted on 331 individuals from 19 sites for 25 putative loci. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses showed three major clades in both allozyme and mtDNA data, with a further nine mtDNA sub-clades, largely supported by the allozymes. Generally, each of these sub-clades was concordant with a traditional geographic grouping known as spring complexes. We observed a coalescent time between ∼2-15 million years ago for haplotypes within each of the nine mtDNA sub-clades, whilst an older total time to coalescence (>15 mya) was observed for the three major clades. Overall we observed that multiple layers of phylogeographic history are exemplified by Phreatomerus, suggesting that major climate events and their impact on the landscape have shaped the observed high levels of diversity and endemism. Our results show that this genus reflects a diverse fauna that existed during the early Miocene and appears to have been regionally restricted. Subsequent aridification events have led to substantial contraction of the original habitat, possibly over repeated Pleistocene ice age cycles, with P. latipes populations becoming restricted in the distribution to desert springs."
https://openalex.org/W2050706714,"Background The clinical, radiological and pathological similarities between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis can make disease differentiation challenging. A complicating factor is that some cases of sarcoidosis may be initiated by mycobacteria. We hypothesised that immunological profiling might provide insight into a possible relationship between the diseases or allow us to distinguish between them. Methods We analysed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in sarcoidosis (n = 18), tuberculosis (n = 12) and healthy volunteers (n = 16). We further investigated serum samples in the same groups; sarcoidosis (n = 40), tuberculosis (n = 15) and healthy volunteers (n = 40). A cross-sectional analysis of multiple cytokine profiles was performed and data used to discriminate between samples. Results We found that BAL profiles were indistinguishable between both diseases and significantly different from healthy volunteers. In sera, tuberculosis patients had significantly lower levels of the Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) than those with sarcoidosis (p = 0.004). Additional serum differences allowed us to create a linear regression model for disease differentiation (within-sample accuracy 91%, cross-validation accuracy 73%). Conclusions These data warrant replication in independent cohorts to further develop and validate a serum cytokine signature that may be able to distinguish sarcoidosis from tuberculosis. Systemic Th2 cytokine differences between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis may also underly different disease outcomes to similar respiratory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2117522253,"Background Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key factors in the innate immune system and initiate the inflammatory response to foreign pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. In the microenvironment of tumorigenesis, TLRs can promote inflammation and cell survival. Toll-like receptor 2/6 (TLR2/6) signaling in tumor cells is regarded as one of the mechanisms of chronic inflammation but it can also mediate tumor cell immune escape and tumor progression. However, the expression of TLR2 and its biological function in the development and progression of hepatocarcinoma have not been investigated. This study aimed to determine the expression of TLRs 1–10 in the established human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BLE-7402, to investigate the biological effect of TLR2 on cell growth and survival. Methods TLR expression in BLE-7402 cells was assayed by RT-PCR, real-time PCR and flow cytometry (FCM). To further investigate the function of TLR2 in hepatocarcinoma growth, BLE-7402 cells were transfected with recombinant plasmids expressing one of three forms of TLR2 siRNA (sh-TLR2 RNAi(A, B and C)). TLR2 knockdown was confirmed using RT-PCR, real-time PCR and fluorescence microscopy. Tumor cell proliferation was monitored by MTT assay and secreted cytokines in the supernatant of transfected cells were measured by bead-based FCM, the function of TLR2 siRNA was also investigated in vivo. Results The BLE-7402 cell line expressed TLRs 2 to 10 at both mRNA and protein levels. TLR2 was the most highly expressed TLR. While all the three siRNAs inhibited TLR2 mRNA and protein expression, sh-TLR2 RNAi(B) had the strongest knockdown effect. TLR2 knockdown with sh-TLR2 RNAi(B) reduced cell proliferation. Furthermore, secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 was also reduced. The result showed a drastic reduction in tumor volume in mice treated with sh-TLR2 RNAi(B). Discussion These results suggest that TLR2 knockdown inhibit proliferation of cultured hepatocarcinoma cells and decrease the secretion of cytokines. It is suggested that TLR2 silencing may worth further investigations for siRNA based gene therapy in treatment of hepatocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2100300753,"The aspiration to mimic and accelerate natural evolution has fueled interest in directed evolution experiments, which endow or enhance functionality in enzymes. Barring a few de novo approaches, most methods take a template protein having the desired activity, known active site residues and structure, and proceed to select a target protein which has a pre-existing scaffold congruent to the template motif. Previously, we have established a computational method (CLASP) based on spatial and electrostatic properties to detect active sites, and a method to quantify promiscuity in proteins. We exploit the prospect of promiscuous active sites to serve as the starting point for directed evolution and present a method to select a target protein which possesses a significant partial match with the template scaffold (DECAAF). A library of partial motifs, constructed from the active site residues of the template protein, is used to rank a set of target proteins based on maximal significant matches with the partial motifs, and cull out the best candidate from the reduced set as the target protein. Considering the scenario where this 'incubator' protein lacks activity, we identify mutations in the target protein that will mirror the template motif by superimposing the target and template protein based on the partial match. Using this superimposition technique, we analyzed the less than expected gain of activity achieved by an attempt to induce β-lactamase activity in a penicillin binding protein (PBP) (PBP-A from T. elongatus), and attributed this to steric hindrance from neighboring residues. We also propose mutations in PBP-5 from E. coli, which does not have similar steric constraints. The flow details have been worked out in an example which aims to select a substitute protein for human neutrophil elastase, preferably related to grapevines, in a chimeric anti-microbial enzyme which bolsters the innate immune defense system of grapevines."
https://openalex.org/W2025712675,"IgE, the antibody that mediates allergic responses, acts as part of a self-regulating protein network. Its unique effector functions are controlled through interactions of its Fc region with two cellular receptors, FcεRI on mast cells and basophils and CD23 on B cells. IgE cross-linked by allergen triggers mast cell activation via FcεRI, whereas IgE-CD23 interactions control IgE expression levels. We have determined the CD23 binding site on IgE, using a combination of NMR chemical shift mapping and site-directed mutagenesis. We show that the CD23 and FcεRI interaction sites are at opposite ends of the Cε3 domain of IgE, but that receptor binding is mutually inhibitory, mediated by an allosteric mechanism. This prevents CD23-mediated cross-linking of IgE bound to FcεRI on mast cells and resulting antigen-independent anaphylaxis. The mutually inhibitory nature of receptor binding provides a degree of autonomy for the individual activities mediated by IgE-FcεRI and IgE-CD23 interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2049639243,"Cardiac valve defects are a common congenital heart malformation and a significant clinical problem. Defining molecular factors in cardiac valve development has facilitated identification of underlying causes of valve malformation. Gene disruption in zebrafish revealed a critical role for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) in valve development, so this gene was screened for polymorphisms in a patient population suffering from cardiac valve defects. Two genetic substitutions were identified and predicted to encode missense mutations of arginine 141 to cysteine and glutamate 416 to aspartate, respectively. Using a zebrafish model of defective heart valve formation caused by morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown of UGDH, transcripts encoding the UGDH R141C or E416D mutant enzymes were unable to restore cardiac valve formation and could only partially rescue cardiac edema. Characterization of the mutant recombinant enzymes purified from Escherichia coli revealed modest alterations in the enzymatic activity of the mutants and a significant reduction in the half-life of enzyme activity at 37 °C. This reduction in activity could be propagated to the wild-type enzyme in a 1:1 mixed reaction. Furthermore, the quaternary structure of both mutants, normally hexameric, was destabilized to favor the dimeric species, and the intrinsic thermal stability of the R141C mutant was highly compromised. The results are consistent with the reduced function of both missense mutations significantly reducing the ability of UGDH to provide precursors for cardiac cushion formation, which is essential to subsequent valve formation. The identification of these polymorphisms in patient populations will help identify families genetically at risk for valve defects."
https://openalex.org/W2023662109,"p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and PAK3 belong to group I of the PAK family and control cell movement and division. They also regulate dendritic spine formation and maturation in the brain, and play a role in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. PAK3, in particular, is known for its implication in X-linked intellectual disability. The pak3 gene is expressed in neurons as a GTPase-regulated PAK3a protein and also as three splice variants which display constitutive kinase activity. PAK1 regulation is based on its homodimerization, forming an inactive complex. Here, we analyze the PAK3 capacity to dimerize and show that although PAK3a is able to homodimerize, it is more likely to form heterodimeric complexes with PAK1. We further show that two intellectual disability mutations impair dimerization with PAK1. The b and c inserts present in the regulatory domain of PAK3 splice variants decrease the dimerization but retain the capacity to form heterodimers with PAK1. PAK1 and PAK3 are co-expressed in neurons, are colocalized within dendritic spines, co-purify with post-synaptic densities, and co-immunoprecipitate in brain lysates. Using kinase assays, we demonstrate that PAK1 inhibits the activity of PAK3a but not of the splice variant PAK3b in a trans-regulatory manner. Altogether, these results show that PAK3 and PAK1 signaling may be coordinated by heterodimerization."

Clusters were formed using the k-means method and their relationship with 115 variables from the areas of life habits, socioeconomic status and health was examined. Results Four clusters were identified for both genders. Individuals from Cluster I are characterized by high persistence, low extravagance and disorderliness. They have healthy life habits, and lowest scores in most of the measures for psychiatric disorders. Cluster II individuals are characterized by low harm avoidance and high novelty seeking. They report the best physical capacity and highest level of income, but also high rate of divorce, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Individuals from Cluster III are not characterized by any extreme characteristic. Individuals from Cluster IV are characterized by high levels of harm avoidance, low levels of exploratory excitability and attachment, and score the lowest in most measures of health and well-being. Conclusions This study shows that the temperament subscales do not distribute randomly but have an endogenous structure, and that these patterns have strong associations to health, life events, and well-being."

Baseline serum fetuin A, chemerin levels, conicity index and anthropometric parameters were checked. Presence of hepatic steatosis was qualified by liver ultrasound and quantified by the hepato-renal index (HRI); central obesity defined by waist circumference (WC). ROC analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses for prediction of hepatic steatosis and central obesity on the basis of fetuin A/chemerin levels, anthropometric parameters, and other relevant covariates were performed.Data from 103 women and 113 men (mean age 60±12 years) were analyzed. Eighty subjects had hepatic steatosis and their HRIs were significantly higher than those without hepatic steatosis (P<0.001). Serum fetuin A levels were positively associated with HRIs (P<0.001) and chemerin levels (P<0.001). Fetuin A, chemerin and WC were predictors for hepatic steatosis and central obesity by ROC curve. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, fetuin A and WC independently predicted hepatic steatosis defined by HRIs. And chemerin predicted central obesity and regional adiposity after covariate adjustments (all P<0.05).Serum fetuin A levels were higher in prevalent HD patients with hepatic steatosis, and positively correlated with chemerin levels.

Since there is an asymmetry in the degree to which emotional information is conveyed by the face, with the left side being more expressive than the right, we hypothesised that academics in the sciences would seek to pose as non-emotional rationalists and put their right cheek forward, while academics in the arts would express their emotionality and pose with the left cheek forward. We sourced 5829 pictures of academics from their University websites and found that, consistent with the hypotheses, there was a significant difference in the direction of face posing between science academics and English academics with English academics showing a more leftward orientation. Academics in the Fine Arts and Performing Arts however, did not show the expected left cheek forward bias. We also analysed profile pictures of psychology academics and found a greater bias toward presenting the left check compared to science academics which makes psychologists appear more like arts academics than scientists. These findings indicate that the personal website pictures of academics mirror the cultural perceptions of emotional expressiveness across disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W2035020019,"Computer simulations of external current stimulations of dentate gyrus granule cells of rats with Status Epilepticus induced by pilocarpine and control rats were used to evaluate whether morphological differences alone between these cells have an impact on their electrophysiological behavior. The cell models were constructed using morphological information from tridimensional reconstructions with Neurolucida software. To evaluate the effect of morphology differences alone, ion channel conductances, densities and distributions over the dendritic trees of dentate gyrus granule cells were the same for all models. External simulated currents were injected in randomly chosen dendrites belonging to one of three different areas of dentate gyrus granule cell molecular layer: inner molecular layer, medial molecular layer and outer molecular layer. Somatic membrane potentials were recorded to determine firing frequencies and inter-spike intervals. The results show that morphologically altered granule cells from pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats are less excitable than control cells, especially when they are stimulated in the inner molecular layer, which is the target area for mossy fibers that sprout after pilocarpine-induced cell degeneration. This suggests that morphological alterations may act as a protective mechanism to allow dentate gyrus granule cells to cope with the increase of stimulation caused by mossy fiber sprouting."
https://openalex.org/W2077726663,"Thrombin is produced by the ordered action of prothrombinase on two cleavage sites in prothrombin. Meizothrombin, a proteinase precursor of thrombin, is a singly cleaved species that accumulates abundantly as an intermediate. We now show that covalent linkage of the N-terminal propiece with the proteinase domain in meizothrombin imbues it with exceptionally zymogen-like character. Meizothrombin exists in a slowly reversible equilibrium between two equally populated states, differing by as much as 140-fold in their affinity for active site-directed ligands. The distribution between the two forms, designated zymogen-like and proteinase-like, is affected by Na(+), thrombomodulin binding, or active site ligation. In rapid kinetic measurements with prothrombinase, we also show that the zymogen-like form is produced following the initial cleavage reaction and slowly equilibrates with the proteinase-like form in a previously unanticipated rate-limiting step before it can be further cleaved to thrombin. The reversible equilibration of meizothrombin between zymogen- and proteinase-like states provides new insights into its ability to selectively exhibit the anticoagulant function of thrombin and the mechanistic basis for its accumulation during prothrombin activation. Our findings also provide unexpected insights into the regulation of proteinase function and how the formation of meizothrombin may yield a long lived intermediate with an important regulatory role in coagulation."
https://openalex.org/W1965121075,"Trentepohlia is a genus of subaerial green algae which is widespread in tropical, subtropical, and also temperate regions with humid climates. For many years, small-scale Trentepohlia coverage had been found on the rocks of some glacier valleys on the northern slopes of Mt. Gongga, China. However, since 2005, in the Yajiageng river valley, most of the rocks are covered with deep red coloured algal carpets, which now form a spectacular sight and a tourist attraction known as 'Red-Stone-Valley'. Based on morphology and molecular data, we have named this alga as a new variety: Trentepohlia jolithus var. yajiagengensis var. nov., it differs from the type variety in that its end cells of the main filament are often rhizoid, unilateral branches. This new variety only grows on the native rock, both global warming and human activity have provided massive areas of suitable substrata: the rocks surfaces of the Yajiageng river valley floodplain were re-exposed because of heavy debris flows in the summer of 2005; plus human activities such as tourism and road-building have also created a lot of exposed rock! In summer, the glaciers of the northern slopes of Mt. Gongga have brought to the valleys wet and foggy air, ideal for Trentepohlia growth. The cells of the new variety are rich in secondary carotenoids (astaxanthin?), which helps the algal cells resistance to strong ultraviolet radiation at high altitudes (they are only found on rock surfaces at alt. 1900-3900 m); the cells are also rich in oils, which gives them high resistance to cold dry winters."
https://openalex.org/W2144334839,"Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are essential for the development, regeneration, and hypertrophy of skeletal muscles. IGF-II promotes myoblast differentiation through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), Akt, and mTOR signaling. Here, we report that skeletal muscle- and kidney-enriched inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (SKIP) negatively regulates myogenesis through inhibition of IGF-II production and attenuation of the IGF-II-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. We also demonstrate that SKIP expression, which was markedly elevated during differentiation, was controlled by MyoD in C2C12 cells. Expression of SKIP inhibited IGF-II at the transcription level. These results indicate that SKIP regulates MyoD-mediated muscle differentiation. Silencing of SKIP increased IGF-II transcription and myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, knockdown of SKIP resulted in thick myotubes with a larger number of nuclei than that in control C2C12 cells. Taken together, these data indicate that SKIP controls the IGF-II-PI 3-kinase-Akt-mTOR auto-regulation loop during myogenesis. Our findings identify SKIP as a key regulator of muscle cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1983153900,"Background On Earth only a few legged species, such as water strider insects, some aquatic birds and lizards, can run on water. For most other species, including humans, this is precluded by body size and proportions, lack of appropriate appendages, and limited muscle power. However, if gravity is reduced to less than Earth’s gravity, running on water should require less muscle power. Here we use a hydrodynamic model to predict the gravity levels at which humans should be able to run on water. We test these predictions in the laboratory using a reduced gravity simulator. Methodology/Principal Findings We adapted a model equation, previously used by Glasheen and McMahon to explain the dynamics of Basilisk lizard, to predict the body mass, stride frequency and gravity necessary for a person to run on water. Progressive body-weight unloading of a person running in place on a wading pool confirmed the theoretical predictions that a person could run on water, at lunar (or lower) gravity levels using relatively small rigid fins. Three-dimensional motion capture of reflective markers on major joint centers showed that humans, similarly to the Basilisk Lizard and to the Western Grebe, keep the head-trunk segment at a nearly constant height, despite the high stride frequency and the intensive locomotor effort. Trunk stabilization at a nearly constant height differentiates running on water from other, more usual human gaits. Conclusions/Significance The results showed that a hydrodynamic model of lizards running on water can also be applied to humans, despite the enormous difference in body size and morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1999798918,"Motor variability often reflects a mixture of different neural and peripheral sources operating over a range of timescales. We present a statistical model of sequence timing that can be used to measure three distinct components of timing variability: global tempo changes that are spread across the sequence, such as might stem from neuromodulatory sources with widespread influence; fast, uncorrelated timing noise, stemming from noisy components within the neural system; and timing jitter that does not alter the timing of subsequent elements, such as might be caused by variation in the motor periphery or by measurement error. In addition to quantifying the variability contributed by each of these latent factors in the data, the approach assigns maximum likelihood estimates of each factor on a trial-to-trial basis. We applied the model to adult zebra finch song, a temporally complex behavior with rich structure on multiple timescales. We find that individual song vocalizations (syllables) contain roughly equal amounts of variability in each of the three components while overall song length is dominated by global tempo changes. Across our sample of syllables, both global and independent variability scale with average length while timing jitter does not, a pattern consistent with the Wing and Kristofferson (1973) model of sequence timing. We also find significant day-to-day drift in all three timing sources, but a circadian pattern in tempo only. In tests using artificially generated data, the model successfully separates out the different components with small error. The approach provides a general framework for extracting distinct sources of timing variability within action sequences, and can be applied to neural and behavioral data from a wide array of systems."
https://openalex.org/W2063006843,"Background Investigation of the environmental influences on human behavioral phenotypes is important for our understanding of the causation of psychiatric disorders. However, there are complexities associated with the assessment of environmental influences on behavior. Methods/Principal Findings We conducted a series of analyses using a prospective, longitudinal study of a nationally representative birth cohort from Finland (the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort). Participants included a total of 3,761 male and female cohort members who were living in Finland at the age of 16 years and who had complete temperament scores. Our initial analyses (Wessman et al., in press) provide evidence in support of four stable and robust temperament clusters. Using these temperament clusters, as well as independent temperament dimensions for comparison, we conducted a data-driven analysis to assess the influence of a broad set of life course measures, assessed pre-natally, in infancy, and during adolescence, on adult temperament. Results Measures of early environment, neurobehavioral development, and adolescent behavior significantly predict adult temperament, classified by both cluster membership and temperament dimensions. Specifically, our results suggest that a relatively consistent set of life course measures are associated with adult temperament profiles, including maternal education, characteristics of the family’s location and residence, adolescent academic performance, and adolescent smoking. Conclusions Our finding that a consistent set of life course measures predict temperament clusters indicate that these clusters represent distinct developmental temperament trajectories and that information about a subset of life course measures has implications for adult health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2068806297,"The structural characterization of glycolipids from Thermus thermophilus HB8 was performed in this study. Two neutral and one acidic glycolipids were extracted and purified by the modified TLC-blotting method, after which their chemical structures were determined by chemical composition analysis, mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The structure of one of the neutral glycolipids, NGL-A, was Galp(α1-6)GlcpNacyl(β1-2)Glcp(α1-)acyl(2)Gro, and the other, NGL-C, was Galf(β1-2)Galp(α1-6)GlcpNacyl(β1-2)Glcp(α1-)acyl(2)Gro. The structure of NGL-C was identical to that reported previously [Oshima, M. and Ariga, T. (1976) FEBS Lett. 64, 440]. Both neutral glycolipids shared a common structural unit found in the Thermus species. The acyl groups found in NGL-A and NGL-C, iso-type pentadecanoxy and heptadecanoxy fatty acid, were also the same as those found in this species. In contrast, the acidic glycolipid, AGL-B, possessed the structure of N-(((GlcpNAc(α1-)acyl(2)Gro)P-2)GroA)alkylamine. The alkyl group in AGL-B was an iso-type heptadecanyl, suggesting that the iso-type structure of the long alkyl chain is responsible for the thermal stability of the bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1968350631,"Surfactant proteins (SPs) are important lipoprotein complex components, expressed in alveolar epithelial cells type II (AEC-II), and playing an essential role in maintenance of alveolar integrity and host defence. Because expressions of SPs are regulated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), we hypothesized that phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, influence SP expression and release. Analysis of PDE activity of our AEC-II preparations revealed that PDE4 is the major cAMP hydrolysing PDE in human adult AEC-II. Thus, freshly isolated human AEC-II were stimulated with two different concentrations of the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast-N-oxide (3 nM and 1 µM) to investigate the effect on SP expression. SP mRNA levels disclosed a large inter-individual variation. Therefore, the experiments were grouped by the basal SP expression in low and high expressing donors. AEC-II stimulated with Roflumilast-N-oxide showed a minor increase in SP-A1, SP-C and SP-D mRNA mainly in low expressing preparations. To overcome the effects of different basal levels of intracellular cAMP, cyclooxygenase was blocked by indomethacin and cAMP production was reconstituted by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Under these conditions SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-B and SP-D are increased by roflumilast-N-oxide in low expressing preparations. Roflumilast-N-oxide fosters the expression of SPs in human AEC-II via increase of intracellular cAMP levels potentially contributing to improved alveolar host defence and enhanced resolution of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2016182830,"Rearrangement of the skin during wound healing depends on plasmin and plasminogen, which serve to degrade fibrin depositions in the provisional matrix and thereby facilitate keratinocyte migration. In the current study, we investigated whether plasmin and plasminogen likewise played a role during the development of skin cancer. To test this, we set up a chemically induced skin tumor model in a cohort of mice and found that skin tumor growth in Plg(-/-) male mice was reduced by 52% compared with wild-type controls. Histological analyses suggested that the growth-restricting effect of plasminogen deficiency was due to thrombosis and lost patency of the tumor vasculature, resulting in tumor necrosis. The connection between plasmin-dependent fibrinolysis, vascular patency, and tumor growth was further substantiated as the effect of plasminogen deficiency on tumor growth could be reverted by superimposing heterozygous fibrinogen deficiency on Plg(-/-) mice. Tumors derived from these Fib(-/+);Plg(-/-) mice displayed a significantly decreased level of tumor thrombosis compared with Plg(-/-) mice. In summary, these data indicate that plasmin-driven fibrinolysis facilitates tumor growth by maintaining patency of the tumor vasculature."
