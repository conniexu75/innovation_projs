https://openalex.org/W1538004207,"According to the Milankovitch theory, changes in the incident solar radiation, called insolation, in the Northern Hemisphere provide the driving force for global glacial cycles. In their Perspective, Karner and Muller discuss recent studies of corals from around the world that shed doubt on the applicability of the theory to the termination of the penultimate glaciation. The authors argue that a fresh, unbiased look at the data is warranted."

https://openalex.org/W2137071214,"The interesting array of articles for the special issue “Movement: Molecular to Robotic” (7 Apr., pp. 79-106) examines the biology of movement for animals with endoskeletons, animals with exoskeletons, robots, and molecules, but movement in an entire kingdom—the plant kingdom—is overlooked. Movement in plants is based on physical mechanisms that are very different from most animal movements, and movements have been a central factor in the evolution of many plant adaptations. Mechanisms include hydraulic shifts operating by means of osmotic engines, differential growth, fracturing of structures due to localized desiccation, and cell separations or dissolution leading to projectile actions."
https://openalex.org/W1543303034,"A U.S. national assessment, drawing on the best available climate model predictions, has concluded that the United States will indeed warm, affecting everything from the western snowpacks that supply California with water to New England's fall foliage. But on a more detailed level, the assessment often draws a blank. As much as policy-makers would like to know exactly what's in store for Americans, the rudimentary state of regional climate science will not soon allow it, and the results of this 3-year effort brought the point home."

In his Perspective, Lubensky discusses the advances reported in two papers in this issue, both of which involve liquid crystals made from V-shaped or bent-core molecules. Walba et al. report a synthetic strategy for producing a ferroelectric phase from achiral bent-core molecules. Pratibha et al. show that new liquid crystalline phases form when bent-core molecules are mixed with a particular class of rodlike molecules. These papers introduce new molecular designs that yield new liquid crystalline phases with controlled structure and properties."

In this Perspective, Ramsay highlights a new technique reported by Müller et al. for overcoming this problem in past and present mountain-building regions, which have particularly complex deformation patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1969767942,"France is on a collision course with the European Union over an E.U. directive that many researchers believe would allow raw DNA sequences of human genes to be patented. On 7 June, French justice minister Elisabeth Guigou told the National Assembly that the directive--which must be enacted by each of the 15 E.U. member nations by 30 July--contradicts French bioethics laws, which forbid the patenting of any part of the human body. If France maintains its defiance, it could be fined up to $600,000 daily for each day it refuses to adopt the directive."

As Science went to press, investigators were trying to determine if the disks--missing from a vault since at least 7 May and discovered behind a nearby copying machine on 16 June--were pocketed by spies or just mislaid by employees. Their disappearance touched off a debate about how useful they might be to a rogue nation or terrorist group."

Research-intensive universities have begun aggressively shopping for prospective candidates, using the new chairs as bait. Smaller universities say that has left them fending off talent raids."
https://openalex.org/W2007653561,"Richard Stone in his News Focus article “Stress: The invisible hand in Eastern Europe's death rates” (9 June, p. [1732][1]) highlights a serious problem in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and especially those of the former Soviet Union. I recently visited Moldova and Armenia. If you ask medical doctors there about the current health service, they say it is chaotic and many times worse than in Soviet times. Diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis are on the increase. A large part of the problem is that many patients don't have the money to buy drugs or even anesthetics. The result is that the hospitals are short of patients and doctors are unemployed. Stone's article ends with a statement that “improving life expectancy in Eastern Europe lies with the region's economy.” In Moldova and Armenia, I saw no signs of such improvement and hence am rather fearful for the future, as most likely the populations of these countries are as well.

https://openalex.org/W2014474735,"The News of the Week article “Goldin shakes up NASA's life sciences program” (Andrew Lawler, 12 May, p. [938][1]) does not include mention of the many contributions that Arnauld Nicogossian, former chief of NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications (OLMSA), has made to our nation's space program. Despite flat budgets for OLMSA over the past 6 years, Nicogossian's leadership has increased the office's extramural research community from about 650 to more than 900 researchers from nationally recognized institutions. Working with the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, Nicogossian has been instrumental in establishing the Life Sciences competitive peer review process, which requires all NASA scientific research to undergo vigorous peer review by independent external panels. Nicogossian should also be credited with spearheading an interdisciplinary research program in biology, physics, and chemistry, which uses biologically inspired technology as the basis for integration. This effort is attracting a new generation of scientists to NASA, as well as several Nobel laureates.

Whether serving as the associate administrator for OLMSA or as chief health and medical officer, Arnauld Nicogossian will continue to do an outstanding job providing NASA with world-class leadership and expertise.

https://openalex.org/W2016108767,"A long-running dispute over who should get credit for first reporting landmarks on Mercury's uncharted hemisphere burst into public view on 26 May, when a Boston University press release claimed honors for a BU team without mentioning the contributions of an erstwhile collaborator, amateur astronomer Ron Dantowitz. The row, which has left both sides bitter and unwilling to work with each other, ""was the opposite of how a collaboration between amateurs and professionals should be,"" says one of the scientists involved."

Earlier this month, however, astronomers won an international agreement that guarantees critical wavelengths safe for research."
https://openalex.org/W2018496397,"Maryland is the most research-intensive state in the country, according to a new report* that describes in unprecedented detail where the federal government's annual $80 billion research budget is spent. The state's concentration of national laboratories and government contractors puts it second in total dollars received and far above California, Massachusetts, and other better known technology heavyweights in per capita federal R&D spending. That ranking is one of many facts in a 650-page tome by RAND's Science and Technology Policy Institute in Arlington, Virginia. Its authors hope the report will raise public awareness about research as well as inform politicians."
