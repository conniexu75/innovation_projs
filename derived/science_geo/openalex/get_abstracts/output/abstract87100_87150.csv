https://openalex.org/W2070972996,"A sensitive assay was used to measure the binding of iodine-125-labeled insulin in serum obtained from 112 newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetics before insulin treatment was initiated. Two groups of nondiabetics served as controls: children with a variety of diseases other than diabetes and nondiabetic siblings of insulin-dependent diabetics. Eighteen of the diabetics were found to have elevated binding and 36 were above the 95th percentile of control values. The insulin-binding protein is precipitated by antibody to human immunoglobulin G, has a displacement curve that is parallel and over the same concentration range as serum from long-standing insulin-dependent diabetics, and elutes from a Sephacryl S-300 column at the position of gamma globulin. These insulin antibodies are present in a large percentage of newly diagnosed, untreated diabetics and may be an immune marker of B-cell damage."

https://openalex.org/W2102106222,"The division cycle of yeast a cells is inhibited by alpha-factor. Haploid a cells were found to bind 35S-labeled alpha-factor, whereas haploid alpha cells and diploid a/alpha cells showed little binding. The association of alpha-factor with a cells was reversible upon dilution. Unlabeled alpha-factor competed for binding of 35S-alpha-factor; the concentration dependence for competition indicated 9 X 10(5) binding sites per cell with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3 X 10(-7) M. The rates of association (kon = 3 X 10(3) M-1 sec-1) and dissociation (koff = 9 X 10(-4) sec-1) were consistent with the equilibrium constant. The alpha-factor binding activity associated with five temperature-sensitive ste2 mutants was thermolabile, suggesting that the STE2 gene encodes the receptor for alpha-factor. In contrast, the binding activity of other temperature-sensitive mutants (ste4, ste5, ste7, ste11, and ste12) showed no thermolability."
https://openalex.org/W1574117447,"Metabolism of [2-13C]pyruvate, [1,2-13C]ethanol, and NH4+ in the presence and absence of 7 nM insulin has been followed at 35 degrees C by alternate scan 13C and 31P NMR at 90.5 and 145.8 MHz, respectively, in isolated perfused liver from 16-h fasted rats. With this technique, 31P and 13C NMR spectra are recorded simultaneously so that both phosphate metabolites and 13C-labeled metabolites could be followed, noninvasively, in perfused liver to give a comprehensive view of the response to a variety of stimuli. 13C-labeled glycogen increased synchronously, at a rate of 17 mumol of glucose units/g of liver/h, with the synthesis of 13C-labeled glucose, which also proceeded at a rate of 17 mumol/g of liver/h; glycogenesis was essentially a gluconeogenic process under these conditions and was not affected by the presence of insulin. From the position of the 13C-labeled citrate peak observed in liver, the measurement of Kd for the citrate-Mg complex under our conditions, and the expression relating these quantities to the concentration of free Mg2+, the intracellular level of free Mg2+ is estimated to be 0.46 +/- 0.05 mM in perfused rat liver. After subsequent administration of glucagon, a rapid decrease in glycogen and citrate was seen by 13C NMR and a 44% increase in glycero-3-phosphocholine was seen by 31P NMR; increase in glycero-3-phosphocholine is consistent with stimulation of liver phospholipase activity by glucagon. The co-administration of two different 13C-labeled substrates introduced multiplet structure arising from spin-spin interaction between labeled adjacent carbons into the peaks of several key metabolites. 13C enrichments at specific carbons of citrate, glutamate, glutamine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and glucose and the distribution of intensity within the multiplets of specific carbons were measured in spectra of perfusates and extracts of the freeze-clamped livers. Within the context of a first order model for fluxes into the Krebs cycle and into glucose, analytical expressions were written that describe the intensity distributions within the several multiplets. In this way, a set of simultaneous equations was generated and solved in general form; when the measured intensity ratios are substituted into these expressions, relative fluxes under the conditions of the experiment can be estimated. Because a redundancy of information is available, checks on self-consistency are built into the estimated fluxes."

https://openalex.org/W1512703420,"gamma-Irradiation of DNA in vitro produces two types of single strand breaks. Both types of strand breaks contain 5'-phosphate DNA termini. Some strand breaks contain 3'-phosphate termini, some contain 3'-phosphoglycolate termini (Henner, W.D., Rodriguez, L.O., Hecht, S. M., and Haseltine, W. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 711-713). We have studied the ability of prokaryotic enzymes of DNA metabolism to act at each of these types of gamma-ray-induced 3' termini in DNA. Neither strand breaks that terminate with 3'-phosphate nor 3'-phosphoglycolate are substrates for direct ligation by T4 DNA ligase. Neither type of gamma-ray-induced 3' terminus can be used as a primer for DNA synthesis by either Escherichia coli DNA polymerase or T4 DNA polymerase. The 3'-phosphatase activity of T4 polynucleotide kinase can convert gamma-ray-induced 3'-phosphate but not 3'-phosphoglycolate termini to 3'-hydroxyl termini that can then serve as primers for DNA polymerase. E. coli alkaline phosphatase is also unable to hydrolyze 3'-phosphoglycolate groups. The 3'-5' exonuclease actions of E. coli DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA polymerase do not degrade DNA strands that have either type of gamma-ray-induced 3' terminus. E. coli exonuclease III can hydrolyze DNA with gamma-ray-induced 3'-phosphate or 3'-phosphoglycolate termini or with DNase I-induced 3'-hydroxyl termini. The initial action of exonuclease III at 3' termini of ionizing radiation-induced DNA fragments is to remove the 3' terminal phosphate or phosphoglycolate to yield a fragment of the same nucleotide length that has a 3'-hydroxyl terminus. These results suggest that repair of ionizing radiation-induced strand breaks may proceed via the sequential action of exonuclease, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase. The possible role of exonuclease III in repair of gamma-radiation-induced strand breaks is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1597307589,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae MATa cells arrest cell division in response to the mating pheromone, alpha factor. After some interval of time the cells resume division. It is demonstrated here that cells recover from division arrest by becoming insensitive to the alpha factor under conditions of low cell density (10(2) cells/ml) where no alpha factor destruction occurs. The time of desensitization occurs later at higher alpha factor concentrations. Using the technique of perfusion photomicroscopy developed in this study, it was found that 95% of the desensitized cells remain insensitive to the alpha factor for greater than or equal to 3 generations at the alpha factor concentration where recovery occurred. Upon recovery, cells have generation times which are similar or identical to the calculated time from the cdc28 start step of cell division to cell separation. Therefore, the abnormally large recovered cells behave as if they have no growth time requirement for cell division for several generations. Desensitization was found to occur asymmetrically for parent and daughter cells. While parents (cells which have budded) are insensitive to alpha factor, their daughters (cells which have never budded and which were formed from desensitized parents during continuous perfusion with alpha factor) show 54% with a delayed generation time compared to control daughter cells."
https://openalex.org/W1559420384,"The total nucleotide sequence (1,158 nucleotides) of the metB gene of Escherichia coli coding for cystathionine gamma-synthase (386 amino acid residues, Mr = 41,503/chain) is presented. The nucleotide sequences of the flanking regions of the metB and metL genes are also presented. Analysis of these sequences and identification of a promoter region upstream from the metB gene confirms that metB and metL form an operon. The transcription direction is from metB to metL; the start site of the gene transcription has been determined. There is no structural evidence of a classical attenuation mechanism in the regulation of this operon coding for enzymes implicated in an amino acid biosynthetic pathway. Finally, the overall organization of the metJBLF gene cluster is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2048938412,"The chicken optic system contains a brain-specific form of spectrin (alpha gamma-spectrin or fodrin) as a major membrane-associated, axonally transported cytoskeletal protein. We show here that the chicken optic system also contains an erythrocyte-specific form of spectrin (alpha beta' beta-spectrin), which has a more restricted distribution; it is confined to the plasma membrane of dendrites and cell bodies of retinal ganglion cells, is absent from the optic nerve fibers, and is not axonally transported from the retina into the optic nerve. During development of the optic system, the expression of alpha gamma-spectrin is constitutive in all cell types. On the other hand, the accumulation of alpha beta' beta-spectrin is detected in only the ganglion cells, and at a time in development which coincides with the phase of synaptogenesis. These results indicate the existence of a developmentally regulated mechanism that topologically segregates the erythroid and brain forms of spectrin from each other, and the former from axonal transport, and suggest that erythroid spectrin may be involved in establishing restricted membrane-cytoskeletal domains in neurons during synaptogenesis, and maintaining them in the adult cell."
https://openalex.org/W2020543194,The basic amino terminus of each histone is external to the nucleosome core particle. In vitro studies have shown that the amino termini are not required for nucleosome assembly. To address the significance of these results in vivo we constructed mutations in yeast histone H2B in genetic backgrounds lacking wild-type H2B protein. We found that the protein can function in vivo even with large deletions at its amino terminus. These mutations produce no obvious phenotype and there appears to be no selection against the mutant proteins in chromatin assembly. A deletion removing a large portion of the carboxyl terminus was lethal. We conclude that much of the amino terminus of histone H2B has no essential function in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W2072699006,"We have developed an in vitro system utilizing yeast cell-free extracts to catalyze recombination events between homologous plasmids containing different mutant alleles of the Tet or ARG4 genes. The reaction increased the frequency of Tcr or Arg+ transformants (recombinants) from 2 X 10(-6) to 1-3 X 10(-3). Linearizing one substrate between the two tet mutations stimulated the reaction 2 to 4 fold. The reaction required rATP, Mg++, NAD, and DTT. The rad52-1 mutation decreased the reaction between linear and circular substrates 5 to 6 fold but had little effect with circular substrates. The structures of Tcr plasmids was analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping and was consistent with a recombination reaction involving crossing-over and gene conversion. Recombination products were also observed directly by subjecting reaction mixtures to electrophoretic analysis. These results indicate that recombination events were catalyzed by the yeast extract."
https://openalex.org/W1658952406,"The ability of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone to modulate the insulin receptor was examined directly in primary cultures of hepatocytes prepared from adult male rats. Hepatocytes were cultured in a defined medium in the presence and absence of dexamethasone, 0.1 microM. The exposure of hepatocytes to dexamethasone resulted in a time-dependent (steady state by 32 h) increase in insulin binding in both intact hepatocytes and Triton X-100-soluble extracts (total insulin receptor content). The enhanced insulin binding found in soluble extracts of dexamethasone-treated hepatocytes was the result of an increase in insulin receptor number without a change in receptor affinity. In order to assess the mechanism by which dexamethasone up-regulates the insulin receptor, the isotope density-shift technique was used to analyze insulin receptor turnover in control and dexamethasone-treated hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were initially cultured for 32 h in standard culture media containing only (14C, 12C, 1H) amino acids. In hepatocytes exposed to dexamethasone, a 417% increase in insulin binding in Triton X-100-soluble extracts was observed. After 32 h, when steady state binding is achieved in dexamethasone-treated cultures, parallel cultures of hepatocytes incubated in the absence and presence of dexamethasone were washed and subsequently cultured in media containing heavy amino acids (15N, 13C, 2H). The time-dependent disappearance of light insulin receptor (receptor degradation) and appearance of insulin receptor (receptor synthesis) were monitored using CsCl gradients to resolve the two density species of receptor. At steady state, the rate of receptor synthesis (k8) was 2.94 and 0.62 fmol of insulin bound h-1 in dexamethasone-treated and control hepatocytes, respectively. In contrast to this large increase in the rate of receptor synthesis observed in dexamethasone-treated cells, the first order rate constant for decay (k d) was the same in dexamethasone-treated (0.074 h-1) and in control (0.077 h-1) hepatocytes. We therefore conclude that glucocorticoid-induced up-regulation of the insulin receptor in the liver is due to stimulation of insulin receptor synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1538480494,"Plectin (Mr = 300,000) was found to be an abundant polypeptide component of Chinese hamster ovary cells accounting for up to 1% of cellular protein. Seventy-five per cent of the plectin were present in cytoskeletons prepared by extraction of attached cells with 0.15% Triton X-100. As shown by immunofluorescence microscopy, plectin's spatial arrangement within these cytoskeletal preparations appeared well preserved, though slightly more filamentous compared to nonextracted cells. Upon in situ incubation of cytoskeletons with [gamma-32P] ATP followed by solubilization and immunoprecipitation, plectin was identified as one of the major phosphoacceptors. A basic phosphorylation of the protein was accomplished by a type I cAMP-independent protein kinase, while a cAMP-dependent protein kinase enhanced its phosphorylation up to 2-fold. Peptide mapping revealed that the two kinases phosphorylated different molecular sites. Peptide maps generated from cytoskeletal plectin phosphorylated in vitro using [gamma-32P]ATP and plectin phosphorylated in vivo using 32Pi were virtually identical demonstrating that the in situ phosphorylation of plectin in preparations of cytoskeletons was specific. Moreover, the specific radioactivity of cytoskeletal plectin was three times higher than that of detergent-extracted plectin, suggesting that phosphorylation is important for the protein's association with the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1495579311,"Certain Escherichia coli mutants defective in phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis accumulate novel glucosamine-derived phospholipids. We previously demonstrated that the simplest of these substance (lipid X) is a diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate bearing beta-hydroxymyristoyl groups at positions 2 and 3 (Takayama, K., Qureshi, N., Mascagni, P., Nashed, M. A., Anderson, L., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7379-7385). We now report the structural characterization of a triacylglucosamine 1-phosphate (designated lipid Y) that is also found in these mutants. Hydrolyzates of Y contain 2 mol of beta-hydroxymyristate and 1 mol of palmitate/mol of glucosamine. In the lipid, one of the beta-hydroxymyristates is amide-linked at position 2, while the two other fatty acyl groups are ester-linked. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry is used to confirm that Y is a monosaccharide derivative and that the molecular weight of Y as the free acid (C50H96NO13P) is 950.29. Analysis of Y by proton NMR spectroscopy at 200 MHz reveals that the anomeric configuration is alpha. Further, one of the esterified fatty acid residues is attached to the 3 OH of the sugar, while the second is linked to an OH moiety of a hydroxymyristate. The 4 and 6 OH groups of the sugar are unsubstituted, as in E. coli lipid X. To establish the precise location of each esterified fatty acyl residue, we subjected Y to a very mild alkaline hydrolysis in the presence of triethylamine. This resulted in the selective removal of a single hydroxymyristoyl group. The triethylamine-treated derivative (lipid Y) has a molecular weight of 723. NMR spectroscopy of Y shows that the 3 OH of the sugar is no longer substituted, while the beta OH of the remaining amide-linked hydroxymyristate is still esterified with palmitate. On the basis of these findings, we propose that lipid Y has the same fundamental structure as lipid X, except for the additional presence of a palmitoyl moiety on the N-linked hydroxymyristate. Presumably, lipid Y is synthesized from X by a selective acylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1560755896,"The vertebrate fatty acid synthetase complex consists of two, apparently identical, subunits which contain seven catalytic centers and an acyl carrier site. As a prelude to studying the functional organization of this system, a comprehensive proteolytic analysis of the chicken fatty acid synthetase subunit has been carried out. Of 24 proteases tested, seven (chymotrypsin, elastase, trypsin, Myxobacter protease, subtilisins A and B, and kallikrein) were found to be capable of inflicting specific cleavages in the native enzyme. The proteolytic profiles were analyzed with respect to both the kinetics and the size of the fragments generated. The relationships between the various fragments were further delineated by combinatorial digestions. All of the data points to the fact that the subunits are indeed identical. The cleavage patterns indicate that the fatty acid synthetase subunit is primarily arranged into three major domains of Mr 127,000, 107,000, and 33,000, since these fragments are commonly produced by most of the proteases. The latter peptides may be further subdivided and mapped by the action of individual enzymes into a number of distinct regions: the 127,000 domain into fragments of Mr 60,000, 45,000, and 23,000; the 107,000 domain into fragments of Mr 14,000, 56,000, 21,000, and 15,000; all aligned accordingly. This proteolytic map serves as a reference for the controlled dissection of the fatty acid synthetase complex, thereby allowing determination of the location of functional centers within the parent polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1563927406,"In a classical translocation experiment, deacylated RNA is bound to the ribosomal peptidyl-tRNA site (P site) and N-acetyl-phenylalanyl-tRNA (AcPhe-tRNA) to the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site); upon addition of elongation factor (EF-G) and GTP, AcPhe-tRNA is translocated from the A to the P site. Here, we demonstrate a model reaction for a spontaneous, EF-G independent translocation. If AcPhe-tRNA is bound to the P site and Phe-tRNA to the A site at 15 mM Mg2+, then at 37 degrees C up to 60% of the AcPhe2-tRNA formed is found at the P site without the addition of EF-G. We demonstrate the following: 1) the spontaneous translocation is not merely illusory as a result of Phe-tRNA binding directly to the P site; 2) it is not mimicked by release of AcPhe2-tRNA from an A site and rebinding to a P site of another ribosome; 3) it is not caused by an EF-G contaminant present in the 70 S preparation, since without EF-G the spontaneous translocation works equally well in the presence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate or fusidic acid; 4) AcPhe2-tRNA evidently has a higher affinity for the P site than AcPhe-tRNA, thus promoting the spontaneous translocation; and 5) peptide-bond formation favors the subsequent translocation. Addition of EF-G increases the initial rate by a factor of 13. Furthermore, at 15 mM Mg2+, 37 degrees C and in the presence of EF-G and GTP, Phe-tRNA cannot be translocated from the A to the P site, if the P site is occupied by deacylated tRNA. With the spontaneous translocation system, all reactions of the elongation cycle are cooperatively interconnected; i.e. upon binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site, a significant portion of the ribosomes performs a complete round of the elongation cycle without the addition of elongation factor EF-G."
https://openalex.org/W1603035659,"Rates of synthesis of albumin and transferrin were compared with the levels of their cognate mRNAs in primary monolayer cultures of chick embryo hepatocytes over a period of 72 h. These liver cells were exposed, from the onset of culture, only to a chemically defined medium devoid of hormonal or macromolecular supplement. Synthesis of transferrin was constant whereas synthesis of albumin diminished to near 0 in 3 days. RNA prepared from hepatocyte monolayers, maintained for various lengths of time in culture, was translated in wheat germ extracts and Xenopus oocytes. Translation products were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, total RNA from the cultured cells was hybridized to labeled cDNA probes to determine the number of sequences specific for each protein. Albumin mRNA was found to decrease with time in culture in all three assay systems, while transferrin mRNA remained constant. Analysis of the kinetics suggests a selective decay, with a half-life of 7 h, of the amount of albumin-specific RNA present at the beginning of culture. Apparently, in the hormone-deprived hepatocytes, there is little or no further transcription of the albumin gene. After addition of insulin to the cultures, albumin mRNA levels increased, suggesting an effect of this hormone on albumin gene utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1512184512,"The recessive mutation, mod A, in the Dictyostelium discoideum strain M31 results in an alteration in the post-translational modification of lysosomal enzymes. We now report studies which indicate that mod A is deficient in glucosidase II, an enzyme which is involved in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. [2-3H]Mannose-labeled glycopeptides were prepared from three purified mod A lysosomal enzymes and compared to the equivalent glycopeptides from parental enzymes. The mod A glycopeptides were deficient in high mannose oligosaccharides containing two phosphomannosyl residues and accumulated oligosaccharides with one phosphomannosyl residue. The phosphate was present in the form of an acid-stable phosphodiester in both instances. There was also an increase in the amount of nonphosphorylated high mannose oligosaccharides mod A and these were larger than the corresponding material from the parental enzymes. In addition, the nonphosphorylated oligosaccharides were only partially degraded by alpha-mannosidase, indicating the presence of a blocking moiety. In vitro enzyme assays demonstrated that the mod A cells cannot remove the inner 1 leads to 3-linked glucose from a glucosylated high mannose oligosaccharide. The cells are also deficient in membrane-bound neutral p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucosidase activity. This activity has been attributed to glucosidase II in other systems. Removal of the outer 1 leads to 2-linked glucose from Glc3Man9Glc-NAc2 is normal, demonstrating the presence of glucosidase I activity. We conclude from these data that M31 cells are deficient in glucosidase II, the enzyme which removes the two inner glucose residues from the glucosylated oligosaccharides of newly glycosylated proteins. This defect can explain the mod A phenotype and is proposed to be the primary genetic defect in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581322380,"The 50 S ribosomal subunits from Escherichia coli were modified by reaction with 2-iminothiolane under conditions in which 65 sulfhydryl groups, about 2/protein, were added per subunit. Earlier work showed that protein L7/L12 was modified more extensively than the average but that nearly all 50 S proteins contained sulfhydryl groups. Mild oxidation led to the formation of disulfide protein-protein cross-links. These were fractionated by urea gel electrophoresis and then analyzed by diagonal gel electrophoresis. Cross-linked complexes containing two, three, and possibly four copies of L7/L12 were evident. Cross-links between L7/L12 and other ribosomal proteins were also formed. These proteins were identified as L5, L6, L10, L11, and, in lower yield, L9, L14, and L17. The yields of cross-links to L5, L6, L10, and L11 were comparable to the most abundant cross-links formed. Similar experiments were performed with 70 S ribosomes. Protein L7/L12 in 70 S ribosomes was cross-linked to proteins L6, L10, and L11. The strong L7/L12-L5 cross-link found in 50 S subunits was absent in 70 S ribosomes. No cross-links between 30 S proteins and L7/L12 were observed."
https://openalex.org/W1606700480,"The existence of isoelectric variants of bovine brain and human placental choline acetyltransferase was confirmed by chromatofocusing. The identification of molecular weight variants (bovine brain, Mr = 68,000 and 63,000; human placental, Mr = 66,000 and 64,000) was also demonstrated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting and immunochemical visualization of choline acetyltransferase with monoclonal antibodies. No correlation between the isoelectric variants and molecular weight variants could be observed; however, in the case of the bovine brain enzyme the more alkaline isoelectric variant was enriched in the higher molecular weight form of the enzyme. Treatment of the bovine brain enzyme with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease resulted in the conversion of the Mr = 68,000 form of the enzyme to the Mr = 63,000 form. During this conversion no change in the enzyme activity was observed demonstrating that the Mr = 63,000 form of the enzyme and probably also the Mr = 68,000 form of the enzyme are active. Preparation of the bovine brain enzyme in the presence of proteolytic enzyme inhibitors yielded a new higher molecular weight form of the enzyme, Mr = 73,000, which was enzymatically active. The Mr = 73,000 form of the enzyme exhibited a single isoelectric form when analyzed by chromatofocusing. These results suggest that the Mr = 73,000 form of the enzyme represents the native form, and that other molecular weight and isoelectric variants may arise by proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1542401505,"Rat liver L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA was enriched from total polysomes by immunoprecipitation with a specific antibody and Staphylococcus aureus cells. Double-stranded cDNA synthesized from the enriched mRNA was inserted into the PstI site of pBR322, and the resultant recombinant DNA molecules were used to transform Escherichia coli. Three clones containing DNA complementary to L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA were identified by colony hybridization, hybrid-selected translation, and dot blot hybridization. A partial restriction endonuclease map of cDNA inserts was constructed covering about 1.86 kilobase pairs. The cDNA insert of recombinant plasmid pLPK-14 was used as a hybridization probe to quantitate L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA in rat liver after various treatments. The level of hybridizable L-type enzyme mRNA was markedly increased by a high carbohydrate diet. Diabetes greatly reduced the mRNA level in the liver of rats maintained on a high carbohydrate diet, but insulin administration resulted in restoration of the mRNA level to normal within 24 h. These changes were approximately proportional to the changes in the level of translatable L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA. Thus, we conclude that nutritional and hormonal regulation of synthesis of hepatic L-type pyruvate kinase occurs at the pretranslational level."
https://openalex.org/W1568854958,"Sequential treatment of the chicken liver fatty acid synthetase by trypsin and subtilisin cleaved the Mr 267,000 subunit to 6-8 polypeptides, ranging in molecular weights from 15,000 to 94,000. Fractionation of the digest by ammonium sulfate and chromatography on a Procion Red HE3B affinity column permitted the isolation of a polypeptide (Mr = 94,000) containing the beta-ketoacyl reductase activity but no other partial activities normally associated with the synthetase. The specific activity of the beta-ketoacyl reductase increased 2 to 3 times in this fraction, an increase that is within the expected range based on relative molecular weight. The kinetic parameters of this fraction towards NADPH and N-acetyl-S-acetoacetyl cysteamine were essentially the same as the beta-ketoacyl reductase component of the intact synthetase. However, the purified fragment did not catalyze the reduction of acetoacetyl-S-CoA derivative, a substrate that is readily reduced by the intact synthetase. Fluorescence measurements with etheno-NADP+ indicate the binding of about 1 mol of NADP+/94,000 daltons, a value which is in agreement with the results obtained from fluorescence measurements with NADPH and the binding of a radiolabeled photoaffinity analog of NADP+. Phenylglyoxal inhibits the beta-ketoacyl reductase activity of either the intact synthetase or the isolated fragment, suggesting the involvement of an essential arginine at or near the active site. Another fragment (Mr 36,000) containing beta-ketoacyl reductase activity was isolated from the synthetase after kallikrein/subtilisin double digestion. Previous mapping studies had shown that this fragment lies adjacent to the COOH-terminal thioesterase domain and overlaps the tryptic Mr 94,000 peptide by approximately 21 daltons. This fragment, but not the Mr 94,000 fragment, was found to contain the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group, indicating that the acyl carrier protein moiety is located in the 15,000-dalton segment that separates the beta-ketoacyl reductase from the thioesterase domain."
https://openalex.org/W1605981237,"Insulin receptors from turkey erythrocyte plasma membranes were solubilized in nondenaturing detergents (Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate). Their hydrodynamic properties were determined by sedimentation analyses in H2O and D2O, and gel filtration on Sepharose 4B. Two specific insulin-binding species are observed after velocity sedimentation in linear sucrose density gradients: peaks I and II. In Triton X-100, the sedimentation coefficient (s20,w), partial specific volume (Vc), and Stokes radius (a) for peaks I and II are, respectively, 10.2 +/- 0.5 S and 6.6 +/- 0.5 S, 0.75 +/- 0.02 ml/g, and 0.76 +/- 0.02 ml/g, and 89 +/- 3 A and 76 +/- 3 A, to yield Mr = 410,000 +/- 75,000 and 235,000 +/- 55,000, respectively, for the protein-Triton X-100 complex. The corresponding values in deoxycholate solution are: 10.7 +/- 0.5 S and 6.9 +/- 0.5 S, 0.71 +/- 0.03 ml/g and 0.70 +/- 0.04 ml/g, and 86 +/- 3 A and 69 +/- 3 A for peaks I and II, respectively, to yield 360,000 +/- 65,000 and 180,000 +/- 45,000, respectively, for the molecular weight of the protein-deoxycholate complex. These data are consistent with a model whereby each receptor species binds to one micelle of the appropriate detergent. In agreement with this model, it was also found that, in both Triton X-100 and deoxycholate, concentrations higher than the critical micellar concentration are required in order to maintain discrete receptor species in solution. At concentrations below the critical micellar concentration, the receptors aggregate to a broad band that sediments faster than 11.3 S. This is typical of membrane proteins that are stabilized in solution by insertion into detergent micelles. Based on these results, the protein molecular weights of peaks I and II are estimated to be 355,000 +/- 65,000 and 180,000 +/- 45,000, respectively. When membranes are treated with the reducing agent dithiothreitol, peak I is converted to peak II. This fact, together with the estimates obtained for the protein molecular weights of the two receptor species, suggests that peak I is a disulfide-linked dimer of peak II. The sedimentation characteristics of insulin receptors in many different cell types appear to be similar. As with turkey erythrocytes, detergent extracts of membranes from rat liver contained two native receptor species whose sedimentation coefficients were similar to peaks I and II. However, in all the other cell types examined, including rat adipocytes, rat heart muscle, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 3T3-C2 fibroblasts, and FAO hepatoma cells, peak I (the native dimer) was the predominant species observed."
https://openalex.org/W2141094606,"The cytoplasmic isozyme of aspartate transaminase is inactivated by trypsin due to loss of a 19-residue peptide from the NH2-terminal region. A second peptide bond at Arg-25 is then cleaved by trypsin leaving a residual core protein, transaminase 26-412. Inactivation by trypsin resembles that for the mitochondrial enzyme (Sandmeier, E., and Christen, P. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10284-10289), yet occurs 10 times faster for the cytoplasmic isozyme. In the mitochondrial enzyme, trypsin cleavage produces equal concentrations of proteins missing the first 26 and 31 amino acids. Sequence variation in the NH2-terminal regions can explain such differences. Specifically, the mitochondrial NH2 terminus has no trypsin-susceptible residue at position 19 and is stabilized by an electrostatic interaction between Asp-15 and Arg-292, whereas position 15 is a valyl residue in the cytoplasmic enzyme. Calorimetric data reveal both a decreased transition temperature (Td) and enthalpy (delta Hd) of denaturation in transaminases 20-412 and 26-412. Interaction of substrates with the active site chromophore and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) reveal that catalytically inactive transaminases 20-412 and 26-412 can bind amino acid substrates and produce spectroscopically detectable conversion of the pyridoxal to the pyridoxamine form of the protein. By contrast, substrate analogs only form enzymatic Michaelis-type complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1509682375,"The neutral amino acid transport systems of freshly isolated rat pancreatic islets have been studied by first examining the transport of L-alanine and the nonmetabolizable analogue 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB). By comparing the uptake of MeAIB and L-alanine for their pH dependency profile, choline and Li+ substitution for Na+, tolerance to N-methylation, and competition with other amino acids, the existence in pancreatic islets of both A and ASC amino acid transport systems was established. The systems responsible for the inward transport of five natural amino acids was studied using competition analysis and Na+ dependency of uptake. These studies defined three neutral amino acid transport systems: A and ASC (Na+-dependent) and L (Na+-independent). L-Proline entered rat islet cells mainly by system A; L-leucine by the Na+-independent system L. The uptake of L-alanine, L-serine, and L-glutamine was shared by systems ASC and L, the participation of system A being negligible for these three amino acids. An especially broad substrate specificity for systems L and ASC is therefore suggested for the rat pancreatic islet cells. The regulation of amino acid transport was also investigated in two conditions differing as to glucose concentration and/or availability, i.e. islets from fasted rats and islets maintained in tissue culture at high or low glucose concentrations. Neither alanine nor MeAIB transport was altered by fasting of the islet-donor rats. On the other hand, pancreatic islets maintained for 2 days in tissue culture at high (16.7 mM) glucose transported MeAIB at twice the rate of islets maintained at low (2.8 mM) glucose. Amino acid starvation of pancreatic islets during 11 h of tissue culture resulted in a 2-fold increase in MeAIB transport."
https://openalex.org/W1528550936,"A trypsin-modified form of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase has been isolated, purified, and characterized. The native enzyme, previously thought to be resistant to proteases, shows a loss of 20% of its activity after a 30-min exposure to 10% trypsin. No further loss is seen after 3 h; this is in contrast to the apoenzyme which loses essentially all restorable activity (addition of saturating Zn(II) and Mg(II) restores activity to the apoenzyme) when exposed to trypsin. Under these conditions, a single major peptide is produced, cleaved at the Arg-10 Ala-11 bond, which is purified using a chromatographic technique that separates proteins according to their pI (chromatofocusing). This modified alkaline phosphatase has a Vmax of 2000 mumol/h/mg (1 M Tris, pH 8.0, 20 degrees C, 1 mM p-nitrophenolphosphate) which is 22% less than the Vmax for the native enzyme. The Km for p-nitrophenolphosphate is lower for trypsin-modified alkaline phosphatase than for the native enzyme, 1.9 X 10(-5) and 4 X 10(-5) M, respectively. The KI for Pi for the native enzyme is 1.5 X 10(-5) M and for trypsin-modified alkaline phosphatase is 1 X 10(-5) M, suggesting that the reduction in Vmax is due to a reduction in the rate constant for Pi dissociation. Differential scanning calorimetry results indicate differences in the stabilities of the two species. The trypsin-modified alkaline phosphatase has a Tm of 90 degrees C which is lower than that for the reconstituted apoenzyme (93.5 degrees C) or for the native enzyme (98.5 degrees C). This modified form of alkaline phosphatase may prove to be valuable in studies concerning subunit interactions in this system as the deleted decapeptide occurs at the subunit interface region in the native structure."
https://openalex.org/W1898735964,"Bovine enterokinase has been purified from the mucosal fluid adhering to the intestinal wall. Enterokinase is predominantly present as membrane fragments which must be treated with Triton X-100 to release the enzyme. The purification resulted in a higher yield of enzyme in fewer steps and in less time than when mucosal cells were used. The properties of the enzyme in the fluid are identical with those found previously with the mucosal cell preparation (Liepnieks, J. J., and Light, A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1677-1683), but differ in the size of the subunits and in amino acid composition from the enzyme purified from intestinal contents (Anderson, L. E. Walsh, K. A., and Neurath, H. (1977) Biochemistry 16, 3354-3360). It is highly unlikely that the existence of isoenzymes could explain these differences. It is more likely that the enzyme isolated from the intestinal contents represents an extensively degraded form with retention of enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1561402256,"Abstract Succinyl-CoA synthetase has an (alpha beta)2 subunit structure and shows half-of-the-sites reactivity with respect to the formation of the phosphohistidyl residues that acts as a catalytic intermediate. Adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate has been found to be a substrate, but the overall maximum velocity is 3 orders of magnitude lower than that seen with ATP. Moreover, steps of the reaction involving thiophosphoryl transfer are much slower than the corresponding phosphoryl transfers. These properties of adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate as a substrate have been exploited to test the concept of alternating sites catalytic cooperativity proposed earlier as a rationale for the subunit structure of succinyl-CoA synthetase. As predicted by this model for catalysis, the rate of discharge of thiophosphate from the enzyme in the presence of succinate and CoA is stimulated by ATP. Neither of two nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP has an equivalent effect. The results indicate that the transfer of the thiophosphoryl group from the enzyme to succinate at one active site is not favored until the neighboring active site is phosphorylated by ATP, with accompanying reciprocal changes in the conformations of the two halves of the enzyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1497772750,"The amino acid sequences of ribosomal proteins S5 and L30 from Bacillus stearothermophilus have been determined. These proteins have recently been crystallized in our institute. Sequence data were obtained by manual sequencing of peptides derived from cyanogen bromide cleavage and digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin or thermolysin. Proteins S5 and L30 contain 166 and 62 amino acid residues and have calculated Mr values of 17,628 and 7,053, respectively. Comparison of the sequences with those of the homologous proteins from Escherichia coli shows 55% identical residues for S5 and 53% for L30. For both proteins, the distribution of conserved and substituted regions is not uniform throughout the molecule. Secondary structure predictions were carried out for the B. stearothermophilus proteins. Comparison with the results for the homologous E. coli proteins indicated similar secondary structural order for the molecules from the two species."

When such H1 dimers were cleaved with N-bromosuccinimide, chymotrypsin, or staphylococcal protease, analysis of the resulting fragments suggests that the major cross-links were formed between the COOH-terminal portions of neighboring H1 molecules, and that substantial bridging can also be made between the NH2-terminal portion of one H1 molecule and the COOH-terminal portion of another. NH2-terminal to NH2-terminal cross-links were not seen at significant levels, suggesting that the position of the NH2-terminal portion of H1 in chromatin is more restricted."

https://openalex.org/W1539005142,"Four types of carbamyl phosphate synthetase have been previously distinguished on the basis of catalytic properties and metabolic role. Immunoblot assay has now demonstrated cross-reactivity between rat liver carbamyl phosphate synthetase I and the following other three types of synthetases: carbamyl phosphate synthetase II from SV40-transformed baby hamster kidney cells, carbamyl phosphate synthetase III from spiny dogfish liver and from largemouth bass liver, and Escherichia coli carbamyl phosphate synthetase. The strongest cross-reactivity was observed between carbamyl phosphate synthetases I and III. These findings indicate at least partial structural homology among the various synthetases and constitute the first demonstration of such a relationship among the enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1523094174,"In the preceding paper (Aiyer, R. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14992-14999), the hydrodynamic properties of insulin receptors from turkey erythrocyte plasma membranes solubilized in nondenaturing detergents (Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate) were characterized. Two specific insulin-binding species are observed after velocity sedimentation in linear sucrose density gradients: peak II whose protein molecular weight (Mp) is 180,000 +/- 45,000 and its disulfide-linked dimer, peak I (Mp, 355,000 +/- 65,000). This paper describes the subunit composition of these species determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Insulin receptors were covalently attached to [125I]iodoinsulin with disuccinimidyl suberate. After solubilization in Triton X-100 or deoxycholate, peaks I and II were separated by sedimentation and subjected to SDS-PAGE; the constituent polypeptides were then identified by autoradiography. Under reducing conditions, both peaks I and II yield a major band of apparent molecular weight (Mapp) of 135,000; this band most likely represents the insulin-binding subunit (alpha). Minor bands of lower molecular weight are also seen whose significance is not entirely obvious. Under nonreducing conditions, peak I yields bands at Mapp = 230,000 and at greater than 240,000, while peak II yields bands at Mapp = 120,000 and 200,000. When these bands were cut out of the gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE following reduction with 10% beta-mercaptoethanol, all of them produced a single band that migrated with Mapp = 135,000. These results indicate that the alpha subunit is linked by disulfide bonds to at least one more subunit (beta). It is also apparent that the alpha subunit travels with higher mobility (Mapp = 120,000) under nonreducing conditions, suggesting the presence of intrachain disulfide bonds. Thus, peak II has a minimum subunit composition of alpha beta, where alpha is the insulin-binding subunit with a minimum Mr = 120,000-135,000 and beta has a minimum Mr = 80,000-90,000. And peak I, the disulfide-linked dimer of peak II, has a minimum subunit composition of alpha 2 beta 2. These results were further confirmed by cross-linking of protein subunits with glutaraldehyde, an (alpha, omega)-dialdehyde that reacts with amino groups. Within the limits of error, these molecular weights are in agreement with those estimated from the hydrodynamic properties of the detergent-solubilized, native receptor species reported in the preceding paper."
https://openalex.org/W1485186006,"CDP-diglyceride, the precursor of all the phospholipids in Escherichia coli, is cleaved in vitro to phosphatidic acid and CMP by a membrane-bound hydrolase. Since the physiological function of CDP-diglyceride hydrolase is unknown, we have explored the possibility that this enzyme acts in vivo as either a phosphatidyl- or cytidylyltransferase. To distinguish between these two alternatives, partially purified hydrolase was incubated with CDP-diglyceride in the presence of 50% H218O. Analysis of the reaction products by 31P NMR showed that 18O is incorporated exclusively into CMP, suggesting that the enzyme is a cytidylyltransferase. This conclusion is further supported by the following experimental results: (i) the hydrolase catalyzes the transfer of CMP from CDP-diglyceride to Pi; (ii) numerous phosphomonoesters, such as glycerol 3-phosphate, phosphoserine, and glucose 1-phosphate also function as CMP acceptors, but the corresponding compounds lacking the phosphate residues are not substrates for the enzyme; and (iii) CDP-diglyceride hydrolase exchanges [32P]phosphatidic acid for the phosphatidyl moiety of CDP-diglyceride and 32Pi for the beta-phosphate residue of CDP, indicating the involvement of a novel CMP-enzyme complex. These data suggest a biosynthetic role for CDP-diglyceride hydrolase, and extend the possible functions of CDP-diglyceride in the E. coli envelope."

https://openalex.org/W1493329012,"The interaction of the Escherichia coli elongation factor Tu guanosine tetraphosphate complex (EF-Tu ppGpp) with aminoacyl-tRNAs(aa-tRNA) was reinvestigated by gel filtration and hydrolysis protection experiments. These experiments show that EF-Tu X ppGpp like EF-Tu X GDP (Pingoud, A., Block, W., Wittinghofer, A., Wolf, H. & Fischer, E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11261-11267) forms a fairly stable complex with Phe-tRNAPhe, KAss being 0.6 X 10(5) M-1 at 25 degrees C. The binding of the EF-Tu X ppGpp X aa-tRNA complex to programmed ribosomes was investigated by a centrifugation technique. It is shown that this complex is bound codon-specific with KAss = 3 X 10(7) M-1 at 0 degrees C and that it stimulates peptidyl transfer. A numerical estimation of the intracellular concentration of EF-Tu X GTP X aa-tRNA and EF-Tu X ppGpp X aa-tRNA during normal growth and under the stringent response indicates that ppGpp accumulation does affect the EF-Tu X GTP X aa-tRNA concentration but does not lead to major depletion of this pool. Furthermore, due to the higher affinity of EF-Tu X GTP to aa-tRNA and of the ternary complex EF-Tu X GTP X aa-tRNA to the ribosome, EF-Tu X ppGpp X aa-tRNA binding to the ribosome is not significant. According to our measurements and calculations, therefore, a direct participation of EF-Tu in slowing down the rate of protein biosynthesis and improving its accuracy during amino acid starvation is not obvious."
https://openalex.org/W1571243879,"Optically detected triplet state magnetic resonance spectra are reported for the complex formed between mercurated poly(Urd) and Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein. Upon forming a complex, the triplet state properties of Trp residue(s) in the protein are perturbed by the heavy mercury atom and are characterized by a shortened triplet state lifetime and the appearance of a strong D + E slow passage optically detected magnetic resonance signal. These features, which signal an external heavy atom effect, provide direct evidence for a close range interaction between mercurated nucleotide bases and Trp residues owing to the requirement of a van der Waals contact between the perturbed molecule and the heavy atom perturber. The amplitude-modulated phosphorescence microwave double resonance technique selectively displays the phosphorescence spectrum of the heavy atom-perturbed Trp triplet states. A van der Waals contact manifested through a stacked structure of the mercurated uridine base and the indole moiety of Trp is strongly suggested as the most plausible mode of interaction from steric considerations, since other approaches of the mercury atom are blocked by the covalent attachment of 2-mercaptoethanol to mercury. The magnitude of the heavy atom perturbation also is consistent with Hg approach to the pi-system from above or below the indole aromatic plane, and is at least an order of magnitude larger than effects expected from an edge-on approach."
https://openalex.org/W1572352963,"We describe a method by which sulfhydryl compounds may be transported into Escherichia coli as the mixed disulfides with a cysteine residue of a di- or tripeptide. Transport occurs through the di- or oligopeptide transport systems, and it is suggested that subsequent release of the sulfhydryl compound occurs as a result of a disulfide exchange reaction with components of the sulfhydryl-rich cytoplasm. The free sulfhydryl compounds used here (2-mercaptopyridine and 4-[N-(2-mercaptoethyl)]aminopyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) show weak growth-inhibitory properties in their own right, but disulfide linkage to a cysteinyl peptide results in a considerable enhancement (up to 2 orders of magnitude). This is the first example of the use of the peptide transport systems of E. coli to effect portage transport of a poorly permeant molecule by using attachment to the side chain of one of the amino acid residues of a peptide; all previous examples have involved the incorporation of amino acid analogues into the peptide backbone. The synthesis of cysteinyl peptides containing disulfide-linked 2-mercaptopyridine is described. Displacement of the 2-mercaptopyridine by sulfhydryl compounds of interest proceeds rapidly and quantitatively in aqueous alkaline solution to provide the required peptide disulfides."

Without added NaCl, strand exchange proceeds efficiently with all duplex DNA termini examined including a nicked circular duplex.

https://openalex.org/W1604881091,"The attachment of 4-[N-2-(mercaptoethyl)]aminopyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (MEPDA) to AlaAlaCys through a disulfide bond to the cysteine residue has been described (Boehm, J. C., Kingsbury, W. D., Perry, D., and Gilvarg, C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14850-14855). The peptide disulfide showed enhanced growth inhibitory properties in Escherichia coli compared to the free sulfhydryl compound. Genetic evidence was presented to show that this side chain-modified peptide utilizes the oligopeptide transport system to gain entry to the cell. Following transport of the peptide, MEPDA is liberated by disulfide exchange reactions with sulfhydryl-containing components of the cell pool. In this paper, we examine in more detail the metabolism of this peptide. Using gel filtration chromatography to examine filtrates from cell suspensions incubated with the peptide, it was shown that loss of the peptide from the medium is accompanied by a corresponding increase in a component having the properties of MEPDA. The release of sulfhydryl groups from the peptide by cell suspensions could be monitored by Ellman's reagent and was found to be dependent upon peptide transport. Following cleavage of the disulfide bond, MEPDA is able to cross the cytoplasmic membrane and exit from the cell as a relatively lipophilic uncharged metal chelate."
