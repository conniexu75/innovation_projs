In one-species series, detection ability increased with successive encounters with one prey type. No similar effect occurred in two-species series. These results are a direct demonstration of a specific search image."

https://openalex.org/W1988384830,"Analysis of heptane-soluble compounds from ovipositors of Heliothis zea and Heliothis virescens shows that both species produce relatively large amounts of (Z)-11-hexadecenal, with traces of (Z)-9-hexadecenal, (Z)-7-hexadecenal, and hexadecanal. Heliothis virescens females differ from Heliothis zea in that they also produce trace amounts of tetradecanal, (Z)-9-tetradecenal, and (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol. In both species, trace compounds are essential to pheromonal activity and specificity of chemical signals."

https://openalex.org/W1979825436,Climatically significant variation of the solar constant (the energy output of the sun) implies measurable change in the solar radius. The available data limit variations of the solar radius between 1850 and 1937 to about 0.25 arc second; modeling of the sun indicates that the solar constant did not vary by more than 0.3 percent during that time.

https://openalex.org/W2065003267,"Evidence is presented which suggests that trends in the ozone concentration and stratospheric temperature, reported between the early 1960's and 1976, are to a large extent due to solar ultraviolet flux variability associated with the 11-year solar cycle. Radiative-convective-photochemical simulations of ozone and temperature variations have been made with a solar ultraviolet flux variability model. Results for temperatures and ozone concentrations, when compared with published data, show good agreement."

Representatives from public, private, and academic sectors participated in preparing an inventory of needs for the development of human, economic, and physical resources. The program includes 2,489 projects in basic and applied sciences at a cost of $260 million to 1982 and 17,000 scholarships at a cost of $130 million."

https://openalex.org/W4250181840,"In the issue of 13 April, in the News and Comment article, ""Low-level radiation: A high-level concern"" (p. 155), Health Physics was incorrectly referred to as the Journal of Health Physics. It was also stated that Oak Ridge Associated Universities runs Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In fact, the laboratory is run by the Union Carbide Corporation. In that same issue, in the Research News article, ""Low-level radiation: Just how bad is it?"" (p. 160), the name of the American Journal of Public Health was transmogrified to the American Journal of Health Physics the second time the journal was mentioned."
