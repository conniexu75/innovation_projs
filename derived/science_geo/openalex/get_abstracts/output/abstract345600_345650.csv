https://openalex.org/W2076377242,A sensitive and reliable new method for the detection of potato spindle tuber viroid in potato tubers has been developed. The method is based on hybridization of highly radioactive recombinant DNA to viroid RNA that has been attached to a solid support. The method can be automated and permits the rapid testing of large numbers of tubers.

Among these may be charged particles, X(+/-), that are stable or nearly so. The X(+,)s would form superheavy hydrogen, while the X(-,)s would bind to nuclei. Chemical isolation of naturally occurring technetium, promethium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, or americium would indicate the presence of superheavy particles in the forms RuX(-), SmX(-), (232)ThX(-), (235,236,238)UX(-), (244)PuX(-), or (247)CmX(-). Other substances worth searching for include superheavy elements with the chemical properties of boron, fluorine, manganese, beryllium, scandium, vanadium, lithium, neon, and thallium."

https://openalex.org/W1987738208,"Polycrystalline calcite was revealed by scanning electron microscopy of fractured skeletal ossicles of the sea star Echinaster spinulosus (Echinodermata, Asteroidea). Whisker-like calcite crystals were observed in specimens that were loaded in stress relaxation before being fractured; rapidly broken surfaces were smooth and glassy. The crystallites were 1300 angstroms wide and at least 3600 angstroms long and were packed together in lamellae. The lamellae were wound into spirals that formed the trabecular bars. All the crystallites in an ossicle appear to be aligned in the same direction. Geometric considerations indicate that the requirement for packing the crystallites smoothly may explain the high magnesium ion concentration of echinoderm calcite."

The fractions represent a wide range of chemical types and molecular size. Their isolation is a step toward speciation."

https://openalex.org/W2026984259,"The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is intended to reduce the vulnerability of the United States to interruptions in the oil supply from foreign sources. Storage for 248 million barrels of crude oil in salt caverns and mines, with equipment for pumping and distribution, was constructed and operationally tested in a 4-year period. Its present inventory is the largest known crude oil reserve in the world. Facilities for expanding the reserve's capacity by another 290 million barrels are being developed by solution-mining in salt domes."

https://openalex.org/W2074984367,A 5700-square-kilometer quiet zone occurs in the midst of the locations of more than 4000 earthquakes off the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. The region is indicated by the seismic gap technique to be a likely location for an earthquake of magnitude larger than 7. The quiet zone has existed since at least 1950; the last large earthquake originating from this area occurred in 1898 and was of magnitude 7.5. A rough estimate indicates that the magnitude of an earthquake rupturing the entire quiet zone could be as large as that of the 1898 event. It is not yet possible to forecast a time frame for the occurrence of such an earthquake in the quiet zone.

Spectral analysis of data upwind of Buffalo, New York, and Houston, Texas, suggests important roles for atmospheric turbulence and chemical reaction in aerosol fluctuations."
