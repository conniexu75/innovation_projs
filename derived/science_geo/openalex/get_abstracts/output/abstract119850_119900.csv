https://openalex.org/W2011582460,"S-Nitrosothiols have many biological activities and have been suggested to be intermediates in signal transduction. The mechanism and products of S-nitrosothiol decomposition are of great significance to the understanding of nitric oxide (·NO) biochemistry. S-Nitrosothiols are stable compounds at 37°C and pH 7.4 in the presence of transition metal ion chelators. The presence of trace transition metal ions (present in all buffers) stimulates the catalytic breakdown of S-nitrosothiols to ·NO and disulfide. Thiyl radicals are not formed as intermediates in this process. Photolysis of S-nitrosothiols results in the formation of ·NO and disulfide via the intermediacy of thiyl radicals. Reduced metal ion (e.g. Cu+) decomposes S-nitrosothiols more rapidly than oxidized metal ion (e.g. Cu2+) indicating that reducing agents such as glutathione and ascorbate can stimulate decomposition of S-nitrosothiol by chemical reduction of contaminating transition metal ions. Transnitrosation can also stimulate S-nitrosothiol decomposition if the product S-nitrosothiol is more susceptible to transition metal ion-catalyzed decomposition than the parent S-nitrosothiol. Equilibrium constants for the transnitrosation reactions of reduced glutathione, either with S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine or with S-nitroso-L-cysteine indicate that S-nitrosoglutathione formation is favored.

The biological relevance of S-nitrosothiol decomposition is discussed. S-Nitrosothiols are compounds with the generic structure of RSNO. Under appropriate conditions these compounds decompose to liberate nitric oxide (·NO) and the corresponding disulfide (1Ignarro L.J. Lippton H. Edwards J.C. Baricos W.H. Hyman A.L. Kadowitz P.J. Gruetter C.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1981; 218: 739-749PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the formation and decay of low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols, such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) 1The abbreviations used are: GSNOS-nitrosoglutathioneCySHreduced cysteineCySNOS-nitroso-L-cysteineDMPO5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxideDMPO/·SGspin adduct of GS· with DMPODMPO/·Scysspin adduct of ·Scys with DMPODMPO/·S-NAPspin adduct of ·S-NAP with DMPODTPAdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acidESRelectron spin resonanceGSHreduced glutathioneGSSGoxidized glutathioneGS·glutathione-derived thiyl radicalNAPN-acetyl-DL-penicillamine·NOnitric oxidePBSphosphate-buffered salineRS·thiyl radical·Scyscysteine-derived thiyl radicalSNAPS-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine·S-NAPN-acetyl-DL-penicillamine-derived thiyl radicalHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyESRelectron spin resonanceGgauss. and S-nitrosocysteine (CySNO), may represent a mechanism for the storage or transport of ·NO (2Myers P.R.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 7-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). According to this proposal, S-nitrosothiols are synthesized chemically by reaction of ·NO with thiol. Subsequently, these compounds are transported or diffuse to the site of action. Decomposition of the S-nitrosothiol then leads to ·NO release and the corresponding biological effect. This hypothesis is mainly speculative and remains to be rigorously tested. Little is known about the reaction of ·NO with glutathione (GSH) in vivo; however, the direct reaction of GSH with ·NO does not generate GSNO but forms glutathione disulfide and nitroxyl anion (NO−) (4Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5DeMaster E.G. Quast B.J. Redfern B. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11494-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). GSNO is formed only if ·NO is oxidized, by reaction with oxygen, to form ·NO2 and N2O3 (6Wink D.A. Nims M. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. LeGraff W.G. Mitchell J.B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). As intracellular oxygen concentrations at the tissue level are in the range of 10-20 µM (7Smirnova T.I. Smirnov A.I. Clarkson R.B. Belford R.L. Magn. Reson. Med. 1995; 33: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and as the rate of ·NO oxidation is proportional to the squared power of the ·NO concentration (8Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), it is likely that the oxidation of ·NO by oxygen in vivo is a slow and insignificant process (4Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Evidence for the formation of S-nitrosothiols from endogenous ·NO remains scarce (9Gaston B. Reilley J. Drazen J.M. Fackler J. Ramdev P. Arnelle D. Mulins M.E. Sugarbaker D.J. Chee C. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10957-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, nitrosylation of protein thiols has been implicated in the ·NO-dependent regulation of many enzymes, including protein kinase C (10Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27180-27185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (11Clancy R.M. Levartovsky D. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Yegudin J. Abramson S.B.

Although the physiological relevance of S-nitrosothiols remains to be established, these compounds have been used as donors of ·NO (1Ignarro L.J. Lippton H. Edwards J.C. Baricos W.H. Hyman A.L.

Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The most commonly employed compounds are GSNO and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP) (Fig. 1A). Such compounds have been shown to have diverse and remarkable biological effects. For example, SNAP is a potent vasodilator (1Ignarro L.J. Lippton H. Edwards J.C. Baricos W.H. Hyman A.L. Kadowitz P.J. Gruetter C.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1981; 218: 739-749PubMed Google Scholar) and low concentrations of GSNO have been shown to afford significant protection to the ischemic myocardium (17Konorev E.A. Tarpey M.M. Joseph J. Baker J.E. Kalyanaraman B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 200-206PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that S-nitrosothiols decompose by homolytic cleavage of the S-N bond (Reaction 1). RSNO→RS·+·NOREACTION 1 This process generates ·NO and a thiyl radical, RS·(18). However, this assumption has not been effectively tested under physiologically relevant conditions. It has been established that S-nitrosothiols are sensitive to both photolytic (19Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Sexton D.J. Muruganandam A. McKenny D.J. Mutus B. Photochem.

Chem. Commun. 1993; : 1758-1759Crossref Google Scholar) but are stable in the presence of transition metal ion chelators in the dark. The biological activity of S-nitrosothiols may not be exclusively dictated by the release of ·NO as the chemistry of these compounds is complex. S-Nitrosothiols have also been shown to form NO−, which under appropriate conditions can lead to the formation of either nitrous oxide (4Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B.

S-Nitrosothiols can also undergo nitrosonium (NO+) transfer to other cellular thiols by a process referred to as transnitrosation (24Barnett D.J. Rios A. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; 2: 1279-1282Crossref Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the mechanism of decomposition and transnitrosation reactions of S-nitrosothiols using electron spin resonance (ESR), optical spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and electrochemical methods. GSH, reduced cysteine (CySH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (NAP), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were obtained from Sigma. DMPO was purified using activated charcoal as reported previously (25Kotake Y. Reinke L.A. Tanigawa T. Koshida H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Copper(II) sulfate and copper(I) chloride were obtained from Fisher. GSNO and CySNO were synthesized according to the method of Hart (26Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). SNAP and nitronyl nitroxide (2-(p-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazolin-3-oxide 1-oxyl) (NNO) were synthesized according to the published procedures (27Field L. Dilts R.V. Ravichandaran R. Lanhert P.G. Carnahan G.E. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1978; : 249-250Crossref Google Scholar, 28Ullman E.F. Osiecki J.H. Boocock D.G.B. Darcy R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 7049-7059Crossref Scopus (828) Google Scholar). ESR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Varian E109 spectrometer operating at 9.5 GHz and employing 100 kHz field modulation. Samples were prepared in the nitrogen glove box and taken up in a 100-µl capillary (Corning), which was sealed at both ends with Miniseal (Baxter). The capillary was placed in a 4-mm quartz tube, which was then placed inside the ESR cavity. All samples were prepared in the dark and irradiated, when required, with visible light (λ > 408 nm) inside the ESR cavity. Data were collected using the VIKING software, developed at the Medical College of Wisconsin, and simulated with the ESR software developed by David Duling from the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC. 2This software is available via the World Wide Web at http://lmb.niehs.nih.gov/LMB/ Photolytic decomposition of GSNO was performed in 8-ml glass vials. Samples were irradiated while stirring with light from xenon arc lamp source (ILC Technology, Sunnyvale, CA) after passing through a copper(II) sulfate solution (100 g/liter) and a long pass filter of λ > 408 nm. Aliquots were removed for GSSG measurements. Samples for ESR studies were prepared in glass capillaries and were irradiated inside the ESR cavity. Separation of GSNO and GSSG was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1050 series HPLC system equipped with UV-vis detection. The mobile phase was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and methanol (94:6) with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The stationary phase was an analytical C18 reversed phase column (Partisil ODS-3, 5-µm particle size, Whatman, Hillsboro, OR). UV absorption was used to detect GSNO and GSSG (λ = 220 nm). ·NO was detected directly using a ·NO electrode (World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL) in a thermostated oxygen-electrode chamber (Yellow Spring Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH) modified by the addition of a glass window for irradiation purposes. The ·NO electrode was stabilized at 37°C in PBS before use. The presence of ·NO was confirmed using NNO, which rapidly scavenges ·NO to form the corresponding imino nitroxide (29Hogg N. Singh R.J. Joseph J. Neese F. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radical Res. 1995; 22: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transnitrosation reactions between SNAP and either GSH or CySH were monitored at 37°C in PBS containing DTPA (100 µM) by following the change in absorbance at 234 nm. The initial rate of the transnitrosation reaction at a range of thiol concentrations was used to measure the rate constant (k1) for this reaction according to Equation 1, where d[SNAP]0/dt is the initial rate of decay of SNAP. d[SNAP]0dt=k1[SNAP]0[RSH]0(Eq. 1) [SNAP]0 and [RSH]0 represent the initial concentrations of SNAP and RSH. A similar series of experiments using NAP and either GSNO or CySNO was conducted to determine the rate constant for the reverse reaction (k−1). Equilibrium constants (K) were calculated from the ratio of the forward and the reverse rate constants. The chemical structures of the thiols and S-nitrosothiols used in this study are shown in Fig. 1A. In order to measure the production of thiyl radicals from the decomposition of S-nitrosothiols, these compounds were mixed with DMPO at 37°C and ESR spectra were obtained. GSNO, SNAP, and CySNO, in the dark, gave no ESR-detectable DMPO spin adducts (Fig. 2, A, C, and E, respectively). Irradiation of a mixture of GSNO and DMPO with visible light (λ > 408 nm) gave a four-line ESR spectrum (Fig. 2B), that could be simulated (Fig. 2B, dotted line), using similar values for the nitrogen and hydrogen hyperfine coupling constants (aN = 15.2 G and aHβ = 16.3 G). This spectrum is characteristic of the glutathione-derived thiyl radical (GS·) adduct with DMPO (DMPO/·SG) (18Josephy P.D. Rehorek D. Janzen E.G. Tet. Lett. 1984; 25: 1685-1688Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The chemical structures of thiyl radical adducts of DMPO are shown in Fig. 1B. Irradiation of a mixture of SNAP and DMPO gave a six-line spectrum characteristic of trapping of N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine-derived thiyl radical (·S-NAP) with DMPO (DMPO/·S-NAP), which could be simulated using the hyperfine coupling constants (aN = 15.3 G and aHβ = 17.7 G) (Fig. 2D). Irradiation of CySNO in the presence of DMPO also gave a six-line ESR spectrum of spin adduct of CySH-derived thiyl radical (·Scys) with DMPO (DMPO/·Scys) (aN = 15.1 G and aHβ = 17.2 G) (Fig. 2F). The spectral parameters of DMPO/·SG, DMPO/·S-NAP, and DMPO/·Scys adducts are characteristic and distinguishable. The spectra in Fig. 2 were collected in the absence of transition metal ion chelators and under these conditions the S-nitrosothiols decomposed in the dark with relative rates CySNO > SNAP > GSNO (Ref. 30Mathews W.R. Kerr S.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 1529-1537PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). The observation that DMPO thiyl radical adducts were not formed in the dark suggests that transition metal ion-induced decomposition of S-nitrosothiols does not proceed through a thiyl radical intermediate (Fig. 2). To further investigate the intermediacy of thiyl radical, GSNO was allowed to decompose both in the dark and under irradiation, in the presence and absence of DMPO, and the extent of conversion of GSNO to GSSG was monitored. DMPO has been shown to react rapidly with thiyl radicals (k = 107M−1 s−1) (31Harman L.S. Carver D.K. Schreiber J. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1642-1648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Buettner G.R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 177: 295-299Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). If thiyl radicals are formed, it is expected that they will react with DMPO and reduce the yield of GSSG. Photolytic and transition metal ion-mediated decomposition of GSNO liberated ·NO and resulted in the formation of GSSG (Reaction 2). 2GSNO→GSSG+2·NOREACTION 2Fig. 3 shows a typical HPLC trace for the separation of GSNO from GSSG. The retention times for GSNO and GSSG were 8.5 and 9.5 min, respectively. In the absence of DMPO, irradiation of GSNO resulted in the stoichiometric conversion of GSNO to GSSG (Fig. 3A) (20 nmol of GSNO produced 10 ± 1.2 nmol of GSSG). In the presence of DMPO, irradiation resulted in an identical decrease in GSNO, indicating that DMPO did not affect the amount of light absorbed by GSNO; however, the concomitant formation of GSSG was inhibited (Fig. 3B). The kinetics of GSNO decay and GSSG formation are shown in Fig. 4. Decomposition of GSNO in the dark was a slow process (t1/2= 80 h) (Fig. 4A) that results in the formation of GSSG. 3The t1/2 of GSNO has been measured to be 159 h (30Mathews W.R. Kerr S.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 1529-1537PubMed Google Scholar). However, this value has an absolute dependence on the amount of contaminating metal ions in the system. DMPO(100 mM) had no effect on the formation of GSSG. Decomposition of GSNO under irradiation was more rapid (t1/2=8 min) (Fig. 4B) and also resulted in the formation of GSSG. DMPO (100 mM) did not affect GSNO decomposition but resulted in a 50% reduction in GSSG formation. At higher concentrations of DMPO (200 mM), an 80% reduction in the yield of GSSG was observed during photolytic decomposition of GSNO (Table I). High concentrations of DMPO are required in order to compete with the diffusion-limited dimerization of GS·. Addition of Cu2+ (2 µM) resulted in a more rapid decomposition of GSNO. Under these conditions, DMPO/·SG was not observed by ESR and DMPO (200 mM) did not affect the yield of GSSG (Table I). These results indicate that photolytic decomposition of GSNO occurs through a GS· intermediate, whereas dark, transition metal ion-mediated decomposition does not.Fig. 4The effect of DMPO on GSSG formation and GSNO depletion during decomposition of GSNO. GSNO (250 µM) was incubated in the presence or absence of DMPO (100 mM) either in the dark at 37°C (A) or in the presence of visible light (λ > 408 nm) and DTPA (100 µM) (B). Incubations were separated by reverse phase HPLC. Products were detected by UV absorption at 220 nm and quantified against known concentrations of standard solutions.

Barnett D.J. McAninly J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; 2: 741-745Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that addition of Cu2+ to GSNO resulted in a rapid release of ·NO. However, addition of Cu+ resulted in a much greater stimulation of ·NO release, which was inhibited by DTPA, a transition metal ion chelator (data not shown). These results indicate that the binding of copper ions to GSNO is a prerequisite for enhanced decomposition, as has been described for other S-nitrosothiols (33Askew S.C. Barnett D.J. McAninly J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; 2: 741-745Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Both Cu2+- and Cu+-induced ·NO release were antagonized by NNO, and ESR analysis indicated that, under these conditions, NNO was partially converted to imino nitroxide confirming the production of ·NO (data not shown). Interestingly, the addition of GSH to GSNO, in the absence of DTPA, stimulated the contaminating transition metal ion-dependent release of ·NO (Fig. 5). In the presence of DTPA, GSH-stimulated GSNO decay does not result in ·NO production (4Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the proposal that Cu2+/Cu+ redox cycling mechanism is not responsible for GSNO decomposition. However, reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ by GSH, or other reducing agents, will accelerate GSNO decay. Decomposition of GSNO by Cu+ may occur by the mechanism shown in Reactions 3 and 4. This represents a catalytic redox cycle for Cu+, which will not occur with Cu2+ unless additional reducing equivalents are present. Under these conditions autoxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+ may lead to superoxide and peroxynitrite formation. GSNO+Cu1++H+→GSH+·NO+Cu2+REACTION 4 Transnitrosation between thiols and S-nitrosothiols has been implicated in the biological activity of S-nitrosothiols (34Meyer D.J. Kramer H. Ozer N. Coles B. Ketterer FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Park J. Billman G.E. Means G.E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 885-891PubMed Google Scholar). Previous determinations of the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for these reactions have used extremely high concentrations of both thiol and nitrosothiol (0.5-10 mM) (24Barnett D.J. Rios A. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; 2: 1279-1282Crossref Google Scholar, 34Meyer D.J. Kramer H. Ozer N. Coles B. Ketterer FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Park J. Billman G.E. Means G.E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 885-891PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons for using high concentrations of S-nitrosothiols are: (i) most S-nitrosothiols have similar UV-vis spectra and (ii) the Δεmax for the transnitrosation reaction is less than 100 M−1 cm−1. SNAP, on the other hand, has an additional absorbance peak at 228 nm, and transnitrosation between SNAP and other thiols can be monitored at 234 nm with a Δεmax of approximately 3000 M−1 cm−1. Fig. 6A shows the spectral changes that occurred upon addition of GSH (100 µM) to SNAP (100 µM) in the presence of DTPA. As transnitrosation proceeded the decay of absorbance at 234 nm was accompanied by an increase in absorbance at 200-220 nm. A sharp isosbestic point at 222 nm was observed, indicating that decomposition of S-nitrosothiol was not occurring. The Δε for this change was measured to be 3040 M−1 cm−1 at 234 nm from the maximum change at a high concentration of GSH (500 µM). The initial rate of SNAP decay, using a range of GSH concentrations (Fig. 6B), was used to calculate a rate constant for this reaction (Table II), assuming a reversible second-order reaction (Reaction 5). SNAP+GSH⇌GSNO+NAP REACTION 5A parallel set of experiments were performed using GSNO (100 µM) and NAP (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 µM) (Fig. 6B and data not shown) as the reactants to determine the rate constant of the reverse reaction (Table II). The ratio of these two numbers gave an equilibrium constant of 18.6, indicating that GSNO formation is favored. This is in contrast to Meyer et al. (34Meyer D.J. Kramer H. Ozer N. Coles B.

A similar set of reactions, using SNAP and CySH for the forward reaction and CySNO and NAP for the reverse reaction, gave the rate constants shown in Table II. The calculated equilibrium constant of 6.46 indicates that the formation of CySNO is favored in this reaction. This is larger than that measured by Meyer et al. (34Meyer D.J. Kramer H. Ozer N. Coles B. Ketterer FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), who reported an equilibrium constant of 2.2 for this reaction. The equilibrium constant (KGC) for the reaction between GSNO and CySH was calculated to be 0.35 from the relationship KGC = KSG/KSC, where KSG is the equilibrium constant for the reaction between SNAP and GSH and KSC is the equilibrium constant for the reaction between SNAP and CySH (Table II). This indicates that GSNO formation is thermodynamically favored in this reaction system.Table II.Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of transnitrosation reactionsReactantsk1k−1KaK =k1/k−1.M−1s−1M−1s−1SNAP/GSH9.09 ± 0.780.53 ± 0.1318.6SNAP/CySH20.63 ± 3.153.15 ± 1.116.46GSNO/CySHNDND0.35bCalculated from K(SNAP/CySH)U/UK(SNAP/GSH).a K =k1/k−1.b Calculated from K(SNAP/CySH)U/UK(SNAP/GSH). Open table in a new tab The observation that photolysis of S-nitrosothiols generates thiyl radicals (Fig. 2) indicates another method by which transnitrosation reactions can be monitored. Photolysis of a mixture of a thiol and an S-nitrosothiol in the presence of DMPO, after a period of dark incubation, will give a “snapshot” of the transnitrosation reaction. Fig. 7 shows the transnitrosation reaction between SNAP and GSH as monitored by ESR. Computer simulations indicate that the presence of DMPO/·SG and DMPO/·S-NAP is sufficient to account for the spectra shown in Fig. 7. A solution of SNAP gave the ESR spectrum of DMPO/·S-NAP (Fig. 7A) immediately after photolysis. However, if the solution was incubated with GSH in the dark for 20 min before photolysis, the ESR spectrum observed was a mixture of both the DMPO/·SG and the DMPO/·S-NAP spin adducts. After 60 min of dark incubation, the DMPO/·SG spectrum dominated. These results are consistent with the optical data indicating that GSNO formation is favored during transnitrosation (Table II). The transnitrosation reaction between GSH and CySNO (Reaction 6) was monitored by ESR as shown in Fig. 8. CySNO+GSH⇌GSNO+CySNREACTION 6 Incubation of CySNO (500 µM) with GSH (500 µM) in the presence of DMPO resulted in no ESR signal under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 8A); however, upon irradiation of the solution, it immediately (within the dead time of sample preparation and ESR analysis which is about 2 min) gave only the DMPO/·SG (Fig. 8B). Incubation of GSNO with CySH in the presence of DMPO resulted in no ESR signal under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 8C); however, upon irradiation of the solution (after incubation in dark), it gave only the DMPO/·SG (Fig. 8, D and E). This indicates that the transnitrosation reaction between CySNO and GSH is rapid and the equilibrium of Reaction 6 favors GSNO formation. In the absence of transition metal ions or in the presence of metal ion chelators, the transnitrosation reaction is unlikely to be responsible for the release of ·NO from S-nitrosothiols as both the reactant and product S-nitrosothiol are stable. However, in the presence of contaminating transition metal ions, transnitrosation may accelerate ·NO release. This is shown for the reaction between GSNO and NAP (Fig. 9). In the presence of DTPA and in the dark, GSNO did not generate ·NO and addition of NAP had no effect. In the absence of DTPA, however, GSNO generated a small amount of ·NO, which was dramatically enhanced by the addition of NAP. Irradiation of GSNO, in the presence of DTPA, gave a much greater release of ·NO, which was unaffected by NAP. However, in the absence of DTPA, the addition of NAP resulted in enhanced production of ·NO. Although the equilibriu"

In control studies, the O-glycans on CD43 (leukosialin), a mucin-like glycoprotein also expressed by HL-60 cells, were analyzed and compared to those of PSGL-1.

The structures of the glycans on PSGL-1 responsible for binding to P- and E-selectin are not known. Both sialylation and fucosylation of PSGL-1 are important for interactions with P- and E-selectin (4Moore K.L. Stults N.L. Diaz S. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Varki A. McEver R.P. J.

Recent studies on the post-translational glycosylation of recombinant PSGL-1 indicate that O-glycans containing the core-2 motif GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr are necessary for high affinity binding of PSGL-1 to P- and E-selectin (19Li F.

However, proper glycosylation of PSGL-1 is necessary but not sufficient for high affinity binding to P-selectin. PSGL-1 also contains tyrosine sulfate residues near the amino terminus that are essential for high affinity interactions with P-selectin, but not with E-selectin (13Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M.

Although carbohydrates on PSGL-1 are critical for binding to selectins, no detailed chemical structures of the glycans are available. Much of the information about the glycosylation of the molecule has been obtained by enzymatic treatments of the native ligand and by studies on recombinant forms of PSGL-1 expressed in various cell types. While these indirect methods can provide valuable information about critical determinants on the ligand, detailed structural information on O-glycans from native PSGL-1 is essential to identify glycans that are important for ligand function and to provide a clearer understanding of why PSGL-1 is a ligand for P- and E-selectin, whereas other mucins such as CD43 are not. Here we describe the structures of the O-glycans on PSGL-1 synthesized by HL-60 cells that were metabolically radiolabeled with 3H-sugar precursors. We have compared the glycosylation of PSGL-1 with that of CD43 to determine whether two sialomucins expressed by the same cells are O-glycosylated differently. The HL-60 cell line was used in these studies because the post-translational modifications known to be important for binding to P- and E-selectin on both HL-60 and neutrophil PSGL-1 are comparable (4Moore K.L.

Our studies demonstrate that the majority of O-glycans of PSGL-1 are disialylated or neutral forms of the core-2 tetrasaccharide. Less than 15% of the O-glycans are fucosylated and these contain the structural determinant for the sLex antigen. These results demonstrate that PSGL-1 is glycosylated differently from CD43 and that PSGL-1 contains unique O-glycans that are likely to be critical for high affinity interactions with P- and E-selectin.

[3H]PSGL-1 was purified from cell extracts using affinity chromatography on a column of immobilized, recombinant soluble P-selectin (21Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J.

The enriched EDTA-eluted samples were rechromatographed on the P-selectin column after dialysis into Ca2+-containing buffer. The twice purified PSGL-1 represented ≈0.07% of the [3H]GlcN radioactivity in the cell extract. Purified [3H]PSGL-1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by fluorography. CD43 was immunoprecipitated from 3H-sugar-labeled HL-60 cells using a CD43-specific mAb, H5H5 (IgG1). The H5H5 hybridoma cell line was produced by Dr. T. August and obtained from the Developmental Hybridoma Bank (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). CD43 was immunoprecipitated using described procedures (8Moore K.L. Eaton S.F. Lyons D.E. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23318-23327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, followed by fluorography. The gel slices containing radiolabeled PSGL-1 and CD43 were directly treated with mild base/borohydride as described elsewhere (23Iyer R.N. Carlson D.M. Arch. Biochem.

Chromatography was performed on Bio-Gel P-4 (medium mesh) in a 1 × 90 cm column and on Bio-Gel P-10 (medium mesh) in a 1 × 48-cm column in 0.1 M pyridyl/acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The anionic character and sialylation of glycans was assessed partly by chromatography on a column of QAE-Sephadex, with step elution in 2 mM Tris-base containing 20, 70, 140, 200, and 250 mM NaCl (24Cummings R.D.

The simple core-1 O-glycan Galβ1→3GalNAc was radiolabeled by reduction in the presence of NaB[3H]4 to form Galβ1→3GalNAcOH[3H] (26Li E. Tabas I. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7762-7770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A set of [3H]GlcN-labeled standard glycans was prepared from [3H]GlcN-labeled HL-60 cell total glycoproteins following previously described procedures (15Carlsson S.R. Sasaki H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standards included the disialylated core-2 hexasaccharide NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4 GlcNAcβ1→6(NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→3)GalNAcOH, the neutral core-2 tetrasaccharide Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→ 6(Galβ1→3)GalNAcOH, and the trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAcOH. The structure of each glycan was confirmed by sensitivity to Arthrobacter neuraminidase, β-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, as determined by descending paper chromatography as described below. The core-2 fucosylated pentasaccharide standard Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAcOH was prepared by incubating the [3H]GlcN-tetrasaccharide Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAcOH with unlabeled GDP-Fuc (100 µM) in the presence of 50 µg of extract from COS7 cells stably transfected with the human FTIV gene, as described previously (27Debose-Boyd R. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This α-1,3-fucosyltransferase adds Fuc in α-1,3-linkage to GlcNAc residues in acceptors containing terminal N-acetyllactosamine sequences (28Goelz S.E. Hession C. Goff D. Griffith B. Tizard R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21777-21783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the reaction migrated as a pentasaccharide, as expected, and was converted to the corresponding tetrasaccharide by treatment with the Streptomyces α-1,3/4-fucosidase. To define the Man:Fuc ratio and provide standard high mannose-type N-glycans, radiolabeled glycoproteins were prepared from [3H]Man-labeled HL-60 cell extracts. For the preparation of glycopeptides, the cell extracts were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and treated with Pronase as described previously (24Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. Schneider W.J. Hobgood K.K. Tolleshaug H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15261-15273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these glycopeptides, high mannose-type N-glycan standards (Man9GlcNAc1, Man8GlcNAc1, Man7GlcNAc1, Man6GlcNAc1, and Man5GlcNAc1) were prepared following treatment with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (31Cummings R.D. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 243Google Scholar). In the [3H]GlcN-labeled, disialylated hexasaccharide NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→3)GalNAcOH, prepared from HL-60 cells, the NeuAc, GlcNAc, and GalNAcOH residues are radiolabeled (32Varki A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 16-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). During equilibrium radiolabeling over a 48-h period, the relative molar ratios for these residues should be close to unity. Longer labeling times do not affect the distribution of radioactivity between GlcN, GalN, and NeuAc, confirming that equilibrium has been attained. To determine the relative molar ratio for GlcNAc and GalNAc residues, this [3H]GlcN-hexasaccharide was desialylated to generate a [3H]GlcN-tetrasaccharide; this tetrasaccharide was hydrolyzed in strong acid and the released radioactivity was identified by high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) as described below. All radioactivity was recovered in [3H]GlcN and [3H]GalNOH in the ratio of [3H]GlcN:[3H]GalNOH of 1.0:0.8. This ratio was used as a correction factor for calculating relative molar ratios of isolated glycans, i.e. the radioactivity recovered in [3H]GalN(OH) in a sample after hydrolysis was divided by 0.8. The relative molar ratio we observed is consistent with other studies on HL-60 cells metabolically radiolabeled with the [3H]GlcN precursor (17Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24379-24386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the relative molar ratio for NeuAc and GlcNAc residues, the [3H]GlcN-hexasaccharide was desialylated with neuraminidase, and the released radioactivity in NeuAc was determined. The radioactivity recovered in GlcN and NeuAc was in the ratio of 1.0:1.4, respectively. Since NeuAc radioactivity was derived from two residues of the disialylated hexasaccharide, this gave a final value for the relative molar ratio for GlcN:NeuAc of 1.0:0.7. The ratios of GlcN:GalN and Man:Fuc in PSGL-1 and CD43 were determined following strong acid hydrolysis of excised gel slices containing purified PSGL-1 and CD43. The gel slices were treated with 250 µl of 2 N trifluoroacetic acid at 121°C for 2 h. The released, radiolabeled monosaccharides in the hydrolysate were identified by HPAEC on a CarboPac PA-1 column (4 × 250 mm) in a Dionex system and elution with 16 mM NaOH for 30 min. The relative molar ratio for GlcN:GalN in glycans was calculated by dividing the radioactivity in the GlcN peak by the radioactivity in the GalN peak and correcting for differences in specific activity of [3H]GlcN versus [3H]GalN. The Man:Fuc ratio in [3H]Man-glycans was also determined following acid hydrolysis as described above, using a Man:Fuc ratio of 1.0:1.0, which is typically observed after equilibrium radiolabeling of cells with [2-3H]Man (24Cummings R.D.

Enzymatic treatments of glycans with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, β-galactosidase, Arthrobacter neuraminidase, Streptomyces α-1,3/4-fucosidase, and E. freundii endo-β-galactosidase were performed as described previously (34Cummings R.D.

Digestion with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) neuraminidase was performed in 20 µl of 10 mM phosphate, pH 7.0, with 20 milliunits of enzyme for 24 h at 37°C, followed by addition of another 20 milliunits of enzyme and further incubation for 24 h. O-Glycans were analyzed and purified by descending paper chromatography on Whatman filter paper for the times noted using the pyridine/ethyl acetate/water/acetic acid (5:5:1:3) solvent system, as described previously (31Cummings R.D. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 243Google Scholar). Glycans were chemically defucosylated by treatment with 0.1 N trifluoroacetic acid at 100°C for 1 h as described elsewhere (36Spooncer E. Fukuda M. Klock J.C. Oates J.E. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4792-4801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PSGL-1 and CD43 were purified from HL-60 cells metabolically labeled with [3H]GlcN (Fig. 1A). The [3H]GlcN-PSGL-1 was purified by affinity chromatography on a column of immobilized P-selectin. The bound, EDTA-eluted fraction isolated after the first chromatography (1×) was repurified by a second chromatography (2×) on the P-selectin column. Virtually all (90-99%) of the radiolabel in the 2×-purified material bound P-selectin. This two-step procedure was necessary to remove a contaminating glycoprotein of ~120 kDa under nonreducing conditions that remained after the first step. The purified PSGL-1 behaved as a dimer of ~250 kDa in nonreducing conditions and ~120 kDa in reducing conditions. CD43 was immunoprecipitated using a CD43 mAb, and electrophoretically separated under nonreducing conditions. A single band of 120 kDa for CD43 was observed in both nonreducing (Fig. 1B) and in reducing conditions (data not shown). In the initial assessment of the glycosylation of PSGL-1 and CD43, we determined the ratio of GlcN:GalN in the purified glycoproteins. [3H]GlcN is metabolized by animal cells into radiolabeled GlcNAc, GalNAc, and sialic acids (32Varki A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 16-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gel slices containing the [3H]GlcN-glycoproteins were treated with strong acid (which results in destruction of sialic acids), and the radiolabeled GlcN and GalN were identified by Dionex HPAEC. The GlcN:GalN ratio was determined to be ≈2:1 for PSGL-1 and ≈1:1 for CD43. The GlcN:GalN ratio of ≈1:1 for CD43 is consistent with published evidence that a majority of the glycans in CD43 have the simple core-2 motif Galβ1→ 4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAcOH (15Carlsson S.R. Sasaki H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24379-24386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the glycans of PSGL-1 contain higher amounts of GlcNAc relative to GalNAc than the glycans of CD43. The presence of the sLex determinant on PSGL-1 has led to expectations that PSGL-1 might be heavily fucosylated (8Moore K.L. Eaton S.F. Lyons D.E. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23318-23327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the amount of Fuc present on PSGL-1 and CD43 isolated from HL-60 cells metabolically radiolabeled with [2-3H]Man. This labeled precursor is metabolized by cells to [2-3H]Fuc, and the relative specific activity of Man and Fuc after equilibrium labeling is equivalent (32Varki A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 16-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). [3H]Man-PSGL-1 and -CD43 were isolated by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The corresponding bands were subjected to strong acid hydrolysis, and the released monosaccharides were separated by HPAEC on a Dionex system. The Man:Fuc ratio was determined to be 3:5 for PSGL-1 and 3:2 for CD43. As a control, the Man:Fuc ratio was also determined for the total unpurified glycoproteins from HL-60 cells and found to be 3:1. Thus, PSGL-1 contains more Fuc residues than CD43 and more Fuc residues than average glycoproteins in HL-60 cells. Using this information it is possible to estimate the number of Fuc residues on PSGL-1. The cDNA sequence of PSGL-1 predicts that PSGL-1 has three potential N-glycosylation sites (9Sako D.

We find that in addition to insulin the insulinoma express the normal β-cell markers Pdx-1, IAPP, and Glut-2, and that these markers are absent from the glucagonoma: a reflection of the normal α-cell. Furthermore, this study suggests that the GLP-1, glucagon, GIP, IGF-1, and insulin receptors as well as E-cadherin, R-cadherin, Id-1, and Id-2 are differentially expressed within the islet of Langerhans. Importantly, insulinoma-specific expression of the recently cloned homeodomain protein Nkx 6.1 predicted β-cell-specific expression in the normal islet. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies raised against recombinant Nkx 6.1 did indeed localize Nkx 6.1 expression exclusively to the nuclei of normal islet β-cells. Apart from pancreatic islets only the antral part of the stomach contained Nkx 6.1 mRNA. We conclude that multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based mRNA profiling is a powerful tool to identify differentially expressed genes within phenotypically related cells and propose that Nkx 6.1 is involved in specifying the unique characteristics of the β-cell.

INTRODUCTIONThe developmental maturation of precursor cells into more specialized phenotypes during ontogeny is characterized by highly specific changes in gene expression. Thus, a detailed picture of mRNA levels in developmentally related cells may provide insight into both mechanisms and pathways of differentiation. The four distinct cell types (α- β- δ-, and PP-cells) present in the pancreatic islet of Langerhans are thought to derive from common precursor cells through stages of transient phenotypes expressing multiple islet as well as gut and brain peptide hormones (1Alpert S.

Since transcription factors regulating key differentiation steps are often involved in activating the genes that confer the specialized functions of terminally differentiated cells (11Li S.

Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar), we have included all cloned factors, which have been implicated in insulin gene regulation.Analysis of the mRNA levels of 54 selected genes in the different tumor phenotypes has led to the identification of several candidate genes with a predicted cell-specific expression in the normal islet. Importantly, we show by immunohistochemistry on sections of adult rat pancreas that the newly identified homeodomain protein Nkx 6.1 is expressed specifically in β-cells as predicted from the tumor analysis. The tissue distribution of Nkx 6.1 mRNA showed a remarkable tissue restriction (comparable to that of insulin and IAPP), suggesting that this factor plays a crucial role in specifying the unique nature of the pancreatic islet β-cell.DISCUSSIONBy multiplex RT-PCR, we have screened a large number of genes for differential expression in phenotypically distinct islet tumor phenotypes using neonatal rat islets of Langerhans as control tissue. Importantly, we find that the expression of the previously identified islet β-cell restricted genes IAPP, GLP-1-R, and Glut-2 and the transcription factor Pdx-1 segregate with insulin gene activity in the insulinoma phenotype. Derivation of the glucagonoma from pluripotent MSL-cells is associated with a shutdown of insulin, Glut-2, and Pdx-1 gene activity. These observations reflects the nature of normal islet β- and α-cells. We therefore conclude that these phenotypically distinct transformed islet cells are useful representatives of the corresponding cell types in the normal islet.Of the genes tested, a substantial fraction showed differential expression among the different tumor phenotypes, of which the most important are summarized in Fig. 7. It is striking that the MSL-G2 line is almost identical to the β-cell-like IN insulinoma in expression of most of the selected genes except for the inverse correlation between the two major pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon and the presence of Nkx 6.1, Id-4, and GLP-1-R in the insulinoma. Several otherwise β-cell restricted factors, such as Glut-2, IAPP, and, most importantly, the Pdx-1 gene, are expressed prior to insulin gene activation. This supports our previous proposal that the MSL-G2 culture is representing a pre-β-cell phenotype (21Madsen O.D. Nielsen J.H. Michelsen B. Westermark P. Betsholtz C. Nishi M. Steiner D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 557-561Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In contrast, the in vivo derivation of glucagonomas is associated with profound changes in the gene expression profile (Fig. 7). Several hormone genes (neuropeptide Y, PP, and calcitonin) as well as the GIP receptor gene are activated, while the expression of the calcitonin-R, IGF-1-R, R-, and E-cadherin, as well as Glut-2 and Pdx-1, are completely turned off. From these results we predict that these genes are differentially expressed in normal islet cells.Glucokinase expression in the insulinoma as well as in the glucagonoma is interesting and suggests a role of the enzyme in sensing low glucose levels, which might be coupled to the regulated secretion of glucagon in the normal α-cell. Agreeing with the glucagonoma expression, the glucokinase promoter has also been found active in α-cells of transgenic mice (35Jetton T.L. Liang Y. Pettepher C.C. Zimmerman E.C. Cox F.G. Horvath K. Matschinsky F.M. Magnusson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3641-3654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).During the δ-cell-like maturation seen in Tu-6 cells, which proceeded through the establishment of an in vitro culture from the insulinoma tumor cells (10Serup P. Andersen F.G. Petersen E.E. Madsen O.D. Diabetologia. 1992; 35 (Suppl. 1): A118Google Scholar), we observe down-regulation of several hormonal genes (gastrin, cholecystokinin, IAPP, and insulin), whereas somatostatin is activated in most cells of the Tu-6 line. This is additionally accompanied by the reduction of Glut-2, GLP-1-R, and R-cadherin expression, and a concomitant activation of the glucagon receptor and the Id-1 and −2 genes. However, both Pdx-1 and Nkx 6.1 are still expressed in the Tu-6 line, indicating that some features of the β-cell phenotype are retained in this somatostatinoma culture. The fact that the Id factors are expressed in this material is interesting, in light of the HLH-protein-dependent hormone gene activation, e.g of the insulin gene. A possible role of these factors could be to evoke tissue-specific functions of the (in the islet) homogeneously expressed complex IEF-1 (36Ohlsson H. Thor S. Edlund T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 37Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), consisting of the Pan1/2 and NeuroD factors. That is, these factors may act to negatively regulate the IEF-1 complex through binding to the individual components of IEF-1, inactivating these in non-DNA-binding heterodimeric complexes. In this respect, the low level insulin gene activation in Tu-6, despite presence of the known insulin gene transactivating proteins (Pdx-1, NeuroD, and the pan-factors) could be explained by the high level expression of the Id-1 and Id-2 genes (38Cordle S.R. Henderson E. Masuoka H. Weil P.A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1734-1738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Together, our results show that the maturation pathways of the MSL-G2 tumor cells closely resembles the hypothetical model of islet ontogeny (1Alpert S.

Development. 1995; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are precursors for all four islet cell types, and that α-cell maturation involves inactivation of the Pdx-1 gene. The Pdx-1/glucagon double-positive cells constituting the majority of the cells of the MSL-G2 culture may reflect an endocrine precursor phenotype as previously suggested (2Teitelman G. Alpert S. Polak J.M. Martinez A. Hanahan D. Development. 1993; 118: 1031-1039PubMed Google Scholar, 40Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Teitelman G. Development. 1995; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Glut-2-positive and hormone-negative cells in the developing pancreas have been proposed as pre-β-cells (39Pang K. Mukonoweshuro C. Wong G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9559-9563Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The fact that δ-cell-like maturation of the Tu-6 somatostatinoma culture occurred through the insulinoma phenotype is in accordance with the cell lineage model of islet ontogeny as δ-cell maturation was proposed to proceed through an insulin/somatostatin double-positive phenotype (1Alpert S. Hanahan D. Teitelman G. Cell. 1988; 53: 295-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). PP-cell maturation has earlier been suggested to proceed through insulin and somatostatin-expressing precursor cells with terminal differentiation occurring late in islet development (1Alpert S. Hanahan D. Teitelman G. Cell. 1988; 53: 295-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 40Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Teitelman G. Development. 1995; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is contrasted by our finding that, within the tumor system, only the AN glucagonoma expresses PP, suggesting that PP- and α-cell types could be linked more closely. Supporting this hypothesis are findings of a cell type co-expressing glucagon and PP in man (41Larsson L.-I. Hougaard D.M. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 759-765Google Scholar), and that a high fraction of the earliest PP-positive cells during rat pancreatic development are co-expressing glucagon. 2A. Øster, J. Jensen, P. Serup, O. D. Madsen, and L.-I. Larsson, manuscript in preparation. An important observation of this study is the selective co-activation of the homeodomain protein Nkx 6.1 with insulin in the IN insulinoma. This suggests a role for Nkx 6.1 in the specification of the normal β-cell, substantiated by our finding that Nkx 6.1 immunoreactivity within the islet is confined to the nuclei of pancreatic β-cells exclusively. Several otherwise β-cell restricted genes, such as Glut-2, IAPP, and Pdx-1 were found to be expressed in the MSL-G2 culture prior to insulin and GLP-1-R gene activation. It thus appears that differentiation of the β-cell can be divided into discrete steps, each requiring the action of appropriate key regulatory factors. Both Pdx-1 and Nkx 6.1 are likely mediators of these processes. However, although this study may suggest that Nkx 6.1 is playing a role late in β-cell development, its action is probably not limited to the specification of the β-cell phenotype, as developmental studies have shown that Nkx 6.1 protein is expressed in the majority of the endodermal pancreatic precursor cells (Pdx-1- and Glut-2-positive-cells), during early stages of pancreatic organogenesis, and at subsequent stages segregates to β-cells exclusively.2In addition to the MSL-G2-derived cells, we analyzed the commonly used rat insulinoma cell line, RIN-5AH, which is syngeneic to MSL cells. In many respects, the RIN-cells appear to represent much less differentiated β-cells when compared to the MSL-G2-derived IN tumor. This is most notably exemplified by the low insulin production, and lack of IAPP, Glut-2, Nkx 6.1, R-cadherin, and IGF-1 receptors. Additionally, RIN-5AH cells express the homeodomain proteins cdx-3 and lmx-1, which we do not find in islets. We believe that the prolonged in vitro culture of RIN-5AH cells combined with their fast growth rate are major determinants of these differences. From this comparison, we suggest that the MSL-G2-IN phenotype in many respects is superior to RIN-5AH cells when addressing aspects of β-cell biology by the use of transformed cells.In summary, we have, by the use of mRNA profiling, successfully predicted the β-cell-specific expression of Nkx 6.1. We also predict a number of other genes to be expressed in particular islet cell types. Whether these predictions are accurate is currently being investigated using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. INTRODUCTIONThe developmental maturation of precursor cells into more specialized phenotypes during ontogeny is characterized by highly specific changes in gene expression. Thus, a detailed picture of mRNA levels in developmentally related cells may provide insight into both mechanisms and pathways of differentiation. The four distinct cell types (α- β- δ-, and PP-cells) present in the pancreatic islet of Langerhans are thought to derive from common precursor cells through stages of transient phenotypes expressing multiple islet as well as gut and brain peptide hormones (1Alpert S. Hanahan D. Teitelman G. Cell. 1988; 53: 295-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 2Teitelman G. Alpert S. Polak J.M. Martinez A. Hanahan D. Development. 1993; 118: 1031-1039PubMed Google Scholar). Such multi-hormonal and presumably immature phenotypes are also hallmarks of pancreatic endocrine tumors (3Bordi C. Bussolati G.

We have previously shown that the endogenous neuropeptides, endothelin-3 (ET-3), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), modulate the proliferation of astrocytes through positively and negatively regulating the transcription of the immediate-early gene egr-1 which transactivates basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) by unknown mechanisms. In these studies, we determined the involvement of MAP kinase (Erk) activation by ET-3 in the transcription of egr-1, and the molecular determinants by which Egr-1 transactivates bFGF. Transfection of astrocytes with a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) expression vector increased the transcription of a cotransfected egr-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct 3-fold. This induction was totally abolished by a dominant negative MAPK mutant. A 3-fold induction of egr-CAT expression by ET-3 was significantly reduced by treatment with ANP, or a cotransfected dominant negative MAPK plasmid. Using mobility shift assays, we showed that ET-3 induced the expression of Egr-1 protein which bound specifically to several early growth-related protein (Egr-1) binding sites on the bFGF promoter, and that this effect was significantly reversed by treatment with ANP. We also found that the Sp1 transcriptional factor was bound at these same sites, but was not stimulated by ET-3. Deletion experiments indicated that only the site at −160 bp of the bFGF promoter was significant for bFGF transactivation by Egr-1. We conclude that the astrocyte mitogen, ET-3, stimulates egr-1 transcription through a MAP kinase (Erk) related mechanism, and that Egr-1 transactivates bFGF through a specific noncanonical, Egr-1 site on the promoter. ANP inhibits each of these steps, providing a pathway for its anti-proliferative action. The mechanisms controlling the proliferation of astrocytes are of great interest but are not well defined.

Astrocytes are known to play an important role in guiding the construction of the nervous system and controlling the chemical and ionic environment of nerve cells (7Gasser U.E. Hatten M.E.

In this regard, astrocyte proliferation induced by exogenous or endogenous growth factors is important. One potent mitogen for astrocytes is bFGF, which is produced in a variety of neural cells including astrocytes (9Emoto N. Gonzalez A-M. Walicke P.A. Wada E. Simmons D.M. Shimasaki S. Baird A. Growth Factors. 1989; 2: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 10Woodward W.R. Nishi R. Meshul C.K. Williams T.E. Coulombe M. Eckenstein F.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 121: 142-152Crossref Google Scholar), where it may serve as an autologous growth factor. Recently, we have shown that Egr-1 is one of the key proteins in the regulation of astrocyte proliferation (11Hu R-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It was determined that the endogenous mitogenic neuropeptide, ET-3, and the antigrowth ANP, can modulate the proliferation of astrocytes through positively and negatively regulating the production of Egr-1. We also showed that ET-3 and ANP modulate the transcription of bFGF by regulating the transcription of egr-1. Both these proteins were shown to be crucial for astrocyte proliferation. To further understand the series of events underlying the regulation of astrocyte growth, we designed experiments to test how Egr-1 contributes to transcriptional activation/inhibition of the bFGF promoter, as modulated by ET-3 and ANP. We were interested in determining whether Egr-1 regulates activation of the bFGF promoter through direct interaction with DNA and what are the proximal signals which lead to the positive or negative modulation of egr-1 expression by these neuropeptides. These issues are potentially important beyond our model because Egr-1 is the first immediate early protein/transcriptional factor identified to activate bFGF transcription (11Hu R-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning the bFGF promoter between the nucleotides +34 to +44 (oligo A, 5′-CAGTAGGGGGCGCGC-3′), −74 to −51 (oligo A1, 5′-GCCTCTCCCCCGCCCCCGACTGAG-3′), and −172 to −151 (oligo A2, 5′-GGGTTGGGCGGGGGTGACTTT-3′) were obtained from Bio-Synthesis, Inc., Lewisville, TX (see Fig. 1).

Biol. 1990; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and egr-CAT reporter plasmid containing the 1.2-kilobase pair segment of the 5′-upstream promoter region of the egr-1 gene (13Rupprecht H.D. Sukhatme V.P. Lacy J. Sterzel R.B. Coleman D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F351-F360PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. V. P. Sukhatme. The plasmid containing the full-length human bFGF promoter-CAT construct (pF2.0CAT) as well as deletion mutants of bFGF promoter-CAT constructs (pFdCAT16/8, pFdCAT22/2, and pFdCAT6N) (14Shibata F. Baird A. Florkiewicz R.Z. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Florkiewicz. The MAPK expression vector and the dominant negative MAPK mutant (Y185F) were kindly provided by Dr. M. Cobb (15Robbinson D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary astrocytes from 16-day gestational fetal rats were isolated, cultured, and characterized as previously reported (11Hu R-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of ET-3 and ANP for 2 h or 16-18 h. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (16Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar) with additional protease inhibitors, leupeptin and aprotinin (2 µg/ml; Sigma). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and extracts were aliquoted and stored at −80°C. The oligonucleotides (oligo A, A1, and A2) containing the consensus sequence of the Egr-1 binding element was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe was mixed with in vitro synthesized Egr-1 protein (Promega TNT reticulocyte lysate system) or nuclear extract protein in 20 ml of the binding solution (10 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 µg poly(dA-dT), and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. For gel mobility shift assays with antibodies, the antibodies (2 µl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were added to the reaction mixture subsequent to addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe and incubated at 4°C for 1 h. Transient transfection of astrocytes and COS-7 cells was performed using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the manufacturer's instructions. The Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% of antibiotic-antimycotic, was removed prior to transfection and cells were washed with plain medium without serum and antibiotic. Cultures were layered with liposome-DNA complexes, incubated for 5 h, and after that the complex was removed and replaced with 10% fetal bovine serum medium, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 24 h. In some experiments the cells were maintained in 0.4% serum containing medium for 24 h and then exposed to either ET-3 (100 nM), ANP (100 nM), or ET-3 + ANP for 16 h. The egr-CAT reporter was included in each transfection. In some experiments double or triple transfections were performed. These experiments used a MAPK containing plasmid or a dominant negative MAPK (Dom Neg MAPK) plasmid. Transfection with this plasmid has been shown to lead to the overproduction of kinase-deficient protein (15Robbinson D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MAPK, and Dom Neg MAPK plasmids are driven by the same CMV promoter; therefore as a control, pCMV5 vector was used. Comparable total plasmid DNA was present in all experiments. Transfected cultures were washed twice with isotonic buffer 24-48 h post-transfection and collected. Cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thaw (dry ice/ethanol) for 5 min each. Supernatants were collected after microcentrifuging for 5 min at 4°C and assayed for β-galactosidase or CAT activity. The conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol (DuPont NEN) into acetylated chloramphenicol was monitored as described previously (17Prins B.A. Hu R-M. Nazario B. Pedram A. Frank H.J.L. Weber Levin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11938-11944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To monitor transfection efficiency, a β-galactosidase expression plasmid pON249 (18Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Glembotski C.G. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20555-20562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was simultaneously transfected into the cells, and β-galactosidase was detected using a chemiluminescent reporter assay system (Tropix, Inc.). The CAT values were divided by the β-galactosidase values to normalize for differences in the transfection efficiencies. All transfection data is presented as the mean ± S.D. from three culture dishes per experimental condition. The data shown in some figures is from a single representative experiment; similar results were obtained in at least three experiments for each preparation of cells and plasmids. To evaluate the need for MAPK in the signaling pathway activating egr-1 expression in astrocytes, we performed a series of transfection experiments which utilized a MAPK expression vector (MAPK) and a dominant negative plasmid which abolished MAPK activity (Dom Neg MAPK). We found that expression of wild type MAPK activated egr-1 expression 3-fold (Fig. 1A). This induction was totally abrogated when the cells were cotransfected with a dominant negative MAPK mutant. Moreover the latter plasmid caused a 40% reduction of the basic activity of egr-CAT. We next addressed the role of MAPK-induced egr-1 expression in mediating ET-3 stimulation. We compared the level of egr-CAT expression in cells stimulated with ET-3 alone, and with cells treated with ET-3 + ANP or cells cotransfected with Dom Neg MAPK plasmid prior to ET-3 exposure. As shown in Fig. 1B, the 3-fold induction of egr-CAT expression by ET-3 was significantly reduced by treatment with ANP (50%) or when the Dom Neg MAPK plasmid was cotransfected (60%). Thus, we found that ET-3 requires MAPK activation to stimulate egr-1 expression in astrocytes. Several genes that are regulated by Egr-1 protein share the similar consensus promoter sequences 5′-CGCCCCCGC-3′ (19Cao X. Mahendran R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16949-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Christy B.A. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Examination of the proximal promoter region of the bFGF gene indicates that there are three imperfect but potential Egr-1 binding elements located at −160 bp (site A2) and −60 bp (site A1) upstream, and one at +40 bp (site A) downstream of the transcription start site, thus raising the possibility that bFGF gene expression may be modulated through the interaction of Egr-1 protein with the bFGF promoter (Fig. 2). Comparison of sequences of sites A2, A1, and A with the established consensus sequence for Egr-1 binding revealed that each site deviated by one or two nucleotides (underlined) from the Egr-1 consensus sequence: site A1, CCCCCCCGC; site A2, GCGGGGGG; and site A, GGGGGCG. Additionally, it is necessary to stress that all three sites contain two extensively overlapping transcription factor motifs, one for Egr-1 and another for the zinc finger protein, Sp1 (GGCGGG) (Fig. 2). This common site we termed the ZiPB (zinc finger protein binding) motif. Previously, overlapping binding sites for Egr-1 and Sp1 were observed in the promoters of adenosine deaminase, platelet-derived growth factor A-chain, colony-stimulating factor-1, thrombospondin I, and interleukin 2 genes (21Ackerman S.L.

Decker E.L. Zipfel P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22500-22506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In order to determine if Egr-1 binds to sites A1 or A2, EMSAs were employed. As shown in Fig. 3, in vitro translated Egr-1 protein bound efficiently to oligonucleotide probes containing either site A1 or A2 and one DNA-protein binding complex was formed (Fig. 3, lane 1 and 7). This binding was saturable because molar excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotides in the binding reaction mixture inhibited retardation complex formation (lanes 2-4 and lanes 8-11). Moreover, the protein-DNA complex could be supershifted by anti-Egr-1 antibody (lanes 6 and 12). Similar results were obtained when oligonucleotide A was used as a probe (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that Egr-1 protein binds to sites within the human bFGF promoter. As we showed previously, ET-3 significantly stimulates both Egr-1 and bFGF mRNA and protein production (11Hu R-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of Egr-1, we examined the mechanism by which ET-3 and ANP modulate bFGF gene expression. We determined whether the bFGF ZiPBs can interact with astrocytic nuclear factors, and whether this interaction could be influenced by ET-3 and/or ANP action. We performed gel mobility shift assays using nuclear protein extracts from astrocytes not treated and treated with ET-3 and ET-3 + ANP (100 nM). Both probe A1 (Fig. 4A) and A2 (Fig. 4B) formed two DNA-protein binding complexes with nuclear extract prepared from nonstimulated astrocytes (lane 1), and three bands when cells were treated with ET-3 (lane 4) and ET-3 + ANP (lane 7). However, the intensity of the lower, ET-3-induced band was decreased when the probe was incubated with the nuclear extract prepared from the cells treated with ET-3 + ANP (compare lower bands lane 4 and 7). Antiserum directed against Egr-1 specifically altered migration of only the lower complex formed by DNA and nuclear extract, prepared from astrocytes treated with ET-3 and ET-3 + ANP (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 5 and 8). This indicates that Egr-1 gives rise to these inducible protein complexes. One of the slower DNA-protein complexes was supershifted with antibody directed against Sp1 protein (Fig. 4, lanes 3, 6, and 9). Sp1 protein binding to the ZiPB sites was constitutive, equal levels being detected in unstimulated and stimulated cells (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1, 4, and 7). The same experiments were conducted using oligonucleotide A as a probe and the same results were obtained (data not shown). These results indicate that ET-3 can stimulate the expression of nuclear protein which binds preferentially to the Egr-1 binding sites A2, A1, and A on the bFGF promoter, and that this expression is partially reversed by treatment with ANP. Previously, we showed that ET-3 and ANP positively and negatively, respectively, modulate Egr-1 protein production (11Hu R-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the increased binding of the ET-3-treated nuclear extract to the bFGF promoter shown here reflects the stimulation of Egr-1 protein production, inhibited by ANP. The DNA binding specificity of all complexes was further tested in competition experiments by using commercial oligonucleotides representing consensus sequences for Egr-1 (egr), Sp1, and mutated Egr-1 (megr) (see “Materials and Methods”). The EMSA was performed using nuclear extract prepared from astrocytes stimulated by ET-3 and probe A2 (Fig. 5) (we have obtained similar results using an oligonucleotide A1 or A as probes; data not shown). We found that the DNA binding of protein was saturable because the excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotides in the binding reaction mixture blocked the formation of all DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 5, lane 2). Competition of the lower complex, induced by ET-3 and identified with Egr-1 specific oligonucleotides (lane 3), are in agreement with the supershift observed with Egr-1 specific antiserum (lane 6). Excess oligonucleotide containing a mutated Egr-1 consensus site did not abolish formation of this band (lane 4), showing specificity. These results confirm the observation that Egr-1 is a part of the lower DNA-protein complex formed on the bFGF promoter. Addition of Sp1-binding oligonucleotides to the binding mixture effected formation of the two upper complexes (Fig. 5, lane 5), and as it has been shown already (Fig. 4, lanes 3, 6, and 9) antibody against Sp1 supershifted one of the upper complexes. It seems that the second upper band could represent binding by a second form of Sp1 protein, or a different member of the Sp family, which is able to bind to the same binding site but is not recognized by the Sp1 antibody used in these experiments. Taken together, these results suggest that the ZiPB region of human bFGF promoter can bind at least two zinc finger proteins, Egr-1 and Sp1. Moreover, we found that ET-3 and ANP positively and negatively modulate the binding of Egr-1 protein to its target sequence on the bFGF promoter, but not that of Sp1. To determine whether and how Egr-1 is capable of regulating bFGF reporter activity, in vivo cotransfection experiments were conducted with several CAT reporters containing 5′ truncations of the bFGF promoter (Fig. 6A). Each construct was transiently transfected into astrocytes or COS-7 cells in the presence or absence of the Egr-1 expression vector pCMV5-Egr-1 and the activation of each reporter by Egr-1 was determined. As shown in Fig. 6B, an pF2.0CAT reporter gene construct (−1800 bp to +179 bp), containing a single AP1 site, five GC boxes, and three Egr-1 binding sites, was activated by expression of Egr-1, nearly 6-fold in COS-7, and 7-fold in glial cells. The basic activity of an pFdCAT16/8 deletion construct (−480 bp to +179 bp) containing the regulatory elements described above, but lacking sequences from −1800 bp to −480 bp was much more responsive to Egr-1 than pF2.0CAT, 12 and 14 times in COS-7 and glial cells, respectively. These results are consistent with a suggestion that the residues between −854 bp and −521 bp display negative regulatory function (14Shibata F. Baird A. Florkiewicz R.Z. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The reporter pFdCAT22/2 (−160 bp to +179 bp) which does not contain A2 binding sites (see Fig. 6A) showed a significant decrease of responsiveness to Egr-1, 3.5-fold in COS-7 cells and 6-fold in astrocytes. However, pFdCAT6N, lacking A1 sites, was stimulated by Egr-1 to a similar magnitude, 5.6 times in COS-7 cells and 8 times in glia, while the promoterless pBLCAT4 plasmid was completely unresponsive. We suggest that deletion of −160 bp to −21 bp removed both the negative regulatory elements upstream of the A2 site along with the positive regulating A2 site, yielding a net effect that was neutral. Collectively, these data indicate that ZiPB of the human bFGF promoter, containing the A2 binding site element (at −160 bp), is necessary for maximal responsiveness of the bFGF gene to Egr-1 protein. The regulation of egr-1 transcription is an important nuclear event in astrocyte proliferation, as modified by the neuropeptides, ET-3 and ANP (11Hu R-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In fact, egr-1 is strongly activated by several glial mitogens (26Arenander A.T. de Vellis T.J. Herschman H.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here we found that the ability of ET-3 to stimulate egr-1 transcription was dependent on MAP-kinase. Several laboratories, including our own, have reported that endothelin activates the MAP kinase cascade in astrocytes and other cells but the importance of this was not determined (27Cazaubon S. Parker P.J. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P-O. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Pouyssegur J. Dunn M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the recent report that vitamin D3 and phorbol ester activate egr-1 transcription through this serine/threonine kinase, in a setting where vitamin D3 is mitogenic (29Beno D.W. Brady L.M. Bissonnette M. Davis B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3642-3647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Since we found that ANP inhibits the ET-3 induced transcription of egr-1, this may have occurred through inhibiting MAP-kinase stimulation of egr-1. We recently showed that ANP inhibits ET-stimulated MAP kinase kinase (MEK) and MAPK making this mechanism likely (30Prins B. Weber M.J. Hu R.-M. Pedram A. Daniels M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14156-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is also known that ET can activate v-src (31Simonson M.S. Wang Y. Herman W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 77-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that this cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase can activate egr-1 in BALBc 3T3 cells (32Qureshi S.A. Cao X. Sukhatme V.P. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10802-10806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), providing a possible upstream mechanism, connecting the activation of ET transmembrane receptors to this astrocytic nuclear action. We speculate that ET-induced v-src activation leads to MAPK activation, via MEK; additional signaling events upstream of MEK but distal to v-src are under investigation. The egr-1 promoter contains five SREs (33Tsai-Morris C.H. Cao X.M. Sukhatme V.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8835-8846Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that transcriptional activation of this gene by extracellular signals is often mediated by SRE/Ets elements (32Qureshi S.A.

Some of the studies suggested that tissue-specific and stimulus-dependent utilization of promoter elements may be important for egr-1 induction (36DeFranco C. Damon D.H. Endoh M. Wagner J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 356-379Google Scholar, 37Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.J. Lehman E. Gasson J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 38Kharabanda S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). SRE/Ets binding sites on the egr-1 promoter are occupied by multiprotein complexes that are similar to the ternary complex described for the c-fos SREs (40Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that one of the Ets domain-containing proteins, Elk1 is a substrate for MAPK (41Gille H.G. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 42Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne S. Dalton S. Treisman R.

We recently found that ET-3 activation of egr-1 through the MAPK pathway in astrocytes is mediated by SRE elements. 2E. Biesiada, M. Razandi, and E. R. Levin, unpublished data. Regarding the regulation of the bFGF gene, the promoter does not contain CAAT or TATA box motifs (14Shibata F. Baird A. Florkiewicz R.Z. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is known that this promoter contains AP1 binding sites and five GC boxes but the functional relevance of these sites is unknown. It has been described that an increased level of bFGF mRNA synthesis in response to phorbol ester occurs in human astrocytoma cell lines (45Murphy P.R. Sato Y. Sato R. Friesen H.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the activation of bFGF-reporter constructs by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and forskolin occurs in adrenal medullary cells (46Stachowiak M.K. Moffet J. Joy A. Puchacz E. Florkiewicz R. Stachowiak E.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 203-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recently the bFGF promoter was reported to be regulated by the p53 protein at the transcriptional level (and its basal core promoter was found to be responsive to p53) (47Ueba T. Nosaka T. Takahashi J.A. Shibata F. Florkiewicz R.Z. Vogelstein B. Oda Y. Kikuchi H. Hatanaga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9009-9013Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Within the human bFGF promoter we have identified three zinc finger protein binding sites (ZiPB) at −160, −60, and +40 bp, containing overlapping binding motifs for Egr-1 and Sp1 proteins. These motifs could be involved in the ability of Egr-1 to transactivate bFGF. We found that deletion of the Egr-1 binding site at −160 bp (designated A2) resulted in a significant loss of the ability of Egr-1 protein to stimulate bFGF transcription (reduction by 3-fold). Further deletion of Egr-1 binding sites (both A2 and A1 in the FdCAT6N construct) resulted in no further reduction in activity, suggesting that the Egr-1 binding site at −60 bp (A1) is unimportant for bFGF transactivation by Egr-1. A further analysis of the sequences of the A1 site led us to discover another putative binding site for Egr-1 (5′ CTCCCCCGC 3′) overlapped with the first one, and an Sp1 binding site (marked by dashed line in Fig. 2). However, results obtained from gel mobility shift assays indicated that this site is not able to bind Egr-1 protein (data not shown). It is known that the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene product, WT-1, can bind to the same DNA sequences as Egr-1 (48Morris J.F. Madden S.L. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2339-2348PubMed Google Scholar) and displays opposite effects on the transcription of target genes containing Egr-1 binding sites (49Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 50Drummond S.L. Madden P. Rowher-Nutter G.I. Bell G.I. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1992; 257: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The binding affinities of these two proteins to the same sequence varies (51Nakagama H. Heinrich G. Pelletier J. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 52Hamilton T.B. Barilla K.C. Romaniuk P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but the classic WT-1 target motif has 20-30-fold higher affinity for WT-1. We observed that ZiPB sites located on A and A1 sites of the bFGF promoter display similarity of sequences to a DNA motif of higher affinity for the WT-1 protein (51Nakagama H. Heinrich G. Pelletier J. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A potential role of the WT-1 protein in the interactive regulation with Egr-1 of human bFGF might be important. For instance, bFGF transcripts are abundantly expressed in >90% of human gliomas (53Takahashi J.A. Mori H. Fukumoto M. Igarashi K. Jaye M. Oda Y. Kikuchi H. Hatanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5710-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and in glioma cells, ANP cannot inhibit and ET cannot stimulate the basal high expression of egr-1 (11Hu R-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This is perhaps due to a loss of competitive regulation between WT-1 and Egr-1, as has been reported in Wilms' tumor cells (49Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Further work is needed to define this possible interaction. We found that the results of the gel mobility shift assays supported the functional reporter studies but raised additional issues. The two zinc finger proteins Egr-1 and Sp1 were shown to bind to the oligonucleotide representing bFGF promoter sequences. In unstimulated and stimulated astrocytes, the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 (54Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tijan R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar) binds to these regions, while in activated cells, the induced Egr-1 protein binds these elements. ET-3 significantly increased binding of Egr-1 protein to all of the sites on the bFGF promoter, identified both by competition with an Egr-1 binding oligonucleotide, and by supershifting with antibody to this protein. ANP significantly inhibited the increased Egr-1 binding. This was likely to have resulted, at least in part, from the increase and decrease, respectively, of the production of the Egr-1 protein, as modulated by ET-3 and ANP, which we have previously shown (11Hu R-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, despite the changes in protein binding at the A, and A1 sites, there were no functional effects. We are unable at this time to discriminate functionally between the effect of Egr-1 and a possible action of Sp1 on bFGF expression. However, Egr-1 does not bind to Sp1 consensus sequences, and Sp1 does not bind to Egr-1 consensus sequence (19Cao X. Mahendran R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol.

Our results are partially compatible with this model. The events that underlie cell proliferation are usually initiated when transmembrane receptors are ligated, enacting a cytosolic-relayed signal to the growth program in the nucleus. Thus, the stimulation of egr-1 by ET-3 depends on MAPK, providing the important cytoplasmic-nuclear link involved in ET-3-induced astrocyte proliferation. The inhibition of this same sequence is important for the antiproliferative action of ANP. Transcription of bFGF is positively regulated, mainly through the Egr-1 protein's action at a noncanonical Egr-1 binding site. The elucidation of how bFGF commits the astrocyte to a cell division pathway, perhaps in conjunction with egr-1 and MAPK, will provide a model to understand the precise events which govern positive and negative growth."

Binding specificity was determined using displacement of 1-O-[3H](3-[4-benzoyldihydrocinnamidyl]propyl)-InsP4 photoaffinity labeling. Centaurin-α displayed highest affinity for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3) (IC50 = 120 nM), whereas InsP4, PtdInsP2, and InsP3 bound with 5-, 12-, and >50-fold lower affinity, respectively. Screening a rat brain cDNA library with a polymerase chain reaction product, generated using partial amino acid sequence from tryptic peptides, yielded a full-length clone. The 2,450-base pair cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a novel protein of 419 amino acids. Northern analysis revealed a 2.5-kilobase transcript that is highly expressed in brain. The deduced sequence contains a novel putative zinc finger motif, 10 ankyrin-like repeats, and shows homology to recently identified yeast and mammalian Arf GTPase-activating proteins.

An ethyl acetate solution of 2.76 mCi (80 nmol) of this reagent was evaporated to dryness under N2 and dissolved in 200 µl of N,N-dimethylformamide. To this solution, 100 µl of 0.25 M triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer was added, followed by the addition of 100 µl of a 0.56 mg/ml solution of aminopropyl-InsP4 (0.81 µmol) in 0.25 M TEAB buffer. The reaction was kept in the dark and stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was then concentrated in vacuo; the residue was dissolved in 500 µl of deionized water and applied to a Pasteur pipette (4 × 0.5 cm) column of DEAE-cellulose (HCO3− form). The column was washed with 1 ml of deionized or distilled water and eluted sequentially with the following: 1 ml of 0.1 M TEAB, 1 ml of 0.2 M TEAB, 1 ml of 0.3 M TEAB, 1 ml of 0.35 M TEAB, 1 ml of 0.4 M TEAB, 1 ml of 0.4 M TEAB, 1 ml of 0.5 M TEAB, and 1 ml of 0.6 M TEAB.

For further purification by InsP4 affinity chromatography, the concentrated heparin-agarose eluates were diluted with 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA (ACB) and loaded onto an InsP4 affinity column (44Theibert A.B. Estevez V.A. Ferris C.D. Danoff S.K. Barrow R.K. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3165-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) adapted to an FPLC (Pharmacia, column dimensions, 10 × 3 cm) at a rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 ml of 200 mM NaCl in ACB and eluted with a gradient of 0.2 M to 1.5 M NaCl at 0.2 ml/min. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and assessed for protein or [3H]BZDC-InsP4 photoaffinity labeling. InsP4 column fractions from the soluble fraction of 100 whole rat brains were concentrated for tryptic digestion and peptide sequencing. Concentrated heparin-agarose column eluate (5-30 µl) was incubated with 40-60 µl of 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM potassium phosphate, 0.5 mM potassium pyrophosphate, and 20-70 nM [3H]BZDC-InsP4. To determine the affinity and specificity of photolabeled centaurin-α, 10 nM to 3 µM concentrations of the indicated inositol phosphate or phospholipid were included with the [3H]BZDC-InsP4. Samples were equilibrated for 10 min at 0°C before exposure to UV light (360 nm) for 1 h at 0°C. SDS sample buffer was then added to the samples and the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% Laemmli gels. Gels were fixed and fluorographed with the Entensify System (Amersham Corp.), dried, autoradiographed, and digitized. All of the photolabeling studies were performed in at least three independent experiments. Approximately 50 µg of concentrated centaurin-α purified by InsP4 affinity column chromatography was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie to localize the protein band with an apparent molecular size of 46 kDa, which was then excised and digested with trypsin. The resultant tryptic peptides were fractionated via reverse phase HPLC with a linear gradient of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (90 min). Individual tryptic peptides were then subjected to automated Edman degradation on a Procise 492 protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, ABD division). The nine unique peptide sequences that were obtained were compared with sequences in the GenBank data base using the TFASTA and BLAST DNA analysis software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group. Rat brain template cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of rat brain poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed based on two tryptic peptides having 100% homology to putative peptide sequences at the ends of a human-expressed sequence tag (GenBank accession number T09325). The sequences of the primers synthesized (DNA International) were as follows: 5′-TT(T/C)CA(T/C)TA(T/C)(T/C)TICA(A/G)GTIGCITT(T/C)CC-3′ (26-mer, 64-fold degeneracy) and 5′-C(C/T)TGIGGIAGCATIGG(C/T)CT(G/A)TCIAC-3′ (25-mer, 8-fold degeneracy). Using these primers in PCR on the rat brain template cDNA, we were able to obtain a product corresponding to a predicted size of approximately 400 bp. The PCR product was subsequently cloned using the TA cloning system (Invitrogen). A total of 1.6 × 106 independent recombinants of a λZap II postnatal day 7 rat brain cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. Craig Garner, University of Alabama at Birmingham) were screened with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 400-bp PCR product as a probe (Promega Prime-a-Gene System). Twenty-five strongly positive plaques were picked and excised with the Stratagene Solr System. The clone containing the longest insert of 2,450 bp was sequenced and called centaurin-α. Using a nested deletion based strategy, both strands of the centaurin-α clone were sequenced as double-stranded plasmids with M13 forward and reverse primers by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using deoxyadenosine 5′-[α-35S]thiotriphosphate and Sequenase 7.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The multiple tissue Northern blot containing poly(A)+ RNA from the indicated rat tissues was obtained from Clontech. According to the company's catalog, “Multiple tissue Northern blots are premade Northern blots of quality poly(A)+ RNA from different (rat) tissues. The poly(A)+ RNA is purified by several passages through oligo(dT)-cellulose columns, then run on a denaturing formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose gel, and blotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane. The lanes of the blots each contain approximately 2 µg of pure poly(A)+ RNA from specific tissues. The RNA loaded in each lane is adjusted so that a visible β-actin signal is present in every lane.” Prehybridization was performed at 42°C in 6 × SSPE (1.08 M NaCl, 60 mM sodium phosphate, 6 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 100 µg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% SDS for 4 h. An [α-32P]dCTP-labeled AvaI/BamHI fragment (4.5 × 109 cpm/µg, 1,240 bp) from the 3′ end of centaurin-α was hybridized to the membrane for 24 h at 42°C (protocol recommended by Clontech). The membrane was washed four times in 1 liter of 2 × SSC (0.9 M NaCl, 99 mM sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 50°C, followed by two 15-min washes in 1 liter of 1 × SSC, of 0.5 × SSC, and of distilled deionized water at 50°C. Autoradiography was performed at −80°C with Kodak X-Omat-AR film with intensifying screens for 24 h. A COOH-terminal fusion protein construct (containing ankyrin repeats 7-10) was made by digesting the 2.5-kb pair centaurin-α cDNA with BglII and KpnI to generate a 1.6-kb pair fragment that was cloned into the Pinpoint Xa2 expression vector (Promega). The expression of recombinant centaurin-α in the bacterial strain DH5α was induced by inositol-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The COOH-terminal fusion protein was extracted with 8 M urea from insoluble bacterial pellets. The extract was clarified by centrifugation. Then, the supernatant was dialyzed to remove the urea. The COOH-terminal fusion protein was then purified using the Soft-link avidin resin (Promega). Approximately 1 mg of purified fusion protein was obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture. A peptide containing the NH2-terminal amino acids 2-19 of centaurin-α was synthesized and conjugated to PPDT (purified protein derivative of tuberculin). The bacterially expressed COOH-terminal Pinpoint centaurin-α fusion protein and the PPDT-conjugated NH2-terminal peptide were injected into rabbits following a standard booster immunization protocol. The NH2-terminal antipeptide antiserum was designated J49 and the COOH-terminal fusion protein antiserum, J4. COS-7 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The EagI/SphI fragment of the centaurin-α cDNA was subcloned into the p63d2 vector downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter (22Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) to give the centaurin-α vector named p63d.2.13. Transient transfections of COS-7 cells (plated at 50-80% confluence) were performed using 10-20 µg of recombinant centaurin-α DNA and 50 µl of lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.)/10-cm dish, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following transfection, the cells were cultured for an additional 48-60 h. The expressed recombinant centaurin-α protein was isolated and partially purified by heparin-agarose and InsP4 affinity column chromatography under the same conditions as for the native rat brain centaurin-α protein. Approximately 20 µg of purified recombinant centaurin-α protein was obtained from one 10-cm dish of cells. Fractions from rat brain homogenate and cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Protean nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed with either the rabbit polyclonal NH2-terminal J49 antipeptide or the J4 antiserum at 1:500 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were detected using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Previously, we have used an InsP4 affinity column to isolate specific, high affinity InsPn-binding proteins from the particulate fraction of rat cerebella (44Theibert A.B. Estevez V.A. Ferris C.D.

This strategy led to the identification of one high affinity InsPn-binding protein, the clathrin-associated protein AP-2 (7Voglmaier S.M. Keen J.H. Murphy J.E. Ferris C.D. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Theibert A.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition to the proteins characterized for [3H]InsP4 binding and photolabeling, we noted the presence of a 46-kDa protein (47Theibert A.B. Estevez V.A. Mourey R.J. Marecek J.F. Barrow R.K. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9071-9079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We predicted that this 46-kDa protein would have the highest affinity for InsP4, since the other InsPn-binding proteins eluted from the resin in rank order of their affinity for InsP4, and the 46-kDa protein eluted from the column last. However, under the conditions used for reversible [3H]InsP4 binding and photoaffinity labeling with an radioiodinated arylazido probe, [125I]ASA-InsP4 (43Estevez V.A. Prestwich G.D. J. Am. Chem.

The enzyme exhibited a reversible decrease in Vmax after incubation, compared with control enzyme incubated at higher oxygen concentrations. This change was accompanied by a small increase in the apparent Km of the enzyme for both cytochrome c and oxygen, although the optical absorption spectra of oxidized, cycling, or reduced enzyme were not affected. Spectroscopy studies after 4 h of incubation revealed that heme a3 was 33% reduced during cycling at [O2] = 25 µM whereas enzyme at [O2] = 135 µM was only 18% reduced, suggesting that the site of inhibition occurred at the electron transfer step between heme a3 and O2. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observation that intact cells or mitochondria exhibit a reversible inhibition of respiration during prolonged exposure to [O2] <25 mM, by demonstrating that the catalytic activity of cytochrome c oxidase function is similarly inhibited, possibly through an allosteric effect of molecular O2 on the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2043002903,"Prenyltransferases catalyze the consecutive condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with allylic diphosphates to produce prenyl diphosphates whose chain lengths are absolutely determined by each enzyme. To investigate the mechanism of the consecutive reaction and the determination of the ultimate chain length, a random mutational approach was planned. A geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase gene from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius was randomly mutagenized by NaNO2 treatment to construct a library of mutated geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase genes on a yeast expression vector. The library was screened for suppression of a pet phenotype of yeast C296-LH3, which is deficient in hexaprenyl-diphosphate synthase. Five mutants that could grow on a YEPG plate, which contained only glycerol as an energy source instead of glucose, were selected from approximately 1,400 mutants. All selected mutated enzymes catalyzed the formation of polyprenyl diphosphates with prenyl chains longer than geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Especially mutants 1, 3, and 5 showed the strongest elongation activity to produce large amounts of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate with a concomitant amount of hexaprenyl diphosphate. Sequence analysis revealed that each mutant contained a few amino acid substitutions and that the mutation of Phe-77, which is located on the fifth amino acid upstream from the first aspartate-rich consensus motif, is the most effective for elongating the ultimate product. Amino acid alignment of known prenyltransferases around this position and our previous observations on farnesyl-diphosphate synthase (Ohnuma, S.-i., Nakazawa, T., Hemmi, H., Hallberg, A.-M., Koyama, T., Ogura, K., and Nishino, T.(1996) J.

INTRODUCTIONThe basic repeating subunit of chromatin, the nucleosome core, contains a histone octamer, formed by two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, wrapped by 146 base pairs of DNA. The linker histone H1 (as well as H5 in nucleate erythrocytes) interacts with 20 additional base pairs of DNA (for review, see Ref. 1Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). The path of DNA around the histone octamer has been described (2Richmond T.J. Finch J.T. Rushton B. Rhodes D. Klug A. Nature. 1984; 311: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 3Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), but the information on the architecture of the histones in the nucleosome mainly depends on the data obtained from crystals of histone octamers (3Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 4Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.W. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The structures of core histones within the nucleosome and free in solution are similar in that the N-terminal third of the molecules does not possess any regular structure, whereas the remaining two-thirds adopt a compact structure. The C-terminal tract of H2A may be an exception in that it seems to expand radially from a central position within the core to the DNA surface at the dyad axis (3Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The flexibility of the N-terminal tails makes it difficult to know in detail their paths in the nucleosome, and yet the issue is an interesting one, for these tails contain the biologically acetylatable lysyl residues (see Ref. 5Loidl P. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1994; 103: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar for a recent review on histone acetylation).The introduction of reporter groups (for instance, fluorescent probes) into proteins has often be a valuable experimental approach to study structural details either in the proteins themselves or in supramolecular complexes involving these proteins. However, the use of fluorescent probes in histones and nucleosomes has been very limited to date because of the difficulty in obtaining specifically modified histones. One remarkable exception is the covalent modification of cysteines by 5-[(iodoacetamido)ethyl]aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, but its use is obviously limited to cysteine-containing histones, i.e. H3 of most organisms (reviewed in Ref. 6Dabán J.-R. Cantor C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 192-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and H4 in some cases (7Lindsey G.J. Thompson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Of course, the specific modification of a residue more abundant in core histones might overcome that difficulty.Enzymatically directed chemical modification of proteins is arousing considerable interest, and for instance, the reaction catalyzed by transglutaminase (TGase) 1The abbreviations used are: TGasetransglutaminaseDNCmonodansylcadaverineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidAUTacetic acid/urea/Triton X-100dansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. has been used to introduce fluorescent probes into proteins or peptides. The fluorescent derivatives have proved to be useful and sensitive tools to study the interactions between the peptides or proteins and their physiological counterparts in complex systems (see, for instance, Ref. 8Ferrándiz C. Pérez-Payá E. Braco L. Abad C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).TGases catalyze an acyl transfer reaction in which the γ-carboxamide group of a glutamine residue in a protein acts as acyl donor. The ε-amino group of lysine residues as well as some polyamines are the physiological amine donors, but some nonphysiological amines can also be used by the enzyme (9Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The reasons for the specificity of protein lysyl or glutaminyl substrates are not known. It seems clear that both the sequence around a particular glutamine residue and the conformation of its neighborhood play a definite role in determining its capacity as substrate (10Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the nature of the amino acid preceding the lysyl substrates is also crucial (12Grootjans J.J. Groenen P.J.T.A. De Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22855-22858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TGases are involved in a variety of roles, including blood clotting and coagulation of other body fluids, stabilization of intra- and extracellular matrices, formation of the cornified envelope and other related changes in the epidermis, and cross-linking of cell envelopes in apoptosis (10Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar).In this paper, we report that core histones are remarkably good glutaminyl substrates for tissue TGase. They incorporate DNC faster than many physiological TGase substrates, although, to date, no role for the TGase reaction has been described in histones. We have determined the glutamine residues that act as acyl donors in each of the four individual histones. This basal reactivity changes when histones are incorporated in nucleosomes, and so our results open up a number of possibilities to address structural issues in nucleosomes. Some of the fluorescent histones obtained may represent useful tools to study the histone anatomy in the core particle as well as some of the conformational changes undergone by the nucleosome.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we show that 9 out of the 18 glutamine residues present in free core histones are glutaminyl substrates for TGase in vitro, and we have identified these nine residues. The basis for glutamine specificity in the TGase-catalyzed reaction remains obscure, and in spite of the effort carried out by several authors, it has not been possible to derive a consensus sequence for the glutaminyl substrates (11Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Coussons P.J. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Johnson C.M. Smith B. Sawyer L. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data show no clear dominance of any kind of amino acids in the environment of the modified glutamines when compared with the unmodified ones (Table II). In close agreement with previous observations made by other workers (10Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Coussons P.J. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Johnson C.M. Smith B. Sawyer L. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it can be concluded that the lack of a consensus sequence may reflect an important dependence on the conformation of the glutamine environment.Our data also support the idea that the conformational determinants are essential for a glutamine residue to be modified because of the temperature-dependent modification of Gln112 of H2A. Obviously, apart from sequence motifs, the final reason that determines whether Gln112 is modified or not must be a structural one. The structure of histones in solution changes in going from 4 to 37°C (28Michalski-Scrive C. Aubert J.P. Couppez M. Biserte G. Loucheux-Lefebvre M.H. Biochimie (Paris). 1982; 64: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the modification of Gln112 therefore depends on the temperature-related exposure of the residue.Of the 18 glutamines of core histones (Table II), five are placed in the N-terminal tails. Three of these, namely Gln24 of H2A and Gln5 and Gln19 of H3, are TGase substrates in free histones, whereas Gln6 of H2A and Gln22 of H2B are not. By studying a number of proteins whose glutamines are known either to act or not to act as TGase substrates, Coussons et al. (29Coussons P.J. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Smith B. Sawyer L. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 929-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) derived some rules to identify “discouraging” sequence features for the TGase reaction. For substrates with little ordered structure, they claimed that the positively charged amino acids within the five positions next to the C-terminal side of a glutamine residue are a discouraging feature, whereas glycine, valine, and leucine frequently occur on the C-terminal side of the modified glutamines. These rules do not fully apply to the N-terminal tails of the histones. The best glutamine substrate in the histones, namely Gln5 of H3, possesses two positively charged residues in positions +3 and +4 relative to glutamine, and the other two glutamines modified in the N-terminal tails, Gln24 of H2A and Gln19 of H3, have a positively charged residue in positions +5 and +4, respectively. Gln6 of H2A, which is not appreciably modified, possesses two glycines next on the C-terminal side. On the other hand, Gln22 of H2B contains lysine residues in positions +1, +2, and +5. Positively charged residues in positions +1 and +2 do not occur in any case in the modified glutamines present in the N-terminal tails, and when the analysis includes all the modified glutamines, only Gln93 of H4, which is a poor substrate, possesses a single arginine in position +2. It is tempting to speculate that positive charges in positions +1 and +2, rather than in other positions, act as a discouraging feature for the TGase reaction, at least in unfolded protein regions. If this were the case, it would explain why Gln22 of H2B becomes a TGase substrate in nucleosomes. Actually, the charges of the lysines next to glutamine are surely neutralized by interaction with DNA, and in this way, an otherwise nonreactive glutamine residue becomes reactive.Two other glutamine residues in the N-terminal tails, namely Gln5 and Gln19 of H3, are modified in nucleosomes, but the rest of the glutamines modified in free histones are not labeled in nucleosomes at low ionic strength. Gln125 of H3 and Gln95 of H2B are in equivalent positions within helix III of the histone fold (30Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11170-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and Gln93 of H4 is also placed in helix III. The remaining glutamines unlabeled in the nucleosome are either in the N- or C-terminal unstructured regions of the histones in the core particle (3Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Anyway, our results show that the reactivity of some glutaminyl residues is lost in the nucleosome, due either to the proper folding of the histone molecules to form the octamer or to blocking by the proximity of other histones or DNA. Therefore, the TGase reaction is a useful probe to determine the accessibility of glutamine residues in the nucleosome. The possibility of using TGase to analyze protein structure and organization was foreseen by Folk (9Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), although he reported that the failure of many proteins to act as TGase substrates can lead to disappointing results. Fortunately enough, this is not the case with histones, and experiments to apply this methodology to the study of conformational changes in the nucleosome are being carried out in our laboratory.The experiments described in this paper also show that DNC-modified histones can be properly reconstituted into core particles (see Fig. 6). The yield of reconstitution is obviously higher with histones modified in the N-terminal tails, which do not participate in histone-histone interactions, but the differences in the reconstitution yield do not mean that the reconstituted particles are defective. Therefore, nucleosome reconstitution with DNC-modified histones represents another potential use of the TGase reaction because the fluorescent probe may be a useful tool for structural studies.It is somewhat surprising that histones are such good TGase substrates. First, it is widely accepted that only a minor fraction of proteins are glutaminyl substrates of TGase (10Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Early data show, for instance, that only 3 out of 300 proteins observed in lymphocytes incorporate polyamines by the TGase-catalyzed reaction (31Folk J.E. Park M.H. Chung S.I. Schrode J. Lester E.P. Cooper H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3695-3700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the number of reactive glutamines in a protein substrate is usually very limited. Takagi et al. (32Takagi J. Aoyama T. Ueki S. Ohba H. Saito Y. Lorand L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) have recently found that out of ~40 glutamine residues in the propolypeptide of bovine von Willebrand factor, only four are substrates of factor XIIIa. Moreover, most of the proteins that act as TGase glutaminyl substrates in vitro are also physiological substrates. A few proteins and natural peptides, for which no physiological function for the TGase-catalyzed reaction has been described, are glutaminyl substrates in vitro, but it cannot be excluded that a function might be eventually found. On the other hand, the modification of Gln95 of H2B (Fig. 2B) is faster than that of many known natural substrates of the enzyme. For instance, the incorporation of putrescine into the propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor is completed only after 6 h of incubation with factor XIIIa (33Usui T. Takagi J. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12311-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the type 2 plasminogen activator inhibitor reacts even more slowly in the presence of tissue TGase (34Jensen P.H. Lorand L. Ebbesen P. Gliemann J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As other histone glutamines are modified even faster than Gln95 of H2B, it is tempting to wonder whether histones actually are natural substrates of TGase.However speculative, there are several possibilities that the TGase-catalyzed histone modification plays a physiological role. For instance, TGases are involved in apoptosis, probably by cross-linking proteins to give apoptotic bodies (35Fesus L. Davies P.J.A. Piacentini M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 170-177PubMed Google Scholar). As chromatin is progressively condensed in perinuclear regions during apoptosis (see Ref. 36McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 142: 343-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar for a review), it may be that TGase-catalyzed histone cross-linking mediates this chromatin condensation. An increase in TGase activity during apoptosis has been detected only in the cytoplasm (35Fesus L. Davies P.J.A. Piacentini M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 170-177PubMed Google Scholar), but it has been suggested that, due to cell shrinkage and cytoskeletal alterations, cytosolic enzymes may act on the nuclear components (36McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 142: 343-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, the possibility exists that TGase is present in some nuclei. For instance, it has been recently shown that apoptotic and non-apoptotic nuclei from rat intestinal mucosa cells immunoreact with a TGase antiserum (37Luciano L. Gupta P.D. Groos S. Adamski J. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments carried out in our laboratory also seem to indicate that chromatin condensation involving cross-linking of histones occurs upon incubating isolated chicken erythrocyte nuclei with TGase. It is worth noting that the existence of a cross-link between a glutamine of H2B and a lysine of H4 has been recently found in the sperm of the starfish Asterina pectinifera (38Shimizu T. Hozumi K. Horiike S. Nunomura K. Ikegami S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), thus providing support to our idea that the TGase reaction may occur in histones in vivo. Finally, putrescine is readily linked to histones, and the covalent attachment of polyamines to histones might also be of physiological significance. Some polyamine-binding proteins, presumably via the TGase-catalyzed reaction, have been described (39Hand D. Perry M.J.M. Haynes L.W. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 11: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Del Ducca S. Beninati S. Serafini-Fracassini D. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and polyamines have been suggested to modulate chromatin structure and function (41Matthews H.R. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It may be also possible that this modulation takes place after covalent binding, a mechanism suggested to occur in the modulation of ornithine decarboxylase (42Russell D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 157: 115-120Google Scholar). Obviously, more in-depth research on these topics will be necessary to investigate the above possibilities. INTRODUCTIONThe basic repeating subunit of chromatin, the nucleosome core, contains a histone octamer, formed by two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, wrapped by 146 base pairs of DNA. The linker histone H1 (as well as H5 in nucleate erythrocytes) interacts with 20 additional base pairs of DNA (for review, see Ref. 1Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). The path of DNA around the histone octamer has been described (2Richmond T.J. Finch J.T. Rushton B. Rhodes D. Klug A. Nature. 1984; 311: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 3Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), but the information on the architecture of the histones in the nucleosome mainly depends on the data obtained from crystals of histone octamers (3Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 4Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.W. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The structures of core histones within the nucleosome and free in solution are similar in that the N-terminal third of the molecules does not possess any regular structure, whereas the remaining two-thirds adopt a compact structure. The C-terminal tract of H2A may be an exception in that it seems to expand radially from a central position within the core to the DNA surface at the dyad axis (3Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The flexibility of the N-terminal tails makes it difficult to know in detail their paths in the nucleosome, and yet the issue is an interesting one, for these tails contain the biologically acetylatable lysyl residues (see Ref. 5Loidl P. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1994; 103: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar for a recent review on histone acetylation).The introduction of reporter groups (for instance, fluorescent probes) into proteins has often be a valuable experimental approach to study structural details either in the proteins themselves or in supramolecular complexes involving these proteins. However, the use of fluorescent probes in histones and nucleosomes has been very limited to date because of the difficulty in obtaining specifically modified histones. One remarkable exception is the covalent modification of cysteines by 5-[(iodoacetamido)ethyl]aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, but its use is obviously limited to cysteine-containing histones, i.e. H3 of most organisms (reviewed in Ref. 6Dabán J.-R. Cantor C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 192-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and H4 in some cases (7Lindsey G.J. Thompson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Of course, the specific modification of a residue more abundant in core histones might overcome that difficulty.Enzymatically directed chemical modification of proteins is arousing considerable interest, and for instance, the reaction catalyzed by transglutaminase (TGase) 1The abbreviations used are: TGasetransglutaminaseDNCmonodansylcadaverineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidAUTacetic acid/urea/Triton X-100dansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. has been used to introduce fluorescent probes into proteins or peptides. The fluorescent derivatives have proved to be useful and sensitive tools to study the interactions between the peptides or proteins and their physiological counterparts in complex systems (see, for instance, Ref. 8Ferrándiz C. Pérez-Payá E. Braco L. Abad C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).TGases catalyze an acyl transfer reaction in which the γ-carboxamide group of a glutamine residue in a protein acts as acyl donor. The ε-amino group of lysine residues as well as some polyamines are the physiological amine donors, but some nonphysiological amines can also be used by the enzyme (9Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The reasons for the specificity of protein lysyl or glutaminyl substrates are not known. It seems clear that both the sequence around a particular glutamine residue and the conformation of its neighborhood play a definite role in determining its capacity as substrate (10Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the nature of the amino acid preceding the lysyl substrates is also crucial (12Grootjans J.J. Groenen P.J.T.A. De Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22855-22858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TGases are involved in a variety of roles, including blood clotting and coagulation of other body fluids, stabilization of intra- and extracellular matrices, formation of the cornified envelope and other related changes in the epidermis, and cross-linking of cell envelopes in apoptosis (10Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar).In this paper, we report that core histones are remarkably good glutaminyl substrates for tissue TGase. They incorporate DNC faster than many physiological TGase substrates, although, to date, no role for the TGase reaction has been described in histones. We have determined the glutamine residues that act as acyl donors in each of the four individual histones. This basal reactivity changes when histones are incorporated in nucleosomes, and so our results open up a number of possibilities to address structural issues in nucleosomes. Some of the fluorescent histones obtained may represent useful tools to study the histone anatomy in the core particle as well as some of the conformational changes undergone by the nucleosome.

Tetrahedral tungstate, WO2−4, is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme and is isosteric with the substrate and product of the catalyzed reaction. Planar nitrate, NO−3, is isosteric with the PO3 moiety of a phosphotransfer transition state. The crystal structures of the Yersinia PTPase with and without ligands, together with biochemical data, permit modeling of key steps along the reaction pathway. These energy-minimized models are consistent with a general acid-catalyzed, in-line displacement of the phosphate moiety to Cys403 on the enzyme, followed by attack by a nucleophilic water molecule to release orthophosphate. This nucleophilic water molecule is identified in the crystal structure of the nitrate complex. The active site structure of the PTPase is compared to alkaline phosphatase, which employs a similar phosphomonoester hydrolysis mechanism. Both enzymes must stabilize charges at the nucleophile, the PO3 moiety of the transition state, and the leaving group. Both an associative (bond formation preceding bond cleavage) and a dissociative (bond cleavage preceding bond formation) mechanism were modeled, but a dissociative-like mechanism is favored for steric and chemical reasons. Since nearly all of the 47 invariant or highly conserved residues of the PTPase domain are clustered at the active site, we suggest that the mechanism postulated for the Yersinia enzyme is applicable to all the PTPases.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of intracellular or membrane proteins is a fundamental cellular signal for regulating cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation (1Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The levels of phosphotyrosine in the cell are governed by the competing actions of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases, 1The abbreviations used are: PTPaseprotein tyrosine phosphatasePTPase-WO4the crystal structure of the Yersinia PTPase in complex with tungstatePTPase-NO3the crystal structure of the nitrate complexPTPase-SO4the crystal structure of the Cys403→ Ser mutant of the Yersinia PTPase in complex with sulfateWATNuca hypothetical nucleophilic water molecule used in modeling the reaction.

A variety of receptor-like and nonreceptor-like PTPases is found in all eukaryotic cells. Presumably, this molecular diversity provides specific PTPases for different signal transduction pathways that can occur simultaneously in the cell. Although few PTPases have been assigned specific roles in signaling pathways, much is known about PTPase biochemistry, largely from studies of a homologous enzyme identified in Yersinia (2Guan K. Dixon J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The Yersinia PTPase, encoded on a virulence plasmid, is required for pathogenicity in this bacterium (3Bliska J.B. Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The PTPase reaction proceeds in two steps. First, the phosphate is transferred from tyrosine (R) to a functional group on the enzyme (I) and then the phosphoenzyme intermediate is hydrolyzed (II) (4Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in a manner similar to the well studied alkaline phosphatase (5Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) (Reaction 1). Mutagenesis and biochemical studies have identified several invariant residues in the PTPase signature sequence, (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G, important for phosphotyrosine hydrolysis. The phosphate moiety is transferred to the thiol of Cys403 (4Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16389-16396Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Arg409 is critical for ligand binding and catalysis (8Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Of invariant residues outside of the signature sequence, Asp356 was identified as a putative general acid and Glu290 was identified as a putative general base on the basis of mutagenesis and pH rate profile experiments (9Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The PTPases, unlike alkaline phosphatase, are very substrate-specific, selecting phosphotyrosines over the other phosphorylated residues (1Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). In addition, the Km and kcat are greatly improved for the PTPases when using a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide as opposed to phosphotyrosine by itself (10Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our laboratory recently reported the x-ray crystal structure of the unliganded Yersinia PTPase to 2.5-Å resolution and the complex with tungstate, WO2−4, to 2.6-Å resolution (11Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We have also solved the structure of a Cys403→ Ser mutant complexed with sulfate, SO2−4 (12Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The PTPase is an α+β protein with an eight-stranded, mixed β-sheet. The central feature of the structure is a strand-loop-helix motif where the loop contains the PTPase signature sequence, including the Cys403 nucleophile. Oxyanions bind within this loop, which we have termed the phosphate binding or P-loop. Three of the anion oxygens are coordinated by main chain amides of the P-loop while the fourth, apical, anion oxygen (O-4) points away from the P-loop. Asp356, the putative general acid, is located on a movable loop, termed the WpD-loop (for the conserved Trp-Pro-Asp sequence). Upon binding of an oxyanion, the carboxyl group of Asp356 shifts 8 Å toward the active site and this apical oxygen (12Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To better understand the roles of the conserved residues and the specificity of this enzyme, we have refined the tungstate complex structure to a higher resolution, 2.4 Å. Tungstate, a tight competitive inhibitor (KD = 61 µM at pH 7.0; Ref. 8Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), is tetrahedral, like the phosphate moieties of the substrate (phosphotyrosine) and product (orthophosphate). One of the oxygens of the orthophosphate product is derived from a water molecule. Thus, in any crystal structure of the PTPase in complex with a tetrahedral oxyanion, one of the oxygens of the ligand will be analogous to the water-derived oxygen of the orthophosphate product. In the hopes of observing the nucleophilic water molecule prior to attack, crystals were grown in the presence of nitrate, NO−3, a trigonal planar oxyanion. Nitrate is also isosteric with the planar PO3 moiety expected in a phosphotransfer transition state. Energy-minimized models of reaction intermediates that are consistent with the known biochemistry were derived from these crystal structures. These models highlight residues that are likely to be of key importance in the hydrolysis. The models also place certain limits on the nature of the reaction mechanism. The catalytic domain (residues 163-468) of Yop51, a PTPase from Yersinia enterocolitica, was expressed and purified as described previously (13Zhang Z.-Y. Clemens J.C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A.

The crystals diffract to at least 2.0 Å, and 9875 reflections (89% completeness) between 7.0 and 2.4 Å were recorded from 4 crystals (Table I). Isomorphous crystals of the PTPase-NO3 complex (P212121, a = 56.7 Å, b = 49.7 Å, c = 99.5 Å; size 0.8 × 0.4 × 0.06 mm3) were grown by mixing equal volumes of PTPase solution (23 mg/ml) with precipitant (27% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500, 10% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, 220 mM sodium nitrate, and 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.2).

The PTPase-WO4 amplitudes (and those from a mercury derivative) were used to phase data from isomorphous crystals of the Yersinia PTPase Cys403→ Ser mutant containing bound sulfate, PTPase-SO4 (11Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). After much of the Cys403→ Ser structure had been traced, a tetrahedral tungstate ion was fit into a difference electron density map and the model (residues 186-468) was further refined with X-PLOR (16Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1987Google Scholar) against the PTPase-WO4 amplitude data. The first 23 residues of the polypeptide chain are not visible and are presumed disordered. Force field interactions between the tungstate and Cys403 were turned off to allow close approach of these two groups if necessary. An overall anisotropic B-factor was applied. One residue (Cys418) has been modeled with two alternate conformations. The PTPase-WO4 structure currently has a crystallographic R-factor of 17.9% for all non-zero reflections between 7 and 2.4 Å (Table I). One hundred forty-three crystallographically observed water molecules and a sulfate molecule have been added by inspection of 2Fobs− Fcalc and Fobs− Fcalc electron density maps. PTPase-NO3 was phased on the protein atoms from the PTPase-WO4 structure. The final structure, including one nitrate and 105 water molecules, was refined to a final R-factor of 18.1% for all non-zero data from 7 to 2.4 Å. Atomic Coordinates for PTPase-WO4 and PTPase-NO3 have been submitted to the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (17Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O.

The phosphohexapeptide Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-Tyr(P)-Leu (10Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) was modeled initially in an extended conformation. The phosphate moiety, assumed deprotonated based on the pH profile for kcat/Km (27Zhang Z.-Y. Malachowski W.P. Van Etten R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8140-8145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was modeled on top of the tungstate coordinates, and the tyrosine was positioned within a clear active site cavity. Grooves in the protein surface were graphically highlighted by an algorithm that subtracts the molecular volume of the enzyme from the convex hull of the enzyme. The substrate peptide was then manually docked into grooves near the active site, taking into account possible electrostatic interactions. A 25-Å sphere of water (about 1000 water molecules) centered around the phosphate moiety was added. The model, including explicit polar hydrogens and a unified atom model for non-polar hydrogens, was subjected to simulated annealing from 1000 K to 300 K and then energy minimized using X-PLOR (16Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1987Google Scholar). Only the ligand atoms, water molecules within 15 Å of the active site, Arg409, Cys403, Asp356, and all explicit hydrogens were allowed to move, although all atoms were included in the force field. Models for the phosphotransfer reactions and the phosphocysteine intermediate were generated similarly, constrained by the nucleophile-phosphorus distances given in Table III. Throughout, the active site nucleophile (Cys403) was assumed to be unprotonated (6Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The putative general acid, Asp356, was modeled as protonated for the second transition state, but at the first transition state the proton was placed on the leaving group.Table IIIModel restraint distancesStepO-P distanceP-S distanceO-S distanceÅÅÅMichaelis Complex1.643.755.39Midpoint of PhosphotransferDissociative2.472.945.41Associative1.642.133.77 Open table in a new tab Nitrate binds within the P-loop (Fig. 1) and effects the closed conformation of the Asp356-containing WpD-loop, as do tungstate (11Stuckey J.A.

Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The orientation of the oxyanion is the same in each oxyanion-bound crystal structure and results in up to 11 hydrogen bonds between the P-loop and the anion oxygens, along with hydrogen bonds to crystallographically observed active site water molecules (Table IV). Three anion oxygens are coordinated by five of the seven amide nitrogens from the P-loop and also by the side chain of Arg409. Arg409 is in turn coordinated in a bidentate salt-bridge with Glu290, the putative general base (9Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The apical anion oxygen, O-4, in the PTPase-SO4 and PTPase-WO4 complexes points away from the nucleophilic cysteine and the P-loop, and, in PTPase-WO4, is coordinated by an invariant glutamine residue, Gln446.Table IV.Hydrogen bonds to the oxyanion in three PTPase crystal structuresAnion oxygenHydrogen bond donorPTPase-NO3PTPase-WO4PTPase-SO4aPTPase-SO4 is Protein Data Bank entry 1YTS (12).

Open table in a new tab The anion in PTPase-SO4 is 0.6 Å deeper in the active site than in PTPase-WO4, primarily because the Ser403 hydroxyl in PTPase-SO4 is smaller than the Cys403 thiolate in PTPase-WO4. This permits Asp356 to shift farther into the active site in the PTPase-SO4 crystal structure. Asp356 in PTPase-NO3 occupies a position intermediate to those seen in PTPase-WO4 and PTPase-SO4. Although five of the seven amide hydrogens are directed toward the bound anion, the two remaining P-loop amides point to the nucleophilic Cys403 (Table V). The amide nitrogens of Gly406 and Thr410 and the conserved side chain hydroxyl of Thr410 make hydrogen bonds with the nucleophile.

WAT1 is observed in all three anion complexes and has an average crystallographic temperature factor of 16 Å2. WAT1 is buried under the ligand and is well coordinated with four tetrahedrally positioned hydrogen bonds. In PTPase-NO3, Asp356 approaches within 3.1 Å of WAT1. A second, poorly ordered water molecule, WAT2, sits above the oxyanion in the active site. In PTPase-SO4, WAT2 is 3.0 Å from Gln446; however, in the other two structures WAT2 makes good hydrogen bonds only with other water molecules.Table VI.Hydrogen bonds involving active site water moleculesWater moleculeHydrogen bond partnerPTPase-NO3PTPase-WO4PTPase-SO4 (Cys403→ Ser)DistanceaAssumes that each water molecule accepts hydrogen bonds from nitrogens and donates to oxygens.AngleDistanceAngleDistanceAngleÅ°Å°Å°WAT1Gln446 Oε12.62.63.2Gln357 N3.11362.81373.0146Gln450 Nε23.21453.21643.3155Asp356 Oδ23.13.5Anion O-12.62.62.7Anion O-4NAbNA, not applicable.3.43.0WAT2Gln446 Nε23.81433.71123.0148Anion O-4NA4.04.2WAT3cWAT3 is only observed in PTPase-NO3, and occupies a position close to that observed for O-4 of the tetrahedral oxyanions.WAT23.0Gln446 Oε12.7Gln357 Nε22.9108Gln446 Nε23.0126Gln446 Oδ23.3a Assumes that each water molecule accepts hydrogen bonds from nitrogens and donates to oxygens.b NA, not applicable.c WAT3 is only observed in PTPase-NO3, and occupies a position close to that observed for O-4 of the tetrahedral oxyanions. Open table in a new tab A unique active site water molecule is present in PTPase-NO3 (Fig. 1). Nitrate lacks the apical oxygen present in tungstate and sulfate. Instead, in PTPase-NO3 WAT3 sits 4.2 Å directly above the nitrate, perfectly in line with the sulfur of the nucleophile, Cys403 (O-N-S angle of 168°, O-S distance of 7.3 Å). WAT3 is well ordered (B = 17 Å2) and is coordinated principally by the side chains of Gln446 and the Gln357. Although Gln446 is invariant, Gln357 is found only in the Yersinia PTPase sequence. A second anion binding site, far from the active site, contains a sulfate in the PTPase-WO4 and PTPase-SO4 complex structures, coordinated by the side chains of Arg278 and Ser388 and the main chain nitrogen of Ser389 (none of these residues is highly conserved). PTPase-NO3, grown without sulfate, has a water molecule at this alternate oxyanion binding site. A phosphotyrosine-containing hexapeptide manually docked into the active site pocket and nearby grooves was subjected to energy minimization, as described above (Fig. 2). The position of the phosphotyrosine side chain is well defined by residues lining the active site. Specifically, the phosphotyrosine ring packs against the hydrophobic face of Phe229 (Fig. 3A). Ile232 and Ile443 also contribute to a hydrophobic binding site, while Gln446 and Gln357 define the other side of the phosphotyrosine pocket. This modeled peptide-Yersinia PTPase complex is consistent with the recently reported crystal structure of substrate bound to the human PTPase, PTP1B (Ref. 28Jia Z.C. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, and see “Discussion”). WAT1 is the only water molecule that can fit in the active site binding pocket with the substrate present. Asp356, modeled as protonated, moved to within hydrogen bonding distance (2.7 Å) of the ester oxygen during energy minimization.Fig. 3Energy-minimized atomic models of the PTPase reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2093253631,"MARCKS is a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate which binds calcium/calmodulin and actin, and which has been implicated in cell motility, phagocytosis, membrane traffic, and mitogenesis. MARCKS cycles on and off the membrane via a myristoyl electrostatic switch (McLaughlin, S., and Aderem, A. (1995) <i>Trends Biochem. Sci.</i> 20, 272-276). Here we define the molecular determinants of the myristoyl-electrostatic switch. Mutation of the N-terminal glycine results in a nonmyristoylated form of MARCKS which does not bind membranes and is poorly phosphorylated. This indicates that myristic acid targets MARCKS to the membrane, where it is efficiently phosphorylated by PKC. A chimeric protein in which the N terminus of MARCKS is replaced by a sequence, which is doubly palmitoylated, is phosphorylated by PKC but not released from the membrane. Thus two palmitic acid moieties confer sufficient membrane binding energy to render the second, electrostatic membrane binding site superfluous. Mutation of the PKC phosphorylation sites results in a mutant which does not translocate from the membrane to the cytosol. A mutant in which the intervening sequence between the myristoyl moiety and the basic effector domain is deleted, is not displaced from the membrane by PKC dependent phosphorylation, fulfilling a theoretical prediction of the model. In addition to the nonspecific membrane binding interactions conferred by the myristoyl-electrostatic switch, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates that specific protein-protein interactions also specify the intracellular localization of MARCKS."

The activity of the βγ dimers was compared in two assays: formation of the high affinity agonist binding conformation of the A1 adenosine receptor and receptor-catalyzed exchange of GDP for GTP on the α subunit.

In addition to the selectivity provided by the receptor itself, the interaction between the intracellular loops of the receptors and the αβγ subunits in the heterotrimer is a major determinant of specificity (6Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 7Wess J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 308-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some receptors couple selectively to certain G protein α subunits. For example, the β-adrenergic receptor couples primarily to members of the Gsα family (1Birnbaumer L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 675-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and rhodopsin to the Gtα subunit (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Other receptors, such as the angiotensin AT1 or muscarinic receptors couple to multiple α subunits including members of the Gq and Gi class of α subunits (6Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 8Bauer P.H. Chiu A.T. Garrison J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 579-585PubMed Google Scholar), leading to activation of multiple signaling networks by a given ligand (5Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar).Although the receptor and the α subunit provide one determinant of selectivity, the βγ subunit is clearly required for the receptor to couple to the α subunit (9Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3477-3483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a third level of selectivity may be provided by the type of βγ subunit used to form the receptor-αβγ complex. In addition, since the βγ dimer can activate effectors directly (11Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 12Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 13Sternweis P.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the diversity of these proteins may contribute to the specificity of signaling. Two lines of experimental evidence support this conclusion. Using recombinant βγ subunits purified from Sf9 insect cells, some investigators have demonstrated differences in βγ activity using in vitro assays. For example, the β1γ1 dimer is less potent in activating the muscarinic K+ channel (14Wickman K.D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), type II adenyl cyclase (15Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ueda N. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) compared with the β1γ2 dimer. In contrast, the β1γ1 dimer is far more effective at coupling rhodopsin to the Gtα subunit than β1γ2 (17Kisselev O. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using an antisense RNA approach to study G protein-dependent regulation of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel in GH3 cells, Kleuss et al. (18Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1991; 353: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 19Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 20Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Science. 1993; 259: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) suggested that the Go1αβ3γ4 heterotrimer coupled preferentially to the muscarinic receptor and that the Go2αβ1γ3 combination coupled to the somatostatin receptor. Thus, the structural diversity of the γ subunit may be an important determinant of the selectivity of coupling of receptors to G proteins and of the βγ dimer to effectors.The 11 known γ subunits are modified by the addition of isoprenoid lipids to an invariant cysteine residue in a CaaX motif at their carboxyl terminus (21Casey P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1731-1740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These lipids have been assumed to be responsible for attaching proteins to membranes (22Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Speigel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Muntz K.H. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), but growing evidence suggests the prenyl groups may also play a major role in determining activity and interaction with other proteins (24Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 25Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For example, prenylation of the γ1 subunit is necessary for the formation of an active transducin αβγ complex (26Fukada Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 27Ohguro H. Fukada Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3669-3674Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), for ADP-ribosylation of α subunits by pertussis toxin (15Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for the stimulation of phospholipase C-β by the β1γ1 dimer (28Dietrich A. Meister M. Brazil D. Camps M. Gierschik P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies with synthetic peptides indicate that the carboxyl-terminal region of the γ subunit is an important domain for the interaction among the receptor, the α subunit, and the βγ dimer. For example, peptides made from the carboxyl terminus of the γ1 subunit are most effective at stabilizing the rhodopsin Gtα subunit interaction if they contain the farnesyl group (29Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); peptides with a geranyl or geranylgeranyl group have much lower potency in the stabilization assay (30Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that in addition to the primary amino acid sequence of the γ subunit, the prenyl group is important in establishing receptor-αβγ coupling. To examine this possibility, we have purified recombinant βγ dimers from Sf9 cells containing γ subunits with altered prenyl groups (31Lindorfer M.A. Sherman N.E. Woodfork K.A. Fletcher J.E. Hunt D.F. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18582-18587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and examined their activity in two assays of receptor coupling which are dependent on βγ activity. Membranes from Sf9 cells expressing recombinant A1 adenosine receptors were reconstituted with purified Giα subunits and various types of βγ dimers and assayed for the ability to establish the high affinity agonist binding conformation of the receptor and the ability of the receptor to activate the exchange of GDP for GTP on the α subunit. The data indicate that the A1 adenosine receptor markedly prefers γ subunits containing the geranylgeranyl group.RESULTSTo examine the ability of the various βγ dimers to support the establishment of the high affinity agonist binding conformation of a receptor, bovine A1 adenosine receptors were expressed in the membranes of Sf9 insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. Previous studies have shown this procedure to produce membranes containing high levels of receptors that are not coupled to G proteins and that the receptors can be effectively recoupled by reconstitution of the Gi or Goα subunits in the presence of the βγ dimer.2 The experiments shown in Fig. 1A were performed to establish the binding parameters for the membranes used in the experiments presented in this report using the Gi1α subunit. The membranes expressing the bovine receptor contained ~4 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein as measured using binding isotherms with the antagonist ligand [3H]cyclopentylxanthine. When measured using the agonist ligand 125I-ABA, recombinant bovine A1 adenosine receptors bound ligand with low affinity (Fig. 1A, −G protein). As expected, addition of increasing concentrations of purified recombinant Gi1α subunit and β1γ2 dimer to the Sf9 cell membrane expressing recombinant bovine A1 adenosine receptors resulted in the reestablishment of high affinity 125I-ABA binding (Fig. 1A, +G protein). Note that increasing the G protein concentration in the reconstitution mix from 3 to 40 nM produces a progressively larger fraction of adenosine receptors in the high affinity conformation. These curves demonstrate the very high affinity expected of the bovine receptor for the 125I-ABA ligand (33Tucker A.L. Linden J. Robeva A.S. D'Angelo D.D. Lynch K.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on the data in Fig. 1A, an 125I-ABA concentration of 0.3-0.5 nM and a G protein concentration of 6 nM were chosen for subsequent experiments as a reasonable compromise between the size of the response, the basal level of binding, and the amount of G protein and ligand used in each experiment.The ability of the reconstituted G protein α subunit to increase the high affinity state of the receptor absolutely requires the βγ dimer (9Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3477-3483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this assay is a sensitive measure of the ability of different βγ dimers to support the first step in the formation of the receptor-αβγ complex. The β1γ1 dimer has been found to be less potent than other βγ combinations in its ability to activate effectors (13Sternweis P.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Wickman K.D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E.

Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and to reestablish high affinity agonist binding.2 To examine the concentrations of βγ needed for the assay, we compared the ability of various concentrations of β1γ1 or β1γ2 dimers in combination with the Gi2α subunit to reconstitute high affinity 125I-ABA binding (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1A, increasing the amount of either βγ subunit increased the levels of 125I-ABA binding, but the β1γ1 subunit was less effective at all concentrations compared with the β1γ2 dimer. At 10 nMβγ, the Bmax values were about 880 fmol/mg of membrane protein for β1γ2 and 462 fmol/mg of protein for β1γ1. There was no apparent difference in EC50 value for the two βγ dimers (EC50 ~0.1 nM). Based on the data shown in Fig. 1B, concentrations of βγ dimers between 3 and 10 nM were used in most subsequent experiments.To characterize the role of the prenyl group of the γ subunits in establishing the high affinity agonist binding conformation of the receptor, we prepared γ1 and γ2 subunits with altered prenyl groups and examined their ability to support high affinity agonist binding. The mutant γ1-S74L has a geranylgeranyl lipid in place of the wild type γ1 farnesyl group, and the mutant γ2-L71S has a farnesyl group in place of the wild type γ2 geranylgeranyl group (31Lindorfer M.A. Sherman N.E. Woodfork K.A. Fletcher J.E. Hunt D.F. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18582-18587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The ability of these different βγs to induce high affinity binding of bovine A1 adenosine receptors using 3 nM Gi2α subunit and a 3 nM concentration of various βγ dimers is shown in Fig. 2A. The β1γ1-S74L mutant (which contains the geranylgeranyl group) produced an increment in binding about three times greater than the wild type β1γ1 (which contains the farnesyl group). The wild type β1γ2 dimer produced a 2-fold increase in high affinity binding. Interestingly, the β1γ2-L71S mutant containing the farnesyl group was much less active than wild type β1γ2 and was approximately equal to the wild type β1γ1 in generating the high affinity state of the receptor. The responses of all of the βγ dimers were statistically significant (see the legend of Fig. 2A). Experiments analogous to those shown in Fig. 2A were performed with the Gi1α subunit (Fig. 2B). The same order of effectiveness at establishing high affinity agonist binding was observed using the Gi1α subunit as with the Gi2α subunit, i.e. β1γ2 or β1γ1-S74L >β1γ2-L71S ≈β1γ1.To determine if the differences observed between the native and altered βγ dimers in Fig. 2 were due to differences in the potency or the efficacy of the proteins, we compared the concentration dependence of the wild type and mutant γ combinations for the ability to reestablish the high affinity 125I-ABA binding conformation of the receptor. Fig. 3A presents the high affinity binding of various concentrations of β1γ1 and its prenyl mutant β1γ1-S74L. Note that alteration of the γ1 prenyl group from farnesyl to geranylgeranyl leads to a significant increase in agonist binding at all concentrations of βγ dimer reconstituted into the membrane. The increase in binding is sensitive to GTPγS (open circles), suggesting that the increase in binding is due to receptors coupled to the αβγ heterotrimer. Fig. 3B shows an analogous experiment performed with the native β1γ2 dimer and the prenyl mutant β1γ2-L71S. Clearly, changing the prenyl group from geranylgeranyl to farnesyl results in a significant decrease in binding at the relatively low concentrations of βγ dimer tested. It is important to note that mass spectral analysis of the structure of the four γ subunits used in these experiments showed that the primary amino acid sequences are correct and that all γ proteins are fully modified with the expected prenyl group (31Lindorfer M.A. Sherman N.E. Woodfork K.A. Fletcher J.E. Hunt D.F. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18582-18587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the type of prenyl group on the γ subunit plays an important role in the reconstitution of the receptor-αβγ complex and the resulting formation of the high affinity agonist binding state of the receptor.As most of the response to the βγ dimers occurs over a narrow concentration range (1-10 nM), the differences in activity observed could be due to differences in the ability of the proteins to incorporate into the Sf9 cell membrane. Thus, it was important to demonstrate that γ subunits with different prenyl groups (farnesyl versus geranylgeranyl) reconstitute into the membrane equally. To this end, we labeled the four different recombinant βγ dimers with 125I and examined the ability of the proteins to partition between the buffer phase and the Sf9 cell membrane under the conditions used to measure high affinity agonist binding. As shown in Table I, all four of the βγ dimers tested reconstitute into the Sf9 cell membrane equally well. About 25% of the G protein βγ subunits added to the reconstitution mixture are incorporated into the membrane under these conditions. Thus, as judged by this experimental approach, the length of the prenyl chain does not significantly affect the concentration of the βγ dimer reconstituted into the Sf9 cell membrane.To determine if the Giα subunit used in the assay affected the results, the ability of wild type and altered γ subunits to reestablish high affinity agonist binding was investigated using three different recombinant Giα subunits. As shown in the left panels of Fig. 4 (A-C), the mutant β1γ1-S74L dimer was more effective than the native β1γ1 dimer regardless of the Giα subunit used in the assay. The increase in high affinity binding induced by the β1γ1-S74L dimer was about 1.5-2 times larger than that produced by the β1γ1 subunit. Similarly, the right panels of Fig. 4 (D-F) demonstrate that the altered β1γ2-L71S dimer was less effective than the native β1γ2 when paired with any of the three Giα subunits. Again, the increase in high affinity binding induced by the native β1γ2 subunit was about 1.5-1.8 times larger than the mutant β1γ2-L71S dimer.Fig. 4Comparison of the abilities of three recombinant Giα subunits and different concentrations of βγ dimers to reconstitute high affinity 125I-ABA binding in membranes from Sf9 cells expressing recombinant A1 adenosine receptors. Panels A-C, membranes were reconstituted with a 6 nM concentration of the indicated Giα subunit and the indicated concentration of the β1γ1 or β1γ1-S74L dimers and formation of the high affinity binding state measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each tube in the binding assay contained 20 fmol of receptor and 0.4 nM125I-ABA. The ratio of receptor to α to βγ was approximately 1:20:0-33. Panels D-F, membranes were reconstituted with a 6 nM concentration of the indicated Giα subunit and the indicated concentration of the β1γ2 or β1γ2-L71S dimers. Formation of the high affinity binding state was measured as described above, except 125I-ABA was 0.55 nM. The results are representative of three similar experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The data presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 demonstrate the importance of the γ subunit prenyl group in the formation of the high affinity agonist binding conformation of the receptor-αβγ complex. Using the bovine A1 adenosine receptor as a model receptor in the presence of two different γ sequences and three different Giα subunits, the geranylgeranyl group supports formation of larger amounts of the high affinity agonist binding conformation of the receptor (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and text). As the βγ dimer is also required for receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange (17Kisselev O. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Fawzi A.B. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12194-12200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of the γ subunits with altered prenyl groups on receptor-catalyzed exchange of GDP for GTP. A time course of [35S]GTPγS binding to the Sf9 cell membrane expressing the bovine A1 adenosine receptor in the presence and absence of 100 nM R-PIA is shown in Fig. 5. Note from Fig. 5A that when either the Gi2α subunit or the β1γ2 dimer was reconstituted into the membrane alone, the agonist produced a minimal change in GTPγS binding. This result is consistent with a low level of coupling of the expressed receptor to endogenous Sf9 cell G proteins (see Fig. 1). When both the Gi2α and the β1γ2 subunits were reconstituted into the membrane, the addition of 100 nM R-PIA catalyzed a rapid and linear exchange of [35S]GTPγS for GDP over the 4-min assay period (8-12 min). If longer time courses were examined, the response was sustained for an additional 30 min, although the rate slows after 10 min of stimulation (data not shown). The amount of receptor-stimulated GTPγS exchanged for GDP at the 12-min point in Fig. 5B represents GDP/GTP exchange on about 5% of the Gi2α subunit present in the reconstitution mixture. At longer times (30 min of stimulation) up to 10% of the nucleotide on the α subunit was exchanged. Based on these calculations, the assay is measuring exchange on a significant fraction of the α subunit reconstituted into the membrane. As expected from the data in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, both the α and the βγ subunits are required for receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange. Thus, this assay provides another sensitive test for differences in the function of the βγ dimer.Fig. 5Receptor-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange in Sf9 cell membranes expressing A1 adenosine receptors and reconstituted with recombinant G protein α and βγ subunits. Panel A, control experiments showing that neither the Gi2α-subunit alone nor the β1γ2 subunit alone is sufficient to catalyze [35S]GTPγS binding. Sf9 cell membranes (30 fmol of receptor/time point) were reconstituted with either 6 nM Gi2α subunit or 6 nMβ1γ2 subunit alone for 30 min at 0°C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction tube was brought to 25°C, and [35S]GTPγS was added to a concentration of 6 nM and incubated for 8 min before adding 100 nM R-PIA. Samples were taken for filtration through glass fiber filters at 30-s intervals after adding the agonist. Panel B, an analogous experiment in which both α and βγ subunits were reconstituted into the Sf9 cell membrane as described above. The results are representative of 10 similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To compare the activity of native γ subunits containing different prenyl groups in this assay, we examined the ability of the β1γ1 and β1γ2 dimers to support receptor-catalyzed GTP exchange using 6 nM Gi2α subunit (Fig. 6). In the presence of 6 nMβ1γ1 the rate of receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange increased only slightly (1.5-2-fold) above base line. In contrast, 6 nMβ1γ2 dimer supported a marked and linear increase in the rate of GDP/GTP exchange. We next examined the effect of the mutant γ subunits with altered prenyl groups on the rate of receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange by comparing the activity of the native β1γ1 dimer with that of the β1γ1-S74L mutant (Fig. 7A). Clearly, changing the prenyl group from farnesyl to geranylgeranyl on the γ1 subunit results in a significant increase in the rate of nucleotide exchange, from 65 fmol/min/mg of protein for the β1γ1 subunit (about a 2.3-fold increase over the basal rate of 22.6 fmol/min/mg of protein) to 139 fmol/min/mg of protein (about a 6.3-fold increase over basal) for the β1γ1-S74L dimer. Likewise, changing the prenyl group from geranylgeranyl to farnesyl on the γ2 subunit caused a significant decrease in the rate of nucleotide exchange, from 272 fmol/min/mg of protein (about 4.8-fold over the basal rate of 57 fmol/min/mg of protein) to 123 fmol/min/mg of protein (about 2.1-fold over the basal rate) for the β1γ1-L71S dimer (Fig. 7B). Based on these data, it appears that the bovine A1 adenosine receptor prefers the geranylgeranyl group on either γ subunit to catalyze a rapid rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on the Giα subunit. This result is consistent with the effects of exchanging the γ subunit prenyl groups observed for high affinity agonist binding in Figs. 2, 3, 4 given the kinetic differences between these two assays.Fig. 7Effect of the γ subunit prenyl group on the rate of receptor-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange on the G protein α subunit. Panel A, Sf9 membranes containing 30 fmol of receptor/time point were reconstituted with 6 nM Gi2α subunit and a 6 nM concentration of the β1γ1 or the β1γ1-S74L dimers and the assay conducted as described in the legend to Fig. 5. The [35S]GTPγS concentration was 6.6 nM. Panel B, an analogous experiment in which the membranes were reconstituted with 6 nM Gi2α subunit and a 6 nM concentration of the β1γ2 or the β1γ2-L71S dimers. The [35S]GTPγS concentration was 8.6 nM.

https://openalex.org/W1891097825,"Given the high homology in amino acid sequence between the δ-opioid receptor and the two other types (µ and κ), distinct residues in this receptor may confer its selectivity to some ligands. In order to identify molecular determinants in the human δ receptor responsible for the selectivity of δ-selective ligands, two different δ/µ chimeras were constructed. In the first one, the δ sequence from the top of transmembrane 5 to the C terminus was replaced by the equivalent µ sequence, and in the second one, 13 consecutive residues in the third extracellular loop region of the δ receptor were replaced by the µ counterpart. These two chimeras retained the ability to bind the nonselective bremazocine but completely lost the ability to bind different δ-selective ligands. These results suggested that the region of the third extracellular loop of the δ receptor is crucial for the type selectivity. Furthermore, an alanine scan was performed by site-directed mutagenesis of 20 amino acids located in or proximal to the third extracellular loop. Among all the point mutations, only mutations of Trp-284, Val-296, or Val-297 significantly decreased the binding of δ-selective ligands tested. Moreover, combined mutation of Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 considerably decreased the affinities of the receptor for δ-selective ligands compared with the single point mutations. These findings suggest that Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 are crucial residues involved in the δ receptor type selectivity. Given the high homology in amino acid sequence between the δ-opioid receptor and the two other types (µ and κ), distinct residues in this receptor may confer its selectivity to some ligands.

These two chimeras retained the ability to bind the nonselective bremazocine but completely lost the ability to bind different δ-selective ligands. These results suggested that the region of the third extracellular loop of the δ receptor is crucial for the type selectivity. Furthermore, an alanine scan was performed by site-directed mutagenesis of 20 amino acids located in or proximal to the third extracellular loop. Among all the point mutations, only mutations of Trp-284, Val-296, or Val-297 significantly decreased the binding of δ-selective ligands tested. Moreover, combined mutation of Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 considerably decreased the affinities of the receptor for δ-selective ligands compared with the single point mutations. These findings suggest that Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 are crucial residues involved in the δ receptor type selectivity. Opioid receptors are cell surface glycoproteins that constitute specific binding sites for a variety of compounds used for treating pain. Extensive pharmacological studies led to the definition of three opioid receptor types, µ, κ, and δ (1Lutz R.A. Pfister H.P. J. Recept. Res. 1992; 12: 267-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Simon E.J. Med. Res. Rev. 1991; 11: 357-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Indeed, the availability of highly selective ligands permitted a better characterization of these three types of receptors. In the past few years, cDNAs encoding the µ, κ, and δ of different species have been cloned (reviewed in Ref. 3Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, human receptors represent the ultimate therapeutic targets. Thus, the cloning of human µ, κ, and δ cDNAs (4Wang J.B.

Life Sci. 1994; 54: PL463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) provided particularly relevant tools for opioid drug discovery. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of the three human opioid receptors has shown that these receptors have characteristics common to the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein-coupled receptors with an extracellular N-terminal domain, a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, and seven putative transmembrane domains (7Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 8Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Moreover, given their high degree of identity (approximately 60%) with the highest similarity in the transmembrane domains and intracellular loops, distinct residues in these receptors may confer their selectivity to some ligands. Binding sites of selective ligands most probably reside, at least in part, in the divergent regions that are the extracellular loops and the N-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is also a divergent region, but its involvement in binding of ligands is unlikely. All of the opioid analgesics currently used clinically interact with the µ receptor and are known to induce severe side effects and addiction (9Jaffe J.M. Martin W.R. Gilman A. Rall J. Nies A. Taylor P. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. Pergamon Press Inc., New York1990: 485Google Scholar, 10Ellison N.M. Patt R.B. Cancer Pain. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia1993: 185Google Scholar). These major disadvantages were less pronounced with the use of a number of agonists selective for the κ receptor which also display analgesic properties (11Pfeiffer A. Brantl V. Herz A. Emrich H.M. Science. 1986; 233: 774-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 12Unterwald E. Sasson S. Kornetsky C. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 1993; 104: 276-296Google Scholar), suggesting that some effective analgesics with minimal side effects, selectively interacting with one of the three types of opioid receptors, may be developed. Particularly, δ receptors that bind enkephalin-like peptides with high affinity have been proposed to mediate analgesia (14Heyman J.S. Mulvaney S.A. Mosberg H.I. Porreca F. Brain Res. 1987; 420: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Heyman J.S. Mosberg H.I. Porreca F. NIDA Res. Monogr. 1986; 75: 442-445PubMed Google Scholar, 16Heyman J.S. Vaught J.L.

Neuropharmacology. 1992; 31: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), making them an interesting target for drug design. In an effort to elucidate the binding sites of δ-selective ligands, construction of chimeric δ/µ receptors and site-directed mutagenesis on the human δ-opioid receptor cDNA were performed. The ability of these mutated receptors to bind δ-selective ligands was evaluated by studying competition of [3H]bremazocine binding with four δ-selective ligands, i.e. SNC-80, DPDPE, 1The abbreviations used are: DPDPEcyclic [D-penicillamine2,D-penicillamine5]enkephalinTMtransmembrane domainhDORhuman δ-opioid receptor. deltorphin II, and naltrindole. Three hydrophobic residues, Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297, were identified as essential residues for normal binding of δ-selective ligands. cyclic [D-penicillamine2,D-penicillamine5]enkephalin transmembrane domain human δ-opioid receptor. pcDNA3 vector was purchased from Invitrogen. 293S cells were obtained from Cold Spring Harbor. [3H]Bremazocine was purchased from DuPont NEN. Naloxone and naltrindole are from Research Biochemicals Int. (RBI). SNC-80 is from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, United Kingdom). DPDPE and deltorphin II were purchased from Bachem Bioscience. Both δ and µ receptor cDNAs were subcloned in pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) at EcoRI + XhoI sites and at HindIII site, respectively. δ1-214/µ215-381 chimera was created using two distinct BglII restriction sites conserved in the δ and µ cDNA containing vector. The first site is located in the sequence encoding Lys-214 at the most C-terminal part of the second extracellular loop of the δ receptor and the second site is located in the vector. The 1.8-kilobase fragment generated by BglII digestion of µ encoding plasmid was ligated with the 5-kilobase fragment generated by the same digestion of the δ encoding plasmid. δ/µ288-300 chimera and point mutations were created using Clontech site-directed mutagenesis kit which is based on the method of Deng and Nickoloff (19Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Mutations and constructions were verified and confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293S cells (Cold Spring Harbor) were grown as monolayers in 150-mm Petri dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 at 37°C. Wild-type and mutant δ-opioid receptor constructs were transfected for transient expression into 293S cells by a modified calcium-phosphate precipitation method described in Ref. 20Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and mechanically detached in 11 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.32 M sucrose, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then lysed with a Polytron homogenizer by one 5-s burst at maximum speed. The lysate was frozen at −80°C or immediately used for the binding experiments. Saturation and competition binding assays for wild-type and mutant δ-opioid receptors were carried out using 0.1 ml of membrane suspension (≈25 µg of protein), prepared as described above, in a total volume of 0.3 ml. Binding reactions were performed at 25°C for 1 h in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For saturation experiments, duplicate contained 0.5-15 nM [3H]bremazocine (30 Ci/mmol). Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 µM naloxone. For competition experiments, duplicate contained ≈5 nM [3H]bremazocine and 1 pM to 10 µM SNC-80, DPDPE, or deltorphin II or 0.01 pM to 100 nM naltrindole. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/B filters presoaked for approximately 1 h in 0.1% polyethyleneimine. Data from saturation and competition experiments were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression using computer program GraphPad Prism. The three-dimensional model of human δ-opioid receptor was constructed in three steps. We have first identified the sequences of transmembrane domains based on the sequence alignment of opioid receptor family. Then, the seven initial helices were built using the identified sequences and were submitted to a conformational search using a mixed Molecular Dynamics and Monte-Carlo procedure. The purpose of the Molecular Dynamics and Monte-Carlo search is to find the maximal interactions among the seven helices. Tilt of helices derived from the projection density maps of rhodopsin (21Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) were used as restraints. Finally, the three extracellular loops were added to the model using the coordinates from the Protein Data base which show similar sequences on the sequence homology analysis. Sequence of human δ-opioid receptor (6Knapp R.J. Malatynska E. Fang L. Li X. Babin E. Nguyen M. Santoro G. Varga E.V. Hruby V.J. Roeske W.R. Yamamura H.I. Life Sci. 1994; 54: PL463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Genbank p41143) was first submitted to the TMAP procedure of EMBL (22Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) to search the opioid receptor family and then to predict the transmembrane helical regions. Final definition of the helical domains were further adjusted using the assumption that the arginine and lysine residues are most likely at the end of helix (23Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods in Neuroscience. Vol 25. Academic Press, New York1995: 366Google Scholar). Initial helix building, sequence homology, and final structure refinement were performed using Quanta/CHARMM (Biosym/MSI) software. In order to identify residues in the δ-opioid receptor involved in binding of δ-selective ligands, different mutants of the human δ-opioid receptor were created. The ability of these mutants to bind δ-selective ligands was determined using a nonselective radioligand, [3H]bremazocine, as a tracer to label the receptors and four unlabeled δ-selective ligands as competitors, SNC-80, a nonpeptidic agonist, DPDPE, and deltorphin II which are peptidic agonists, and naltrindole a nonpeptidic antagonist. Chemical structures of the five ligands used are illustrated in Fig. 1. Initially, a chimeric receptor was created in which the first 214 amino acids correspond to the δ sequence and the last 165 amino acids correspond to the µ sequence (Fig. 2A). This δ1-214/µ215-381 was constructed using a conserved unique restriction site in δ and µ receptors located at the junction of the second extracellular loop and TM5. Because of the high similarities between the δ and µ sequences, only some residues in the δ1-214/µ215-381 chimera are divergent from the wild-type δ (Fig. 2B). A second chimeric receptor, named δ/µ288-300, was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. In this chimera, a stretch of 13 consecutive amino acids in the region of the third extracellular loop of the δ receptor was replaced for the equivalent sequence of the µ receptor (Fig. 3, A and B).Fig. 3Schematic representation of the δ/µ288-300 chimera.

Nonlinear regression analysis of the saturation curves showed that the affinities of both chimeras for [3H]bremazocine were not significantly different from the wild-type (Fig. 4A), suggesting that both chimeric receptors retain the ability to bind the nonselective ligand bremazocine. However, competition of [3H]bremazocine binding with SNC-80, DPDPE, deltorphin II, and naltrindole on the two chimeras demonstrated that their affinities for the four δ-selective ligands were considerably decreased (Fig. 4A). A representative experiment of competition binding is shown in Fig. 4B. These results suggest that residues located downstream from the second extracellular loop and more particularly around the third extracellular loop of the hDOR are involved in binding of δ-selective ligands. In order to identify specific residues involved in binding of δ-selective ligands, an alanine scan was performed for 20 amino acids located in or proximal to the third extracellular loop (Fig. 5). These point mutations on the wild-type δ receptor were made using site-directed mutagenesis. Saturation binding experiments with [3H]bremazocine and competition curves with SNC-80, DPDPE, deltorphin II, and naltrindole were also performed on the 20 single point mutants. Affinities of these mutants for [3H]bremazocine as well as for the four δ-selective ligands are listed in Table I. Similar to the chimeras, affinities of the 20 mutants for [3H]bremazocine were comparable with that of the wild-type δ. However, when the affinities of the mutants are examined for each δ-selective ligand individually, some of them have a Ki higher than the wild-type (for SNC-80: W284A, V296A, and V297A; for DPDPE: W284A, I289A, V296A, and S312A; for deltorphin II: W284A, I289A, R291A, V296A, V297A, S312A; for naltrindole: W284A, L295A, V297A, A298G, and S312A). Mutations affecting the binding of the δ-selective ligands are not always the same for every ligand, probably reflecting their respective chemical properties. Otherwise, in a global observation of Table I, three mutants appeared to have their affinities altered (from 3- to 25-fold) for all or three of the four δ-selective ligands. These mutants are W284A, V296A, and V297A. Even though Ki values of these three mutants were higher than Ki values of wild-type δ receptor, they are not comparable with those of the chimeras (from 200- to more than 1000-fold), suggesting that more than one residue is involved in binding of δ-selective ligands.Table I.Ligand affinities for wild-type δ receptor and single point mutantsKd (nM), [3H]BremazocineKi (nM)SNC-80DPDPEDELT IINALTWT hDOR3.05 ± 0.372.33 ± 0.243.68 ± 0.410.80 ± 0.170.06 ± 0.02A275G0.80 ± 0.111.25 ± 0.241.17 ± 0.140.43 ± 0.130.07 ± 0.04F280A1.28 ± 0.331.99 ± 0.664.53 ± 1.141.16 ± 0.300.07 ± 0.05V283A1.65 ± 0.051.62 ± 0.735.37 ± 1.490.94 ± 0.260.06 ± 0.00W284A3.67 ± 0.3259.33 ± 10.21aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.31.91 ± 3.81aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.8.24 ± 1.05aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.0.29 ± 0.07aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.T285A2.45 ± 0.444.37 ± 1.186.84 ± 1.551.07 ± 0.380.16 ± 0.05D288A2.00 ± 0.692.08 ± 0.612.69 ± 0.930.92 ± 0.160.08 ± 0.06I289A2.10 ± 0.495.39 ± 0.5512.65 ± 1.89aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.3.84 ± 0.60aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.0.17 ± 0.02D290A1.38 ± 0.561.15 ± 0.321.09 ± 0.481.07 ± 0.320.06 ± 0.01R291A1.97 ± 0.283.86 ± 0.872.43 ± 0.6411.83 ± 3.73aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.0.13 ± 0.01R292A2.80 ± 0.343.27 ± 0.614.91 ± 1.562.53 ± 0.64aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.0.06 ± 0.00D293A1.37 ± 0.411.42 ± 0.441.63 ± 0.401.53 ± 0.290.11 ± 0.01P294A2.08 ± 0.482.28 ± 1.102.99 ± 0.190.88 ± 0.170.09 ± 0.05L295A3.57 ± 0.373.98 ± 0.874.79 ± 0.251.12 ± 0.340.36 ± 0.03aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.V296A3.47 ± 0.5713.81 ± 3.34aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.11.87 ± 1.39aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.3.77 ± 0.49aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.0.14 ± 0.05V297A4.25 ± 0.527.18 ± 1.62aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.4.65 ± 0.708.90 ± 1.68aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.0.23 ± 0.07aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.A298G2.63 ± 0.383.11 ± 0.252.98 ± 0.130.80 ± 0.120.29 ± 0.10aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.A299G1.74 ± 0.441.82 ± 0.084.10 ± 0.800.84 ± 0.170.13 ± 0.07L302A2.29 ± 0.342.42 ± 0.522.71 ± 0.420.86 ± 0.050.14 ± 0.05A309G1.12 ± 0.230.93 ± 0.212.42 ± 0.530.52 ± 0.070.10 ± 0.04S312A6.98 ± 3.085.88 ± 2.0810.37 ± 2.11aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.3.64 ± 0.80aSignificantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05.0.23 ± 0.11a Significantly higher than wild-type with p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab In order to evaluate the simultaneous contribution of the three amino acids Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 to the binding of δ-selective ligands, two different combinations of point mutations were generated. In one mutant the two valines were replaced with alanines (V296A + V297A), and in the other mutant all three amino acids as well were replaced with alanines (W284A + V296A + V297A). As shown in Table II, these combined mutations did not affect the binding of the nonselective ligand bremazocine. Simultaneous mutations of V296A and V297A led to a greater effect on binding of SNC-80 and DPDPE compared with the single point mutations but did not significantly change the binding of deltorphin II and naltrindole. Moreover, combined mutations of W284A, V296A, and V297A greatly decreased the affinities of the receptor for all four δ-selective ligands (Table II). However, this triple point mutation did not lead to an effect comparable with the chimeras, suggesting that more residues may be involved or that the mutations may be too conservative.Table II.Ligand affinities for wild-type δ receptor and combinatory mutantsKd (nM), [3H]BremazocineKi (nM)SNC-80DPDPEDELT IINALTWT hDOR3.05 ± 0.372.19 ± 0.293.25 ± 0.840.49 ± 0.130.04 ± 0.02W284AaData for these three mutants were transposed from Table I for better comparison.3.67 ± 0.3259.33 ± 10.2131.91 ± 3.818.24 ± 1.050.29 ± 0.07V296AaData for these three mutants were transposed from Table I for better comparison.3.47 ± 0.5713.81 ± 3.3411.87 ± 1.393.77 ± 0.490.144 ± 0.05V297AaData for these three mutants were transposed from Table I for better comparison.4.25 ± 0.527.18 ± 1.624.65 ± 0.708.90 ± 1.680.23 ± 0.07V296A + V297A3.74 ± 0.8931.48 ± 10.4519.73 ± 5.718.85 ± 4.450.14 ± 0.05W284A + V296A + V297A6.12 ± 0.59306 ± 59281 ± 62424 ± 230.9 ± 0.2a Data for these three mutants were transposed from Table I for better comparison. Open table in a new tab In the chimeras, residues of the δ sequence were replaced for residues of the µ sequence, whereas in the triple point mutant (W284A + V296A + V297A), alanines were used to replaced the δ residues. Thus, to determine if the substitution of alanines for Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 account for the smaller effect on binding of selective ligands compared with the chimeras, the same three amino acids were replaced with the equivalent residues of the µ. In the first mutant, only the Trp-284 was replaced with a lysine (W284K). In the other mutant, in addition to W284K mutation, Val-296 and Val-297 were replaced with a glutamic acid and a threonine, respectively (W284K + V296Q + V297T). Nonlinear regression analysis of the [3H]bremazocine saturation curves showed that these two other mutants maintained their ability to bind bremazocine to a comparable extent to the wild-type δ receptor (Table III). However, the mutation of Trp-284 for a lysine produced an effect of over 10-fold on the binding of DPDPE, deltorphin II, and naltrindole but led to a particularly pronounced effect on SNC-80 binding (373-fold). Substitution of µ residues for Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 did not increase the loss of binding for the δ-selective ligands that were observed with the alanine substitutions.Table IIIEffect of µ residue substitution on ligand affinitiesKd (nM), [3H]BremazocineKi (nM)SNC-80DPDPEDELT IINALTWT hDOR3.05 ± 0.372.19 ± 0.293.25 ± 0.840.49 ± 0.130.04 ± 0.02W284K7.21 ± 0.43817 ± 36538.10 ± 10.9145.80 ± 3.390.6 ± 0.3W284K + V296Q + V297T4.05 ± 0.75248 ± 38122 ± 15125 ± 280.49 ± 0.19 Open table in a new tab In the present study, we used chimeric constructs between δ- and µ-opioid receptors as an initial approach to locate critical regions involved in the selectivity displayed by the δ receptor. δ1-214/µ215-381 and δ/µ288-300 chimeric receptors allowed us to show that the region of the third extracellular loop is essential to the binding of tested δ-selective ligands. Then, using site-directed mutagenesis of individual residues in or surrounding the third extracellular loop, we have identified Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 of the human δ-opioid receptor as important molecular determinants for the normal binding of SNC-80, DPDPE, deltorphin II, as well as naltrindole. Furthermore, simultaneous mutation of these three hydrophobic residues considerably altered the binding of the four δ-selective ligands. All the chimeric or mutated receptors displayed high affinity binding of bremazocine, a nonselective ligand. Replacement of Trp-284 by either an alanine or a lysine led to the most important effect on the binding of δ-selective ligands compared with the other point mutations, suggesting that Trp-284 plays a major role in determining the selectivity for ligands. In a recent study, Hjorth and co-workers (24Hjorth S.A. Thirstrup K. Grandy D.K. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1089-1094PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that Glu-297 of the κ-opioid receptor plays an important role in the κ-selective binding characteristics of nor-binaltorphimine. Interestingly, this residue is located at the corresponding position of Trp-284 of the δ receptor, suggesting that the residue at this position (δ, Trp; µ, Lys; and κ, Glu) may represent a crucial recognition site for opioid ligands. This hypothesis may explain why the δ/µ288-300 chimera has higher affinities for the four δ-selective ligands than the δ1-214/µ215-381 chimera. Indeed, the presence of Trp-284 in the δ/µ288-300 chimera may contribute to restore in part the binding of δ-selective ligands. Previous studies using κ/δ or δ/µ chimeric receptors revealed that δ-selective ligands interact mainly with the C-terminal half of the δ receptor (25Fukuda K. Kato S. Mori K. J. Biol.

Moreover, it has been shown that mutation of Asp-95 located in TM2 of the δ receptor reduced the affinity of the receptor for δ-selective agonists but not for antagonists or nonselective ligands (27Kong H.

This suggests that binding of different classes of ligands may involve distinct residues. More recently, Wang and co-workers (28Wang W.W. Shahrestanifar M. Jin J. Howells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12436-12440Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) proposed that vicinal arginine residues in the putative third extracellular loop of the δ receptor are important for high affinity binding of D-serine2,leucine5],enkephalin-threonine which is a δ-selective ligand. In contrast, in our study, mutation of these two arginines did not affect the binding of δ-selective ligands with the exception of Arg-291 which seems important for the binding of deltorphin II. This discrepancy may be due to the different amino acids chosen to replace the arginines and to the ligand tested. The sequence analysis suggested that residue Trp-284 is located at the most N-terminal position of the third extracellular loop and that residues Val-296 and Val-297 are located at the extracellular surface of TM7. Based on our three-dimensional model, these three residues are pointing toward the inside of the putative binding pore formed by the seven TMs (Fig. 6A). Positions of Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 in the sequence of the receptor along with the orientation of TM6 and TM7 in the three-dimensional model suggest that these three residues are most likely participating directly in the binding processes instead of only stabilizing the structure of the helices. The fact that bremazocine binding is not affected by the mutations supports this hypothesis. Very recently, Befort and co-workers (29Befort K. Tabbara L. Kling D. Maigret B. Kieffer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10161-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have proposed that aromatic residues located in the TMs of the δ-opioid receptor contribute to ligand recognition. They suggested that these aromatic residues constitute major anchor points for nonselective opioids, whereas additional interactions may take place for δ-selective ligands in other regions of the receptor. Supporting this idea, residues they have identified are conserved across δ, µ, and κ receptors. Their results combined with our findings led to our formulation of an hypothesis that binding of δ-selective ligands may be achieved in two steps. The first step would be the recognition of the δ type by ligand interaction with Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 located at the entrance of the binding pore formed by the seven Tms (Fig. 6B). The second step would be the interaction with the general binding domain formed by the aromatic residues proposed in the study of Befort et al. (29Befort K. Tabbara L. Kling D. Maigret B. Kieffer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10161-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis, the effect of Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 mutations on binding of a ligand seems to correlate with its degree of selectivity. The effect seems more important for highly selective ligands like SNC-80 and deltorphin II than for naltrindole, a weakly selective ligand. Our study is the first extensive site-directed mutagenesis study aimed at identifying critical residues for δ-selective ligand-receptor interaction. Even though Trp-284, Val-296, and Val-297 have been identified as recognition elements determining the selectivity, more studies are needed to elucidate the overall binding pathway for selective ligands.

https://openalex.org/W1976018125,"To understand the mechanism by which human red blood cells (RBCs) contribute to hemostasis and thrombosis, we have examined the effects of metabolites released by activated platelets on intact RBCs. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a signal molecule produced by activated platelets, was observed to lower the filterability of human erythrocytes by ~30% at 10−10M. PGE2 also caused a reduction in mean cell volume of ~10%. The shrinkage of red cells after PGE2 treatment was confirmed by documenting a decrease in osmotic fragility and an increase in cell density following exposure to the hormone. Careful analysis, however, revealed that only ~15% of the erythrocytes responded to stimulation with PGE2. Examination of the cause of cell shrinkage showed that induction of a PGE2-stimulated K+ efflux pathway leading to rapid loss of cellular K+ was responsible. The PGE2-stimulated K+ loss was also observed to be Ca2+-dependent, suggesting the possible involvement of the Gardos channel. Gardos channel participation was supported by the observation that two Gardos channel inhibitors, charybdotoxin and clotrimazole, independently blocked the PGE2-stimulated K+ efflux. Further evidence for Gardos channel activation came from experiments aimed at characterizing the efflux pathway followed by the obligatory counterion. Thus, K+ efflux was readily stimulated even when NO−3 was substituted for Cl−, suggesting that neither KCl cotransport nor Na/K/2Cl cotransport plays a prominent role in the PGE2-induced cell shrinkage. Further, the anion transporter band 3 was implicated as the counterion efflux route, since DIDS inhibited the PGE2-stimulated cell volume change without blocking the change in membrane potential. Taken together, we propose that release of PGE2 by activated platelets constitutes part of a mechanism by which activated platelets may recruit adjacent erythrocytes to assist in clot formation.

We have previously characterized carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of apoB expressed in COS cells and have shown that these proteins were readily synthesized but retained within the ER and degraded, if the size of the truncated protein was larger than apoB 29. Below this size, the smaller the size of the apoB truncates, the greater the extent of secretion, although >50% of these smaller proteins were also degraded within the ER. In the present study, we demonstrate that this secretory defect can be overcome by coexpression with microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP); moreover, this complementation is inversely related to the size of apoB. Secretion of apoBs larger than B29 required the coexpression of MTP and, in the presence of MTP, was oleate-responsive. MTP, in the presence or absence of oleate supplementation, had little or no effect on the secretion of the shorter truncates. We discovered, however, that MTP was physically associated with all forms of apoB intracellularly (B13-B41). The association of MTP with apoB 41 was stable to high salt washing, as well as to low pH, suggesting that these interactions may be hydrophobic in nature. In addition to the interaction with MTP, apoB was also found to be associated with calnexin, confirming previous studies, and with proteins bearing the KDEL retention signal. However, studies on overexpression of human calnexin and tunicamycin inhibition of glycosylation showed that interaction with calnexin was not necessary for the formation or secretion of apoB 41-containing lipoproteins; moreover, in the presence of MTP, the association of calnexin with apoB 41 was transient or absent. These data suggest that for apoB to attain a folded state sufficient to escape the quality control of the ER, it needs to obtain neutral lipid (supplied by MTP), as well as its ability to keep it packaged as a rudimentary lipoprotein, dependent on its size being larger than B29.

In this paper we describe Gap1m, which is closely related to Gap1IP4BP, to also be an IP4-binding protein and show that the pleckstrin homology domain (PH) is the central IP4-binding domain by expressing fragments of the mouse Gap1m in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins and examining their activities.

The PH domain is highly conserved in the Gap1 family and also has striking homology to the amino-terminal region of Bruton's tyrosine kinase.

Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2394) Google Scholar). This may result from aging or pathogenic conditions, e.g. cataract formation (17Jahngen-Hodge J. Taylor A. Shang F. Huang L. Mura C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Spector A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), or the presence of chemicals that mediate the production of such oxygen species (19Bhuyan D.K. Bhuyan K.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has been known that these reactive oxygen species may damage proteins by oxidizing the amino acid side chains of cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine, and even aliphatic amino acid residues. Oxidatively damaged proteins are removed from the cell by proteolysis (20Pacifi R.E. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, oxygen radical production has also been implicated in apoptosis (22Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 23McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 370-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Apart from these phenomena, oxidation and reduction have been proposed to play a role in a number of proteins (mainly transcription factors) whose activity is regulated by a thiol switch that is supposedly operated by changes in the intracellular redox potential (24Staal F.J.T. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 25Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar, 26Toledano M.B. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given the changes induced in RI by thiol oxidation in vitro (15Fominaya J.M. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24655-24660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it would be of interest to examine whether oxidation of thiol groups can also occur within the cell and whether it results in increased sensitivity to proteolysis. To this end we have incubated LLC-PK1 cells (28Hull R.N. Cherry W.R. Weaver G.W. In Vitro. 1976; 12(10): 670-677Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar) with hydrogen peroxide and with diamide, a thiol-specific oxidant. The results show that oxidation of thiol groups is sufficient to cause removal of RI activity and protein from the cell. Analysis of mRNA levels and protein half-life indicate that most likely a proteolytic mechanism is involved. Bovine pancreatic RNase A, diamide, and L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), were obtained from Sigma. Perhydrol 30% (H2O2) was from Merck. DTNB, GSH, Triton X-100, leupeptin, pepstatin A, benzamidine HCl, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Fluka Chemie AG. Tween-20, nitrocellulose, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody were purchased from Bio-Rad. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum (FCS), phenol, methionine, and cysteine were from Life Technologies, Inc. Trypan blue solution 0.5% was from Serva. ECL Western blotting detection reagents and Hybond-N+ membranes were obtained from Amersham Corp. Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. DIG RNA labeling (SP6/T7) and DIG nucleic acid detection kits were from Boehringer Mannheim. Trans35S-label was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. RI (1 µM) was incubated with various concentrations of diamide (0.125-1 mM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.6 mM EDTA at 37°C for 30 min. Aliquots were diluted 500-fold in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in H2O and used directly in the RNase assay. Cleavage of diamide-treated RI with thermolysin and analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described previously (15Fominaya J.M. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24655-24660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells (28Hull R.N. Cherry W.R. Weaver G.W. In Vitro. 1976; 12(10): 670-677Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Y. Nagamine (Friedrich Miescher-Institut, Basel) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated FCS in a 95% air, 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37°C. LLC-PK1 cells in logarithmic phase (2 × 106 cells/10 cm dish) were treated with 0, 2.5, and 5 mM H2O2 for 30 min either with or without pretreatment with 250 µM BSO for 24 h in order to deplete GSH levels. Cells at the same density were also treated with 250 µM diamide for various lengths of time. In this case, glucose was omitted from the medium. Unless specified otherwise, incubations with the various oxidants were carried out in serum-free medium. At the end of the incubations, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80°C until used. Before extraction, the cells were thawed on ice and removed from the plate with a rubber policeman in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 M saccharose, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 µg/ml pepstatin A, 1 µg/ml benzamidine HCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Unless specified otherwise, all steps were performed at 4°C. Cells were lysed by vortexing and incubation on ice for 10 min. The extracts were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 270,000 × g for 30 min. The final supernatants were either frozen in dry ice and stored at −80°C or processed immediately. RI activity was determined by titrating the inhibitor with a known amount of RNase A. The concentration of RNase A was determined from its absorbance at 280 nm, using A0.1%280 = 0.73 mg−1·ml·cm−1 (29Gill S.C. von Hipper P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar, 30Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The remaining RNase activity was determined using total yeast RNA as a substrate as described previously by Fominaya et al. (31Fominaya J.M. Garcia-Segura J.M. Gavilanes J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A Shimadzu UV-240 spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance at 260 nm, and the readings were corrected for the appropriate blanks. RI activity was expressed as units of RI/mg of protein, defining 1 unit as the amount of RI required to inhibit the activity of 5 ng of RNase A by 50% (13Blackburn P. Wilson G. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total protein concentration in cell extracts was calculated using the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar) as adapted by Bio-Rad. Enzyme activity was assayed following the conversion of pyruvate and NADH into lactate and NAD+ according to the procedure described by Storrie et al. (33Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 220-221Google Scholar). The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was registered and lactate dehydrogenase activity was expressed as nmol of NAD+·min−1·mg−1 protein. To determine the percentage of viable cells after each treatment, the cells were trypsinized, resuspended in medium, mixed with trypan blue solution (1:1 v/v), and counted. Cell viability was calculated as the percentage of trypan blue-excluding cells with respect to the total cell count. The DTNB colorimetric method (34Beutler E. Duron O. Kelly B.M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1963; 61: 882-888PubMed Google Scholar) was used for determination of GSH. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off with a rubber policeman in 0.3 ml of 1.67% (w/v) freshly prepared meta-phosphoric acid. This treatment resulted in cell lysis and precipitation of the proteins. Under these conditions, GSH represents the only measurable soluble thiol within the cells. Samples were centrifuged and aliquots of 0.2 ml were mixed with 0.7 ml of 0.3 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.7, and 0.1 ml of 0.04% DTNB in 1% sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.8. After 5 min, the absorbance at 412 nm was measured and the amount of soluble thiols determined by comparison with GSH standards. Protein samples (2.5 µg) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10 or 12.5% slab gels according to the method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and the blots were blocked overnight at 4°C with 5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl (TBS), containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). RI was detected with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody (20 ng/ml) against recombinant porcine RI and a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution). The blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). Exposure time on x-ray film ranged from 20 to 60 s. Cells were grown as indicated above. Total cellular RNA was extracted according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63167) Google Scholar). RNA was quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm, and its purity was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Total RNA (15 µg/lane) for Northern blot analysis was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to charged nylon membranes. After prehybridization, the membrane was hybridized overnight at 68°C with a digoxigenin-labeled RI cRNA probe obtained by in vitro transcription of the previously characterized cDNA (4Vicentini A.M. Kieffer B. Matthies R. Meyhack B. Hemmings B.A. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8827-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing of the membrane were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybrids were revealed using an anti-digoxigenin antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase and nitrotetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate. Briefly, LLC-PK1 cells grown until the late exponential phase on 6-cm tissue culture dishes were washed with methionine- and cysteine-free medium (FCS was also omitted), followed by metabolic labeling with 100 µCi/ml Trans35S-label in the above medium for 50 min. Cells were washed three times with DMEM and chased in the same medium containing 2 mM Met and 1 mM Cys and supplemented with 10% FCS for the indicated times. Cell extracts were prepared as described above. RI was immunoprecipitated by incubation for 1 h at 4°C with the purified antibodies (0.125 µg/µg of total protein), followed by an overnight incubation with 50 µl of a 50% solution of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). The immunocomplexes collected with the beads were washed three times with 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20, and the antigen was eluted from the beads by boiling for 3 min in gel sample buffer as described (37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The samples were resolved using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the radiolabeled bands containing RI were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The incubation of cultured LLC-PK1 cells with 5 mM H2O2 for 30 min decreased the level of RI activity by 40% compared to untreated control cells (Fig. 1A). Reduced glutathione (GSH) can act as a scavenger for H2O2 and radicals generated from it (38Das D.K. Maulik N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to examine the effect of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis (39Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of LLC-PK1 cells with 250 µM BSO for 24 h reduced the concentration of GSH to 20% of control levels, but the RI activity remained essentially the same (Fig. 1A). After further incubation with 5 mM H2O2 for 30 min, the RI activity had decreased to approximately 20% of that of untreated cells. Under the experimental conditions used, total cell number did not decrease, and cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion was always higher than 90% (data not shown), indicating that cell death was not the cause of the decrease in RI. While morphology of the cells incubated either with 5 mM H2O2 or 250 µM BSO was like that of the control, the cytoplasms of the BSO-preincubated cells treated with H2O2 became granular and vacuolated after 15-20 min of incubation (data not shown). The reductions in RI activity correlated with a decrease in the amount of RI protein in the cells as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that an oxidizing environment lead to the loss of RI, but the specific involvement of cysteine residues cannot be concluded given the general nature of hydrogen peroxide oxidation. To learn more specifically about the role of thiol oxidation in RI inactivation, the effect of diamide, a thiol-specific oxidant (40Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 41Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), was examined in detail. In vitro pilot experiments showed that diamide completely oxidized the 30 thiol groups of RI with concomitant loss of activity (data not shown). Treatment of the fully oxidized protein with thermolysin (1% w/w) for 30 min at 37°C resulted in complete degradation, as demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). In contrast, the native protein was completely resistant to proteolysis under the same conditions. Increased susceptibility of RI oxidized to proteolysis has previously been observed using DTNB as the oxidizing reagent (15Fominaya J.M. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24655-24660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of LLC-PK1 cells with 250 µM diamide rapidly decreased RI activity in a time-dependent manner, reaching approximately 12% of the control after 50 min (Fig. 2A). This process was preceded by an even faster decline of the concentration of GSH. Western blot analysis showed that the decrease in RI activity was not simply due to inactivation, as the protein also disappeared from the cells (Fig. 2B). It was important to ascertain that these changes were not caused by cell death or irreversible cell damage. For this purpose, cells treated with diamide for 40 min were allowed to recover from the oxidative insult for 24 h, during which RI activity was followed. The results in Fig. 3 demonstrate that after this period RI activity was restored to near control levels. This increase was due to reappearance of the RI protein as found by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Furthermore, the increase in the number of cells during this 24-h period was normal, indicating that no irreversible damage had been invoked. Moreover, during the incubation with diamide, total cell number did not decrease and cell viability was always higher than 90%. The morphology of the cells remained normal, at least for the initial 20 min. After this, vacuoles appeared in the cytoplasm (data not shown). The results presented in Fig. 4 show that diamide did not have an effect on cytoplasmic proteins in general. Neither the activity of a cytoplasmic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, nor the recovery of the amount of total protein changed during incubation with diamide. Given the increased susceptibility of thiol-oxidized RI to proteolysis in vitro, it seemed likely that also intracellularly such a mechanism was responsible for the diamide-induced decrease in the level of RI protein. If, however, RI had a very short half-life, an inhibitory effect of diamide on its synthesis could also explain the observations. Since the half-life of RI has not been determined previously, a pulse-chase experiment was performed. From the results summarized in Fig. 5, a value of 8.5 ± 0.62 h was obtained for untreated LLC-PK1 cells, which is much longer than the 50 min period over which the decrease in RI was observed. Furthermore, diamide did not affect the steady-state level of the mRNA encoding RI, as was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2C). To prove that degradation of RI took place in the cell and not during manipulation of the samples, the following experiment was performed. Fully denatured and carboxymethylated RI (cmRI) is easily degraded by proteases (5Hofsteenge J. Kieffer B. Matthies R. Hemmings B.A. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8537-8544Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Fominaya J.M. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24655-24660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can easily be distinguished from endogenous RI due to its lower electrophoretic mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Incubation of cmRI for 2 h at 4°C with extracts obtained from cells treated with diamide for 0, 30, or 50 min showed no degradation (Fig. 6). The same result was obtained when the experiment was performed at 37°C (data not shown). In vitro studies on RI have shown a clear dependence of its inhibitory activity on the preservation of its cysteines in the reduced state (4Vicentini A.M. Kieffer B. Matthies R. Meyhack B. Hemmings B.A. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8827-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Lee F.S. Fox E.A. Zhou H.M. Strydom D.J. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8545-8553Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The presence of reducing agents like dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol (13Blackburn P. Wilson G. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Roth J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Shortman K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 55: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as well as antioxidants (metal chelators like EDTA) (44Gribnau A.A.M. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Bloemendal H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have been shown to be essential in maintaining RI stable and active. Here we have investigated in cultured cells the effect of oxidants on intracellular RI. Oxidative damage to intracellular proteins is accepted as a “marker” for proteolytic degradation (20Pacifi R.E. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Studies on these aspects of protein turnover usually employ compounds that create reactive oxygen species which can react with a number of amino acids side chains (20Pacifi R.E. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Incubation of LLC-PK1 cells with hydrogen peroxide caused a decrease in RI activity. Using specific antibodies, we could demonstrate that this decrease was due to disappearance of the protein (Fig. 1B) and not simply to inactivation or complex formation with endogenous RNases. Under normal conditions reduced glutathione maintains a reducing environment in the cytoplasm which protects proteins containing sulfhydryl groups like RI from inactivation (38Das D.K. Maulik N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 45Meister A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1969s-1975sPubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this it was found that the inactivating effect of H2O2 on RI was augmented by inhibiting GSH synthesis by BSO (Fig. 1). H2O2 is not a specific oxidant for cysteines. It can also oxidize the side chains of Met, Trp, Tyr, and His and generate protein-protein cross-linkage (20Pacifi R.E. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In order to examine the role of thiol oxidation in intracellular RI inactivation, a thiol-specific oxidant was used. Diamide can react with both protein and nonprotein thiols like GSH. Incubation of LLC-PK1 cells with diamide rapidly decreased the level of GSH and was followed by a decline in RI activity and protein (Fig. 2). RI is not inactivated due to the low level of GSH. Using BSO to reduce the concentration of GSH to the same level as in the diamide experiment did not result in a decrease in RI (Fig. 1A). The same result was obtained using ethacrynic acid, an inhibitor of glutathione-S-transferase (data not shown). Furthermore, inhibition of the reduction of GSSG with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea had no effect (data not shown). Most likely, the diamide that remains after oxidizing GSH acts directly on intracellular RI, in agreement with the in vitro susceptibility of the protein to this reagent. The rapid decrease in the level of GSH upon addition of diamide demonstrated that the effect of the reagent involved a direct reaction with thiol groups in the cytosolic fraction. In agreement with this, we found that treatment of the cells with DTNB, which is impermeable to cell membranes, did not alter the GSH or RI level (data not shown). The decrease in RI protein could be due to either an increased rate of degradation or an inhibition of RI synthesis in combination with a normal high turnover. The former seems to be the case. RI has a half-life of 8.5 h in untreated LLC-PK1 cells. If diamide would only inhibit the synthesis of RI and not affect its degradation, a 6.6% decrease over the experimental period would be expected. Since nearly 90% of RI disappeared, an “active” mechanism must be operating. Given the sensitivity of thiol-oxidized RI to proteolysis in vitro (15Fominaya J.M. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24655-24660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the role of oxidation in “marking” proteins (20Pacifi R.E. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), an intracellular proteolytic event seems a reasonable explanation. The possibility that, in addition to this, diamide has an effect on the translation of the mRNA for RI cannot be excluded. However, the steady-state level of RI mRNA was unaltered, showing that transcription was not influenced by diamide (Fig. 2C). These results show that oxidation of thiol groups in intracellular RI is sufficient for its inactivation and further degradation in the cell. It is important to note that the conditions used in these experiments did not produce a general cell damage and that the effects of diamide were reversible (Fig. 3). At this point it may be useful to discuss briefly the methods used to determine RI. In the past, numerous studies on the effect of physiological stimuli and chemical compounds on RI have used activity measurements only (1Lee F.S. Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1993; 44: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since artifactual complexes with endogenous RNases may form upon tissue disruption (1Lee F.S. Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1993; 44: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 46Hofsteenge J. Matthies R. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9806-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and specific activity and relative amounts of such RNases are not known, the amount of free or complexed RI cannot be determined accurately. In LLC-PK1 cells the level of endogenous RNases is too low to be detected by the methods used. Thus the RI activity measurements are not affected by fortuitous complex formation. Furthermore, specific probes, antibodies against RI and cDNA encoding RI, were used to qualitatively asses changes in protein and mRNA level. The quantitative application of such analyses to some of the systems in which changes in RI activity have been observed, e.g. growth and development, disease, hormones, compounds affecting cellular functions, or physical stimuli (see Ref. 1Lee F.S. Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1993; 44: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar for an overview), will be needed to unravel the biological function of RI. Whether thiol modification is a physiological mechanism of modulating RI activity as suggested previously (10Aoki Y. Natori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 196: 699-703Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Fominaya J.M. Garcia-Segura J.M. Ferreras M. Gavilanes J.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), as has been found for other proteins (24Staal F.J.T. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 25Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar, 26Toledano M.B.

Enzymol. 1990; 63: 169-172Google Scholar), remains to be examined. It is not known whether thiol oxidation plays any role in the normal turnover (t1/2 = 8.5 h) of RI, but it is conceivable that accumulation of oxidized thiols in RI alters its conformation and makes it more susceptible to proteolysis (15Fominaya J.M.

Our results using H2O2 and LLC-PK1 cells directly correlate oxidation, RI instability, and degradation of the protein and extend the studies on cataract formation. It will be of interest to examine the level of RI protein using specific antibodies in this and other pathological situations in which an increase in oxidative stress has been observed. In summary, we have shown that oxidation of thiol groups in intracellular RI is sufficient for its removal from the cell. In agreement with in vitro experiments (15Fominaya J.M. Hofsteenge J. J.

Pgp homologs are expressed in many organisms, from bacteria to yeast and mammals. Previous studies established a model system to analyze the function of murine, human, and Plasmodium falciparum Pgp by heterologous expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, such studies have been hampered by the inherent resistance of yeast cells to chemotherapeutic agents. We find that an erg6 mutation, which blocks the final synthetic step of the membrane sterol ergosterol, renders yeast sensitive to anthracyclines and dactinomycin, clinically relevant Pgp substrates. We demonstrate that expression of the murine mdr3 gene confers dactinomycin resistance in both the erg6 mutant yeast strain and in an erg6 rad52 DNA repair mutant yeast strain. Similarly, murine mdr3 expression confers resistance to the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 in a CsA-FK506-sensitive vph6 mutant yeast strain. CsA and FK506 are known to partially overcome Pgp-mediated drug resistance, suggesting the targets of these drugs might regulate Pgp function. We find that both murine mdr3 and the yeast Pgp homolog STE6 function in yeast mutants lacking the CsA target proteins cyclophilin A and calcineurin. In contrast, murine mdr3 function was severely compromised in yeast mutants lacking the FK506/rapamycin target protein FKBP12. Both wild-type FKBP12 and an F43Y FKBP12 mutant with reduced prolyl isomerase activity supported mdr3 function. Our results support the model that immunosuppressants reverse multidrug resistance by competing with other Pgp substrates but reveal that inhibition of FKBP12-dependent Pgp function may also contribute to reversal of multidrug resistance by FK506 and rapamycin.

Subsequently, the binding of DnaB helicase from the DnaB-DnaC complex through direct contact with DnaA protein suggests that it orients the binding of the replicative helicase for its subsequent action to promote bidirectional replication fork movement (8Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Priming of DNA replication by primase for both leading and lagging strand synthesis is proposed to occur through a physical interaction between primase and DnaB protein (9Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus establishing the elongation phase of DNA replication. The correlation of domains of DnaA protein to its various functions is rudimentary. By comparative analysis of homologs of the dnaA gene from phylogenetically diverse microbes, sequence conservation of a P-loop motif, GX4GKT located at residues 172-179 (reviewed in Ref. 10Messer W.

Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In p21ras and RecA protein, corresponding residues interact with the phosphates of the bound nucleotide (12Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A.

M., and Kaguni, J. M. (1996) Mol. Microbiol. 20, in press. Together, these results implicate this region of DnaA protein in binding to ATP. The DNA-binding domain of DnaA protein has been localized to a region from residue 379 to the carboxyl terminus (17Roth A. Messer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2106-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Other domains of DnaA protein involved in purine binding, unwinding, interaction with DnaB protein (8Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or interaction with phospholipids that displace the bound nucleotide (18Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7202-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) are unknown. To correlate domains of DnaA protein to its various functions, a collection of monoclonal antibodies were produced and characterized biochemically. Reported here, some antibodies inhibit replication of plasmids containing oriC but not of an M13 derivative containing a DnaA protein-binding site in a proposed hairpin structure (19Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Priming of DNA replication in vitro on the latter template, termed ABC priming, involves assembly of an intermediate formed on the single-stranded DNA that is dependent on DnaA protein. These results suggest that a subset of DnaA protein functions are required for ABC priming compared to those involved in replication of oriC plasmids. The region of DnaA protein bound by M7 antibody that interferes with the interaction between DnaA and DnaB protein (8Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been identified. Presumably, a domain in this region interacts directly with DnaB protein. Results with a third class of antibodies suggest that DnaA protein may act at a later step in the initiation process, perhaps through interaction with subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Reagents, commercial enzymes, and highly purified replication proteins were as described (8Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Libraries of recombinant plasmids, each of which expressed a fusion protein of T7 gene 10 protein joined to a small peptide derived from DnaA protein, were constructed essentially as recommended by Novagen. To construct a library, the dnaA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, treated with DNase I in the presence of Mn2+, and fragments of 50-150 base pairs in size were purified from an agarose gel. The DNA fragments were then treated successively with T4 DNA polymerase and Tth DNA polymerase to repair and then add a single dA residue to the 3′-end of each fragment. This was followed by ligation to linearized pTOPE-1b with a single dT residue at each 3′-end, and transformation into HMS174 (λ DE3). Both the linearized vector and the competent cells were obtained from Novagen. Colonies transferred to nitrocellulose filters were lysed with chloroform vapor, and the filters were placed on Whatman 3MM paper saturated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 M urea, and 0.5 M NaCl. Positive clones were then identified by immunoblot analysis with the monoclonal antibody of interest. Detection of antibody-antigen complexes was with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). After color development, the filters were aligned to corresponding original plates, and positive clones were colony purified and verified as immunoreactive by the above method. Plasmid DNA, isolated by an alkaline lysis procedure, was sequenced by the enzymatic method with primers that flank the site of insertion in the vector. The epitope was deduced by comparative analysis of the DNA sequences of inserts. The dnaA+ gene and an ochre mutant at codon 148 contained in pACYC184 were from this laboratory. 3M. D. Sutton and J.

Whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspension of 108 cells of the plasmid-bearing strains (Sup−) collected at mid-log phase in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. DnaA protein, transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), was detected by immunoblot analysis with A22, M7, and M48 as primary antibodies and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody. An ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham) was used to detect antibody-antigen complexes. Fragment retention assays (25 µl) (15Hwang D.S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained 6 ng of a 459-base pair SalI-XhoI fragment containing oriC from pTSO182 DNA (22Oka A. Sugimoto K. Takanami M. Hirota Y. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and 100 ng of HinfI-digested pBR322 DNA as a nonradioactive competitor in buffer containing 40 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 50 mM KCl. 3′ end-labeling of the oriC fragment was performed with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP. Monoclonal antibodies were added, as indicated (160-250 ng), to reactions prior to DnaA protein (80 ng) and DNA to measure their effect on DNA binding activity. Following incubation at 30°C for 10 min, the reactions were filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore HAWP, 0.22 µm, 24 mm) and washed with 250 µl of the above buffer equilibrated at room temperature essentially as described (15Hwang D.S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity retained on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Gel mobility shift assays (23Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 24Garner M.M. Revzin A.

Monoclonal antibodies were added before DnaA protein and DNA. After incubation at 30°C for 10 min, the samples were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel in 90 mM Tris borate and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. Reactions (25 µl) were performed essentially as described (11Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and contained DnaA protein (2 pmol), an equimolar amount of the indicated monoclonal antibody, and 5 mM DTT, 15% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Incubation was for 15 min on ice. After addition of [α-32P]ATP (0.5 µCi) to 0.2 µM, incubation was continued at 0°C for 10 min followed by filtration through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore HAWP, 0.22 µm, 13 mm). The filters were then washed with 500 µl of the above buffer at room temperature. Radioactive ATP retained by the filters was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Assays (25 µl) of ABC priming with M13-A site single-stranded DNA or of oriC replication (primase-primed) with M13oriC2LB5 DNA were performed as described (8Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaA protein was preincubated with the indicated antibody in 40 mM HEPES pH 8, 40 mM potassium glutamate, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 4% sucrose, and 4 mM DTT for 10 min on ice. Replication proteins for ABC priming were then added to measure DNA synthesis activity of DnaA protein as described (8Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One stage reactions (25 µl) contained 40 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% (w/v) sucrose, 2 mM ATP unless otherwise indicated, 4 mM DTT, 11 mM magnesium acetate, 200 ng of M13oriC2LB5 supercoiled DNA, 21 ng of HU protein, 160 ng of single-stranded DNA-binding protein, 100 ng of DnaB protein, 24 ng of DnaC protein, 500 ng of gyrase A subunit, 1 µg of gyrase B subunit, and 60 ng of DnaA protein. Monoclonal antibodies were added before DnaA protein to measure their effect. Incubation was at 30°C for 25 min unless noted otherwise. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS to 2.5% and EDTA to 10 mM. The samples were electrophoresed at 25 V for 18 h in 1% agarose gels in 90 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mM EDTA, then stained with ethidium bromide. Two-stage reactions (25 µl) were performed essentially as described (25Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and contained 30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 0.4 mg/ml BSA, 20% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, 6 mM CaCl2, 0.4 mM ATP, 80 ng of M13oriC2LB5 DNA, and the above amounts of proteins. The indicated monoclonal antibodies were added before DnaA protein. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30°C for the first stage, then placed on ice followed by addition of 500 ng of gyrase A subunit, 1 µg of gyrase B subunit, magnesium acetate to 10 mM, and ATP to 2 mM. Incubation followed for 10 min at 24°C for the second stage. Na2EDTA to 50 mM and SDS to 2.5% were added and electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels was as described above. DnaA protein (0.5 µg/well) or BSA (10 µg/well, Fig. 7A) were added to 96-well microtiter trays (Nunc-Immuno Plate, Maxisorp, Inter-Med) in 50 µl of buffer containing 0.137 M NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.76 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3 (phosphate-buffered saline). Subsequent steps were performed as described (8Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After removing unbound DnaA protein, the indicated monoclonal antibody diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% BSA was added then incubated for 1 h. DnaB protein (except where noted, 30 ng in 50 µl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% BSA) was added and incubated for 15 min. Glutaraldehyde (2 µl of a 2.5% solution in water) was added followed by incubation for 30 min. The wells were then washed as described (8Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to remove unbound protein. Retained DnaB protein was detected with rabbit antiserum specific for DnaB protein. Colorimetric detection was as described (8Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To correlate domains of DnaA protein to its various functions, a collection of monoclonal antibodies were produced. Epitopes recognized by each were then determined with a peptide library constructed by joining of random segments (50-150 base pairs) of the dnaA coding region to T7 gene 10. Expression was dependent on the T7 RNA polymerase gene under lacUV5 promoter control. Transformants (2-5 × 103 per antibody) were replica-plated onto nitrocellulose filters, lysed with chloroform vapor, then screened to identify immunoreactive clones. The portion of DnaA protein in the fusion protein was deduced by DNA sequence analysis of inserts in recombinant plasmids. In addition, transformants recognized by one antibody were tested for reactivity with other appropriate antibodies. For example, transformants bound by A3 were also found to react with M100 (Table I). Similarly, M12 bound to transformants identified by M36 as well as the converse. Clone 7 was obtained by its immunoreactivity to a monoclonal antibody not described here and was characterized early in this work. Transformants of clone 7 were bound by several antibodies (M85, M48, M43, M10, and M1). For simplicity, the immunoreactivity of antibodies to various recombinants lists those that were useful in defining the minimal epitope (Table I). This approach is designed to identify continuous or primary epitopes and not conformational epitopes. It also assumes that amino acid residues of T7 gene 10 protein do not contribute to the epitope.Table I.Deduced epitopes of monoclonal antibodies to DnaA proteinMonoclonal antibodyImmunoreactive cloneaThe nomenclature of an immunoreactive transformant correlates with the antibody that originally identified it.Deduced amino acid sequence (as residues of DnaA protein)Deduced epitopebDeduced epitopes are indicated relative to the primary amino acid sequence of DnaA protein.M36-3111-148M36M48-4111-146125-146cAmino acids from residues 125-146 are EPTYRSNVNVKHTFDNFVEGKS, from 104 to 114 are TQPQRAAPSTR, and from 86 to 98 are TPQAAVTSNVAAP.M48-5125-148M48-4111-146M12M48-5125-148125-146M36-3111-148M85-1120-154M85M85-3101-144133-138M85-12133-138Clone 7133-147M48-4111-146M48M48-5125-148133-146Clone 7133-147M43M43-1131-146M43-3131-146133-141M43-4111-141Clone 7133-147M10M10-5237-245133-142M10-6113-146M10-7120-142Clone 7133-147M1M48-4111-146133-146M48-5125-148Clone 7133-147A3A3-184-114A3-294-117104-114M100-4104-119M100M100-4104-119110-114M100-6110-130M100-9101-126M100-11110-127A3-184-114A3-294-117M60M60-286-9886-98M60-386-98M60-570-100M60-676-112M7M36-3111-148111-148a The nomenclature of an immunoreactive transformant correlates with the antibody that originally identified it.b Deduced epitopes are indicated relative to the primary amino acid sequence of DnaA protein.c Amino acids from residues 125-146 are EPTYRSNVNVKHTFDNFVEGKS, from 104 to 114 are TQPQRAAPSTR, and from 86 to 98 are TPQAAVTSNVAAP. Open table in a new tab Positive clones were obtained with most monoclonal antibodies except for M1, M12, A22, and M7. Immunoreactive clones for M1 and M12 were not obtained presumably due to weak binding. These antibodies yielded a weaker colorimetric response on binding to reactive transformants (see Table I) originally identified by M48 or M36 (data not shown). Immunoblot experiments indicated that A22, M7, and M48 were immunoreactive to full-length DnaA protein of 52 kDa (Fig. 1). However, A22 was not reactive to transformants of Table I that expressed fusion proteins of T7 gene 10 and portions of the dnaA gene (data not shown). M7 was only reactive to the transformant containing plasmid M36-3. No positive clones for A22 were identified after screening over 2 × 104 transformants. By comparison, about 2 positive clones were obtained for each 103 transformants screened with antibodies that appear to recognize linear epitopes, generally considered to be composed of 4-8 amino acids (26Pinilla C. Appel J.R. Houghten R.A. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Appel J.R. Pinilla C. Niman H. Houghten R. J.

Based on this reasoning, about 40 positive clones should have been detected with A22 if it recognized a linear epitope. As recombinant plasmids were constructed to contain 50-150 base pairs of the dnaA gene, this result suggests that the epitope recognized by A22 resides in a larger region and may be conformational. Alternatively, the epitope in the fusion protein may have had a negative effect on bacterial growth to result in the failure to obtain such clones. A collection of nonsense mutants of the dnaA gene have been obtained.3 In a nonsuppressing strain, one encodes a truncated polypeptide of 147 amino acids, established as an ochre mutant by DNA sequence analysis and confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis relative to molecular weight standards. To localize the portion of DnaA protein bound by A22 and M7, immunoblot analysis was performed with a nonsuppressing strain bearing this plasmid-encoded mutant (Fig. 1) as well as other mutants with nonsense codons more distally located (data not shown). As a control, M48, whose epitope is from residues 133 to 146 (Table I), recognized the 147 residue long ochre peptide (Fig. 1) and other nonsense polypeptides (data not shown). The ochre peptide (Fig. 1) and longer nonsense polypeptides (data not shown) were also bound by M7 and A22. However, the response with M7 to the ochre peptide was less than to the full-length gene product (Fig. 1). This result suggests that the epitope recognized by M7 is not entirely in the ochre peptide, or that its conformation after transfer resulted in lesser binding. We believe that the weaker signal with chromosomally-encoded DnaA protein bound by M7 or A22 compared to M48 (right lane of each set of Fig. 1) is due to binding of M7 and A22 to conformational instead of linear epitopes. Indeed, poor reactivity of a monoclonal antibody to its antigen in Western blots is often interpreted to signify that the antibody binds to a conformational epitope. By comparison, all three antibodies bound comparably to immobilized DnaA protein by ELISA (data not shown). Poor renaturation of the conformational epitopes bound by M7 and A22 may have resulted in a weak signal with the chromosomally-encoded protein. The signal was much greater with purified or plasmid-encoded protein because of their higher levels. Whereas these results suggest that the epitopes recognized by A22 and M7 are conformational and in the amino-terminal region of DnaA protein, they are not identical. First, the response with A22 to the ochre peptide was greater than that with M7 (Fig. 1). Second, M7 bound by immunoblotting to the fusion protein encoded by plasmid M36-3 (encoding residues 111-148 of DnaA protein, Table I), whereas A22 did not (data not shown). M7 and A22 also bound to a polypeptide encoded by an in-frame deletion mutant (data not shown) that lacks amino acids 220 through 294. 4J. Lipar and J. Kaguni, unpublished results. By comparison, neither antibody was immunoreactive to transformants containing plasmid M85-12 (encoding a fusion protein containing residues 118-138 of DnaA protein), M48-5 (residues 125-148), clone 7 (residues 133-147), M10-5 (residues 237-245), M10-6 (residues 113-146), M10-7 (residues 120-142), M60-2 (residues 86-98), or M60-6 (residues 76-112). The lack of immunoreactivity to these recombinants suggests that the epitope recognized by M7 and contained in plasmid M36-3 is within residues 111-148. The epitope recognized by A22 appears to be within the first 147 residues. Filter binding assays (see “Experimental Procedures”) with a labeled restriction fragment containing the oriC sequence revealed that none substantially reduced DNA binding (data not shown, summarized in Table III). At a saturating level of DnaA protein (80 ng) and in the absence of antibody, about 5.2 ng of the 6 ng of oriC fragment was retained. Reactions containing antibodies resulted in retention of 4.8-5.9 ng of DNA. The failure to detect inhibition of DNA binding activity was regardless of the order of addition of DnaA protein, and antibody.Table III.Summary of the linear epitopes and their inhibitory effects of monoclonal antibodies to DnaA proteinMonoclonal antibodyaThe monoclonal antibodies were classified by an ELISA method with preparations of goat antimouse antibody that were specific for each immunoglobulin subclass.Epitope (amino acid position)oriC replicationABC primingF1* formationDNA bindingATP bindingM36, IgG2B125-146−b−, not inhibitory or marginally inhibitory; +, inhibitory; ++, strongly inhibitory.−−−−M12, IgG1125-146−−−−−M85, IgG2B133-138−−−−−M48, IgG1133-146−−−−−M43, IgG1133-141−−−−−M10, IgG3133-142−−−−−A3, IgG1104-114+−+−−M100, IgG1110-114+−+−−M7, IgG2AConformational++++++−−A22, IgG1Conformational+++++−−M1, IgG3133-146+−−−−M60, IgG386-98+−−−−a The monoclonal antibodies were classified by an ELISA method with preparations of goat antimouse antibody that were specific for each immunoglobulin subclass.b −, not inhibitory or marginally inhibitory; +, inhibitory; ++, strongly inhibitory.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) were also performed with a restriction digest of an oriC-containing plasmid. Addition of M100, M85, and A3 (as well as the remaining antibodies, not shown) did not affect the DNA binding activity of DnaA protein (Fig. 2). Under these experimental conditions, the oriC fragment did not migrate as a discrete complex when bound by DnaA protein. Binding was inferred by the reduction in the level of unbound oriC fragment. DnaA protein binds ATP with high affinity (KD ~ 0.03 µM) (11Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Bound to ATP, DnaA protein is active in DNA replication. Comparative sequence analysis revealed at residues 172-179 a conserved P-loop motif (GX4GKT) that is found in many nucleotide-binding proteins (30Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The effect of monoclonal antibodies on ATP binding was examined to determine if any were inhibitory. However, none were found to reduce ATP binding activity by greater than 15% under conditions in which 0.3 ATP was bound per monomer of DnaA protein (summarized in Table III). Six monoclonal antibodies inhibited DNA replication of an oriC-containing plasmid (Fig. 3). M7 and A22 inhibited to near background levels at a ratio of 2 DnaA protein molecules per antibody molecule (Fig. 3). By comparison, inhibition by M1, A3, M100, and M60 antibodies required higher levels. The remaining antibodies were not inhibitory (data not shown). As the inhibitory antibodies did not appear to interfere with binding to DNA or ATP (summarized in Table III), inhibition of replication activity was for another cause. The monoclonal antibodies were also tested for inhibition of ABC priming (Fig. 4). This assay measures the replication activity of DnaA protein with a single-stranded M13 derivative harboring a DnaA box in a proposed hairpin structure (19Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA synthesis also requires single-stranded DNA-binding protein, DnaB, and DnaC proteins, primase, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. By contrast to the antibodies that inhibited oriC replication (Fig. 3), only M7 and A22 inhibited ABC priming substantially (Fig. 4). Other antibodies were not inhibitory or only slightly inhibitory. Previous studies showed that M7 interfered with the interaction between DnaA protein and DnaB protein from the DnaB-DnaC complex only if M7 was added first (8Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A22 may inhibit ABC priming by a similar mechanism as inhibition was dependent"

The expression of syndecan-1 is modified during development, carcinogenesis, and tissue regeneration. During cutaneous wound healing, syndecan-1 expression is transiently induced in newly-formed capillaries of granulation tissue as well as in proliferating keratinocytes. To study the mechanisms underlying this regulation we investigated the effects of several growth factors/cytokines on syndecan-1 expression in two human cell lines: EA.hy 926 endothelial cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. None of these factors significantly altered syndecan-1 mRNA expression in cultured keratinocytes, but when given to endothelial cells, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) specifically and dose-dependently suppressed syndecan-1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. TNF-α reduced the amount of syndecan-1 protein in EA.hy 926 cells in both the presence and absence of serum and, at the same time, induced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The suppressive effect of TNF-α on endothelial syndecan-1 expression was reproducible in in vivo experiments in which TNF-α-coated beads were administered directly to healing skin wounds of mice. Data supporting these findings were further obtained by injecting TNF-α into an experimental rat granulation tissue model. In this tissue TNF-α suppressed syndecan-1 mRNA expression by approximately 80%. These results indicate that TNF-α is capable of down-regulating syndecan-1 expression in endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo and suggest that similar mechanisms may be responsible for the changes in syndecan-1 expression observed during various regenerative, developmental, and malignant processes.

Normal cutaneous wound healing requires collaboration between and within several cell types including fibroblasts, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages. This interplay is based on paracrine, juxtacrine, and autocrine signaling mediated by growth factors and their receptors as well as on the mechanisms by which cells detect and regulate changes in adhesion. Many of the same mechanisms also participate in creating new tissues during embryogenesis. Furthermore, some of these molecular events are believed to be excessive or unrestricted during tumorigenesis. One class of molecules that has been suggested to regulate both the growth factor responses and the adhesion of cells is the family of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans named syndecans (1Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 2Elenius K. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2975-2982PubMed Google Scholar). The members of this family (currently syndecans 1-4) consist of short conserved cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains and long dissimilar ectodomains carrying variable numbers of glycosaminoglycan side chains. The predominant glycosaminoglycan type in all syndecans is heparan sulfate, but at least in the case of syndecan-1 a hybrid form bearing both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains also exists (3Rapraeger A. Jalkanen M. Endo E. Koda J. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11046-11052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first and at the moment the best characterized syndecan is syndecan-1 (4Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 has been shown to bind via its heparan sulfate side chains to many extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin (5Saunders S. Bernfield M. J.

Thus, syndecan-1 putatively has a function both in anchoring cells to surrounding extracellular matrix (possibly in concert with integrin-type matrix receptors) and as a growth factor co-receptor influencing activation of various receptor tyrosine kinases (1Bernfield M.

Furthermore, syndecan-like heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed at the surface of endothelial cells have been suggested to have a role in regulating leukocyte endothelium interactions (22Tanaka Y.

In normal mature tissues syndecan-1 is expressed with few exceptions only in epithelia (24Hayashi K. Hayashi M. Jalkanen M. Firestone J.H. Trelstad R.L. Bernfield M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, during various regenerative and developmental states syndecan-1 expression is regulated both at transcriptional and posttranslational levels. For example, syndecan-1 expression is transiently induced in condensing mesenchymes during organogenesis (25Vainio S. Jalkanen M. Thesleff I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1945-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26Vainio S. Jalkanen M. Bernfield M. Saxen L. Dev. Biol. 1992; 152: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and in proliferating keratinocytes and endothelial cells during wound healing (27Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). During malignant conversion of epithelial cells, on the other hand, syndecan-1 expression is usually suppressed (28Inki P. Stenbäck F. Talve L. Jalkanen M. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 1333-1340PubMed Google Scholar, 29Leppä S. Mali M. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This, together with transfection studies in which overexpression of syndecan-1 has been shown to result in down-regulation of growth factor responses (31Mali M. Elenius K. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24215-24222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mali M. Andtfolk H. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27795-27798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has lead to a hypothesis that enhanced syndecan-1 expression is associated with “normal” nonmalignant proliferation and provides the cells a way to restrict excessive growth. Thus, transformed cells with suppressed syndecan-1 synthesis could have lost a molecule important for down-regulating proliferation. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate syndecan-1 expression we studied the effect of different growth factors/cytokines on syndecan-1 expression in two cell types that alter their syndecan-1 expression in response to wounding, i.e. keratinocytes and endothelial cells. Here we report that TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine produced in wound tissue by macrophages (33Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), specifically and dose-dependently reduces endothelial syndecan-1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. We speculate i) that cell type-specific regulation of syndecan-1 expression by locally available cytokines may prevail during various in vivo processes and ii) that some of the known effects of TNF-α on endothelial cells or angiogenesis could be influenced by its effects on syndecan-1 expression. EA.hy 926 human endothelial cells (34Emeis J.J. Edgell C.J. Blood. 1988; 71: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Inc.), HAT (12 µg/ml hypoxanthine, 1 µg/ml aminopterin, 8 µg/ml thymidine; Sigma), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (50 µg/ml). Fresh medium was changed every third day. HaCaT human keratinocytes (35Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar) were cultured similarly but without HAT supplement. For RNA isolation, cells were plated at equal density on culture dishes and grown to 70-80% confluence. Twenty-four h before the addition of the growth factor(s), fresh medium with or without FBS was changed. Equally treated cultures without growth factors served as negative controls. Human TNF-α (Peprotech) was used at final concentrations of 5, 25, and 50 ng/ml. FGF-7 (Peprotech), FGF-2 (Peprotech and Boehringer Mannheim), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β; all from Boehringer Mannheim) were used at concentrations of 50 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 5 IU/ml, 1,000 IU/ml and 20 ng/ml, respectively, in all experiments. For cell number estimation, the media were removed, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.5 mM EDTA. Cells were scraped with a rubber policeman. The nuclei were counted with Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics). Total cellular RNA was isolated using 4 M guanidine isothiocyanate and cesium chloride density centrifugation (36Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). RNA samples were size-separated on 1% agarose formaldehyde gels and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont NEN). Filters were hybridized with a multiprime (Amersham Corp.) labeled 921-base pair PstI fragment of a partial human syndecan-1 cDNA clone, hsyn4 (37Mali M. Jaakkola P. Arvilommi A.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6884-6889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or 1.0-kilobase pair HindII fragment of a partial mouse syndecan-1 cDNA clone, PM-4 (4Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The probes were used to detect human and rat syndecan-1 mRNAs, respectively. The filters were washed at 65°C in 2 × SSC, 1.0% SDS (both probes) followed by a wash at 37°C in 0.1 × SSC, 1.0% SDS (for human probe only). Hybridization signals were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using a microcomputer image analyzer (MCID-M4; Imaging Research). For rehybridization with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Ref. 38Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar), bound syndecan-1 probe was removed as advised by the manufacturer of the membrane. Nearly confluent EA.hy 926 cells were labeled for 24 h in sulfate-free DMEM with 100 µCi/ml of carrier-free 35SO4 in the presence or absence of 10% FBS before growth factor addition. Growth factors were added to final concentrations as described above. After growth factor incubation, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and treated for 10 min on ice with extraction buffer (PBS, 0.5 mM KCl, 2% Triton X-100, and 1 mM PMSF), scraped with a rubber policeman, and transferred to microfuge tubes. Samples were centrifuged, and aliquots of supernatants containing equal amounts of total protein were precleared by incubation with Sepharose CL-4B and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against human syndecan-1, anti-P117 (39Inki P. Larjava H. Haapasalmi K. Miettinen H.M. Grenman R. Jalkanen M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar), coupled to Sepharose CL-4B. Samples were washed with 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4, and run on either 0.75% agarose or 3.75-15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. For immunocytochemistry EA.hy 926 cells were plated on coverslips 1-2 days before growth factor addition. TNF-α was added to a final concentration of 5 or 25 ng/ml 24 h before immunostaining. To visualize cell surface ICAM-1 expression, cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with a mouse monoclonal antibody against human ICAM-1 (5C3; Ref. 40Airas L. Salmi M. Jalkanen S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4228-4238PubMed Google Scholar) in DMEM, 10% FBS. Unbound antibody was washed with PBS, and primary antibody was detected with tetramethyl-rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dakopatts). Cells were fixed with methanol and mounted. For negative controls, cells were stained similarly with a mouse monoclonal antibody against human cytokeratin (Dakopatts). For immunohistochemistry of wounded tissue, both frozen and paraffin sections were made. One half of each wound tissue sample was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded into paraffin. The other half was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and subsequently processed to frozen sections (30Inki P. Joensuu H. Grenman R. Klemi P. Jalkanen M. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 70: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This was found necessary because the ICAM-1 antibody used (CRL 1878; ATCC) detected its antigen only in frozen sections, but the morphology of the tissue as well as the cell type-specific distribution of syndecan-1 antibody (281-2) was better restored in paraffin sections. Five-µm sections were immunostained using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) technique (41Hsu S.M. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13453) Google Scholar), as described previously for paraffin sections (27Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and cryosections (30Inki P. Joensuu H. Grenman R. Klemi P. Jalkanen M. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 70: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: a rat monoclonal antibody against mouse syndecan-1 ectodomain (281-2; Ref. 42Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), a rat monoclonal antibody against mouse ICAM-1 (CRL 1878; ATCC) and a rat monoclonal antibody against mouse L-selectin (MEL-14; Ref. 43Gallatin W.M. Weissman I.L. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1983; 304: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar; negative control). The staining pattern of primary antibodies was visualized using Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories). Cells cultured on 24-well plates were labeled for 24 h in 400 µl of sulfate-free medium supplemented with 100 µCi/ml 35SO4 in either the presence or absence of 25 ng/ml TNF-α. After removal of the medium, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated on ice for 10 min in PBS containing 0.5 mM EDTA. Cells were detached from culture dishes with a rubber policeman and washed twice by centrifugation and resuspension in cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 2 mM p-aminobenzamidine, 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide, and 5 mM EDTA). The washed cells were suspended in 1 ml of PBS, 20 µg/ml trypsin and incubated for 15 min on an ice bath, after which cells were centrifuged and the supernatants containing trypsin sensitive cell surface proteoglycans (44Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4103-4109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were removed and stored at −20°C. The pellets containing EA.hy 926 cells were further resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, 0.5 M KCl, 1% Triton X-100, and after centrifugation, supernatants were stored at −20°C. One-fourth of the total volume of medium and of trypsin- and Triton-released samples was transferred to cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)-impregnated filters to quantitate the amount of activity residing in sulfate-labeled proteoglycans (44Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4103-4109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The filters were washed with distilled water, 10% trichloroacetic acid, and 95% ethanol. The radioactivity in filters was estimated using a liquid scintillation counter. To expose healing wounds to exogenous growth factors we implanted coated agarose beads locally into the wounded skin of mice. These beads have previously been shown to slowly release growth factors when implanted to embryonic tissues (45Hayamizu T.F. Sessions S.K. Wanek N. Bryant S.V. Dev. Biol. 1991; 145: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 46Vogel A. Tickle C. Development. 1993; 119: 199-206PubMed Google Scholar). Ten µl of Affi-Gel blue agarose beads (100-200-mesh, 75-150-µm diameter; Bio-Rad) were washed once with PBS and pelleted. Beads were then coated by an incubation with 100 ng/µl of TNF-α or FGF-2 in PBS in a total volume of 5 µl for 30 min at 37°C. Beads incubated with PBS only were used as negative controls. After incubation the total volume was increased to 100 µl with PBS, and one-third of this final volume was injected to each of the three mice studied for each treatment. To prepare the wounds, 5-mm full-thickness incisions were made vertically on the back skin of CO2 anesthetized 3-month-old male BALB/c mice. After operation, the mice were housed individually in cages. Two days after wounding, freshly coated agarose beads were injected into the granulation tissue area under the scab. Two days after injection, mice were sacrificed. Wound tissue was excised and bisected horizontally across the center of the wound to prepare both paraffin and frozen sections from the same tissue for subsequent immunostainings (described above). To quantitate the effects of bead treatments, morphologically distinct blood vessels over 50 µm in diameter showing positive or negative immunostaining were counted from the area of affected dermis (dermis below hypertrophic epidermis). To study the effect of exogenous TNF-α on syndecan-1 mRNA expression in granulation tissue, a standardized experimental wound model was used (47Niinikoski J. Heughan C. Hunt T. Surg. Gynecol. & Obstet. 1971; 133: 1003-1007PubMed Google Scholar). Viscose cellulose sponge (Säteri OY) was cut into cylindrical pieces with a 3 mm-diameter tunnel through the center. Silicone rubber discs were stitched onto both ends of the sponge to create a dead space. After decontamination by boiling, the cylinders were implanted subcutaneously under the back skin of male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with ether. Fifty or 200 ng of TNF-α in 50 µl of PBS was injected into the central tunnels of the cylinders. The injections were repeated daily for 7 days. The control group was injected similarly with PBS or with prostaglandin E2 (Sigma). Rats were sacrificed 7 days after implantation, and the cylinders were dissected from surrounding tissues and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Material was stored at −70°C until used for RNA extraction. In the Northern hybridizations the 1.0-kilobase pair HindII fragment of a mouse syndecan-1 cDNA clone, PM-4 (4Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), was used. We have previously shown that syndecan-1 expression is transiently induced in newly synthesized capillaries as well as in proliferating keratinocytes during wound healing in mice (27Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The expression is both stimulated and subsequently down-regulated in a strictly coordinated manner. Concurrently with these phenomena, a large array of growth factors is released from several sources including recruited macrophages; damaged or activated endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts; and storage sites in extracellular matrix. To explore the molecular mechanisms leading to the regulation of syndecan-1 expression, several growth factors suggested to be involved during the inflammatory and proliferative phases of wound healing were tested for their capability to alter syndecan-1 expression in two human cell lines, EA.hy 926 endothelial cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. When applied to endothelial cells, IFN-γ, FGF-2, IL-1β, TGF-β, and FGF-7 were not found to have any significant effect on syndecan-1 mRNA expression as analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 1). In contrast, TNF-α was shown to dose-dependently down-regulate syndecan-1 mRNA steady state level (Fig. 2A). The effect was already seen at a TNF-α concentration of 5 ng/ml and was further enhanced by increasing the amount to 25 and 50 ng/ml (Fig. 2A). None of the cytokines tested, including TNF-α, had an influence on syndecan-1 expression in Northern analysis of HaCaT keratinocytes (Fig. 1, Fig. 2A), indicating that the regulation needs specific mechanisms characteristic of endothelial cells.Fig. 2The effect of TNF-α on syndecan-1 mRNA expression in EA.hy 926 and HaCaT cells. A, cells were cultured for 24 h in medium containing 10% FBS and the indicated concentrations of TNF-α. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis using human syndecan-1- and GAPDH-specific probes. Ten µg of total RNA was loaded on each lane. Independent autoradiograms containing EA.hy 926 and HaCaT cell-derived material are shown. B, cells were grown in medium containing 10% FBS plus 25 ng/ml of TNF-α. Total RNA was isolated at the indicated time points and used for Northern blot analysis with human syndecan-1- and GAPDH-specific probes. The syndecan-1 signals were quantitated by densitometry and normalized according to the GAPDH signals. The control value obtained from cells not treated with TNF-α is expressed as 100%. The mean obtained by quantitating four independent filters is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the time dependence of the effect of TNF-α on endothelial syndecan-1 mRNA expression, total RNAs were isolated from EA.hy 926 cells exposed to 25 ng/ml of TNF-α for various periods indicated in Fig. 2B. The signals from Northern blot filters hybridized with a human syndecan-1-specific cDNA probe were quantitated by autoradiography and densitometry. A suppression by approximately one-half was observed already at 6 h after the beginning of TNF-α treatment, and the effect was maximal (~70% inhibition) at 10-12 h (Fig. 2B). The suppression was reversible at later time points (48-72 h). Comparable results were observed at the protein level by immunoprecipitation using the anti-P117 polyclonal antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of human syndecan-1 (39Inki P. Larjava H. Haapasalmi K. Miettinen H.M. Grenman R. Jalkanen M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfate-labeled cell-associated material was isolated from EA.hy 926 cells 24 h after the addition of different amounts of TNF-α. To estimate the quantitative changes of cell-associated syndecan-1, the immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed on 0.75% agarose gels (Fig. 3A). While 5 ng/ml of TNF-α was enough to clearly diminish cell-associated syndecan-1 expression (by ~50%), 25 ng/ml caused the maximal reduction (~90% in the presence of FBS; Fig. 3A). The possible influence of serum components was analyzed by carrying out the experiments both after a 24-h starvation in a serum-free medium and in normal medium containing 10% FBS. The effect was found not to be qualitatively dependent on the starvation but was stronger in the presence of serum (Fig. 3A). Quantitatively similar results were obtained by using 3.75-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in which immunoprecipitated syndecan-1 migrated as a broad smear at ~300 kDa (data not shown). These results were due to a suppression of total syndecan-1 protein synthesis and not enhanced transport and shedding of syndecan-1 from the cell surface, since similar suppression was observed by analyzing the amount of syndecan-1 ectodomain released from the cell surface by trypsin treatment or shed to the conditioned medium with a monoclonal antibody 2M. Jalkanen, unpublished observations. detecting the ectodomain of human syndecan-1 (data not shown). The time course of the effect of TNF-α on the expression of syndecan-1 was also studied at the protein level by preparing cell lysates from EA.hy 926 cells at various time points after TNF-α (25 ng/ml) addition and analyzing them by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B). The amount of cell-associated syndecan-1 was found to be maximally decreased (to one-tenth) 24 h after TNF-α treatment (Fig. 3B). After 48 and 72 h the amount of cell surface syndecan-1 was usually close to or marginally beyond the control level (Fig. 3B). The amount of cell-associated syndecan-1 remained unchanged 0.5, 2, or 6 h after TNF-α t"
https://openalex.org/W2007990425,"Treatment of cells with the DNA-alkylating agent N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) induces expression of the endogenous mammalian DNA polymerase β (β-pol) gene and of the cloned promoter in transient expression studies. The lone cAMP response element (CRE) in the core promoter, along with functional protein kinase A, is critical for the MNNG-induced up-regulation. Recently, we described a kinetic mechanism for transcriptional regulation of the β-pol promoter in vitro and found that CRE-binding protein (CREB) from MNNG-treated cells differentially up-regulates the promoter by stimulating formation of closed preinitiation complex (RPc). Here, using a CRE-dependent chimeric β-pol promoter, we purified the RPc assembled with nuclear extract from MNNG-treated and control HeLa cells. Comparison of proteins in the purified RPc samples revealed that the MNNG induction is associated with a strong increase in the Ser133-phosphorylated form of recombinant CREB (CREB-1). CREB depletion of the nuclear extracts diminished transcriptional activity, and addition of purified Ser133-phosphorylated CREB-1 restored activity, whereas unphosphorylated CREB-1 did not. Addition of phosphorylated CREB-1 to the control cell extract mimicked the MNNG-induced up-regulation of transcriptional activity. These results indicate that phosphorylation of CREB-1 is the probable mechanism of activation of the β-pol promoter after treatment of cells with the DNA-alkylating agent MNNG.

Embryonic mouse fibroblasts with a homozygous β-pol gene deletion are deficient in base excision repair activity and are hypersensitive to monofunctional DNA-alkylating agents (6Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kühn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The core promoters of the human, bovine, and rodent β-pol genes have been described (7Widen S.G. Kedar P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16992-16998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsuoka S. Takahashi T. Matsukage A. Eur. J.

These cloned β-pol promoters lack typical TATA and CCAAT elements, are G+C-rich, and have distinct binding elements for Sp1 and activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP response element-binding protein, referred to as CREB throughout. The CRE site in the β-pol promoters is required for full promoter activity (7Widen S.G. Kedar P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16992-16998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a purified CREB from bovine testis binds specifically to the conserved CRE site of the β-pol promoters and stimulates promoter activity in vitro (7Widen S.G. Kedar P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16992-16998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Narayan S. Widen S.G. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12755-12763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human and bovine β-pol promoters also are known to have a functional binding element for the YY1 family of initiation site binding proteins (11He F. Narayan S. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).β-Pol gene expression is induced after exposure of cells to the DNA-alkylating agent MNNG. This induction required transcription (12Fornace A.J. Zmudzka B. Hollander C. Wilson S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 851-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and use of a transfected β-pol core promoter fusion gene revealed transcriptional up-regulation of the β-pol promoter after MNNG treatment. This response is mediated through the CRE of the β-pol promoter (13Kedar P.S. Widen S.G. Englander E.W. Fornace A.J. Wilson S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3729-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and up-regulation of promoter activity is dependent upon the protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway (14Englander E.W. Wilson S.H. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Englander E.W. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Using an in vitro transcription assay system, we found that the rate of transcript formation from a chimeric human β-pol promoter was much higher with nuclear extract (NE) from MNNG-treated HeLa cells than with extract from control HeLa cells. Further results indicated that this up-regulation was dependent upon CREB. The role of CREB from normal and MNNG-treated cells on the transcription initiation process has been described; CREB from MNNG-treated cells supports recruitment of more RPc than CREB from control cells (16Narayan S. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The present investigation was conducted to isolate RPc assembled from control and MNNG-treated HeLa cells and to characterize the CREB family member(s) present and its possible modification as a function of cellular MNNG treatment.DISCUSSIONThe present study describes characterization of a CREB family member that is involved in β-pol gene regulation, as well as a mechanism for transcriptional activation of β-pol gene expression by an alkylating agent in vivo. Previous work, with the cloned human β-pol promoter, indicated that the PKA signal transduction pathway plays a required role in transcriptional activation after exposure of cells to MNNG (12Fornace A.J. Zmudzka B. Hollander C. Wilson S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 851-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Kedar P.S. Widen S.G. Englander E.W. Fornace A.J. Wilson S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3729-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Englander E.W. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and that the CRE site of the β-pol promoter is required for the MNNG response (15Englander E.W. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, we extended these observations using an in vitro transcription assay with HeLa NE and a chimeric β-pol promoter (10Narayan S. Widen S.G. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12755-12763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and found that NE from cells exposed to MNNG is transcriptionally more active than that from control cells. This transcriptional activation is mediated by CREB (16Narayan S. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using a kinetic model of transcriptional initiation, it was shown that CREB from MNNG-treated cells stimulates formation of more RPc than CREB from control cells. The present studies were designed to purify RPc assembled with pSH15 promoter with NE from control and MNNG-treated cells and then to characterize CREB in the two complexes. We first confirmed that the amount of RPc assembled, instead of the rate of assembly, was increased after MNNG treatment. The apparent rate of RPc assembly was not altered by MNNG treatment. Immobilized promoter DNA was used to purify RPc. A larger amount of single cycle run-off transcript was formed by purified RPc from MNNG-treated cells than from the same number of control cells, indicating that more RPc was formed from MNNG-treated cells. Purified RPc was used as starting material to characterize the CREB family members present. RPc assembled from both NEs had a 43-kDa protein, similar to CREB-1 in mass. The identity of this protein was confirmed by DNA binding analysis and Western blotting (Fig. 2). We found that the amount of CREB in RPc from MNNG-treated cells was similar to that in RPc from control cells. These results are consistent with previous findings (15Englander E.W. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Narayan S. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and suggested that a physical modification of CREB secondary to MNNG treatment may account for the transcriptional up-regulation.Phosphorylation of CREB-1 by PKA may be indispensable for CREB transcriptional activation (23Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 26Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Briggs W.H. Montminy M.R.

The phosphorylation of CREB-1 by PKA does not affect the protein's dimerization or DNA binding affinity for strong CRE sites (26Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Briggs W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, in some cases PKA phosphorylation enhances binding of CREB-1 to asymmetrical CREs, such as that in the tyrosine aminotransferase gene (TGACGCAG) (28Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Shutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar; for reviews, see Refs. 29Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr.

Pharmacol. 1994; 124: 1-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the MNNG transcriptional response is mediated through the PKA pathway (15Englander E.W. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and CREB purified from MNNG-treated cells is transcriptionally activated (16Narayan S. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to propose that the transcriptional activation is due to increased phosphorylation. We examined this possibility by metabolically labeling cells with [32P]orthophosphate and simultaneously treating them with MNNG. 32P-Labeled CREB was purified from RPc and resolved by SDS-PAGE. A 43-kDa protein identical in mass to CREB-1 was much more strongly phosphorylated after exposure of cells to MNNG than in control cells. Using an anti-phospho-CREB polyclonal antibody that is specific for the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB-1, we further confirmed that phosphorylation of NE CREB-1 at Ser133 was strongly increased by MNNG treatment.To test the functional activity of CREB and to attempt to mimic the MNNG response, we used a mixed activator approach in which PKA-phosphorylated recombinant CREB-1 was added to the NE from control cells. A very small amount of added phosphorylated CREB-1 (10 ng) (but not unphosphorylated CREB-1) was able to stimulate promoter activity. The role of phosphorylated CREB-1 in transcriptional up-regulation of the β-pol promoter was examined further with NEd. Phosphorylated CREB-1 could restore transcriptional activity of NEd, but unphosphorylated CREB-1 could not. The results indicate that exposure of cells to the alkylating agent MNNG induces phosphorylation of CREB-1, which in turn recruits more RPc onto the promoter. This effect results in a stimulation of the overall amount of transcript formation. These observations are similar to those proposed for transcriptional activation of c-Jun by phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of the transactivation domain (31Franklin C.C. Sanchez V. Wagner F. Woodgett J.R. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7247-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The importance of PKA-phosphorylated CREB-1 in vivo was described in a transgenic mouse model study by Struthers et al. (32Struthers R.S. Vale W.W. Arias C. Sawchenko P.E. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), where expression of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant CREB impaired transcriptional activation of the growth hormone gene and produced growth abnormalities. The enhanced transactivation property of phosphorylated CREB also has been examined by nuclear microinjection in fibroblasts; the results showed that phosphorylated CREB, but not unphosphorylated CREB, stimulated CREB-dependent gene expression (33Alberts A.S. Arias J. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7623-7630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation of target genes by the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB has been proposed to be due to increased association with the phospho-CREB-binding protein (CBP) (34Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Further, in transient expression studies, overexpression of CBP can stimulate cAMP-responsive promoter activity in a CREB phosphorylation-dependent manner (35Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H. Brennan R. Roberts S. Green M. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). CREB phosphorylation, however, has not always been found to mediate activation of CREB-dependent promoters. In several studies (33Alberts A.S. Arias J. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Feramisco J.R. J.

DISCUSSIONThe present study describes characterization of a CREB family member that is involved in β-pol gene regulation, as well as a mechanism for transcriptional activation of β-pol gene expression by an alkylating agent in vivo. Previous work, with the cloned human β-pol promoter, indicated that the PKA signal transduction pathway plays a required role in transcriptional activation after exposure of cells to MNNG (12Fornace A.J. Zmudzka B. Hollander C. Wilson S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 851-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Kedar P.S. Widen S.G. Englander E.W. Fornace A.J. Wilson S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and that the CRE site of the β-pol promoter is required for the MNNG response (15Englander E.W. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, we extended these observations using an in vitro transcription assay with HeLa NE and a chimeric β-pol promoter (10Narayan S. Widen S.G. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12755-12763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and found that NE from cells exposed to MNNG is transcriptionally more active than that from control cells. This transcriptional activation is mediated by CREB (16Narayan S. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using a kinetic model of transcriptional initiation, it was shown that CREB from MNNG-treated cells stimulates formation of more RPc than CREB from control cells. The present studies were designed to purify RPc assembled with pSH15 promoter with NE from control and MNNG-treated cells and then to characterize CREB in the two complexes. We first confirmed that the amount of RPc assembled, instead of the rate of assembly, was increased after MNNG treatment. The apparent rate of RPc assembly was not altered by MNNG treatment. Immobilized promoter DNA was used to purify RPc. A larger amount of single cycle run-off transcript was formed by purified RPc from MNNG-treated cells than from the same number of control cells, indicating that more RPc was formed from MNNG-treated cells. Purified RPc was used as starting material to characterize the CREB family members present. RPc assembled from both NEs had a 43-kDa protein, similar to CREB-1 in mass. The identity of this protein was confirmed by DNA binding analysis and Western blotting (Fig. 2). We found that the amount of CREB in RPc from MNNG-treated cells was similar to that in RPc from control cells. These results are consistent with previous findings (15Englander E.W. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Narayan S. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and suggested that a physical modification of CREB secondary to MNNG treatment may account for the transcriptional up-regulation.Phosphorylation of CREB-1 by PKA may be indispensable for CREB transcriptional activation (23Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 26Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Briggs W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 27Lee C.Q. Yun Y.D. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of CREB-1 by PKA does not affect the protein's dimerization or DNA binding affinity for strong CRE sites (26Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Briggs W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, in some cases PKA phosphorylation enhances binding of CREB-1 to asymmetrical CREs, such as that in the tyrosine aminotransferase gene (TGACGCAG) (28Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Shutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar; for reviews, see Refs. 29Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar and 30Delmas V. Molina C.A. Lalli E. de Groot R. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. Sassone-Corsi P. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 124: 1-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the MNNG transcriptional response is mediated through the PKA pathway (15Englander E.W. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and CREB purified from MNNG-treated cells is transcriptionally activated (16Narayan S. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to propose that the transcriptional activation is due to increased phosphorylation. We examined this possibility by metabolically labeling cells with [32P]orthophosphate and simultaneously treating them with MNNG. 32P-Labeled CREB was purified from RPc and resolved by SDS-PAGE. A 43-kDa protein identical in mass to CREB-1 was much more strongly phosphorylated after exposure of cells to MNNG than in control cells. Using an anti-phospho-CREB polyclonal antibody that is specific for the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB-1, we further confirmed that phosphorylation of NE CREB-1 at Ser133 was strongly increased by MNNG treatment.To test the functional activity of CREB and to attempt to mimic the MNNG response, we used a mixed activator approach in which PKA-phosphorylated recombinant CREB-1 was added to the NE from control cells. A very small amount of added phosphorylated CREB-1 (10 ng) (but not unphosphorylated CREB-1) was able to stimulate promoter activity. The role of phosphorylated CREB-1 in transcriptional up-regulation of the β-pol promoter was examined further with NEd. Phosphorylated CREB-1 could restore transcriptional activity of NEd, but unphosphorylated CREB-1 could not. The results indicate that exposure of cells to the alkylating agent MNNG induces phosphorylation of CREB-1, which in turn recruits more RPc onto the promoter. This effect results in a stimulation of the overall amount of transcript formation. These observations are similar to those proposed for transcriptional activation of c-Jun by phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of the transactivation domain (31Franklin C.C. Sanchez V. Wagner F. Woodgett J.R. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7247-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The importance of PKA-phosphorylated CREB-1 in vivo was described in a transgenic mouse model study by Struthers et al. (32Struthers R.S. Vale W.W. Arias C. Sawchenko P.E. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), where expression of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant CREB impaired transcriptional activation of the growth hormone gene and produced growth abnormalities. The enhanced transactivation property of phosphorylated CREB also has been examined by nuclear microinjection in fibroblasts; the results showed that phosphorylated CREB, but not unphosphorylated CREB, stimulated CREB-dependent gene expression (33Alberts A.S. Arias J. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7623-7630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation of target genes by the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB has been proposed to be due to increased association with the phospho-CREB-binding protein (CBP) (34Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Further, in transient expression studies, overexpression of CBP can stimulate cAMP-responsive promoter activity in a CREB phosphorylation-dependent manner (35Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H. Brennan R. Roberts S. Green M. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). CREB phosphorylation, however, has not always been found to mediate activation of CREB-dependent promoters. In several studies (33Alberts A.S. Arias J. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Feramisco J.R. J.

Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 26Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Briggs W.H. Montminy M.R.

The phosphorylation of CREB-1 by PKA does not affect the protein's dimerization or DNA binding affinity for strong CRE sites (26Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Briggs W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, in some cases PKA phosphorylation enhances binding of CREB-1 to asymmetrical CREs, such as that in the tyrosine aminotransferase gene (TGACGCAG) (28Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C.

Pharmacol. 1994; 124: 1-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the MNNG transcriptional response is mediated through the PKA pathway (15Englander E.W. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and CREB purified from MNNG-treated cells is transcriptionally activated (16Narayan S. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to propose that the transcriptional activation is due to increased phosphorylation. We examined this possibility by metabolically labeling cells with [32P]orthophosphate and simultaneously treating them with MNNG. 32P-Labeled CREB was purified from RPc and resolved by SDS-PAGE. A 43-kDa protein identical in mass to CREB-1 was much more strongly phosphorylated after exposure of cells to MNNG than in control cells. Using an anti-phospho-CREB polyclonal antibody that is specific for the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB-1, we further confirmed that phosphorylation of NE CREB-1 at Ser133 was strongly increased by MNNG treatment. To test the functional activity of CREB and to attempt to mimic the MNNG response, we used a mixed activator approach in which PKA-phosphorylated recombinant CREB-1 was added to the NE from control cells. A very small amount of added phosphorylated CREB-1 (10 ng) (but not unphosphorylated CREB-1) was able to stimulate promoter activity. The role of phosphorylated CREB-1 in transcriptional up-regulation of the β-pol promoter was examined further with NEd. Phosphorylated CREB-1 could restore transcriptional activity of NEd, but unphosphorylated CREB-1 could not. The results indicate that exposure of cells to the alkylating agent MNNG induces phosphorylation of CREB-1, which in turn recruits more RPc onto the promoter. This effect results in a stimulation of the overall amount of transcript formation. These observations are similar to those proposed for transcriptional activation of c-Jun by phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of the transactivation domain (31Franklin C.C. Sanchez V. Wagner F. Woodgett J.R. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7247-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The importance of PKA-phosphorylated CREB-1 in vivo was described in a transgenic mouse model study by Struthers et al. (32Struthers R.S. Vale W.W. Arias C. Sawchenko P.E. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), where expression of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant CREB impaired transcriptional activation of the growth hormone gene and produced growth abnormalities. The enhanced transactivation property of phosphorylated CREB also has been examined by nuclear microinjection in fibroblasts; the results showed that phosphorylated CREB, but not unphosphorylated CREB, stimulated CREB-dependent gene expression (33Alberts A.S. Arias J. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7623-7630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation of target genes by the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB has been proposed to be due to increased association with the phospho-CREB-binding protein (CBP) (34Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Further, in transient expression studies, overexpression of CBP can stimulate cAMP-responsive promoter activity in a CREB phosphorylation-dependent manner (35Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H. Brennan R. Roberts S. Green M. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). CREB phosphorylation, however, has not always been found to mediate activation of CREB-dependent promoters. In several studies (33Alberts A.S. Arias J. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Feramisco J.R. J.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1858-1866PubMed Google Scholar) with in vitro transcription system, no difference in transactivation properties was found with phosphorylated and unphosphorylated CREB. In some reports, it was suggested that the failure to observe phosphorylated CREB-dependent activation of genes was due to rapid dephosphorylation of CREB by nuclear phosphatases (37Sun P. Schoderbek W.E. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1858-1866PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Recent studies of Brindle and Montminy (24Brindle P.K. Montminy M.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) suggested that, in addition to Ser133-phosphorylated CREB, other proteins are required to mediate CREB·CBP complex formation and transcriptional activation of target genes. Data from our studies indicate that phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 by MNNG treatment of cells, perhaps in association with CBP, correlates with β-pol gene activation in the HeLa cell system. Explanations for the differences between these results and those from some other studies are unknown at the moment but could be related with differences in promoter sequence context and as well as details of extract preparation. In summary, we have made use of in vitro transcription systems to understand a potential mechanism for up-regulation of the β-pol promoter after mammalian cells are treated with a monofunctional DNA-alkylating agent. Since this up-regulation appears to require DNA alkylation damage (39Srivastava D.K. Rawson T.Y. Showalter S.D. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16402-16408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it should be interesting to study the linkage between DNA damage and the signal transduction system. We are grateful to Dr. Marc R. Montminy for the generous gift of pET-3A-CREB overexpression plasmid, to Teresa Y. Rawson for expert technical assistance, to Drs. David Konkel and Allan Brasier for critically reading the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2076418133,"CD22 is an immunoglobulin superfamily B lymphocyte-specific adhesion receptor and a member of the recently identified I-type class of lectins. Recent work has shown that CD22 specifically recognizes sialic acid linked α2,6 to terminal N-linked oligosaccharides on selected cell surface glycoproteins. CD22-ligand interaction is regulated by the activity of a β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase that can inactivate CD22-mediated binding by sialylating the CD22 receptor itself. These observations suggest that N-linked glycosylation sites on the CD22 molecule may play a role in the regulation of CD22-mediated adhesion. In this work we have performed site-specific mutagenesis of potential N-linked glycosylation sites on CD22 in an effort to determine whether they might be involved in ligand recognition. We show that mutation of a single potential N-linked glycosylation site in the first immunoglobulin domain of CD22 completely abrogates ligand recognition. Interestingly, this site is characterized by the sequence NCT, where the cysteine is thought to be involved in an intrachain disulfide bond. Site-directed mutagenesis of similar NC(T/S) motifs in the first or second Ig domains of the I-type lectins myelin-associated glycoprotein, and sialoadhesin did not disrupt their ability to mediate sialic acid binding. In contrast, mutation of a NCS motif in the first Ig domain of the I-type lectin CD33 unmasked its sialic acid binding activity.

COS cells transfected with CD22 adhere to lymphocytes, monocytes, and red blood cells, and the observed adhesion is dependent upon the presence of ligand-associated N-linked oligosaccharides containing α2,6-linked but not α2,3-linked sialic acid (Stamenkovic et al, 1991; Sgroi et al., 23Sgroi D.

Interestingly, co-expression of a β-galactoside α2,6-sialytransferase and cell surface or soluble CD22 in COS cells abrogates CD22-mediated adhesion and modulation of T cell activation (Braesch-Andersen and Stamenkovic, 3Braesch-Andersen S.

Because CD22 expressed on B lymphocytes is itself sialylated in α2,6 linkage, it appears likely that the relative α2,6-sialyltransferase activity in B cells and in ligand expressing target cells regulates CD22 interaction with ligands on the same cell surface or on that of adjacent cells. Unlike CD22, CD33, sialoadhesin, and MAG recognize sialic acid in α2,3 but not in α2,6 linkage. More specifically, MAG recognizes the oligosaccharide NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc, whereas CD33 and sialoadhesin bind both NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3(4)GlcNAc and NeuAcα2-3β1-3GalNAc oligosaccharides (Kelm et al., 14Kelm S. Pelz A. Schauer R. Filbin M.T. Tang S. de Bellard M. Schnaar R.L. Mahoney J.A. Hartnell A. Bradfield P. Crocker P.R. Curr.

COS cells transfected with native MAG and sialoadhesin support adhesion of erythrocytes and neutrophils, whereas CD33 expressing cells require desialylation to uncover their erythrocyte and leukocyte-binding ability (Freeman et al., 8Freeman S.D.

Because endogenous glycoconjugates appear to modulate sialoglycoprotein ligand recognition by CD22 and CD33, we performed site-specific mutagenesis of potential N-linked glycosylation motifs within the first two Ig domains of CD22 and the first Ig domain of CD33 in an effort to identify sites necessary for sialic acid binding. Our results demonstrate that mutation of a single potential N-linked glycosylation motif in the first immunoglobulin domain of CD22 completely abrogates its adhesion properties, whereas mutation of a homologously positioned N-linked glycosylation site in CD33 unmasks its ligand binding function.

FITC-conjugated anti-CD22 mAb SJ.10.1H11 was obtained from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME), and FITC-conjugated anti-CD20 was obtained from Becton Dickinson (Mountain View, CA). Eleven CD22 mutants were prepared by a modified version of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method of Ho et al. (11Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). All of the mutations targeted potential N-linked glycosylation sites in Ig domains 1 and 2. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to allow creation of new restriction sites at or in the vicinity of sequences encoding N-linked glycosylation sites, such that the forward and reverse primers could contain one or two mutant codons each. PCR amplification of two fragments was performed, one primed by a forward primer starting at the initial ATG of the coding sequence and containing an XhoI site and by a reverse primer starting within the cluster and containing point mutations as well as a novel restriction site and the other primed by a forward primer starting within the cluster and containing point mutations as well as a corresponding novel restriction site and by a reverse primer spanning a unique NarI site at nucleotides 1434-1439 that encode residues within Ig domain 5 of CD22β. Amplified fragments were subjected to XhoI and restriction endonuclease X and endonuclease X and Nar I digestion and inserted into XhoI/NarI-cut CD22β in a three-way ligation. A distinct restriction site (X) was created in the vicinity of each of the potential N-linked glycosylation sites and was designed to conserve the wild type amino acids at the site or to provide a conservative substitution. Six potential N-linked glycosylation sites were targeted, four in the first Ig domain, and two in the second. The Asn residue in each potential site was substituted by an Ala or Ile. At potential N-linked glycosylation sites 2 and 3, Thr103→ Ala and Ser114→ Gly substitutions were generated, respectively. CD22 mutants containing Lys100→ Ala and Leu104→ Ala substitutions were also generated. All CD22 mutants were subjected to DNA sequence analysis to ensure that appropriate substitutions were made and that no additional mutations had been introduced during PCR. The strategy described above for the generation of CD22 mutants was used in the development of N-linked glycosylation site (CHO) mutants CD33, MAG, and sialoadhesin. Human sialoadhesin cDNA, human CD33 cDNA, and rat MAG cDNA were generously provided by Ajit Varki (UCSD, La Jolla, CA), Brian Seed (Harvard University), and John Roder (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada) respectively. A CHO1 mutant in transmembrane CD33 was generated by an Asn100→ Ala substitution. Site-specific mutations surrounding CHO1 were generated by Arg99→ Ala and Leu103→ Ala substitutions. MAG and sialoadhesin CHO1 mutants were generated by Asn99→ Ala and Asn159→ Ala substitutions, respectively. All of the constructs were transiently expressed in COS cells by the DEAE-dextran method (Aruffo and Seed, 1Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfected COS cells were incubated with 2-5 µg/ml of each antibody for 45 min at room temperature in PBS/5% fetal bovine serum/0.02% sodium azide, washed in PBS, incubated with a secondary, affinity purified, fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody for 30 min at room temperature, washed, fixed briefly in 4% formaldehyde, and examined under an epifluorescence microscope. COS cells were transfected with the various CD22 mutant cDNAs as described above. 48 h after transfection, the COS cells were washed and incubated for 6 h in cysteine/methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 100 µCi of [35S]methionine. Cells were washed in PBS three times and lysed in buffer consisting of PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, and 0.02% sodium azide. The lysates were precleared for 6 h at 4°C with 25 µl of packed protein G-Sepharose beads. Precleared lysates were incubated with the anti-CD22 mAb, HD6, at 5 µg/ml with 25 µl of fresh packed protein G-Sepharose beads for 8 h at 4°C. Beads were washed four times in PBS/0.05% Nonidet P-40, and precipitates were eluted by boiling in sample buffer in the presence of 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were subjected to SDS/8% PAGE, and the gel was fixed, incubated in Autofluor (National Diagnostics; Manville, N.J.) for 1 h, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 8 h. Development of CD22-Ig fusion protein containing the first three Ig-like domains of CD22 has been described previously (Stamenkovic et al., 27Stamenkovic I. Sgroi D. Aruffo A. Sy M.S. Anderson T. Cell. 1991; 66: 1133-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The strategy used to develop CD22-Ig fusions was applied to the generation of CD33, MAG, and sialoadhesin-Ig chimeras. However, because production of MAG and CD33 receptorglobulins in COS cells was weak, the sequence encoding the secretory signal peptide of each receptor was replaced by that of CD22. Forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers containing a Mlu and a Nhe site, respectively, were used to PCR amplify the approximately 800-nucleotide segment spanning the cytomegalovirus promoter and CD22 leader from the CDM8 vector (Stamenkovic and Seed, 26Stamenkovic I. Seed B. Nature. 1990; 345: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and forward and reverse primers containing a NheI and a BamHI site were used to amplify sequences encoding the first four extracellular Ig domains of MAG. Both fragments were subjected to digestion by the appropriate restriction endonucleases and inserted inframe into a MluI/BamHI-cut Ig vector in a three-way ligation. The same approach was used to develop CD33Ig fusions, using Nhe/BglII sites for digestion of the PCR-amplified fragments. For sialoadhesin, sequences encoding the first four Ig domains were used to develop the sialoadhesin-Ig fusion. CD22, CD33, MAG, and sialoadhesin receptorglobulins (Rg) were produced in COS cells and purified from COS cell supernatants as described (Stamenkovic et al., 27Stamenkovic I. Sgroi D. Aruffo A. Sy M.S. Anderson T. Cell. 1991; 66: 1133-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Rosetting assays were performed as described previously (Stamenkovic et al., 27Stamenkovic I.

Briefly transfected COS cells were overlaid with human erythrocytes, tonsillar B lymphocytes, or peripheral blood T cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and incubated at 4°C for 30 min. Nonadherent cells were removed by several washes with serum-free medium, and rosettes were analyzed by light microscopy. 100 µg of purified CD22Rg was noncovalently bound to protein A beads. The protein A-bound CD22Rg was then incubated for 18 h at 37°C with PNGase F at a concentration of 120 units/ml in a 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mM EDTA and 0.02% sodium azide. The beads were washed with PBS × 5, the PNGase F-treated CD22Rg was eluted with 0.1 M citric acid, pH 3.75 and dialyzed overnight against PBS, and protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Peripheral blood leukocytes were subjected to Ficoll gradient centrifugation, and the mononuclear cell and buffy coat layer served as the sources of T lymphocytes and granulocytes, respectively. Lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI/10% fetal bovine serum with 1 µg/ml of PHA for 3 days, whereas granulocytes were prepared fresh and used immediately. Granulocytes and PHA blasts (3-day) were washed in cold PBS, resuspended in PBS, 0.02% sodium azide, preincubated with 100 µg/ml of murine IgG, washed in PBS, and incubated with 50 µg/ml of test and control (CD44Rg) receptorglobulins for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed in cold PBS, resuspended in PBS, 0.02% sodium azide, and 5 µg/ml fluorescein-conjugated, affinity purified goat anti-mouse antibody for 30 min on ice, washed, fixed with PBS containing 4% formaldehyde, and analyzed on a FACscan (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain View, CA). Wild type CD22-transfected or CD22 Thr103-transfected cells were harvested from dishes 48 h after initial transfection with 0.5 mM EDTA/PBS for 10 min at 37°C. Cells (2 × 106) were washed once in PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-CD22 SJ.10.1H11 mAb (10 µg/ml) or FITC-conjugated anti-CD20 mAb (20 µl/test) for 45 min at 4°C. Cells were washed and analyzed on a FACscan. CD33Rg and CD33CHO1Rg (200 µg) were adsorbed to separate protein A-Sepharose columns, washed with PBS, and incubated with 100 milliunits of Vibrio cholera sialidase (Boerhinger Mannheim) for 4 h at 37°C. After incubation the columns were extensively washed with PBS, and fusion proteins were eluted with 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.0. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 6 µg of CD22Rg, CD44Rg, or PNGase F-treated CD22Rg in 100 µl of PBS/0.02% sodium azide overnight at 4°C. The plate was washed with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with 1 mg/ml BSA for 3 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS/0.05% Tween 20, the plate was incubated with 1 µg/ml of anti-CD22 mAb HD6, HD39 or To15, washed with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and exposed for 1 h at room temperature to alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:4000. After three washes with PBS/0.05% Tween 20, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) dissolved in 0.1 M glycine/10 mM MgCl2 solution, pH 9.4, was added. Following 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the colorimetric reaction was read at 405 nm in an El-310 Microplate Autoreader (Biotek Instruments. Winooski, VT). Protein A-Sepharose affinity purified CD22Rg and PNGaseF-treated CD22Rg were individually injected onto a Superose-6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and subjected to a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml of PBS/min utilizing a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). Elution fractions were collected, and protein was detected by spectral absorbance at 226 nM. Elution profiles were generated by plotting protein concentration (spectral absorbance, A226 nm) versus volume (ml). We have shown previously that the first three Ig domains of CD22 are sufficient to provide all of the known adhesive functions and antibody recognition sites of CD22 (Stamenkovic et al., 27Stamenkovic I. Sgroi D. Aruffo A. Sy M.S. Anderson T. Cell. 1991; 66: 1133-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), although the first two domains contain epitopes recognized by several antibodies and provide some adhesive properties. Six potential N-linked glycosylation sites are present in the first two Ig domains (four in domain 1 and two in domain 2), but there are none in the third. To determine the potential role of N-linked glycosylation in the function of CD22 as an adhesion receptor, we substituted the Asn residue in each of the first five potential N-linked glycosylation sites with an Ala and that of the sixth with Ile (Fig. 1) and tested each mutant for expression and the ability to support erythrocyte and lymphocyte adhesion in COS cells. COS cells transfected with CD22 mutants containing Asn67→ Ala, Asn135→ Ala, Asn164→ Ala, and Asn231→ Ile substitutions tested positive with HD39, HD6, and To15 mAb, which recognize distinct epitopes (Table I). However, transfectants expressing a mutant containing Asn101→ Ala and Asn112→ Ala substitutions failed to stain with To15 mAb while maintaining expression of epitopes recognized by HD39 and HD6 mAb (Table I). To determine whether either or both sites are required for expression of the To15 epitope, mutants containing either Asn101→ Ala or Asn112→ Ala were generated, in addition to mutants containing Thr103→ Ala or Ser114→ Gly to ensure that any observed change in antibody recognition or functional property is related to the glycosylation defect and not to the Asn substitution per se. Mutants containing Asn101→ Ala or Thr103→ Ala substitutions displayed weak reactivity with To15 mAb, whereas the mutations Asn112→ Ala and Ser114→ Gly had no significant effect on the To15 epitope expression (Table I). The surface density of CD22 Thr103→ Ala expressed in COS cells was comparable with that of wild type CD22 as determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 2), ruling out the possibility that the weak reactivity with To15 mAb was due to a decrease in surface expression.Table IIn vitro adhesion mediated by and monoclonal antibody staining of COS cells expressing CD22 and CD22 mutantsAdhesion AssayAntibody StainingRBCsT cell blastsTonsillar lymphocytesTo15HD6HD39CD22WT++++++++++++CD22Asn67Ala++++++++++++CD22Asn101Ala/112Ala−−−−+++CD22Asn101Ala−−−+/−+++CD22Thr103Ala−−−+/−++++CD22Asn112Ala+/++++++++++++CD22Ser114Gly+/++++++++++++CD22Asn135Ala++++++++++++CD22Asn164Ala++++++++++++CD22Asn231Ile++++ND++ND++CD22Lys100Ala++++++++ND++CD22Leu104Ala++++++++ND++ Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Flow cytometry analysis of COS cells transfected with wild type CD22 and CD22Thr103. COS cells expressing wild type CD22 or CD22Thr103 (harvested with EDTA) were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD20 (control mAb) or FITC-conjugated antiCD22 mAb SJ.10.1H11 and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoprecipitation of CD22 mutants Asn101→ Ala/Asn112→ Ala, Asn101→ Ala, Thr103→ Ala, and Asn112→ Ala expressed in COS cells using the HD6 mAb revealed a reduction in molecular weight (Mr) consistent with a loss of N-linked glycans (Fig. 3). Although the shift in Mr of the mutant containing Asn112→ Ala was minor, the combined Asn101→Ala/Asn112→ Ala substitution resulted in a greater reduction in Mr than substitution of Asn101→ Ala alone. These observations are consistent with the notion that Asn112 is glycosylated. Mutation of potential N-linked glycosylation sites Asn67, Asn135, Asn164, and Asn231 resulted in a minimal shift in Mr (Fig. 3). Whereas mutation of potential N-linked sites Asn67, Asn135, Asn164, and Asn231 had no significant effect on erythrocyte and lymphocyte adhesion to COS cell transfectants (Table I and Fig. 4), simultaneous mutation of Asn101 and Asn112 completely abrogated adhesion of all cells tested (Table I and Fig. 4). COS cells transfected with CD22 mutants Asn101→ Ala and Thr103→ Ala (N-linked glycosylation site 2) failed to bind erythrocytes or lymphocytes (Fig. 4). Lymphocyte binding by transfectants expressing mutations of Asn112→ Ala and Ser114→ Gly (N-linked glycosylation site 3), on the other hand, was similar to that of wild type CD22 expressing counterparts, although the ability to support erythrocyte adhesion was reduced (Fig. 4). COS cells expressing CD22 cDNAs containing the substitutions Lys100→ Ala and Leu104→ Ala, which correspond to residues adjacent to N-linked glycosylation site 2, were observed to support adhesion of erythrocytes and lymphocytes in a manner comparable with that of wild type CD22 transfectants (Table I). As expected, immunoprecipitation of CD22 Lys100→ Ala and CD22 Leu104→ Ala with anti-CD22mAb did not reveal a shift in Mr (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Previous work had demonstrated that α2,6 sialylation of N-linked glycans in the first two Ig domains of CD22 results in the abrogation of its ability to bind sialoglycoprotein ligands (Braesch-Andersen and Stamenkovic, 3Braesch-Andersen S. Stamenkovic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11783-11786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used the potential N-linked glycosylation site mutants to determine whether α2,6 sialylation of glycans associated with a specific asparagine residue might be responsible for the observed disruption of CD22 interaction with its ligands. COS cells were co-transfected with human α2,6-sialyltransferase cDNA and cDNAs encoding each of the CD22 N-linked glycosylation site mutants, with the obvious exception of Asn101→ Ala, and assayed for their ability to support lymphocyte adhesion. In all cases, co-transfection of α2,6-sialyltransferase cDNA resulted in the abrogation of CD22-mediated adhesion (data not shown). Because mutation of an N-linked glycosylation site may result in a conformational change due to inappropriate protein folding, we assessed the effect of removing N-linked carbohydrates from mature CD22-Ig fusion protein (CD22Rg) containing the first three Ig domains of CD22 (Fig. 5A). The fusion protein was coupled to protein A-Sepharose and subjected to PNGase F hydrolysis. As a result, PNGase F-treated CD22Rg displayed a reduction in Mr of about 10,000-12,000 (Fig. 5B), and a significant decrease in reactivity with lymphocytes (Fig. 6). The absence of complete abrogation of lymphocyte binding as a result of PNGase F treatment was probably due to the fact that the digestion was performed without SDS to avoid altering the structure of the receptorglobulin. It is therefore likely that removal of N-linked glycans was incomplete. Recognition of PNGase F-treated CD22Rg by anti-CD22 mAb was tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using plates coated with PNGaseF-treated and untreated CD22Rg and CD44Rg control. Consistent with N-linked glycosylation site 2 and 3 mutants, PNGase F-treatment of CD22Rg resulted in the loss of the epitope recognized by the To15 mAb but conservation of HD39 and HD6 mAb-specific epitopes (Table II).Fig. 6Removal of N-linked oligosaccharide chains from CD22Rg reduces binding to PHA blasts. Three-day PHA blasts (1 × 106) were incubated with 50 µg/ml of the following receptorglobulins and analyzed by flow cytometry: untreated CD22Rg, CD22Rg treated with PNGaseF (CD22RgRxPNGaseF), and CD44Rg treated with PNGaseF (CD44RgRxPNGaseF).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table II.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of CD22Rg and PNGaseF-treated CD22Rg with CD22 mAbsMean absorbance (405 nm) × 10−3aAntibody binding is expressed as the net mean absorbance and the standard deviation of the enzymatically (alkaline phosphatase) generated product measured after 1 h.

Open table in a new tab Because oligosaccharide side chains can play a role in protein solubility, it is possible that deglycosylation of CD22Rg results in protein aggregation. Such aggregation may mask critical CD22 epitopes thereby providing an alternative explanation for the loss of To15 mAb binding and loss of ligand recognition. Gel filtration chromatography of native and deglycosylated CD22Rg demonstrated a similar retention volume profile (data not shown). Less than 4% of the deglycosylated CD22Rg was present in the void volume, demonstrating that deglycosylation of CD22Rg results in minimal aggregation. Comparison of amino acid sequence alignments of CD22 with the other known I-type lectins reveals that each molecule possesses a NC(S/T) motif in either the first or second Ig domain. The NC(S/T) motif is at the same relative location in the first Ig domain of CD22, CD33, and MAG, whereas it is present in the second domain of sialoadhesin. In order to determine whether the NC(T/S) motif plays a role in ligand recognition by CD33, MAG, and sialoadhesin, we substituted the Asn residue in the NC(T/S) motif of each receptor with Ala. Soluble receptorglobulins of CD33Asn100Ala, MAGAsn99Ala, and SialoadhesinAsn159Ala (CD33CHO1Rg, MAGCHO1Rg, and SialoadhesinCHO1Rg, respectively, where CHO1 indicates the first N-linked glycosylation site from the NH2 terminus of each receptor) were generated (Fig. 5A), and immunoprecipitation of each revealed a small reduction in Mr with respect to the corresponding wild type Rg (Fig. 7), consistent with the loss of N-linked glycans from the mutated site. Binding of each of the mutant receptorglobulins to peripheral blood granulocytes (PBGs) was analyzed by flow cytometry, using binding of CD22Asn101AlaRg(CD22CHO2Rg) relative to that of CD22wtRg as a control. As expected, soluble CD22Asn101Ala (CD22CH02Rg) demonstrated a significant loss of binding to PBGs when compared with wild type CD22Rg (Fig. 8A), whereas MAGCHO1Rg and sialoadhesinCHO1Rg stained PBGs with an intensity comparable with that of corresponding wild-type receptorglobulins (Fig. 8, B and C). In contrast, binding of PBG by CD33CHO1Rg was significantly greater than by wild type CD33Rg (Fig. 8D). Treatment of CD33Rg with V. cholerae sialidase resulted in a slight decrease in Mr (Fig. 7) and enhanced binding of PBG to a level comparable with that of the corresponding CHO1 mutant.Fig. 8Binding to granulocytes of CD22CHO2Rg, MAGCHO1Rg, sialoadhesinCHO1Rg, and CD33Rg and CD33CHO1Rg with/without V. cholera sialidase pretreatment. Peripheral blood granulocytes (1 × 106) were incubated with 50 µg/ml of the indicated fusion protein and analyzed by flow cytometry. CD44Rg served as the negative control fusion protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extracellular Ig-like domains of CD22 that are responsible for its adhesion function contain six potential N-linked glycosylation sites. In this work, we have demonstrated that mutation of a single potential N-linked glycosylation site within the first Ig domain of CD22 (Asn101) results in abrogation of CD22-mediated sialic acid binding. Several observations are consistent with the notion that N-linked glycans at Asn101 are required for CD22-mediated adhesion. First, independent mutation of Asn101→ Ala and Thr103→ Ala resulted in the To15 mAb epitope loss as well as the inability of CD22 to bind ligands. Second, mutation of residues immediately proximal and distal to the second N-linked glycosylation motif had no effect on ligand recognition or To15 reactivity. Third, the removal of N-linked glycans from mature CD22Rg, by PNGaseF, resulted in the reduction of its ability to bind cell surface ligands as well as the loss of the To15 epitope. These results suggest that a single N-linked oligosaccharide chain may play a key role in defining the sialic acid binding region of CD22. The loss of To15 antibody reactivity in COS cells expressing the CD22 Asn101→ Ala mutant suggests that the N-glycosyl chain at Asn101 is necessary for determining the proper three-dimensional conformation of the sialic acid binding site. The mAb To15, which recognizes an epitope in the third extracellular domain and blocks CD22-mediated adhesion (Stamenkovic et al., 27Stamenkovic I. Sgroi D. Aruffo A. Sy M.S. Anderson T. Cell. 1991; 66: 1133-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), reacts weakly with COS cells expressing CD22 Asn101→ Ala and Thr103→ Ala mutants and fails to recognize COS cells expressing the combined Asn101 and Asn112 CD22 mutant. One possible interpretation of this observation is that the Asn101-associated oligosaccharide chain may form part of the To15 epitope and that loss of the oligosaccharide results in diminished mAb reactivity. However, this argument is refuted by the observation that Asn101 and Thr103 reside in the first extracellular domain, which has been shown to be unnecessary for To15 recognition of its epitope (Engel et al., 7Engel P. Wagner N. Miller A.S. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1581-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A more likely possibility may be that loss of Asn101 or simultaneous loss of Asn101 and Asn112-associated glycans result in conformational changes that, respectively, partially or totally mask the To15 epitope. Recently, the function of at least two structurally unrelated adhesion receptors has been shown to be regulated by N-linked glycans. Recognition of hyaluronan by the cell surface receptor CD44 has been observed to be both positively and negatively regulated by N-linked glycans (Bartolazzi et al., 2Bartolazzi A. Nocks A. Aruffo A. Spring F. Stamenkovic I. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), whereas the single N-linked glycan of the adhesion domain of CD2 has been shown to play a critical role in CD2-CD58 interaction without itself being part of the recognition site (Recny et al., 22Recny M.A. Luther M.A. Knoppers M.H. Neidhardt E.A. Khandekar S.S. Concino M.F. Schimke P.A. Francis M.A. Moebius U. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N. Reinherz E.L. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 269: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Cell surface CD2 mutants containing substitutions in the N-glycosylation sequence Asn65-Gly66-Thr67 that preclude attachment of N-glycans at Asn65 display loss of antibody and ligand binding activity, suggesting that the N-linked glycan of CD2 plays a critical role in stabilizing CD2 receptor conformation. These observations suggest that Ig domains of some receptors are not rigid protein scaffolds but appear to maintain the appropriate structure through a dynamic interaction between the polypeptide core and the attached glycan (Wyss et al., 29Wyss D.F. Choi J.S. Li J. Knoppers M.H. Willis K.J. Arulanandam A.R.N. Smolyar A. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. Science. 1995; 269: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The similar behavior of the CD22 Asn101 and the CD2 glycosylation mutant is consistent with the possibility that the second N-linked glycan of CD22, while not necessarily being part of the ligand recognition site, may be required for its appropriate conformation. It has been shown that sialylation of CD22-associated N-linked oligosaccharides abrogates CD22-mediated adhesion (Braesch-Andersen and Stamenkovic, 3Braesch-Andersen S. Stamenkovic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11783-11786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Hanasaki, Varki and Powell, 1995). Thus, the function of CD22 as an adhesion molecule depends, at least in part, on the reciprocity of receptor-ligand sialylation; desialylated CD22 can bind sialylated glycoprotein ligands whereas sialylated CD22 cannot. Our present data indicate that inhibition of CD22-mediated adhesion by endogenous α2,6 sialylation cannot be ascribed to any single N-linked oligosaccharide and is more likely due to the combined sialylation of several glycans. Because high affinity CD22 ligands have been shown to be those that contain multiple α2,6-linked sialic acid residues, it makes sense that endogenous inhibition of CD22-mediated binding involves more than one of its oligosaccharide chains. However, because our experiments have been performed using cell surface CD22 mutants, we cannot exclude the possibility that the loss of adhesion associated with α2,6-sialyltransferase co-expression may be due to interaction between CD22 and sialoglycoproteins on the same cell surface. Mutation of the asparagine residue in the NC(T/S) motif in the first or second Ig-like domains of MAGRg and sialoadhesinRg did not disrupt their ability to bind sialic acid ligands, suggesting that the NC(T/S) motif itself does not provide a structure on which the function of all I-type lectins relies. In addition, the N-linked glycans at these sites are not required for MAG and sialoadhesin-mediated adhesion. In contrast, CD33-mediated adhesion in COS cells is unmasked by pretreatment with sialidase, suggesting that terminal sialylation of CD33 glycans, like those of CD22, may play a critical role in regulating recognition of ligands. The present study demonstrates that unlike CD22, sialylation of a single N-linked glycan of CD33 is sufficient to inhibit interaction with ligands. However, the site of attachment of the CD33 N-linked glycan that blocks adhesion aligns with that of CD22 required for supporting adhesion. Whether the presence or the absence of N-linked glycans at these sites alters ligand binding properties by interfering with the disulfide bond provided by the juxtaposed cysteine residue remains to be determined. However, these observations highlight the unique properties of these two Ig-like receptors that not only behave as sialic acid binding lectins but whose function is subject to regulation by sialylation of a single, similarly located N-linked glycosylation site.

Konkle B.A. Blood. 1995; 86 (Suppl. 1 (abstr.)): 314Google Scholar). Reconstitution studies have demonstrated that GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX are all necessary for expression of the complex on the cell surface (15Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GPV is not absolutely required but does contribute to complex stability (16Calverley D.C. Yagi M. Stray S.M. Roth G.J.

Comparative studies suggest that GPIX might be a primitive progenitor of these members of the leucine-rich repeat family (23Yagi M. Edelhoff S. Disteche C.M. Roth G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16132-16137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). glycoprotein human erythroleukemia polymerase chain reaction platelet factor 4 mutant. The cellular precursors of platelets, megakaryocytes, are large polyploid cells that comprise approximately 0.05% of bone marrow cells (24Berkow R.L. Straneva J.E. Bruno E. Beyer G.S. Burgess J.S. Hoffman R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1984; 103: 811-818PubMed Google Scholar). Time course studies of megakaryocyte development identify a specific pattern of gene expression that coincides with megakaryocytic differentiation (25Breton-Gorius J. Vainchenker W. Semin. Hematol. 1986; 23: 43-67PubMed Google Scholar). The earliest known megakaryocyte marker is rodent acetylcholinesterase (26Long M.W. Williams N. Blood. 1981; 58: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is followed by GPIIb, GPIIIa and platelet factor 4 (PF-4) and subsequently by the GPIb-V-IX complex (25Breton-Gorius J. Vainchenker W. Semin. Hematol. 1986; 23: 43-67PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mazur E.M. Schafer A.I. Loscalzo J. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. Blackwell Science, Cambridge, MA1994: 161Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of megakaryocyte-specific gene regulation will allow comparative studies that correlate promoter activity with the temporal program of megakaryocyte gene expression. Because of the relative paucity of megakaryocytes and the absence of de novo transcription in platelets, which lack nuclei, most studies of gene regulation of megakaryocyte-specific genes have been performed in multipotential hematopoietic cell lines (28Andersson L.C. Nilsson K. Gahmberg C.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1979; 23: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 29Ogura M. Morishima Y. Ohno R. Kato Y. Hirabayashi N. Nagura H. Saito H.

These cell lines resemble megakaryocytes and express several platelet-specific genes, including GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPIX, GPIIb, and PF-4 (31Tabilio A. Rosa J.P. Testa U. Breton-Gorius J. Vainchenker W. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), but they also have features of other hematopoietic lineages.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24532-24539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have identified several shared characteristics. The core promoters 1) are short, generally <500 base pairs; 2) generally lack obvious CCAAT or TATA consensus sequences; 3) have one or more consensus binding sequences for the transcription factor Sp-1 (37Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar); and 4) frequently have functional GATA and Ets cis-acting sites (32LeMarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel C. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 33Prandini M.H. Uzan G. Martin F. Thevenon D. Marguerie G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24532-24539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Characterization of GPIX expression is important for several reasons. Since GPIX expression is critical to platelet function and necessary for assembly of the GPIb-V-IX complex (15Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), comparative studies of transcriptional regulation of the four subunits of the GPIb-V-IX complex can potentially identify which subunit is rate-limiting during assembly of the complex. Furthermore, characterization of GPIX regulation at the transcriptional level can provide a basis for comparison with regulation of other megakaryocyte genes to identify elements that modulate differences in the timing of developmental expression. In addition, the GPIX promoter can serve as a paradigm for other tissue-specific promoters and for promoters of other genes of the leucine-rich repeat family of proteins (32LeMarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel C. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The GPIX gene and upstream flanking regions have been previously sequenced, and the intron/exon structure and transcription start site have been characterized (38Hickey M.J. Roth G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3438-3443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study uses deletion and site-directed mutagenesis to characterize the GPIX promoter in transiently transfected human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells and identifies several positive and negative regulatory domains in the GPIX upstream flanking sequence. In addition, positive regulatory Ets and GATA sites were shown to function in vivo and specifically bind factors in vitro. HEL cells were cultured (37°C in 5% CO2, subcultured 2 times/week) in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Inc.) containing 25 mM HEPES buffer supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate with 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 µg/ml amphotericin B, and 2.05 µg/ml desoxycholate (Fungizone, Life Technologies, Inc.). H/SGPIX was constructed by subcloning a HindIII-SacI fragment of a genomic λ phage-containing sequence from the human GPIX gene, including the 5′-flanking sequence (38Hickey M.J. Roth G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3438-3443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). To generate the GPIX5′ deletion constructs, H/SGPIX template was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a 3′-antisense primer that bound at +4 relative to the GPIX transcription start site in conjunction with different 5′-sense primers that bound at varying distances within the GPIX upstream flanking sequence. Each primer contained restriction site adaptors, BglII in the 3′-antisense primer and Acc65I in the 5′-sense primers, to facilitate subcloning of the amplified product. The PCR fragments were digested with BglII and Acc65I and inserted into the multiple cloning region of the luciferase expression construct pXP2 (39Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) previously digested with the same enzymes. The nomenclature used for each deletion construct shown in Fig. 1 indicates the number of bases of upstream 5′-flanking sequence relative to the GPIX start site (38Hickey M.J. Roth G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3438-3443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of the GPIX-Ets-mut and GPIX-GATA-mut substitution mutants used the PCR mutagenesis technique of Michael (40Michael S.F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 410-412PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, this protocol employed PCR amplification of the GPIX5′-203Luc template by using the same forward and reverse primers that were used to generate the original deletion construct in conjunction with 24-base mutagenic oligonucleotides that had been previously phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase and ATP. This technique introduced specific mutations into either the Ets (GPIX-Ets-mut) or GATA (GPIX-GATA-mut) sites. The mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to introduce EcoRI sites into the constructs to facilitate screening. Specific changes in the GPIX promoter sequence are shown in Fig. 2. To screen for possible PCR errors, the fidelity of both the 5′ deletion and substitution mutants was confirmed by sequencing prior to testing for promoter activity. No PCR errors were identified in the luciferase constructs; however, the original GPIX sequence has two errors, a two-base omission (5′-CG-3′) between positions −107 and −108 and a G residue between −166 and −167. These corrections have been submitted to GenBank™ (accession no. M80478). For each sample, a cationic lipid:plasmid DNA suspension was prepared by mixing 5 µg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 5 µg of the internal control plasmid CMVβgal (CLONTECH) in 0.25 ml of Hepes-buffered saline (20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) with 0.25 ml of a solution consisting of a premix of 1:4 N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP) (Boehringer Mannheim):Hepes-buffered saline. Following incubation (10 min, 22°C), the 0.5 ml of DNA:lipid solution was added to 106 HEL cells in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 2% fetal bovine serum and placed in 100-mm Corning tissue culture dishes. Cells were incubated (37°C, 5 h) and then the transfection medium was replaced with standard tissue culture medium. Approximately 24 h after the initiation of transfection, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline followed by lysis in 200 µl of a solution containing 100 mM KHPO4, pH 7.8, 17 mM MgSO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice. The cellular debris was then removed by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 2 min, and 20 µl of the supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity by using the Promega luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Activity was assayed by using a Turner TD 20e luminometer. Galactosidase activity was measured with 50 µl of the lysate by using the colorimetric assay as described by the manufacturer (Promega) (41Rosenthenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The luciferase activities shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 were corrected for minor variations in transfection efficiency by dividing the luciferase activity generated by the promoter constructs by the galactosidase activity generated by the CMVβgal internal control plasmid. There were no differences in cell mortality when transfected with the different constructs (not shown). Oligonucleotides that include the GPIX GATA site (CTGCACTGGGGGGATAAGCCAGGC), GATA mutant (CTGCACTGGGGGAATTCGCCAGGC), Ets site (ATTTTCATCACTTCCTTCCGC), and Ets mutant (ATTTTCATCACTGAATTCCGC) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. Each oligonucleotide was end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32]ATP (42Ausabel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 12.1.1Google Scholar), annealed with an excess of complementary synthetic strand, and purified on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. To test for factor binding, a mixture was made of 4 µg of HEL nuclear extracts prepared as described (42Ausabel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 12.1.1Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution was made containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 12.5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 µg of poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor with or without double-stranded wild-type or mutant unlabeled competitor as indicated in the experiment. The 15-µl reactions were preincubated for 20 min on ice prior to the addition of probe (20,000 cpm, 0.24 pmol) and then incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 min. The samples were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 50 mM Tris/glycine running buffer. The gels were fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 5% glycerol, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT AR film at −80°C with an intensifying screen. A double-stranded 32P-end-labeled probe was generated by PCR amplification of the template GPIX5′-686Luc by using an unlabeled forward primer that bound at −423 and a 32P-end-labeled reverse primer that hybridized at +19 relative to the GPIX transcription start site. The resulting probe was mixed with increasing amounts of crude HEL cell nuclear extract and digested with 4 units of DNase I at 22°C for 2 min. The samples were analyzed by separation of the fragments on an 8 M urea, 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. An M13 sequencing ladder was run in parallel as a mobility marker. The gel was fixed in 12.5% methanol and 12.5% acetic acid, dried, and analyzed on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager System phosphoimager using Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst software. The GPIX upstream flanking sequence was linked to the luciferase marker gene and tested for its ability to generate luciferase activity in transiently transfected cells. Table I compares promoter activity in the hematopoietic HEL cell line, nonhematopoietic bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells, baby hamster kidney fibroblasts, and human epithelial HeLa cells. The three luciferase expression constructs tested were GPIX5′-686, which has the GPIX upstream flanking sequence gene extending to −686 relative to the start of transcription; pXP1, which lacks the upstream promoter sequence but is otherwise identical to GPIX5′-686; and GL2C, which encodes the SV40 promoter and enhancer. Plasmid pXP1 expressed negligible luciferase activity in all cell lines tested. Construct GL2C showed variable expression levels in the cell lines tested, which is probably a reflection of a combination of differing transfection efficiencies and variable capacity to support SV40 promoter/enhancer activities. GPIX5′-686Luc showed detectable luciferase activity only in the hematopoietic HEL cell line, which indicates that the GPIX upstream flanking sequence contains cell-specific promoter activity and suggests that this activity is selective for hematopoietic cells.Table I.Comparison of GPIX promoter activity in different cell typesPlasmidCell typeHELBAEaBovine aortic endothelial cells.BHKbBaby hamster kidney cells.HeLaGL2C15.67 ± 0.481.57 ± 0.23105.20 ± 28.400.89 ± 0.03GPIX5′686Luc6.25 ± 0.260.03 ± 0.020.06 ± 0.020.01 ± 0.00pXP10.02 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.08 ± 0.020.04 ± 0.04a Bovine aortic endothelial cells.b Baby hamster kidney cells. Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 compares promoter activity in HEL cells generated by luciferase constructs containing 5′ truncations derived from the 5′-flanking region of the GPIX gene. All of the GPIX constructs show activity that is clearly differentiable from the background in cells transfected with pXP1. Comparison of activities generated by the GPIX5′ deletion constructs shows a complex pattern of expression identifying several positive and negative regulatory elements. Elimination of the GPIX sequence between −686 and −423 increases expression approximately 3-fold, identifying one or more negative regulatory elements in this region. Truncation to −311 shows a diminution of activity by approximately 3-fold, indicating the presence of a positive regulatory element between −323 and −311. Deletion of the GPIX promoter region between −311 and −203 increases GPIX promoter activity approximately 10-fold, identifying a strong negative regulatory domain. Comparison of promoter activities generated by constructs GPIX5′-151Luc and GPIX5′-100Luc identifies another positive regulatory domain between −151 and −100. GPIX5′-100Luc and GPIX5′-69Luc, which gave similar amounts of luciferase activity, contain both the Ets and GATA consensus sites. These results indicate that, although the GATA and Ets sites regulate GPIX promoter activity (see below), there are other important regulatory elements within upstream flanking regions, the elimination of which can increase or decrease expression of the attached marker gene. The specific mechanism by which luciferase activity is altered is unclear. It is likely that activity correlates directly with luciferase message levels, although it is possible that changes in luciferase activity in the truncated promoter constructs are caused by alterations in transcription start site utilization. To directly test the function of the GPIX GATA and Ets sites, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of these sites within the context of the strongly expressing construct GPIX5′-203. Fig. 2 shows activities generated by the GATA and Ets mutant constructs in comparison with the wild-type GPIX5′-203 in transiently transfected HEL cells. The data show an approximately 4-fold diminution of promoter activity in the GPIX-Ets mutant and 7-fold diminution in the GPIX-GATA mutant in comparison with activity generated in HEL cells transfected with the wild-type plasmid GPIX5′-203. This experiment indicates that both the GATA and Ets sites are positive regulatory elements necessary for full GPIX promoter activity. To test whether the GPIX GATA and Ets cis-acting elements bind to protein factors that might regulate GPIX promoter activity, we performed gel retardation experiments comparing in vitro binding activity in HEL cell nuclear extracts in the presence of oligonucleotides that encode 32P-end-labeled wild-type or mutant GPIX Ets or GATA sites. The open arrows in Fig. 3 identify two protein complexes when using the Ets probe and one protein complex when using the GATA probe. All three complexes are competable with homologous wild-type competitor but poorly competable with heterologous mutant competitor, although modest competition can be seen with the mutant Ets site with very high levels (400-fold) of the mutant Ets competitor (Fig. 3, A and C, lanes 3-6). It is not clear whether the presence of a second Ets complex represents binding by a distinct protein or identifies a post-translationally modified or degraded Ets site-binding protein. Closed arrows (Fig. 3, lane 2 of each panel) identify nonspecific DNA-protein complexes that obscure the presence of specific complexes. Nonspecific binding is eliminated in the presence of the poly(dI-dC) (Fig. 3, lanes 3-6). Specific binding to both the Ets and GATA sites is shown by the absence of a complex formation by the mutant Ets probe and greatly reduced binding of the mutant GATA probe (Fig. 3, B and D) and by the inefficient competition of the mutant relative to wild-type unlabeled competitors. 32P-End-labeled GPIX promoter probe was mixed with increasing HEL cell nuclear extract and treated with DNase I prior to separation of digested fragments on a denaturing sequencing gel. Analysis of the autoradiographic pattern shown in Fig. 4 identifies a region of decreased band intensity extending from −49 to −35 relative to the GPIX transcription start site. This region includes a GPIX ACTTCCT consensus sequence extending from −45 to −39, which is a functionally important motif found in several megakaryocytic promoters (see “Discussion”). In addition to the “footprint,” protein binding induces the formation of a DNase I hypersensitive site that maps to the first 5′-cytosine nucleotide located within the consensus ACTTCCT at −44. Several transcription factors (43Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) originally identified in detailed structural analyses of tissue-specific promoters have proven to be key regulators in hematopoietic differentiation. Examples include NFE2 in megakaryocyte and erythrocyte development (44Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J.M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar); PU.1, which is expressed in several hematopoietic lineages (45Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Of the four GPIb-V-IX subunit genes, only the GPIbα promoter has been well characterized (36Hashimoto Y. Ware J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24532-24539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The work described here defines two negative regulatory domains, two positive regulatory domains, and positive GATA and Ets cis-acting elements in the GPIX upstream 5′-flanking region. Targeted disruption of the GPIX GATA and Ets sites reduced promoter activity by approximately 85 and 75%, respectively. GATA and Ets cis-acting sites regulate expression of several megakaryocyte-specific genes including GPIIb (32LeMarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel C. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell.

Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition to megakaryocytic promoters, GATA and Ets consensus sites are also important for the regulation of genes with a wider expression such as PECAM-1 (50Gumina R.J. Kirschbaum N. Piotrowski K. Newman P.J. Blood. 1995; 86 (Suppl. 1 (abstr.)): 1797Google Scholar) and P-selectin (51Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are expressed in both megakaryocytes and endothelial cells. Members of the GATA family of transcription factors are defined by a similar binding motif, 5′-GATAA-3′, and a high degree of sequence similarity in their zinc finger DNA binding domains (52Weiss M.J.

Experiments have demonstrated in vitro GATA-1 binding in the GATA sites of the GPIIb promoter (60Martin F. Prandini M.-H. Thevenon D. Marguerie G. Uzan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21606-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the GPIb-V-IX complex is expressed later than GPIIb during megakaryocyte development (25Breton-Gorius J. Vainchenker W. Semin. Hematol. 1986; 23: 43-67PubMed Google Scholar); and since GATA-1 is only expressed early in megakaryocyte maturation while GATA-2 expression continues unabated (52Weiss M.J.

The Ets family of transcription factors share similar amino-terminal DNA binding domains that bind to cis-acting elements with a core consensus binding sequence of GGAA (64Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L.

In vitro binding studies have identified Ets-1 and Ets-2 binding in the GPIIb promoter, and it is possible that one or both of these factors regulate expression of GPIX. Deletion mutagenesis identifies two positive regulatory domains at −323 to −311 and −151 to −100 relative to the GPIX transcription start site (Fig. 1). Computer analysis done by utilizing the Transcription Factor Database program (68Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) identified tandem GAGGAA sequences at −320 to −315 and −302 to −297, which are potential sites for PU.1 binding (69Goebl M.G.

Elimination of the GPIX upstream flanking region between −323 and −311 reduces promoter activity 3-fold and identifies a relatively well circumscribed regulatory domain that includes the distal potential PU.1 site. PU.1 is a member of the Ets transcription factor family (69Goebl M.G. Cell. 1990; 61: 1165-1166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 70Paul R. Schuetze S. Kozak S.L. Kozak C.A. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 464-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein has been identified immunohistochemically in megakaryocytes, and PU.1 mRNA has been detected in HEL cells (71Hromas R. Orazi A. Neiman R.S. Blood. 1993; 82: 2998-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although tandem repeats of PU.1 binding sites are known to regulate expression of several myeloid- and lymphoid-specific genes (72Schwarzenbach H. Newell J.W. Matthias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 898-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 73Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), regulation of megakaryocyte-specific genes by PU.1 has not been described. Thus, although it is possible that PU.1 or another transcription factor is important for GPIX promoter activity in this region, this is only speculation. Elimination of promoter sequences between −151 and −100 reduced promoter activity approximately 3- to 5-fold. Homology searches using the Transcription Factor Database program (68Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) did not identify any sites that are known to regulate other hematopoietic genes. However, the program did identify a 5′-GAGGCGCT-3′ at −113 to −106, which regulates expression of sea urchin actin (74Thiebaud P. Goodstein M. Calzone F.J. Theze N. Britten R.J. Davidson E.H. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1999-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and a potential steroid-responsive element (75Chan G.C.-K. Hess P. Meenakshi T. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-A.

The GPIX promoter has a weak negative regulatory domain between −686 and −423 and a strong negative domain between −311 and −203. Negative regulation of promoter activity is emerging as a common theme in megakaryocyte-specific promoters. Transcriptional silencer domains have been identified upstream of the human PF-4 gene (77Ramachandran B. Surrey S. Schwartz E. Exp.

Blood. 1995; 86 (Suppl. 1 (abstr.)): 2198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described two sites in the GPIIb promoter that mediate transcriptional repression in transiently transfected cells at −120 to −116 (5′-TGAGT-3′) and −102 to −93 (5′-CCCTTTGCTC-3′) relative to the GPIIb transcription start site. Sequence analysis of the GPIX promoter identified an exact duplicate of the GPIIb 5′-TGAGT-3′ hexamer at −455 to −451 within the −686 to −423 negative regulatory domain of the GPIX promoter. In addition, within the strong −311 to −203 GPIX negative repressor domain, there are two sequences at −282 to −273 and −263 to −254 that are similar to the GPIIb CCTTTGCTC sequence. However, the similarity is highly degenerate with three mismatches in each GPIX site. In summary, molecular dissection of the GPIX promoter has identified several positive and negative regulatory elements. In addition, two of these cis-acting elements, Ets and GATA consensus sites, show functional activity that correlates with in vitro binding activity. Further studies are in progress to better define the precise locations of cis-acting sites within the positive and negative regulatory domains and to characterize the factors that bind them."

INTRODUCTIONBacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts contain a membrane-bound ATP synthase that is responsible for ATP synthesis coupled to oxidation or light capture reactions. In bacteria this enzyme may also act as an ATPase to generate the trans-membrane proton gradient. Understanding the mechanism of ATP synthesis and ATP-driven proton pumping is the goal of many laboratories. While useful hypotheses have been generated (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 2Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), none is yet widely accepted, because catalysis has not yet been described in sufficient experimental detail.ATP synthases are composed of two sectors, the F0 which forms a trans-membrane proton conduction path, and the F1 which contains three catalytic nucleotide-binding sites, one on each of the three β-subunits. F1 may be isolated in soluble form and has proved valuable for experimental studies. A detailed structure of bovine mitochondrial F1 was recently resolved by x-ray crystallography (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). Ease of genetic manipulation has meant that the Escherichia coli enzyme has also been extensively studied (for reviews see Refs. 4Fillingame R.H. Krulwich T.A. The Bacteria.

Wilkens S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 284-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and because the sequences of the β-subunits are strongly conserved, we may conclude that their structure will be very similar from whatever source.The three catalytic sites of E. coli F1 show widely different affinities for substrate MgATP (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substoichiometric amounts of MgATP bind very tightly to catalytic site one (Kd = 10−10M, Ref. 8Senior A.E. Lee R.S.F. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). MgATP hydrolysis is very slow when only this first site is occupied (“unisite catalysis”). Because of the low dissociation rates of substrate and products, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for unisite catalysis can be measured by using the centrifuge column technique to separate enzyme-bound from free ligands (9Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this approach has yielded considerable functional insights into catalysis, particularly when combined with mutational or environmental modification of the catalytic sites (10Senior A.E. Weber J. Al-Shawi M.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol.

Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).To achieve physiological catalysis rates, however, additional catalytic sites must be filled with MgATP (“multisite catalysis”; for reviews see Refs. 14Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar, 15Senior A.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Analysis of substrate binding parameters under multisite catalysis conditions required the development of a rapid, true equilibrium, analytical technique. Recently, we designed and applied such a technique (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3474-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By specifically introducing a tryptophan residue into the adenine-binding subdomain of E. coli F1 catalytic sites, at position β331, and using its fluorescence to monitor catalytic site occupancy, we were able to show that (i) all three catalytic sites must be filled to obtain physiological MgATP hydrolysis rates; (ii) the rate of hydrolysis of MgATP when only two sites are filled is slow (0-2% of Vmax); and (iii) in absence of Mg2+ (conditions under which there is no hydrolysis) the pronounced binding cooperativity observed with MgATP is absent and all three sites bind ATP with equal affinity.The next logical step in analysis of multisite catalysis is to determine, under steady-state MgATP hydrolysis conditions, what fraction of the three catalytic sites is filled with MgATP and what fraction with MgADP. A prerequisite would be a probe that can differentiate between bound MgATP and bound MgADP. Due to its location in the adenine-binding subdomain of the catalytic sites, residue βTrp-331 responds to binding of the base moiety, and its fluorescence is virtually completely quenched upon addition of MgATP, MgADP, MgAMPPNP, MgTNP-ATP, free ATP, free ADP, or free TNP-ATP (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3474-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, no differentiation between bound nucleoside di- or triphosphate is possible on the basis of the βTrp-331 fluorescence signal.Model experiments have suggested that tryptophan fluorescence is susceptible to the electric field of a charge in the immediate environment (18Bivin D.B. Kubota S. Pearlstein R. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6791-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, a tryptophan residue located close to the γ-phosphate might respond differently to bound MgATP versus MgADP. As shown by comparison of several known protein structures (19Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), and confirmed in the x-ray structure of bovine mitochondrial F1 (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar), the “Homology A” or “P-loop” motif (20Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar) surrounds the phosphates of a bound nucleotide molecule. Therefore, to obtain an optical probe with the desired properties, we decided to introduce tryptophan residues close to the P-loop in the catalytic sites of F1.At first glance, none of the amino acid residues within the P-loop in E. coli F1 catalytic sites (β149GGAGVGKT156) appeared to be a promising candidate, i.e. where replacement by Trp would preserve enzyme function. One possible exception was βVal-153, since it was shown that substitution of this Val by Tyr in yeast F1 gave partially functional enzyme (21Shen H. Yao B. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other candidates, not within but very close to the P-loop, were βPhe-148 and βAsn-158. The latter is Leu in mitochondrial and chloroplast F1. Therefore, we generated βF148W, βV153W, and βN158W mutants, and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio for fluorescence experiments the mutations were expressed from plasmid pOW1, in which all of the nine natural tryptophan residues present in wild-type F1 have been replaced (22Wilke-Mounts S. Weber J. Grell E. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the effects of the mutations in whole cells and the characteristics of the isolated mutant F1 enzymes, particularly in regard to their fluorescence properties.DISCUSSIONThe first goal of this study was to generate a tryptophan fluorescence probe able to differentiate between an empty catalytic site, an MgATP-filled site, and an MgADP-filled site, in E. coli F1-ATPase. A further goal was to use the probe to establish fractional occupancy of the the three catalytic sites by MgATP and MgADP during steady-state hydrolysis. We introduced Trp in three different positions within or close to the P-loop (20Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar) by generating the mutations βF148W, βV153W, and βN158W, and we expressed each mutant in “tryptophan-free F1” (22Wilke-Mounts S. Weber J. Grell E. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) so that the introduced Trp was the sole Trp residue. Two of the Trp residues, βTrp-153 and βTrp-158, were able to distinguish between an empty and a nucleotide-occupied site but gave the same response (quenching of fluorescence) on binding of MgATP, MgAMPPNP, or MgADP. The third, βTrp-148, fulfilled the requirements, because it gave quenching of fluorescence with MgADP (at 350 nm) and an enhancement of fluorescence with MgAMPPNP and MgADP·BeFx (at 325 nm). Moreover, with MgATP both quenching of fluorescence at 350 nm and an enhancement at 325 nm occurred simultaneously, showing that βTrp-148 differentially senses bound unhydrolyzed MgATP and bound product MgADP in catalytic sites under steady-state hydrolysis conditions. The βF148W mutant strain showed normal growth characteristics under oxidative phosphorylation conditions, and enzymatic characteristics of purified βF148W F1 were similar to those of wild-type enzyme.The fluorescence spectra of residues βTrp-153 and βTrp-158, in absence of nucleotides in the binding site, indicated that their environments are highly nonpolar and that of βTrp-148 indicated a moderately nonpolar environment. Previous work with the βY331W mutant enzyme has shown that in absence of bound nucleotide, the catalytic sites are highly polar and likely to be filled with water molecules (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus all three Trp residues studied here are probably buried in the protein matrix, pointing away from the nucleotide.Upon binding of MgADP, MgAMPPNP, and MgATP the fluorescence of βTrp-153 and βTrp-158 was quenched. The simplest explanation is that nucleotide binding leads to a change in the protein conformation in the direct environment of either Trp residue. The same explanation can be offered for the quenching of βTrp-148 fluorescence by MgADP. In contrast, binding of MgAMPPNP led to enhancement of βTrp-148 fluorescence, combined with a pronounced blue-shift of the spectrum. The MgADP·BeFx complex (which is known to closely mimic the prehydrolysis MgATP-bound state in myosin, Ref. 37Fisher A.J. Smith C.L. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) gave the same spectrum as MgAMPPNP. This response might also be explained as due to a conformational rearrangement of the protein, albeit different from that observed with MgADP. An attractive alternative explanation, however, is that the electric field of the negative charges introduced with the nucleotide γ-phosphate affects the Trp fluorescence (see Introduction). The fact that the MgADP·BeFx complex caused the same response as MgAMPPNP would be in agreement with either interpretation, as such a complex is isoelectronic and potentially isosteric with MgAMPPNP (and MgATP) (37Fisher A.J. Smith C.L. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar).Titration experiments were carried out with βF148W F1 in order to analyze the fluorescence responses with MgADP and MgAMPPNP (Fig. 4, A and B). Quantitative evaluation of the results was affected by the small size of the responses; nevertheless, several conclusions could be drawn with confidence. With either nucleotide, binding cooperativity was evident, and in both cases the data fit reasonably well to a model assuming one site of higher affinity and two sites of lower affinity. This model was established from previous work with the βY331W enzyme (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which displays a far superior tryptophan fluorescence signal and is representative of wild-type in enzymatic properties. Thus, for MgADP and MgAMPPNP the lower Kd corresponds to binding to catalytic site one and the higher Kd corresponds to binding to catalytic sites two and three. The fluorescence signals reached saturation at mM ligand concentrations, i.e. 1 order of magnitude above Km(MgATP), as was also seen with the βY331W enzyme (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and under these conditions all three catalytic sites would therefore be filled with ligand.We next studied the fluorescence responses of βTrp-148 upon titration of βF148W F1 with MgATP concentrations ranging from 0.2 µM up to mM. The data were described in Fig. 5, A-C, and show several important features. At MgATP concentrations sufficient to achieve Vmax rates of hydrolysis, all three catalytic sites became occupied by nucleotide, consistent with our previous work (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the lowest concentration of MgATP of 0.2 µM (where [MgATP] ≈ [F1]) around 0.6 mol total nucleotide was bound per mol F1, corresponding to binding to the highest affinity catalytic site one. When the concentration of MgATP in the medium was raised to 5 µM and above, the average nucleotide occupancy rose, as catalytic site two began to fill. However, even immediately after mixing the amount of bound MgATP never exceeded 1 mol/mol, which indicates that upon binding of MgATP to site two, hydrolysis of MgATP bound at site one was a fast reaction, and release of MgADP from site one was slow, consistent with the slow net turnover rate under these conditions. Further increase of the MgATP concentration up to mM concentrations was sufficient to fill all three catalytic sites and to achieve Vmax rates of hydrolysis. Under steady-state turnover conditions one-third of the catalytic sites contained MgATP and two-thirds contained MgADP (Fig. 6).A model for steady-state, “multisite” MgATP hydrolysis based on these findings is presented in Fig. 7. In the model, the catalytic site with highest affinity for MgATP is designated as H, the site with intermediate affinity is designated as M, and the site with lowest affinity for MgATP is designated as L. After release of MgADP from site L in the previous reaction cycle, site H contains MgATP, site M contains MgADP, and site L is transiently unoccupied (State D in Fig. 7). Then site L fills rapidly with MgATP from the medium (kcat/KM ~106M−1 s−1) to yield State A in Fig. 7. Instantaneously, MgATP at site H is hydrolyzed to MgADP + Pi; this process triggers a synchronized switch in affinity at all three catalytic sites, which is shown by the arrows in State B, Fig. 7. In another fast reaction, Pi is released from the (now) site M, resulting in State C, Fig. 7. Subsequent MgADP release from site L is the rate-limiting step in the cycle. Consequently, State C is the most populous state of all the enzyme molecules present under steady-state MgATP hydrolysis conditions, and the fluorescence response obtained reflects State C. The model incorporates information from previous models in that it involves three catalytic sites, of widely differing affinity for MgATP, with positive catalytic cooperativity observed on binding of MgATP to the lowest affinity site, and a synchronized change in affinity of the sites at one step of the catalytic cycle (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 2Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The essential feature of this model is that it accounts for the new finding from the fluorescence experiments that two of the sites are occupied by MgADP and only one by MgATP in the form of enzyme that predominates in time-average during the catalytic cycle in steady-state MgATP hydrolysis. It may be inferred that this is a necessary feature for the reverse reaction, namely steady-state Δ˜µH+-driven MgATP synthesis.In the structure of mitochondrial F1 obtained by x-ray crystallography (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar), one catalytic site is occupied by MgAMPPNP and one site by MgADP, whereas the other site is empty. In our model (Fig. 7) this corresponds to State D. Our data show that this form of the enzyme is present as only a small fraction of the molecules during steady-state catalysis; nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to suppose that under the crystallization conditions used (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) this form of the enzyme may have been selectively sequestered into the crystals.It is relevant to point out that during catalysis there are potentially at least two states through which the catalytic site passes in addition to the MgATP- and the MgADP-bound states, namely the catalytic transition state and the “MgADP + Pi”-bound state. X-ray crystallographic analysis of other ATP- or GTP-hydrolyzing enzymes has suggested that the catalytic transition state is mimicked by bound MgADP·AlF−4 complex (37Fisher A.J. Smith C.L. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 39Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). We generated the βF148W F1·MgADP·AlF−4 complex (see “Experimental Procedures”) and found that its fluorescence spectrum resembled that seen on addition of mM concentration of MgATP (as in Fig. 3C), that is to say it contained characteristics of both MgADP-bound and MgAMPPNP-bound forms. One interpretation of this result is that this spectrum truly represents that of the catalytic transition state. However, the experiment is ambiguous because it is also possible that under these conditions a fraction of the catalytic sites is in the MgADP-bound state. This would be the case, for example, if the F1 mechanism mandates that only one of the catalytic sites can be in the catalytic transition state at any given time, as appears to be the case for P-glycoprotein (41Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 377: 285-289Google Scholar). Since the time spent in the catalytic transition state is very short in comparison to the time spent in the ground states, the contribution to the overall fluorescence signal during steady-state catalysis should be small. It would be valuable to obtain a probe that sensed the transition state specifically.We also attempted to determine the contribution of the “MgADP + Pi”-bound state to the overall fluorescence signal. It was found that addition of Pi together with MgADP had no effect on the βTrp-148 fluorescence response (see “Results”). In all likelihood, however, this is due to the fact that an F1·MgADP + Pi complex was not generated. Previous work has shown that Pi by itself has very weak binding affinity at catalytic sites in soluble F1, and addition of Pi does not affect the binding affinity of MgADP (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12653-12658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are limitations as to how far we can dissect the catalytic cycle in respect to differential rates of release of Pi versus MgADP using the current data. However, it should be pointed out that the model of Fig. 7 must be essentially correct in that, since a state with all three catalytic sites occupied with nucleotide (one MgATP and two MgADP) is the predominant long-lived species during the catalytic cycle, there is clearly no possibility that release of MgADP precedes that of Pi.Given the small size of the underlying fluorescence responses and other considerations discussed above, we stress that the model of Fig. 7 is a working hypothesis. It is hoped that in the future different Trp probes can be developed to test and extend the model, for example by specifically reporting the catalytic transition state or the presence or absence of Pi. The most important contribution of the current work is to demonstrate for the first time that reaction events occurring at the catalytic sites of F1-ATPase during steady-state catalysis are amenable to analysis using direct optical probes.Finally it may be noted that, given the general similarity of structure of the P-loop sequence in many nucleotide-binding proteins, and the fact that βTrp-148 was specifically inserted in the position immediately preceding the first residue of the P-loop, there seems to be a good chance that insertion of Trp at the equivalent position might provide a valuable probe to distinguish bound nucleoside triphosphate from diphosphate in a range of different proteins and enzymes. INTRODUCTIONBacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts contain a membrane-bound ATP synthase that is responsible for ATP synthesis coupled to oxidation or light capture reactions. In bacteria this enzyme may also act as an ATPase to generate the trans-membrane proton gradient. Understanding the mechanism of ATP synthesis and ATP-driven proton pumping is the goal of many laboratories. While useful hypotheses have been generated (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 2Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), none is yet widely accepted, because catalysis has not yet been described in sufficient experimental detail.ATP synthases are composed of two sectors, the F0 which forms a trans-membrane proton conduction path, and the F1 which contains three catalytic nucleotide-binding sites, one on each of the three β-subunits. F1 may be isolated in soluble form and has proved valuable for experimental studies. A detailed structure of bovine mitochondrial F1 was recently resolved by x-ray crystallography (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). Ease of genetic manipulation has meant that the Escherichia coli enzyme has also been extensively studied (for reviews see Refs. 4Fillingame R.H. Krulwich T.A. The Bacteria.

Wilkens S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 284-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and because the sequences of the β-subunits are strongly conserved, we may conclude that their structure will be very similar from whatever source.The three catalytic sites of E. coli F1 show widely different affinities for substrate MgATP (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substoichiometric amounts of MgATP bind very tightly to catalytic site one (Kd = 10−10M, Ref. 8Senior A.E. Lee R.S.F. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). MgATP hydrolysis is very slow when only this first site is occupied (“unisite catalysis”). Because of the low dissociation rates of substrate and products, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for unisite catalysis can be measured by using the centrifuge column technique to separate enzyme-bound from free ligands (9Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this approach has yielded considerable functional insights into catalysis, particularly when combined with mutational or environmental modification of the catalytic sites (10Senior A.E. Weber J. Al-Shawi M.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol.

Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).To achieve physiological catalysis rates, however, additional catalytic sites must be filled with MgATP (“multisite catalysis”; for reviews see Refs. 14Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar, 15Senior A.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Analysis of substrate binding parameters under multisite catalysis conditions required the development of a rapid, true equilibrium, analytical technique. Recently, we designed and applied such a technique (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3474-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By specifically introducing a tryptophan residue into the adenine-binding subdomain of E. coli F1 catalytic sites, at position β331, and using its fluorescence to monitor catalytic site occupancy, we were able to show that (i) all three catalytic sites must be filled to obtain physiological MgATP hydrolysis rates; (ii) the rate of hydrolysis of MgATP when only two sites are filled is slow (0-2% of Vmax); and (iii) in absence of Mg2+ (conditions under which there is no hydrolysis) the pronounced binding cooperativity observed with MgATP is absent and all three sites bind ATP with equal affinity.The next logical step in analysis of multisite catalysis is to determine, under steady-state MgATP hydrolysis conditions, what fraction of the three catalytic sites is filled with MgATP and what fraction with MgADP. A prerequisite would be a probe that can differentiate between bound MgATP and bound MgADP. Due to its location in the adenine-binding subdomain of the catalytic sites, residue βTrp-331 responds to binding of the base moiety, and its fluorescence is virtually completely quenched upon addition of MgATP, MgADP, MgAMPPNP, MgTNP-ATP, free ATP, free ADP, or free TNP-ATP (7Weber J.

This raised the possibility that the intensity of PLCβ stimulation, and thus the type of the [Ca2+]i signal transduced, is determined by whether PLCβ is activated by Gβγ or Gαq/11. Another potential mechanism by which Gβγ and/or Gαq can regulate Ca2+ signaling is by affecting the different Ca2+ transporting pathways regulating [Ca2+]i (Muallem, 24Muallem S. Putney Jr., J.W. Advances In Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research. Raven Press, New York1992: 351Google Scholar), in particular the IP3-activated Ca2+ channel (IPACC). It has been shown that this channel is regulated by several kinases and phosphatases (Cameron et al., 6Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar; Zhang, et al., 47Zhang B.-X. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10997-11001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the activity of which may be regulated by G proteins. In addition, we showed recently that G proteins regulate two distinct steps in Ca2+ signaling. Stimulation of all cellular G proteins by high concentrations of GTPγS activates PLC to generate IP3. Selective stimulation of G proteins with low concentration of GTPγS or AlF3 regulates the apparent affinity of the IPACC for IP3 to allow robust agonist-mediated Ca2+ release at IP3 levels present in resting cells (Xu et al., 45Xu X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (b): 11737-11744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The latter effect is independent of PLC activation or IP3 metabolism (Xu et al., 45Xu X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (b): 11737-11744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and may be mediated by the Gβγ released from the G proteins affected by the low concentration of GTPγS. To begin to understand how G proteins regulate Ca2+ signaling, in the present study we determined the type of [Ca2+]i signal transduced by activation of Gαq/11 or Gβγ by various Ca2+-mobilizing agonists in pancreatic acinar cells. Infusion through a patch pipette of purified Gβγ, the Gβγ binding protein βARK fragment, the Gβγ scavenger Gαi1G203A, and a Gαq/11 inhibitory antibody, before or after cell stimulation, showed that agonist-dependent activation of Gβγ leads to Ca2+ oscillations, whereas activation of Gαq/11 results in a sustained response. Hence, agonists use selective activation of Gβγ or Gαq/11 to specify the pattern of the Ca2+ signal to be transduced. The standard bath solution (solution A) contained (in mM) 140 NaCl; 5 KCl; 1 MgCl2; 1 CaCl2; 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette (intracellular) solution contained (in mM) 140 KCl; 1 MgCl2; 0.2 EGTA; 5 Na2ATP, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3 with KOH). The Gβγ subunit (a generous gift from Dr. P.

For use in the present experiments batches of Gβγ were dialyzed with a solution containing 140 mM KCl 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH), and 0.2% sodium cholate. Reduction in the sodium cholate concentration was required to obtain stable seals. The βARK1 fragment and a GST peptide (a generous gift from Drs. B. Stoffel and R. Lefkowitz, Duke University, Durham) were dialyzed with a solution containing 140 mM KCl and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH) and concentrated to about 1 mM using centricone filters. Control experiments showed that the GST peptide had no effect on [Ca2+]i signaling by Gβγ or the agonists. Recombinant mutated Gαi1G203A (a generous gift from Drs. A. Raw, J. Hepler and A. Gilman, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) was prepared using a procedure described before (Lee et al., 20Lee E. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1212-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at −80°C in a solution containing 1 mM EDTA and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6 with KOH). The Gαq/11 antibodies (a generous gift from Dr. P. Sternweis) were raised against the C-terminal portion of Gαq as described (Gutowski et al., 12Gutowski S. Smrcka A. Nowak L. Wu D. Simon M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20519-20524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IgG fraction was purified and gel-filtrated through a G-50 Sephadex column in a solution containing 120 mM KCl and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). Preimmune serum was obtained from the animals that were used to obtain the anti Gαq/11 antibodies. The antibodies and serum were stored at −80°C until use. In control experiments the preimmune serum had no effect on ICl−(Ca2+). Proteins were diluted at least 25-fold with the pipette solution to obtain the desired final concentrations. Single rat pancreatic acinar cells were prepared by a standard technique (Muallem et al., 25Muallem S. Pandol S. Beeker T.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 255 (a): 301-307PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the pancreas of a 75-100-g rat was removed, minced, and incubated in an 0.025% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA solution (Sigma) for 5 min at 37°C. The tissue was washed, and single cells were liberated by a 7-min incubation at 37°C in solution A containing 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 160 units/ml pure collagenase (CLSP, Worthington). The cells were washed and kept on ice until use. The tight seal whole cell current recording of the patch clamp technique was used (Hamill et al., 13Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15119) Google Scholar) for measurement of ICl−(Ca2+). Numerous studies by O. H. Petersen group and others (Petersen, 31Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar) have shown that in pancreatic acini this ICl−(Ca2+) faithfully follows changes in [Ca2+]i measured with fluorescent dyes and can be used to monitor changes in [Ca2+]i in whole cell voltage-clamped acinar cells. The experiments were carried out at room temperature using the standard bath and pipette solutions. The patch pipettes had resistance of 3-5 MΩ. Seals of better than 5 GΩ (range 6-10) were produced on the cell membrane, and the whole cell configuration was established by gentle suction or voltage pulses of 0.5 V for 0.3-1 ms. Formation of the whole cell configuration was followed by an increase in capacitance and noise. The patch clamp output (Axopatch-1B, Axon Instruments) was filtered at 20 Hz. Recording was performed with pclamp6 and a Digi-Data 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). In most experiments acinar cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of −30 mV, and depolarizing voltage jumps of 100-ms duration at a frequency of 1 Hz to a membrane potential of +10 mV were repetitively applied throughout the experiment to measure the leak current. In some experiments the cells were voltage-clamped at −30 mV, and leak current was measured only at the beginning and the end of experiments. In all experiments shown the Cl− and cation equilibrium potential was about 0 mV. All the traces shown were at a holding potential of −30 mV and were corrected for the leak currents. Oscillations of [Ca2+]i were followed by measuring the current mediated by the Ca2+-activated Cl− channels (ICl−(Ca2+)) (Petersen, 31Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar; Thorn et al., 39Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Infusion of Gβγ through the patch pipette, by including 200 nM Gβγ purified from bovine brain in the pipette solution, evoked two types of [Ca2+] oscillations as illustrated in Fig. 1, a and b. In 27/43 (63%) cells rapid oscillations in ICl−(Ca2+) with an amplitude of 115 ± 43 pA and a return of the current to near base line were observed (Fig. 1a). In 16/43 (37%) of the cells the ICl−(Ca2+) developed more slowly, each transient lasted for a longer period of time, and the frequency of the oscillations was low. In these cells ICl−(Ca2+) averaged 164 ± 30 pA. Preliminary experiments suggest that the pattern of the oscillations was not a function of the Gβγ concentrations. In 3/8 experiments with 80 nM Gβγ a response similar to that in Fig. 1b and in 3/6 experiments with 700 nM Gβγ a response similar to that in Fig. 1a were observed. For this analysis only cells responding to both Gβγ infusion and agonist stimulation were included. In an additional eight experiments the cells responded to agonist, but the Gβγ-induced oscillations were less than twice the noise. In all experiments in which Gβγ induced clear oscillations (n = 57), subsequent stimulation with high agonist concentration always further increased ICl−(Ca2+) to produce a sustained, nonoscillatory response (Fig. 1a). This indicates that Gβγ could mobilize part but not all of the Ca2+ stored in the IP3-mobilizable pool. Among the noted characteristics of the Gβγ-induced oscillations is the relatively rapid activation of ICl−(Ca2+), usually within 30 s of establishing the whole cell configuration. Subsequently, the amplitude of the oscillations continued to increase and reached its maximal value after about 120-150 s of cell dialysis (Fig. 1, a and b). This was significantly faster than expected from theoretical considerations (see below). The high concentration of Gβγ used and its hydrophobicity may account for the rapid onset of Ca2+ oscillation by Gβγ. The specificity of the Gβγ effect is documented in Fig. 1, c-f. Infusion of as high as 700 nM boiled Gβγ had no effect on ICl−(Ca2+) (n = 4) (Fig. 1c). 47.4 µM of the βARK fragment, which binds Gβγ and inhibits its activity (Koch et al., 18Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Koch et al., 19Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), completely inhibited the effect of 200 nM Gβγ (n = 6) (Fig. 1d). The recombinant mutant Gα subunit, αi1G203A, avidly binds Gβγ and subsequently fails to undergo a GTP- or GTPγS-induced conformational change necessary for dissociation from Gβγ, 2A. Raw, J. R. Hepler, and A. G. Gilman, personal communication. similar to previous findings made with the equivalent αs (Lee et al., 20Lee E. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1212-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and αo (Slepak et al., 33Slepak V.Z. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1414-1423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mutants. Thus, Gαi1G203A effectively scavenges and inhibits the effect of Gβγ. At 200 nM, αi1G203A partially inhibited oscillations evoked by 200 nM Gβγ (Fig. 1e), whereas 400 nMαi1G203A completely inhibited the effect of 200 nM Gβγ in all experiments tested (n = 5) (Fig. 1f). Fig. 2 shows that Gβγ evoked ICl−(Ca2+) oscillations by Ca2+ release from the IP3-mobilizable intracellular pool. Thus, removal of extracellular Ca2+ did not prevent the oscillations (n = 4) (Fig. 2a); buffering the cytosol with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid to prevent changes in [Ca2+]i prevented Gβγ-dependent oscillations and greatly attenuated the effect of 10 µM carbachol (n = 3) (Fig. 2b). Finally, including 1.5 mg/ml heparin, a selective inhibitor of IPACC (Ghosh et al., 10Ghosh T.K. Eis P.S. Mullaney J.M. Ebert C.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11075-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Zhao et al., 48Zhao Khademazad M. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14822-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the pipette solution inhibited the effect of Gβγ and that of the agonist (Fig. 2c). Similar results were obtained in five additional experiments using between 1.5 and 2.5 mg/ml heparin. The overall results in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 show that Gβγ specifically evokes Ca2+ oscillations when infused into pancreatic acinar cells. To determine the role of Gβγ in agonist-mediated Ca2+ oscillations, we tested the effects of αi1G203A and the βARK fragment on agonist-induced ICl−(Ca2+). Fig. 3, Fig. 4 show that both αi1G203A and the βARK fragment inhibited the oscillations induced by three different agonists, which bind to separate receptors in acinar cells (Williams and Yule, 41Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Go V.W. The Pancreas, Biology, Pathobiology, and Disease. Raven Press, New York1993: 167Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 were separated for clarity but are described together to highlight the finding that inhibition of Gβγ inhibited oscillations evoked by all major Ca2+-mobilizing agonists and the different patterns of Ca2+ oscillations evoked by each of the agonists. Oscillations of ICl−(Ca2+) were initiated with a low and a sustained response with high agonist concentrations (Figs. 3a, 4a, 4c, and 4e). With all agonists the oscillatory current was between 80 and 200 pA, whereas maximal concentration of the various agonists caused a single large transient increase in ICl−(Ca2+) of between 500 and 1000 pA (note the different scales for the oscillatory and sustained ICl−(Ca2+) in both figures). Preliminary studies showed that maximal effects with all inhibitory proteins were achieved within 200-250 s of dialysis. Considering the size of these proteins, all in the range of 40 kDa, this is the time expected from theoretical consideration of diffusion of substances in solutions (see below). This indicates minimal binding of the proteins used to the glass pipette and minimal hindrance for diffusion of molecules from pipettes to cells. However, to ensure complete equilibration of proteins between pipette solution and the cell interior, 400 s of dialysis with the various peptides was allowed before cell stimulation was initiated.Fig. 4Inhibition of Gβγ inhibits all forms of agonist-evoked Ca2+ signaling. In all experiments the cells were dialyzed for 400 s with the control pipette solution (a, c, and e) that also contained 47.4 µMβARK (b and f) or 450 nM Gαi1G203A (d) before stimulation with the indicated agonists. The concentration of the proteins in the pipette solution and the agonists in the bath solution are indicated in the figure. The 100-pA current scale applies to the period of stimulation with low and high agonist concentrations. The 250-pA current scale applies to the period of stimulation with high agonist concentration in a and e, as indicated by the break in the tracings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dialysis with 150 nMαi1G203A largely inhibited the oscillations (Fig. 3b) and reduced the sustained response by all agonists by about 84 ± 16% (n = 11). At 450 nM, αi1G203A completely inhibited agonist-evoked Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 4d) and better than 90% (n = 6) of the sustained response. The results in Figs. 3c, 4b, and 4f show that the βARK fragment was as effective as αi1G203A in inhibiting the different patterns of ICl−(Ca2+) oscillations and the sustained response induced by carbachol (Fig. 3c), bombesin (Fig. 4b), and CCK (Fig. 4f). The βARK fragment also inhibited oscillations evoked by the partial CCK agonist, CCK-J180 (not shown). This partial agonist binds to state A of the CCK receptor to exclusively induce [Ca2+]i oscillations (Matozaki et al., 23Matozaki T. Goke B. Tsunoda Y. Rodriguez M. Martinez J. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6247-6254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Loessberg et al., 22Loessberg P.A. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1363-1366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diffusion of charged and uncharged molecules from a patch pipette into cells depends on several properties of the molecules, pipettes, and the cells. Pusch and Neher (32Pusch M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. 1988; 411: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) have shown that for most molecules equilibration time between pipette solution and cells follows a single exponential time course and is approximated by Equations 1 and 2: τ=(0.6±0.17)⋅RA⋅M1/3(Eq. 1) and τ/τ0=V/V0(Eq. 2) where τ is the time constant in seconds, RA is the access resistance in MΩ, and M is the molecular mass of the diffusing molecule in daltons. Equation 2 is a volume scaling formula used to relate the time constant of the cell of interest (τ) to that of chromaphin cells (τ0), for which the constant 0.6 ± 0.17 was obtained. The proteins used in the present studies, Gβγ, Gα1i, and the βARK fragment all have a molecular mass of around 40 kDa, and the IgG anti Gαq/11 has a molecular mass around 150 kDa. The access resistance in our experiments averaged 9.9 ± 1.1 MΩ, and the dimensions of acinar cells are close to those of chromaphin cells (15-17 µm). Thus, it can be calculated that the 40-kDa proteins should equilibrate within about 204 s and the IgG within 316 s. As indicated above, preliminary experiments indeed showed that between 200 and 250 s of dialysis were required for obtaining maximal inhibition with the proteins of 40 kDa. Because of the design of the experiments in Fig. 6, Fig. 7, we performed the most extensive studies with the IgG anti Gαq/11. In 28 experiments with 40-240 µg/ml anti-Gαq/11 in the pipette solution, maximal inhibition was obtained when the antibody was above 80 µg/ml. The concentration of the antibody only affected the time of dialysis needed to achieve maximal inhibition. With 80 µg/ml, 7-10 min of dialysis were required for maximal inhibition. At higher concentrations, maximal inhibition was achieved faster. Two examples for the inhibition of agonist-evoked Ca2+ signaling by 200 µg/ml IgG anti-Gαq/11 are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a shows the protocol used to evaluate the inhibition and that nonimmune serum had no effect on Ca2+ signaling. At a designated time after establishing the whole cell configuration and starting the cytosolic dialysis, the cell was stimulated with maximal concentration of carbachol. Shortly afterwards the cell was inhibited with atropine to terminate the stimulation and force Ca2+ back into the internal stores for rapid and maximal reloading of the stores (Muallem et al. 26Muallem S. Schoeffield M. Fimmel C.J. Pandol S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255 (b): G221-G228PubMed Google Scholar; Muallem et al. 27Muallem S. Schoeffield M. Fimmel C.J. Pandol S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255 (c): G229-G235PubMed Google Scholar). After continuous dialysis with the pipette solution for an additional 400-500 s, the cells were stimulated with high concentration of bombesin (BS) to evaluate the additional inhibition gained by the continuous dialysis. Fig. 5, b and c, shows that about 120 s after establishing the whole cell configuration, 200 µg/ml anti-Gαq/11 inhibited the carbachol response by more than 80% (82 ± 7%, n = 10). Dialysis for an additional 400 s with the antibody increased the inhibition by only about 10% to 91 ± 6%. To show that the antibody did not affect the ICl−(Ca2+) itself or the electrical properties of the cells, the ICl−(Ca2+) was activated by increasing [Ca2+]i with ionomycin. The relatively rapid and extensive inhibition of the agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling by the high concentration of the antibody allowed us to determine their effect before and after cell stimulation as depicted in Fig. 6, Fig. 7.Fig. 7Scavenging Gβγ stabilizes the sustained response and scavenging Gαq uncovers the oscillations. The diagram in the upper panel shows the design of the experiments and the anticipated consequences of scavenging Gβγ or Gαq. In experiment a the pipette contained 47.5 µMβARK, and the cell was stimulated within 20 s of establishing the whole cell configuration. Where indicated stimulation was terminated with 10 µM atropine. Experiment b is the control for a. In experiment c the pipette containing 200 µg/ml anti-Gαq/11 and the cell was stimulated about 15 s after establishing the whole cell configuration. In experiment d the pipette contained both the βARK fragment and the Gαq antibodies to show that the oscillations in c required Gβγ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Time course of inhibition of agonist-evoked Ca2+ signaling by Gαq/11. Cells were dialyzed through a patch pipette with either 200 µg/ml preimmune serum (a) or 200 µg/ml IgG anti Gαq/11 (b and c). Where indicated, the cells were stimulated with high concentrations of carbachol (Car.). Shortly after maximal current was obtained, the cells were then inhibited with atropine and 400-500 s later they were restimulated with high concentrations of BS (Bom.). In experiments b and c at the end of the experiments the cells were exposed to 2 µM ionomycin (Ion.) to evoke maximal current.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the role of Gαq/11 in different aspects of agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i signaling, we first tested the effect of the Gαq/11 antibody on Ca2+ oscillations. Fig. 6a shows the control experiment in which ICl−(Ca2+) oscillations persisted for the duration of cell stimulation with 0.5 µM carbachol. Stimulation of the same cells with 10 µM carbachol produced the usual sustained response. In this set of experiments, dialyzing the cells for 250-400 s with 200 µg/ml of the Gαq/11 antibodies prior to the first cell stimulation completely inhibited the oscillations, and 87 ± 11% (n = 19) of the sustained response evoked by high carbachol concentrations, respectively (Fig. 6b). Inhibition of Ca2+ signaling by the Gαq11 antibodies can be because the antibodies prevented the dissociation of the Gq to its subunits or that binding of Gαq to the antibody is favored over its binding to PLC. To evaluate the role of Gαq/11 in [Ca2+]i oscillations independent of the effect of the antibodies on subunit dissociations, we took advantage of the need to dialyze the cells for 200-250 s with 200 µg/ml anti Gαq/11 for maximal inhibition of signaling. In Fig. 6c the cell was stimulated with 0.5 µM carbachol about 20 s after establishing the whole cell configuration, long before large amounts of antibodies entered the cytos"

Together, these findings suggest that PET100p is not required for the synthesis or localization of cytochrome c oxidase subunits to mitochondria, but is required at a later step in their assembly into an active holoenzyme. Cytochrome c oxidase is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial and some bacterial respiratory chains. This membrane protein catalyzes the final step of cellular respiration by relaying electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, forming water. The energy derived from this electron transfer drives the formation of a proton gradient. Prokaryotic cytochrome c oxidases consist of two subunits which carry four redox-active centers (heme a, heme a3, CuA, CuB) and one or two additional subunits (1Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 2Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, structural and functional homologues of three of the bacterial subunits are products of the mitochondrial genome (1Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 3Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two of these, subunits I and II, form the functional center of the enzyme (4Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). In addition to the mitochondrially encoded subunits, eukaryotic cytochrome c oxidases contain between four and ten subunits of nuclear origin. The number of these smaller subunits varies among species, and in some cases, depends on the isolation procedure used. Most of the structural and physiochemical data on eukaryotic cytochrome c oxidases have come from studies with the bovine heart muscle enzyme (4Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T.

However, yeast cytochrome c oxidase offers a distinct advantage for biosynthetic and genetic studies. Yeast is readily propagated on simple well defined media, can be grown in large quantities and is amenable to genetic manipulation. Unlike mammalian cells, yeast cells can grow fermentatively, without a functional respiratory system. Active preparations of yeast cytochrome c oxidase contain a total of nine subunits: three subunits (I, II, and III) encoded by mitochondrial genes (COX1, COX2, and COX3, respectively) and six subunits (IV, Va or Vb, VI, VII, VIIa, and VIII) encoded by nuclear genes COX4, COX5a or COX5b, COX6, COX7, COX9, and COX8, respectively (3Poyton R.O.

Subunits Va and Vb are interchangeable isoforms (5Trueblood C.E. Poyton R.O. Mol. Cell.

This enzyme is composed of equimolar amounts of each subunit, and like mammalian cytochrome c oxidases, can exist in the mitochondrial membrane as either a monomer or dimer. As discussed above, subunits I and II perform the catalytic functions of the enzyme. In general, less is known about the function of the nuclear-encoded subunits; however, some of them (subunits V and VIII) appear to modulate catalysis (7Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22473-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Taanman J.W. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18754-18761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insofar as the nine subunit enzyme is fully active, the function of these polypeptides is unknown. As reviewed recently (9Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), it is not yet clear if these polypeptides are bona fide subunits of the holoenzyme, polypeptides required for assembly, or contaminating polypeptides that co-purify with it. Recent studies on respiration-deficient yeast mutants have shown that the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase depends not only on the COX structural genes but also on a large number of other nuclear genes (13McEwen J.E.

Among these are genes required for expression of the mitochondrial COX genes, heme A synthesis, and assembly of a functional holoenzyme (9Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev.

Here, we report a new nuclear gene, PET100, whose encoded protein appears to specifically affect the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. The phenotype of a PET100 null mutant indicates that PET100p, like several other recently reported proteins (21McEwen J.E. Hong K.H. Park S. Preciado G.T. Curr.

Escherichia coli strain TGI (24Gibson, T. J., (1984) Studies on the Epstein-Barr Virus Genome. Ph.D. thesis, Cambridge University, UK.Google Scholar) was used for the propagation of plasmid DNA. The shuttle vector P366 (25Spencer F. Gerring S.L. Connelly C. Hieter P. Genetics. 1990; 124: 237-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing a yeast genomic library, was used for cloning the PET100 gene. This plasmid is derived from Ycp50 (26Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and contains a LEU2 gene in place of a URA3 gene as the selectable marker in yeast. The yeast genomic library in this plasmid consists of nuclear DNA, digested with Sau3AI to yield partial fragments averaging 10-12 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)kbpkilobase pair(s)TMPDtetramethyl-p-phenylenediamineORFopen reading framebpbase pair(s). in size. These fragments were ligated into the BamHI site of the vector. For subcloning, the centromeric vectors pFL36 or pFL38 were used (27Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G.Y. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Plasmid SK-PET100 was used to identify the ORF corresponding to PET100; it was constructed by inserting the 1.48-kb BamHI-PstI fragment from PET100 into the BamHI-PstI site in plasmid SK (28Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). kilobase(s) kilobase pair(s) tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine open reading frame base pair(s). The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Strains JM43, JM22, and BC123 have been described previously (13McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29McEwen J.E. Cameron V.L. Poyton R.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 831-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains B9-10B and B9-10D are derivatives of BC123 that carry a wild-type copy of the OP1 gene as well as a pet100-1 allele. They were constructed by crossing BC123 to JM43. The resulting diploids were sporulated, the meiotic products separated by micromanipulation, and the spores germinated at 30°C for 2-3 days on YPD medium. Tetrads that had four viable members were streaked onto a master plate, and the master plate was replica-plated onto YPG media. Both pet mutants and op1 mutants score as respiration-deficient, because neither can grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, e.g. glycerol. To specifically isolate cytochrome c oxidase-deficient mutants in an OP1+ background, colonies were stained with tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), a redox dye that donates electrons directly to the terminal region of the electron transport chain, which allows a rough determination of cytochrome c oxidase activity in yeast strains (13McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A modified version of the procedure of McEwen et al. (29McEwen J.E. Cameron V.L. Poyton R.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 831-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was followed. Colonies were grown on Hybond-N hybridization transfer membranes (Amersham Corp.) on solid YPD media in a Petri plate and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. The membrane was lifted from the plate, and cells were permeabilized by submerging the membrane in liquid nitrogen for about 2 min. Whatman blotting paper (3 mm) was saturated with a freshly prepared solution of 0.2% TMPD in 40 mM KPO4 buffer (pH 6.7). If the colonies contain active cytochrome c oxidase, the compound becomes oxidized and turns blue (TMPD+), whereas cytochrome c oxidase-deficient mutant colonies remain white (TMPD−). The threshold of cytochrome c oxidase activity that can be detected by the TMPD colony stain is between 3 and 8% of the activity of wild-type strains. Once identified, TMPD− colonies were selected and characterized for auxotrophic markers. B9-10B and B9-10D are both OP1+ pet100-1 strains but carry different auxotrophic markers (Table I). Strains CR7 and CR18 are OP1+ derivatives of the previously described strains A11 and A23 (13McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. From restriction mapping, subcloning, and sequence analysis, CR7 was found to carry a hem2 mutation (30Myers A.M. Crivellone M.D. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16822-16829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and A11 was found to carry a cox11 mutation (19Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol.

It was constructed by the one-step gene replacement method (31Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar) as follows. The LEU2 gene isolated as a BglII fragment from plasmid YEp13 (32Broach J.R. Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) was inserted into the BglII site of plasmid SK-PET100. The resulting plasmid, pCC-GD100, bearing the disruption of the PET100 gene, was digested with BamHI and PstI and used to transform JM43 to Leu+ prototrophy. Leu+ transformants were isolated, and the disruption was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. To establish that the bona fide PET100 gene has been cloned and disrupted, JM43GD100 was crossed to B9-10D, and the diploids were tested for their ability to grow on glycerol. In addition, the meiotic products were analyzed. Yeast strains were grown at 30°C in YPD (1% Difco yeast extract, 2% Difco Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose), YPGal (1% Difco yeast extract, 2% Difco Bacto-peptone, 2% galactose), YPG (1% Difco yeast extract, 2% Difco Bacto-peptone, 3% glycerol), and SC medium containing 0.2% drop out mix (33Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) and either 2% glucose or 3% glycerol as the carbon source. For heme supplementation, either hemin chloride (Sigma) or heme A (kindly provided by Dr. Winslow Caughey), dissolved in 50% ethanol, 20 mM NaOH at 3.75 mg/ml, was added to YPG at a final concentration of 26 µg/ml. Prototrophic selection for transformants containing PET100 was performed on SC medium containing 3% glycerol and lacking histidine, adenine, tryptophan, or uracil as required. Solid medium contained 2% agar. Strains were sporulated in YEPA (2% potassium acetate, 1% Difco yeast extract, 2% Difco Bacto-peptone) for 48 h at room temperature followed by incubation in SPM (0.3% potassium acetate, 0.02% raffinose) for 48 h at room temperature. E. coli strains were grown at 37°C in LB medium (0.5% Difco yeast extract, 1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl) supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin for selection of plasmid-bearing strains. The PET100 gene was isolated by genetic complementation of the pet100-1 mutation in strain B9-10B. Strain B9-10B was made competent for transformation by treatment with lithium acetate as described by Schiestl and Gietz (34Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar) and transformed with plasmid p366 (25Spencer F. Gerring S.L. Connelly C. Hieter P. Genetics. 1990; 124: 237-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing a yeast genomic library. Leu+ transformants were selected and then screened for growth on glycerol media lacking leucine. The smallest complementing insert was identified by restriction mapping and subcloning (see “Results”). Plasmid DNAs were purified from E. coli by the alkaline sodium dodecyl sulfate method (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast genomic DNA was purified as described (36Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The oligonucleotide primers used were 20 bases long and corresponded to polylinker sites in plasmid pFL38. Sequencing reactions were analyzed with multiple loadings on 6% acrylamide gels (Sequagel, National Diagnostics). DNA sequences were compared with sequences in the EMBL/GenBank™ data bases. Cleavage of DNA, electrophoresis of fragments, and blotting to nitrocellulose were performed as described (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Southern blots, yeast chromosomal DNA was cut using both ApaI-BamHI and PstI-BamHI and probed with a 1.48-kb radiolabeled fragment from the PET100 gene. The fragment used as probe was labeled by random priming (38Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed in a discontinuous buffer system using a modified version (39Power S.D. Lochrie M.A. Sevarino K.A. Patterson T.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259 (4745148): 6564-6570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of that published by Merle and Kadenbach (40Merle P. Kadenbach B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels composed of a 5.5-cm resolving gel (16% (w/v) 32:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 3.6 M urea, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.1% (w/v) SDS) topped with a 0.5-cm stacking gel (3.5% (w/v) 32:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 0.125 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Samples were dissolved in protein dissociation buffer (10 mM NaPO4 (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 4% (v/v) glycerol), heated at 37°C for 30 min, and boiled for 2 min. Electrophoresis was carried out at 110 V (constant voltage) for 3 h. Proteins were electroblotted to 0.45-mm nitrocellulose membranes for 1 h at 0.8 mA/cm2 gel in semidry transfer buffer consisting of 48 mM Tris base, 39 mM glycine, 0.037% SDS (w/v), and 20% methanol (pH 8.9). After electroblotting, the gels were stained in 25% (v/v) 2-propanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.05% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R-250, and destained in 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid. The nitrocellulose was blocked overnight at 4°C with 5% non-fat dried milk in 100 mM NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The membrane was then washed several times with PBS-T. The blots were incubated with antisera to cytochrome c oxidase holoenzyme for 2 h at room temperature diluted at 1:10,000 in PBS-T (0.8 ml of solution/cm2 nitrocellulose) with gentle rocking. The primary antibodies were raised in rabbits against each subunit of holocytochrome c oxidase. Unbound antiserum was washed away with PBS-T, and the nitrocellulose was incubated for 45 min in the secondary antibody solution (1:5000 dilution of anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig) horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody from donkey) (Amersham Corp.). Membranes were washed in PBS-T to remove unbound secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected by their chemiluminescence, using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Corp.). The blots were air-dried at room temperature for approximately 10 min, wrapped in plastic wrap, and exposed to ECL-Hyperfilm for 30 s to 2 min. Secondary structures were predicted as described by Chou and Fasman (41Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; PubMed Google Scholar) using a computer algorithm, PEPPLOT, provided by GCG (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The location of hydrophobic domains was determined by the SOAP algorithm (42Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) in PC Gene (Intelligenetics, Inc., Mountain View, CA.) with a rolling average of 9 residues. DNA sequences were compared with sequences in the EMBL/GenBank™ data base using BLAST software (NCBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Mitochondria were isolated from cells grown in 250 ml of YPGal at 30°C to mid-exponential phase, as described (7Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Difference spectra and the activity of cytochrome c oxidase were measured on isolated mitochondrial preparations spectrophotometrically, as described (3Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cytochrome c concentration was determined using A550 and an extinction coefficient of 20 mM−1 cm−1 (43Ferguson-Miller S. Brautigan D.L. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 149-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain BC123, which carries a pet100-1 mutation, was identified from a collection of cytochrome c oxidase-deficient mutants (3Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) isolated after mutagenesis of the parent strain, JM22, with ethyl methanesulfonate (13McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BC123 is the only isolate in complementation group 30 (13McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant is complemented by rhoo tester strains, indicating that the cytochrome c oxidase defect is caused by a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene. Strain BC123 does not grow on nonfermentable carbon sources like glycerol, contains 4.8% of the level of cytochrome c oxidase activity present in its parent, JM22, and has reduced levels of cytochromes aa3 (13McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both JM22 and BC123 also carry an op1 (also known as aac2 or pet9) mutation in the structural gene for the major aerobically expressed isoform of the ADP/ATP translocator of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Because this mutation is incompatible with either pleiotropic mitochondrial deletion mutations (i.e. rho− mutations) or mutants lacking a mitochondrial genome (rhoo mutations), its presence in the parent strain favors the isolation of either nuclear (pet) or nonpleiotropic mitochondrial (mit−) mutations (44Kotylak Z. Slonimski P.P. Bandlow W. Schweyen R.J. Wolk K. Kaudewitz R. Mitochondria 1977: Genetics and Biogenesis of Mitochondria. Walter deGruyter & Co., Berlin1977: 83Crossref Google Scholar). Rho− and rhoo mutations are lethal in an op1 genetic background. Although the presence of the op1 mutation was useful for the original isolation of nuclear encoded cytochrome c oxidase deficient mutants, its presence is inconvenient for cloning because op1 mutants, like cytochrome c oxidase-deficient mutants, are incapable of growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. Moreover, in some cases the op1 mutation contributes to the respiratory-deficient phenotype. Therefore, in order to clone PET100 and at the same time eliminate any phenotypic effects of the op1 mutation, we constructed two OP1 derivatives (B9-10B and B9-10D) of BC123. Unlike BC123, both of these strains exhibit some growth on glycerol (see below) and at least one of them, B9-10B, has higher levels of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity than BC123. This strain has 18.6% of the level of cytochrome c oxidase activity found in JM43 (Table II). This level of activity is about 4-fold higher than that reported for BC123 (13McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the growth deficiency of B9-10B on glycerol and its cytochrome c oxidase deficiency are not as severe as those of BC123, they were sufficient for cloning the PET100 gene by transformation.Table II.Disruption of the PET100 gene results in loss of cellular cytochrome c oxidase activityStrainGrowth on glycerolCytochrome c oxidase activity in isolated mitochondriaSpecific activityaµmol of cytochrome c oxidized per min/mg of mitochondrial protein.Percent of JM43JM43+74.76100B9-10D±13.9018.60JM43GD100−0.870.01a µmol of cytochrome c oxidized per min/mg of mitochondrial protein. Open table in a new tab PET100 was cloned by complementation of the growth deficiency of pet100-1 cells on glycerol. Specifically, pet 100-1 mutant strain B9-10B was transformed with a yeast genomic DNA library carried on the LEU2-containing plasmid, p366. Out of 20,000 Leu+ transformants, 37 colonies grew on nonfermentable medium. To confirm that complementation is conferred by the plasmid, and not an artifact resulting from reversion of the pet100-1 gene to wild-type, the seven strongest colonies of the 37 candidates were picked, their DNA was amplified by transforming it into E. coli, and plasmid DNA was isolated from the bacterial transformants. Each of these seven DNAs was reintroduced into yeast pet100-1 cells, and the cells were tested for growth on glycerol. All seven candidates grew. This confirmed that the glycerol-positive phenotype was plasmid-linked and not the result of reversion of a nuclear gene. The average size of the nuclear DNA inserts in the complementing plasmid library was 10-12 kilobases. To localize the region of PET100 activity more precisely, BamHI restriction fragments from two of these clones (2 and 4) were subcloned into pFL vectors at the BamHI site of the polylinker region an"

Two isoforms differing only in the cytoplasmic tail (tail 1 or 2) were analyzed for polarized expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Surface biotinylation, as well as confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, indicated that both proteins were transported to the basolateral surface. Because no sequence similarity has been observed, the two tails contain different basolateral targeting signals. A deletion mutant lacking the only tyrosine residue in tail 1 retained the polarized expression indicating that, in contrast to most basolateral sorting signals, the transport signal of the tail 1 isoform is not dependent on tyrosine. The maintenance of a targeting motif in two distinct cytoplasmic tails suggests that the basolateral expression of MCP in polarized epithelial cells is of physiological importance.

The surface of polarized epithelial cells is separated by tight junctions into an apical and a basolateral domain that differ both in composition and function. The apical membrane faces the external environment and the basolateral membrane mediates the contact with internal tissues and blood vessels. A specialized sorting apparatus exists to ensure that proteins and lipids specific for either of the two surface domains are targeted correctly. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, newly synthesized apical and basolateral proteins occupy the same compartments until they are sorted at the trans-Golgi network and are segregated into distinct transport vesicles for direct delivery to their respective membrane domains (1Rindler M.J.

In hepatocytes, all proteins are delivered to the basolateral surface, whereas the apical proteins are sorted and transported to the apical domain via transcytosis (5Bartles J.R. Feracci H.M. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Caco-2 (colon carcinoma) cells take an intermediate position, with some surface proteins being transported directly to the apical membrane and others being retrieved from the basolateral domain (6Matter K.

Previously, a signal-independent transport had been proposed for the basolateral proteins (9Caplan M. Matlin K.S. Matlin K.S. Valentich D. Functional Epithelial Cells in Culture. Allan R. Liss, New York1989: 71Google Scholar, 10Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). But recently, it has become evident that the cytoplasmic domain of basolateral proteins is responsible for the polarized expression (reviewed in Ref. 11Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The basolateral sorting signals usually contain a critical tyrosine residue and often have a close relationship to the determinants for coated pit localization (12Le-Bivic A. Sambuy Y. Patzak A. Patil N. Chao M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Spiess M. J.

However, there are also basolateral sorting signals that are unrelated to endocytosis signals, e.g. in the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (15Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and the low density lipoprotein receptor (16Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Although most of the information has been obtained using MDCK 1The abbreviations used are: MDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolSTPserine, threonine, and prolinePBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatemAbmonoclonal antibodyHRThuman rectal tumor. cells, it appears likely that similar or identical signals are active in other epithelial cell types (17Yokode M. Pathak R.K. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Little information is available about apical sorting signals. Proteins anchored in the membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) moiety were found to be delivered to the apical surface (18Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A.R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the GPI anchor itself is responsible for the apical transport of GPI-anchored proteins. The carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins has also been proposed as a potential determinant for delivery to the apical membrane (11Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 19Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Madin-Darby canine kidney glycosylphosphatidylinositol serine, threonine, and proline phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate monoclonal antibody human rectal tumor. Membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46) is a widely distributed regulatory protein that inhibits complement activation on host cells (reviewed in Ref. 20Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 178: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar). MCP is a member of the family of C3 binding membrane proteins and acts as a cofactor in concert with plasma serine protease factor I to degrade complement factors C3b and C4b deposited on self tissue. Recently, it has been shown that MCP also serves as the receptor for the measles virus (21Naniche D. Varior-Krishnan G. Cervoni F. Wild T.F. Rossi B. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6025-6032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dörig R.E. Marcil A. Chopra A. Richardson C.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 295-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 23Manchester M. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Oldstone M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2161-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In most cells, MCP consists of a family of different isoforms that arise by alternative splicing of a single gene (24Post T.W. Liszewski M.K. Adams E.M. Tedja I. Miller E.A. Atkinson J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of the extracellular portion is composed of four cysteine-rich repeating domains known as short consensus repeats that are the sites of N-glycosylation and C3b/C4b binding (Fig. 1). The short consensus repeats are followed by an area enriched in serines, threonines, and prolines (STP), a site of extensive O-glycosylation. The STP region may consist of three segments, designated A, B, and C. The isoforms commonly expressed on human cells contain only the C (14 amino acids) or BC (29 amino acids) segments. A short tract of unknown function connects the STP domain with a hydrophobic membrane-spanning region. The cytosolic portion of MCP comprises an intracytoplasmic anchor of 10 predominantly basic amino acids and a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The latter domain is subject to alternative splicing resulting in isoforms with two different tails, a shorter one with 16 amino acids (designated tail 1) or a longer one with 23 amino acids (designated tail 2). We were interested in whether this protein is expressed on the apical and/or basolateral cell surface of epithelial cells. The distribution of MCP may be important for the physiological function of MCP, inhibiting complement activation, as well as for the function as the measles virus receptor. The transport of MCP to the cell surface was analyzed in polarized MDCK cells stably expressing different isoforms. Here we report that two isoforms with different cytoplasmic tails were both transported to the basolateral surface. In contrast, a mutant lacking the whole cytoplasmic tail was transported to the cell surface in a nonpolarized fashion. These results indicate that both cytoplasmic tails contain a signal for basolateral transport. The conservation of a basolateral sorting signal in two different cytoplasmic tails suggests an important role of the polarized expression for this regulatory protein. Evidence is presented that the basolateral sorting signal of the BC1 isoform is independent of tyrosine. Vero C1008 cells and HRT-18 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2. MDCK cells (strain I) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were passaged 1:8 twice a week. For all experiments tissue culture-treated 0.4-µm pore size Transwell polycarbonate filters (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were used. Cells were plated 4-5 days before experiments (2 × 106 cells per 24-mm unit and 2 × 105 cells per 7.5-mm unit). Each cell line formed an electrical tight monolayer expressing different patterns of surface proteins on the apical and basolateral membrane. The polarity was determined by measurement of the transepithelial resistance using a Millipore (Bedford, MA) ERS apparatus: 30-60 Ω·cm2 for Vero C1008 cells, 100-150 Ω·cm2 for HRT-18 cells, and 800-1500 Ω·cm2 for MDCK cells. Three MCP forms were used in this study: isoforms BC1 and BC2 and a tail-minus form (Fig. 1). The nomenclature for MCP isoforms indicates which segments (of A, B, and C) of the STP region and which cytoplasmic tail (1 or 2) are expressed. The tail-minus form was derived from isoform BC2 by deletion of the cytoplasmic tail, making the intracytoplasmic anchor the carboxyl terminus (25Liszewski M.K. Tedja I. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10776-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The d1-6 mutant was derived from isoform BC1 by deletion of the first 6 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail (TYLTDE; Fig. 1; Ref. 25Liszewski M.K. Tedja I. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10776-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All forms were cloned into the expression vector pHβApr-1-neo (26Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) as described by Liszewski et al. (25Liszewski M.K. Tedja I. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10776-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For stable expression, 1.5 × 106 MDCK cells were transfected with 6 µg of plasmid DNA using the electroporation method described by Liljeström and Garoff (27Liljeström P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml geneticin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Resistant cells were subcloned and assayed for MCP expression by intracellular and surface immunofluorescence and Western blot. Filter-grown cells were biotinylated essentially as described by Lisanti et al. (18Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A.R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). MCP was immunoprecipitated from lysed cells using monoclonal antibodies (GB24 or J4/48) as described recently (28Maisner A. Schneider-Schaulies J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6299-6304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After separation on a 12% polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions, proteins were analyzed by Western blot (29Schultze B. Gross H.J. Brossmer R. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6232-6237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated MCP was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (28Maisner A. Schneider-Schaulies J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6299-6304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For intracellular staining, MDCK cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed for 5 min at −20°C with methanol/acetone (1:1). After incubation with PBS+ containing 3% bovine serum albumin and mAb J4/48 (dilution 1:100) for 60 min at 37°C, cells were washed in PBS+ and bound antibodies were detected by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) at a 1:100 dilution in PBS+ containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37°C. Samples were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany) and 10% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). The fluorescence label was visualized and photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with UV optics. For the confocal immunofluorescence, MDCK cell clones grown on 7.5-mm Transwell units were fixed on ice with 2% paraformaldehyde (15 min). The apical and basolateral surfaces were incubated with PBS+ containing 3% bovine serum albumin and mAb J4/48 at a 1:10 dilution for 2 h at 37°C, washed extensively with PBS+, and subsequently incubated with a FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1:100 in PBS+ containing 3% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 37°C. After being washed with PBS+, samples were mounted in Mowiol and 10% DABCO and examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany). The confocal laser scanning microscope worked with the blue line (408-nm wavelength) of an argon laser. Oil immersion planneofluar lenses were used for confocal epifluorescence and/or Nomarski differential interference contrast. To study the sorting of endogenous MCP in polarized epithelial cells, we analyzed the steady state surface distribution of CD46 on the simian cell line Vero C1008. These cells have previously been described as growing in a polarized fashion (30Srinivas R.V. Balachandran N. Alonso-Caplen F.V. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 689-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Simian MCP can be isolated by a monoclonal antibody, GB24, which is specific for the short consensus repeat 3 and 4 region of human MCP (28Maisner A. Schneider-Schaulies J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6299-6304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the apical/basolateral distribution of MCP, we used domain-selective biotinylation of cells cultured on permeable supports. Polarized cell monolayers grown on filters were cooled to 4°C, and either the apical or the basolateral surface proteins were labeled by adding the non-membrane-permeating reagent sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-biotin to the respective chamber. The cells were lysed and MCP was immunoprecipitated by GB24. After electrophoresis on a nondenaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, MCP was transferred to nitrocellulose. Biotin-labeled MCP was detected with streptavidin/peroxidase. As shown in Fig. 2, panel 1, MCP was not equally distributed on the two surface domains of Vero C1008 cells. An efficient biotinylation of MCP was obtained after labeling the cells from the basolateral side (panel 1, lane B). Only a minor band of MCP was detectable after labeling the cells from the apical side (panel 1, lane A), although in this case the labeling reagent did not have to pass through the pores of the filter. This result indicates that MCP is expressed predominantly (96%) on the basolateral surface of Vero C1008 cells. To confirm the polarized expression of MCP with human cells, the same experiment was performed with a human rectal tumor cell line, HRT-18. As shown in Fig. 2, panel 2, MCP of HRT-18 cells, which had a somewhat slower electrophoretic mobility, was also expressed predominantly (95%) on the basolateral surface. As in the case of Vero C1008 cells, apical MCP was detectable only after overexposure of the film. In contrast to simian MCP, human MCP is well characterized and different isoforms are available as cDNA clones. To determine the distribution of a distinct isoform of human MCP on a well-characterized polarized cell line, we established an MDCK cell line stably expressing the BC1 isoform. This isoform contains segments B and C of the STP region and cytoplasmic tail 1 (Fig. 1). Expression of MCP was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody directed against human MCP (J4/48). Although MCP was not detectable in nontransfected parental MDCK cells (Fig. 3A), bright fluorescence was observed after staining of transfected cells (Fig. 3B). The latter cells had retained the polarized phenotype of the parental cells, as indicated by measurement of the transepithelial resistance. To determine the distribution of human MCP on the apical and basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells, filter-grown MDCK cells stably expressing human MCP were subjected to domain-selective biotinylation as described above for Vero C1008 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, panel 2, strong labeling of MCP was achieved by biotinylation of the basolateral proteins (lane B). Biotinylation of the apical surface yielded only a weak MCP band. This result indicates that human MCP is predominantly (98%) expressed on the basolateral membrane domain of MDCK cells, as has been determined above for simian MCP. In the parental cell line, no band was detectable at the position of MCP (panel 1), neither after apical (lane A) nor after basolateral (lane B) biotinylation. To analyze the importance of the cytoplasmic tail of MCP for the basolateral transport we established an MDCK clone expressing another isoform of MCP, BC2, which differs from BC1 only in the cytoplasmic tail. In addition, we generated an MDCK cell clone that expressed MCP and lacked the cytoplasmic tail (tail-minus). The amino acid sequence of the cytosolic portion of BC1, BC2, and the tail-minus form of MCP is shown in Fig. 1. The polarity of the MCP isoforms and tail-minus mutant on the surface of filter-grown MDCK cells was determined by selective biotinylation. Total MCP immunoprecipitated with mAb J4/48 was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used for a Western blot to ensure that there was no difference in the total amount of receptor in the cells labeled from either the apical or the basolateral side, respectively (not shown). In the second aliquot, biotinylated proteins were detected after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose by incubation with streptavidin/peroxidase (Fig. 5). As already shown in Fig. 4, isoform BC1 of MCP was almost exclusively (98%) detected on the basolateral surface. By analysis of cell clones with vastly different expression levels, no difference in the polarized surface distribution was found. Isoform BC2 of MCP was also localized predominantly (97%) on the basolateral membrane (Fig. 5B) and only a minor band was detectable in the sample biotinylated from the apical side (A). This result indicates that both isoforms contain a basolateral sorting signal. In contrast, the tail-minus form of MCP was not transported in a polarized fashion. It was found almost equally distributed on both sides of the cells (40% apical; 60% basolateral), Thus, the deletion of the cytoplasmic tail abolished the polarized transport of MCP. This result indicates that the sorting signal for the basolateral transport of MCP is located in the cytoplasmic tail. Because isoforms BC1 and BC2 differ in the cytoplasmic tail and are both transported in a polarized fashion, both tails must contain a signal for delivery to the basolateral surface. To confirm the result from Fig. 5, the distribution of the two isoforms and the tail-mutant of MCP on the surface of MDCK cells was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Filter-grown MDCK cell clones were fixed without disruption of the plasma membrane. Then they were incubated from both the apical and the basolateral side with J4/48 and a FITC-conjugated second antibody. In Fig. 6, horizontal sections (parallel to the filter) are shown that represent (from top) the apical, central, and basal portions of the cells, respectively. In addition, a vertical section (side view) is shown (Fig. 6, bottom panel). For isoforms BC1 and BC2 of MCP almost no fluorescence signals were detectable in the apical section. The section through the center showed a honeycomb pattern. The brightest fluorescence was observed in the basal section. The vertical profiles displayed characteristic cup-like patterns typical for basolateral proteins. In contrast, in MDCK cells expressing the tail-minus mutant, fluorescent staining was detected on the entire plasma membrane including the apical domain. In the side view (vertical section), tail-minus MCP was found to completely encircle the cells. The confocal immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that both MCP isoforms are localized almost exclusively on the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells and that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of MCP resulted in a loss of polarized surface expression. To determine whether tyrosine is involved in the basolateral targeting of MCP, we analyzed MDCK cells expressing a deletion mutant of the BC1 isoform. This mutant, d1-6, lacked the six NH2-terminal amino acids of tail 1 (TYLTDE) and thus the only tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of the BC1 isoform (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 7, the d1-6 mutant showed the same surface distribution as the BC1 isoform. Strong labeling was detectable only after basolateral surface biotinylation; apical labeling resulted only in a weak band. This result indicates that the tyrosine is not necessary for the basolateral targeting of MCP-BC1. Our work shows that MCP is transported to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells. In recent years evidence has been presented that clearly indicates that the delivery to the basolateral membrane is signal mediated with the critical determinant being located in the cytoplasmic tail (reviewed in Ref. 11Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This is true also for MCP, because deletion of the cytoplasmic tail abolished the polarized transport. A unique feature of MCP is that there exist several isoforms with either of two different cytoplasmic tails. Computer-assisted alignments did not reveal any sequence similarity between tail 1 and tail 2. As the isoforms BC1 and BC2 were both found to be transported to the basolateral membrane, both tails have to contain their own transport signal. Such a situation has not been described for other basolateral proteins. A tyrosine residue was found to be essential for the polarized transport of most basolateral proteins analyzed so far. The basolateral sorting signal may overlap with the coated pit localization signal of a protein (14Prill V. Lehmann L. Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I.

However, in all cases that have been examined it was found by mutating neighboring amino acids that the two determinants are not identical (see Ref. 31Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Basolateral sorting signals that are unrelated to coated pit localization signals have been found in the low density lipoprotein receptor (34Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (35Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison suggested the motif YXX-aliphatic as common denominator of most basolateral signals identified so far (31Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the Fc receptor, a critical role has been assigned to a di-leucine motif (36Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The latter motif is not present in either of the two alternative tails of MCP. Tyrosine residues are present in both tails. Neither the tyrosine in tail 1 (LTD) nor the two tyrosine residues in tail 2 (ATQTK) fit the motif mentioned above. These considerations argue against a major role of a tyrosine for the basolateral targeting of MCP. Experimental support for this conclusion was obtained by analysis of the d1-6 mutant that lacked a tyrosine in the cytoplasmic tail and, nevertheless, was predominantly transported to the basolateral surface. Secretory glycoproteins are usually released from the apical surface of simple epithelial cells, whereas nonglycosylated proteins are released in a nonpolarized fashion (reviewed in Ref. 19Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Several basolateral glycoproteins have been reported to be transported to the apical surface after deletion of the cytoplasmic tail. Based on these data, it has been speculated that the carbohydrate portion may contain a determinant for apical delivery of glycoproteins (11Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 19Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In the case of basolateral glycoproteins, this would imply that the basolateral signal in the cytosolic domain has a higher binding affinity to its sorting machinery than the putative glycan signal in the luminal domain to the receptor for apical sorting. MCP is heavily glycosylated, containing both N- and O-glycans. Removal of the cytoplasmic tail abolished the basolateral transport of MCP, but did not result in the apical delivery of the truncated protein. The tail-minus mutant was rather transported in a nonpolarized fashion. If glycans in general serve as apical sorting signals, one would have to assume that the tail-minus mutant has retained a weak signal for basolateral transport. This weak basolateral sorting signal and the apical sorting signal of the glycans would have the same affinity for their respective receptors, resulting in a nonpolarized expression on the cell surface. As to the location of such a signal, one might consider the intracytoplasmic anchor of 10 amino acids that has been retained on the cytosolic domain of the tail-minus mutant. However, analysis of the basolateral targeting signal in the cytoplasmic domain of glycoprotein G from the vesicular stomatitis virus indicated that a certain minimal distance (≥5 residues) between the transmembrane domain and the transport signal is required for optimal function of the targeting determinant (31Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the 6 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the intracytoplasmic anchor consist mainly of basic amino acids (RRKKKG), which have so far been described only as having a modulating effect, not as being major determinants for the basolateral transport of proteins. Deletion of this anchor will provide a definitive answer, but it should be noted that nonpolarized expression was also observed with the asialoglycoprotein receptor after inactivation of the basolateral sorting signal (32Geffen I. Fuhrer C. Leitinger B. Weiss M. Huggel K. Griffiths G. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20772-20777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus after deletion of the cytoplasmic tail (31Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the view of glycans as general apical sorting signals is still open to debate. For a final conclusion about apical targeting signals one has to await the identification of the respective receptor. A recent study examining the role of MCP as the measles virus receptor reported that Caco-2 cells express MCP predominantly on the apical surface (37Blau D.M. Compans R.W. Virology. 1995; 210: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The differential polarized expression of a protein in two different cell types suggests that the basolateral targeting signal of MCP is not recognized by all epithelial cells. Differential expression of surface proteins by different epithelial cells has been demonstrated so far only for apical proteins. Contrary to the transport in MDCK cells, all apical proteins in hepatocytes and some of them in Caco-2 cells are transiently expressed on the basolateral surface from where they are transported via transcytosis to the apical membrane. GPI-anchored proteins, which are usually delivered to the apical surface of polarized cells, have been localized on the basolateral plasma membrane of Fischer rat thyroid epithelial cells (38Zurzolo C. Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Differences in the polarized expression between MDCK cells and Caco-2 cells have not been described for basolateral proteins. We found that MCP is transported to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells, Vero C1008 cells, and HRT-18 cells, indicating that the basolateral sorting signal is functional in these cells. Histochemical analysis of cells from the human colon also showed that MCP is located on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells (39Inoue H. Mizuno M. Uesu T. Ueki T. Tsuji T. Acta Med. Okayama. 1994; 48: 271-277PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the basolateral transport of MCP in polarized cells may be the rule and the lack of polarized transport as in the case of Caco-2 cells may be the exception. The biological importance of the two alternative cytoplasmic tails for MCP is not clear. Isoforms containing cytoplasmic tail 1 are transported to the cell surface more rapidly than their tail 2 counterparts (25Liszewski M.K. Tedja I. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10776-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These and other differences between isoforms may allow the cell to use MCP more effectively. The fact that both tails contain a basolateral targeting signal suggests that the location of MCP on the basolateral membrane domain is an important feature. Because the basolateral surface of epithelial cells faces the serosal compartment, it appears to be at an appropriate place for a regulatory protein of the complement system. In this context it is interesting to note that another regulatory protein, the decay accelerating factor (CD55), is an apical protein. Like other glycoproteins that are inserted into the membrane via a GPI-anchor, decay accelerating factor is transported to the apical plasma membrane of polarized cells (40Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The targeting signal of MCP may ensure that regulatory proteins are also present on the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells. The technical assistance of A.

https://openalex.org/W2055647658,"Following synthesis, wheat gliadin storage proteins are deposited into protein bodies inside the endomembrane system in a way that enables not only their efficient accumulation and dehydration during seed maturation, but also their rapid rehydration and degradation during germination. In the present report, we studied the mechanism of gliadin deposition and whether it was controlled by the conformation of these proteins. Although gliadins are generally known to be insoluble in aqueous solutions, sucrose gradient analysis showed that a considerable amount of these proteins appeared as relatively soluble monomers in developing grains. In vitro reduction of the intramolecular disulfide bonds that are present in natural monomeric gliadins caused their precipitation into insoluble aggregates. In addition, pulse-chase experiments in the absence or presence of reducing agents showed that formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds also played a major role in folding and deposition of the gliadins in vivo. Our results imply that following sequestration into the endoplasmic reticulum, the gliadins fold into relatively soluble monomers, which are incompetent for rapid aggregation and gradually assemble into protein bodies. This pattern of deposition apparently depends on the conformation of the gliadins, which is stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds formed between the conserved cysteines. The contribution of this study to the understanding of the evolution and function of gliadins is discussed."

The initiation of transcription from a promoter by prokaryotic RNA polymerase has been characterized mainly at the level of promoter binding and open complex formation (1McClure W.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), each appears to be a multistep process (see Ref. 2Suh W.-C. Ross W. Record M.T. Science. 1993; 259: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and references therein). Much less is known about subsequent initiation steps, termed the process of promoter clearance (1McClure W.R. Annu. Rev.

Promoter clearance like other steps in initiation involves the formation of a multistate series of RNA polymerase-DNA complexes generally termed initial transcribing complexes (ITC) 1The abbreviations used are: ITCinitial transcribing complexPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)mAbmonoclonal antibody. (4Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7829-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the ITC, RNA synthesis begins, but the polymerase forms only short RNAs (generally 2-9 nucleotides) whose syntheses are aborted. These reiteratively synthesized abortive RNAs are released from the ITC without disengagement of RNA polymerase from the promoter (5Johnston D.E. McClure W.R. Losick R.R. Chamberlin M.J.

The production of abortive RNAs ceases upon transition of the ITC into a stable ternary elongation complex, which appears to occur concomitant with the release of σ70 and promoter clearance (4Krummel B.

The probability of an RNA polymerase molecule forming an abortive transcript while traversing the initiating template appears to have a great dependence on the specific initially transcribed sequence. This was demonstrated by substitution of the sequences from +3 to +20 of the T5 phage promoter N25, producing the semi-synthetic promoter T5 N25antiDSR (14Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Both promoters, N25 and N25antiDSR, bind polymerase and form open complexes with equal efficiency; however, the N25antiDSR promoter is drastically reduced in activity (14Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently a detailed investigation of abortive transcription properties of three promoters, T7 A1, T5 N25, and T5 N25antiDSR, was completed. 2L. M. Hsu and M. J. Chamberlin, manuscript in preparation. It was found that the reduction in promoter activity of N25antiDSR, resulting from alterations in the initial transcribed sequence, was attributed to a limitation at promoter clearance.2 In achieving promoter clearance, it is unclear whether the release of σ70 is a passive consequence or an active prerequisite to a successful transition from the ITC to the elongation complex. Regardless of the nature of σ70 participation, there remains a fundamental necessity of RNA polymerase to relinquish high affinity promoter binding to establish a stable elongating complex (1McClure W.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the fact that promoter recognition occurs by direct binding of σ70 domains of RNA polymerase holoenzyme to DNA (12Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 13Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and is, therefore, concluded by the release of σ70 from the ITC. Progress toward understanding this transition has been slow due to the extreme instability of ITCs, which has hampered conventional biochemical analysis. Thus, analysis of mutant RNA polymerases altered in their abortive transcription properties might offer new insight into this poorly understood process. We have recently reported the isolation of two Escherichia coli σ70 mutants bearing changes in conserved region 3 (15Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This study revealed an apparent change in interaction of mutant σ70 proteins with core polymerase in vivo. In addition, a cross-linkable ATP analog bound at the initial nucleotide binding site of RNA polymerase in an ITC produces a strong cross-link of the initiating nucleotide to region 3 of σ70, placing it close to the catalytic center of the initiating polymerase (16Severinov K. Fenyo D. Severinova E. Mustaev A. Chait B.T. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20826-20828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is plausible, therefore, that mutants of σ70 bearing alterations in region 3 might be affected in transcription initiation and early RNA synthesis. In this study we investigated whether mutational changes in region 3 of σ70 altered patterns of RNA synthesis in vitro. For this purpose we also utilized the three extensively characterized2 promoters T7 A1, T5 N25, and T5 N25antiDSR. By comparing wild-type and mutant reconstituted RNA polymerases, we find that mutant enzymes produced a strikingly different pattern of abortive RNAs from all three promoter templates. The σ70 overproduction plasmid pLHN12 (a kind gift of Lam Nguyen and Richard Burgess) is derived from the BL21(DE3)/pLysS/pET system (Ref. 17Studier F.W. Rosenburg A. Dunn J. Dubendorff J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar; Novagen Inc.); it contains the rpoD structural gene cloned into the pET11T vector (18Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Burgess R.R. Protein Exp. Purif. 1993; 4: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) under control of the T7 promoter. Mutated rpoD genes were amplified from chromosomal DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (15Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A naturally-occurring 281-base pair (bp) BamHI-XhoI fragment spanning the region 3 coding sequence was excised from the PCR products and subcloned into the unique BamHI-XhoI sites of pLHN12. The presence of mutant alleles and the absence of PCR-generated mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The σ70 proteins were purified using a modification of the method of Gribskov and Burgess (19Gribskov M. Burgess R.R. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Core RNA polymerase free of σ70 was purchased from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). Immunoprecipitations of RNA polymerase holoenzyme were carried out using the IgG2a anti-β monoclonal antibody (mAb) NT63, which reacts with both core and holoenzyme RNA polymerase (20Thompson N.E. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A fixed amount of purified σ70, 100 ng, was mixed in transcription buffer with 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 ng of core RNA polymerase in a total volume of 15 µl for 15 min at room temperature. To each, 5 µl of mAb NT63 ascites fluid was added and immunoprecipitations were performed as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1889Google Scholar) using formalin-fixed protein A-positive Staphylococcus aureus cells and NET buffer (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1889Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed through a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The σ70 protein was detected and quantitated by Western analysis as described previously (15Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), using σ70 mAb 2F8 and 3D3 (22Strickland M.S. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5755-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PCR templates, approximately 200 bp long, were made by PCR amplification of the plasmids pAR1707 (T7 A1 promoter), pDS3/PN25 (T5 N25 promoter), and pDS3/PN25anti DRS (N25anti promoter) using oligonucleotide primers as described by Hsu and Chamberlin.2 Templates produced run-off transcripts of 50 nucleotides for T7 A1 and T5 N25 and 65 nucleotides for N25anti. Reaction volumes were 20 µl, containing 20 nM template DNA and 100 nM RNA polymerase in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 µg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. Optimal KCl concentration2 used was 190 mM for T7 A1 promoter, 250 mM for T5 N25 and 150 mM for N25anti promoter. ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP were provided at indicated concentrations with [γ-32P]ATP at a specific radioactivity of 10-20 cpm/fmol. Reaction components were prewarmed and reactions started by addition of 10 µl of RNA polymerase solution to 10 µl of template and substrates at 37°C. Reactions were terminated after 10 min by addition of 0.1 ml of stop solution (1 mg/ml glycogen, 30 mM EDTA, 0.3 M sodium acetate) followed by 0.4 ml of ethanol. Precipitation was allowed for 1 h at −20°C, and precipitates were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 µl of formamide loading buffer (66% formamide, 100 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 1 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer). Samples were analyzed on a standard 7 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. For electrophoresis 0.5 × TBE buffer was placed in the top reservoir and 1.2 × TBE in the bottom reservoir to stack low molecular weight RNAs. Bromophenol blue tracking dye was run 3/4 the length of the gel. Radioactivity was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant™ version 3.3 software. Previous analysis of strains harboring the mutant σ70 proteins, σ70(P504L) and σ70(S506F), indicated that compared to wild-type σ70, a large fraction of the mutant σ70 in the cell was in the free form, i.e. not in association with holoenzyme (15Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This result was obtained by fractionating cell lysates on glycerol gradients and measuring the amount of σ70 either sedimenting independently or with core RNA polymerase. A simple interpretation of this result is that the σ70 mutant proteins have a lower affinity for core RNA polymerase or form an unstable holoenzyme. Given this uncertainty, we checked whether the purified mutant proteins could form stable holoenzyme. To test this, σ70 was mixed with core RNA polymerase, and competence to form holoenzyme was assayed by coimmunoprecipitation of σ70 with core-specific antibody. The ability of the purified wild-type and mutant σ70 proteins to form holoenzyme was found to be essentially unaltered (Fig. 1). The mass of core enzyme is approximately 5 times greater than σ70; thus, nearly all of the σ70 present (100 ng) in the reconstitution reaction appears to be titrated by a molar equivalent of core RNA polymerase (500 ng) (Fig. 1B). Under subsequent in vitro transcription conditions, the σ70 mutant and wild-type proteins are judged to be equally competent for stable holoenzyme formation. The exact cause of the previous in vivo observations (15Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), however, remains unknown. The immunoprecipitation assay used here was not sensitive enough to detect the extremely low levels of protein required to accurately determine the high affinity binding of σ70 to core polymerase (data not shown). The binding constant has been estimated to be 2 × 109M−1 and was obtained using highly sensitive fluorescence quenching (23Gill S.C. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 307-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Possible effects of these mutants on the transcription cycle were investigated by multiple-round in vitro transcriptions. In vitro transcription was carried out using PCR templates bearing either the T7 A1, T5 N25, or T5 N25antiDSR (N25anti) promoter as described by Hsu and Chamberlin.2 These particular promoters were chosen since they represent promoters with variable abortive tendencies and we reasoned that changes in region 3 of σ70 might affect the production of abortive RNAs (see Introduction). RNA polymerase holoenzyme was reconstituted (see “Materials and Methods”), and a 5-fold excess of holoenzyme to template was used in each assay. All four nucleotide substrates were present at concentrations of 20, 50, or 100 µM. In all reactions RNA was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, thus incorporating radioactivity only at the 5′-end of RNAs. This prevents obscuring of the pattern of abortive RNAs by the production of short RNAs resulting from Gre factor-mediated cleavage (24Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In addition, incorporated radioactivity is directly proportional to the number of RNA molecules of each species regardless of size. RNA products were analyzed as described (see “Materials and Methods”). The pattern of abortive transcripts obtained for wild-type RNA polymerase on the three promoter templates is indistinguishable from that observed by Hsu and Chamberlin.2 For the mutant enzymes, however, the patterns produced are different. In Fig. 2, RNAs synthesized by transcription from the T7 A1 promoter are shown. It is immediately apparent that the production of abortive RNAs is lower for mutant σ70 RNA polymerases than for the wild-type enzyme. Also lower is the amount of full-length RNA produced by the mutant RNA polymerases (Fig. 2, A and B). Fewer abortive RNAs may simply be produced because of lower enzyme activity. Closer inspection, however, reveals that the absolute amount of the early abortive tetrameric RNA (4-mer) produced is similar for all enzymes (Fig. 2B). Apparently, formation of the 4-mer RNA is not as affected as formation of longer abortive RNAs. This observation cannot be extended to dimer and trimer RNAs, since these were not sufficiently well resolved from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP to allow reliable quantitation. In the case of the pentameric (5-mer) and heptameric (7-mer) length RNAs, which are prominent species for the wild-type enzyme, the mutants produce between 2- and 3-fold less (Fig. 2, A and B). Meanwhile, the full-length run-off transcript appears 30% less abundant for σ70(P504L) and 65% less for σ70(S506F) RNA polymerases. Thus, the reduction in abortive RNAs cannot be accounted for by a simple reduction in total enzyme activity in the case of σ70(P504L). In Fig. 2C template positions where mutant enzymes aborted less are indicated (downward arrows). Observed effects appear to occur preferentially at sites of purine addition (position +4 to +8); however, this trend is not apparent on the other promoters. For the T5 N25 promoter, a different array of abortive transcripts is obtained with the wild-type enzyme and effects observed for the mutant polymerases are different from those seen on T7 A1 (Fig. 3A). Like T7 A1, production of short abortive RNAs (4- and 5-mers) are similar for the mutants, while longer products (6-8-mers) are reduced at least 2-3-fold (Fig. 3B). Unlike T7 A1, the mutant polymerases produce the late abortive 9-mer RNA to about 2-fold higher abundance. Also, the level of full-length run-off products (50-mers) is essentially unchanged for wild-type and σ70(P504L) polymerases and is only 30% reduced for σ70(S506F). Reduced production of abortive RNAs within the initial transcribed sequence of T5 N25 appears to be specific for sites of uridine incorporation (Fig. 3C); again, this is not consistent with results for T7 A1 and N25anti promoters. The last promoter analyzed is the semi-synthetic promoter N25anti, which differs from the wild-type T5 N25 promoter by the presence of base substitutions from positions +3 to +20 (14Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here again, only minor effects are observed for short abortive products (4- and 5-mers), while longer products (6-9-mers) are drastically reduced (Fig. 4, A and B). The N25anti promoter is unusual in producing “oligomeric” transcripts of unprecedented length (10-15-mers), which exhibit all of the properties of abortive RNAs.2 Both σ70 mutants produce more of these very long abortive RNAs than the wild-type, e.g. 2- and 3-fold higher for the 10-mer species (Fig. 4B). Similar to the N25 promoter, however, full-length RNA (65-mer) from N25anti is synthesized in equivalent amounts for all RNA polymerases. Analysis of specific positions within the initial transcribed sequence of N25anti at which production of abortive RNAs are different for the mutant polymerases does not reveal a common nucleotide preference (Fig. 4C). Cumulatively, the results presented here are consistent with a difference in the potential of forming abortive transcripts by RNA polymerases bearing the σ70 mutants P504L and S506F. The behavior of these mutant enzymes also differs intrinsically from that of the wild-type in a manner that is independent of specific nucleotide affinities. Most interestingly, the abortive properties of these mutants appear to be influenced by the length of the nascent RNA. Short abortive products, 4-mer on T7 A1 and 4- and 5-mers on N25 and N25anti promoters, are produced with equal or slightly reduced abundance. Midsize abortive products, 5-8-mers for T7 A1, 6-8-mers for N25 promoter, and 6-9-mers for N25anti promoter, are drastically reduced. Furthermore, longer abortive products are more prevalent for N25 and N25anti promoters. Clearly the mutant enzymes respond to different properties associated with the production of these different length abortive RNAs. These different properties most likely result from distinct physical states characteristic of individual ITC, which may be either RNA length- or promoter distance-dependent. A reduction in abortive RNA production could in theory lead to an increased efficiency of promoter clearance. This, however, was not the case for these promoters since an increase in abundance of full-length RNA was not observed. Alternatively, these results could suggest that the mutant polymerases establish more stable ITCs at positions of midsize length RNAs, which do not readily abort, but which do not advance to the next nucleotide addition at an increased rate. An example of a stable non-abortive ITC has been reported for wild-type RNA polymerase at position +6 on the initial transcribed region of a Ptac hybrid template (4Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7829-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The observed changes in production of abortive transcripts for all three promoters are complicated by apparent differences in specific enzymatic activity of the wild-type and mutant polymerases for production of full-length RNAs. It could be argued that the observed low abundance of abortive RNAs for mutant enzymes results from a simple reduction in overall enzymatic activity. In an attempt to address this issue, we estimated relative specific activity by summing the phosphorimaging counts for all of the [γ-32P]ATP-labeled RNA species produced by each polymerase for the three templates. This determination differs from the classic measurement of specific activity, since it quantitates the amount of RNA 5′-ends. Thus, it is a measure for the number of initiations attempted by each enzyme, i.e. formation of the first phosphodiester bond, during the course of the assay. In the classic specific activity determination short abortive RNAs are excluded from quantitation (25Chamberlin M.J. Nierman W.C. Wiggs J. Neff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10061-10069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results in Table I indicated that the total number of RNA molecules produced was reduced for the σ70(P504L) mutant enzyme only on T7 A1 but for the σ70(S506F) on all templates. It must be noted that this evaluation is only an estimate of the total enzyme activity since it fails to include dimer and trimer RNAs, which could not be accurately quantitated. Given this caveat, however, differences in the activities of mutant polymerases appear insufficient to account for the much larger reduction in the level of midsize length abortive RNAs. It is clear that similar amounts of early abortive RNA species (e.g. 4- or 5-mers) are produced by all enzymes, which is consistent with the polymerases having approximately equal average occupancy at these positions. Moreover, the observation that mutant enzymes produce an increased abundance of “long” abortive products (e.g. 9- and 10-mers) compared to wild-type enzyme is difficult to explain by simply assuming a lower overall RNA initiation rate.Table I.Relative amounts of 5′ RNA ends Produced by wild-type and mutant RNA polymerasesType of σ70Relative activityaTranscription conditions were as described under “Materials and Methods” with 50 µM of each NTP.

Open table in a new tab It is also unlikely that the mutant RNA polymerases have acquired different affinities for specific nucleotide addition within the context of a specific initial transcribing sequence. Specific initial transcribed sequence positions displaying low affinity for nucleotide addition, high Km values, have been determined for the three promoters, T7 A1, T5 N25, and N25anti.2 These sites do not correlate with sites of altered abortive behavior of the mutant enzymes. Thus, straightforward sequence-specific determinants that can account for the behavior of the σ70 mutants cannot be attributed simply to changes in specific Km values. In conclusion, it appears that mutational changes in region 3 of σ70 can alter the production of abortive transcripts and, thus, properties of the ITC of RNA polymerase (Figs. 2, 3, 4). To our knowledge, this is the first example of a mutational change in σ70 that affects abortive transcription and implicates region 3 in this process. This finding is consistent with the cross-linking studies of Severinov et al. (16Severinov K. Fenyo D. Severinova E. Mustaev A. Chait B.T. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20826-20828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which physically places region 3 of σ70 near the active center of an initiating RNA polymerase. We find it intriguing that the only known homology, though quite divergent, between region 3 of σ70 and an eukaryotic basal transcription factor is found in the β-subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIE (26Sumimoto H. Ohkuma Y. Sinn E. Kato H. Shimasaki S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that TFIIE recruits to the preinitiation complex, TFIIH, which then mediates efficient promoter clearance of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (27Goodrich J.A. Tijan R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, that this is the sole function of TFIIE and it is conjectured that TFIIE may provide other essential functions during promoter clearance (27Goodrich J.A. Tijan R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The process of abortive initiation has been thought to be tightly associated with the process of promoter clearance (1McClure W.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Thus, the finding that abortive transcription can be significantly changed without influencing the production of full-length transcripts is perhaps surprising. For example, in the case of the N25 and N25anti promoters, the σ70(P504L) mutant enzyme changes dramatically the pattern of abortive RNA products without affecting the abundance of full-length products (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). These results could indicate that for the mutant enzymes the processes of abortive transcription and promoter clearance are separable, that is, not directly coupled nor sequential.

This is especially advantageous in the analysis of self-antigen presentation where conventional approaches utilizing antigen-specific T cells may be biased by the presence of self-tolerance. However, successful biochemical analysis has been reported for only one exogenous antigen and no autoantigens. We have used a novel analytical approach coupling biochemical data with the reported properties of class II-associated peptides to characterize the peptides derived from a clinically relevant autoantigen presented on the disease-associated class II type.

Synthetic peptides containing these core sequences bind to HLA-DR15 with intermediate affinity (IC50, 1.1-6 µM).

Extracellular antigens are recognized by T helper cells in the form of processed peptides bound to HLA class II molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). 1The abbreviations used are: APCantigen presenting cellHELhen egg lysozymeHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. However, the mechanisms determining which antigen-derived peptides are displayed are poorly understood. Extracellular antigens are uptaken by APC into endosomes where, in an acidic reducing environment, proteolytic cleavage generates antigen-derived peptides (processing). Those peptides able to form stable complexes with HLA class II molecules are protected from further proteolysis and transported to the cell surface for T cell recognition.

HLA class II-associated peptides have been purified and characterized from several in vitro propagated APC types bearing a variety of class II types (1Chicz R. Urban R. Lane W. Gorga J. Stern L.

Med. 1993; 178: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). They comprise complex mixtures of short (12-25 residues) peptides and derive mainly from membrane-associated and endosomal proteins. Peptides derived from exogenous antigens, which presumably are present at substantially lower concentrations within endosomes, comprise a small proportion of identified peptides (3Hunt F. Michel H.

Med. 1993; 178: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Nelson et al. were able to identify peptides derived from hen egg lysozyme (HEL) among the IAk-associated peptides of a murine APC pulsed with high concentrations of HEL (8Nelson C.A. Roof R.W. McCourt D.W. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7380-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The peptides contained a common core sequence and variable degrees of NH2- and COOH-terminal overhang, a nested set, now recognized as characteristic of class II-associated peptides and to have a structural basis in the “open at both ends” class II peptide binding groove (9Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). Importantly this core sequence was the immunodominant epitope of HEL on IAk, showing that the approach can identify T cell epitopes and supporting the concept that immune responses to exogenous antigens are directed toward the predominant antigen-derived peptides available. In contrast to exogenous antigens, the relationship between the presentation of self-antigens and the specificity of autoimmune responses has not been established in any experimental or human autoimmune disease. There may be important differences. Because some degree of tolerance to self-antigens is likely to exist and be most complete to the predominant self-antigen derived peptides presented, autoreactivity may be directed at other epitopes (10Sercarz E.E.

Nature. 1992; 358: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). This may be the case in an animal model of autoimmunity in which autoreactivity was found to be directed at a peptide with undetectable binding affinity for class II (13Fairchild P. Wildgoose R. Atherton E. Webb S. Wraith D. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). If the methods used to predict T cell epitopes within exogenous proteins (on the basis of predicted high binding affinity for class II (14Hammer J. Bono E. Gallazzi F. Belunis C. Nagy Z. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Marshall K. Wilson K. Liang J. Woods A. Zaller D. Rothbard J. Biomed. Pept. Prot. Nucl. Acids. 1995; 1: 157-162PubMed Google Scholar)) are to be extended to the prediction of the peptide targets of autoimmunity (16Hammer J. Gallazzi F. Bono E. Karr R.W. Guenot J. Valsasnini P. Nagy Z.A. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1847-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), it will be important to understand the relationship between how an autoantigen is presented as peptides and the autoimmune response to it. We are investigating Goodpasture's disease as a model of antigen presentation in human autoimmune nephritis. Here we describe a novel approach to the analysis of biochemical data that has enabled us to characterize antigen-derived peptides presented by APC pulsed with modest quantities of the Goodpasture antigen. Goodpasture's disease is an uncommon form of glomerulonephritis caused by autoimmunity to a component of glomerular (and certain other) basement membranes (17Saus J. Wieslander J. Langeveld J.

It is a good model of autoimmunity because its pathogenesis is known, the target antigen (α3(IV)NC1) is the same in all patients (21Pusey C.D. Dash A. Kershaw M.J. Morgan A. Reilly A. Rees A.J. Lockwood C.M. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 23-31PubMed Google Scholar), and over 80% of patients carry the same class II allele, HLA-DR15 (22Burns A.P. Fisher M. Li P. Pusey C.D. Rees A.J. Q. J.

Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this work we have sought to identify biochemically the predominant peptides derived from α3(IV)NC1 presented by the disease-associated class II molecule HLA-DR15. cDNA for α3(IV)NC1 (19Turner N. Mason P.J. Brown R. Fox M. Povey S. Rees A. Pusey C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with either glutathione S-transferase (expression vector pGEX (24Smith D. Johnson K. Gene (Amst). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar)) or a 6-histidine residue tag (pET14b from Novagen). In each case a linker containing a thrombin cleavage site joined the fusion partner to the NH2 terminus of α3(IV)NC1. The former fusion protein was purified by cation exchange chromatography before and after thrombin digestion. The purified material appeared as two equally stained bands on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis corresponding to α3(IV)NC1 and undigested fusion protein; this was used in the first antigen pulsing experiment. The latter fusion protein was purified by metal chelation and cation exchange chromatography, appearing as single band on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and was used in the second experiment. MGAR, an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cell homozygous for DR15 (HLA DRB1*1501 and DRB5*0101), was incubated at 2 × 107/ml (total of 1 × 1010 cells) in 5 or 20 µMα3(IV)NC1 (first and second experiments) in RPMI at 4°C for 1 h and then diluted into 9.5 liters of RPMI (final antigen concentration, 0.25 and 1 µM, respectively) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The washed pelleted cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8, containing protease inhibitors. DR15-peptide complexes were affinity-purified employing the monoclonal antibody L243 conjugated to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (L243 binds both the DRB1 and DRB5 gene products of DR15). Peptides released by acid treatment were isolated by ultrafiltration (10-kDa membrane, Amicon), applied to a RP-300 C18 (Brownlee) 10 cm × 2.1 mm column, and eluted with a gradient of increasing 90% acetonitrile/0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in 5% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots of each fraction were analyzed in a Vestec matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer using the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and internal peptide standards. Putative antigen-derived class II-associated peptides identified by mass and retention time were matched to sequences within α3(IV)NC1 with matching calculated mass. A computer was programmed to search the sequence of α3(IV)NC1 calculating the mass of all possible antigen-derived peptides assuming full reduction of disulfide bonds and absence of amino acid modifications. Peptides with calculated mass within the 95% confidence intervals of a measured extra mass were considered to match. In each experiment occurrences of each of the possible (226) 9-amino acid cores within peptides matched to extra masses were counted, and cores were ranked according to the number of different extra masses matched. Numbering of amino acid residues is relative to the sequence SPAT beginning the carboxyl-terminal noncollagenous domain of α3(IV). Random numbers (8000) in the range of the observed extra masses were similarly matched to α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides to assess the frequency with which nested sets would be observed in consecutive experiments due to chance alone.

A motif was derived to identify all sequences containing the minimal requirements for binding to either DR15 gene product. Synthetic peptides were purified by HPLC, and their composition was confirmed by mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Truncation analogues were generated by manual Edman degradation and partial carboxypeptidase digestion employing carboxypeptidase P and Y (Boehringer Mannheim). HPLC conditions were identical to those used for class II-associated peptide pools. Retention time predictions were made as described (27Guo D. Mant C. Taneja A. Parker J. Hodges R. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 359: 499-517Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The amino acid retention coefficients reported in Ref. 27Guo D. Mant C. Taneja A. Parker J. Hodges R. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 359: 499-517Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar were used to seed regression analysis of the measured retention times of 26 synthetic peptides. Measured and predicted retention times exhibited good fit to a linear model (R2 = 0.93). Retention time prediction is well validated for short peptides but may be less reliable when extrapolated to peptides longer than 12 residues because of secondary structure considerations. This source of error was minimized by attempting retention time prediction only for peptides of similar length and sequence to the peptides used to calculate the amino acid coefficients. The myelin basic protein peptide MBP 86-98(98A) (which has high affinity for HLA DRB1*1501 and DRB5*0101 (26Wucherpfennig K.W. Sette A. Southwood S. Oseroff C. Matsui M. Strominger J.L. Hafler D.A.

DR15-peptide complexes were quantified as described by Jensen (28Jensen P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments in the absence of inhibiting peptide established that less than 10% of labeled peptide was bound by DR15, indicating conditions of ligand excess. IC50 values were determined in at least three independent experiments. MGAR, a human Epstein-Barr virus transformed B cell homozygous for HLA-DR15, was incubated with (treated) or without (control) recombinant human α3(IV)NC1, and the purified HLA-DR15-associated peptide pools were separated by reverse phase HPLC. When the chromatograms were compared (Fig. 1a), minor but distinct differences suggested the presence of extra peptides in the peptide pool obtained from antigen-treated APC. In order to confirm the presence of extra peptides and to precisely measure their mass, each HPLC fraction was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Most fractions were found to contain complex mixtures of peptides with molecular masses between 1300 and 3000 Da, as is typical of HPLC-separated class II-associated peptides (3Hunt F. Michel H. Dickenson T. Shabanowitz J. Cox A. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Grey H. Sette A. Science. 1992; 256: 1817-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Similar spectra were obtained for the majority of corresponding control and antigen-treated fractions, indicating that antigen treatment had not greatly perturbed baseline class II peptide presentation. In the first experiment 17 masses present in spectra from antigen-treated fractions could not be found in spectra obtained for any adjacent control fraction (Fig. 1b). The extra, putatively α3(IV)NC1-derived, masses ranged between 1389.8 and 2509.1 Da (95% confidence limits ± 0.07%) and in general occurred in fractions collected where the control and treated chromatograms differed. Attempts to further purify and obtain the sequences of the “extra masses” were unsuccessful because each was present at low levels (estimated to be 0.1-10 pmol) within complex peptide mixtures (comprising <5% of total peptide). In order to identify which antigen-derived peptides could account for the extra masses, the sequence of α3(IV)NC1 was searched for peptides with matching calculated mass. 1-12 (median 5) peptides could be matched to each extra mass. Because HLA class II-associated peptides characteristically comprise nested sets enclosing common core sequences (1Chicz R. Urban R. Lane W. Gorga J. Stern L. Vignali D. Strominger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), we examined the sequences of the matched peptides for the recurring presence of a 9 (or more) amino acid core. Three putative nested sets each comprising peptides matched to six different extra masses were identified. Each set contained a 9-11-amino acid core sequence (Table I) and one (Table II, upper set) was centered on a core sequence containing a DR15 binding motif. The motif, deduced from published data, specifies a 9-amino acid core sequence with hydrophobic residues at positions 1 and 4 (Fig. 2). A further six putative nested sets each containing peptides matched to five extra masses were identified, one with a core sequence matching the DR15 motif (Table II, lower set).Table I.Occurrences of core sequences within peptides matched to extra masses identified in two experimentsCore α3(IV)NC1-derived sequencePositionaNumbering of amino acids is from SPAT commencing the NC1 domain of α3(IV).Occurrence within peptides matched to extra massesbNumber of different extra masses identified in two experiments that match α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides with the indicated core sequences.

Open table in a new tab In order to extend these observations a second experiment was performed with 4-fold more antigen. Seventeen extra masses were identified (1568.5-2449.13 Da ± 0.05%) and matched to 1-10 (median 4) α3(IV)NC1-derived sequences. The number of extra masses that could be matched by mass to peptides containing the core sequences identified in the first experiment are shown in Table I. Eleven of the 17 extra masses could again be matched to peptides containing the two previously identified DR15 motif-containing core sequences (Table III). The probability that this recurrent observation could arise by chance was investigated by matching 8,000 random numbers in the range of the observed extra masses to α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides. Random masses could be matched to peptides containing either (or both) core sequence in 2651/8000 (p = 0.33, σ = 0.0526). The expected number of chance matches is therefore 5.5-5.8, and the probability of observing 11/17 matches lies between 0.0058 and 0.0099 (Binomial distribution using p ± 1.96σ). This result suggested that at least a proportion of the sequences assigned to 11 extra masses (shown in Table III) were likely to be correct.Table III.Measured or calculated retention times of peptides with sequences assigned to extra masses identified in the second experimentExtra massMatched peptidesRetention timecSymbols: *, consistent measured retention times; ‡, consistent predicted retention times; §, inconstent retention times.HPLC fractionaThe retention times of extra masses in fraction n lie between n and n + 1 minutes.MassbMean of 3-5 determinations of mass; 95% confidence limits ± 0.05%.MassSequenceMeasuredPredicted232067.62068.3TGQALASPGSC LEEFRASPF26‡312449.12449.7GQALASPGSC LEEFRASPF LECH33‡QALASPGSC LEEFRASPF LECHG33‡281781.51782.0ALASPGSC LEEFRASPF29.3*26‡312024.92024.3ALASPGSC LEEFRASPF LE31.8*31‡182167.32166.4LEEFRASPF LECHGRGTCN23‡312167.62168.5RFTTMPFL FCNVNDVCN F35‡152179.62179.5TTMPFL FCNVNDVCN FASR28.2§32§392078.52078.4TMPFL FCNVNDVCN FASR30.8§32§391977.91977.3MPFL FCNVNDVCN FASR30.2§31§311845.51846.1PFL FCNVNDVCN FASR29.0*30‡391977.91978.2FL FCNVNDVCN FASRND28§261831.91831.0L FCNVNDVCN FASRND22‡a The retention times of extra masses in fraction n lie between n and n + 1 minutes.b Mean of 3-5 determinations of mass; 95% confidence limits ± 0.05%.c Symbols: *, consistent measured retention times; ‡, consistent predicted retention times; §, inconstent retention times. Open table in a new tab Although the APC had been pulsed with a higher concentration of antigen, again insufficient peptide could be purified to obtain confirmatory sequence data. Instead the sequence assignments shown in Table III were tested by examining the properties of synthetic peptides with some of the proposed sequences. Three out of 6 (marked with asterisks in Table III) exhibited consistent HPLC retention times. Chromatograms for two of these are shown in Fig. 3. Five other extra masses were in fractions with retention times close to those predicted for their respective proposed sequences (marked with ‡ in Table III). Retention time prediction is likely to be acceptably accurate here because it is attempted only for peptides very similar to those used to calibrate the HPLC equipment; 17 of the 26 synthetic peptides used in the calibration were truncation variants of peptides containing one of the two 9-amino acid core sequences common to the sequences in Table III. Therefore analysis of the retention times of synthetic peptides with the sequences proposed in Table III supports sequence assignment in 8/11 and refutes assignment in 3/11. Because class II-associated peptides are known to be capable of binding to affinity-purified class II molecules (1Chicz R. Urban R. Lane W. Gorga J. Stern L. Vignali D. Strominger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), presumably by displacing other peptides, the binding capacity of synthetic peptides was examined in an inhibition binding assay (Fig. 4). Peptides containing either core sequence bound to affinity-purified HLA-DR15 with affinity (IC50, 1.1-6 µM) intermediate within the range reported for class II-associated peptides (1Chicz R. Urban R. Lane W. Gorga J. Stern L. Vignali D. Strominger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 29Buus S. Sette A. Colon S. Jenis D. Grey H. Cell. 1986; 47: 1071-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and similar (less than 5 fold difference) to that measured for the well described (26Wucherpfennig K.W. Sette A. Southwood S. Oseroff C. Matsui M. Strominger J.L. Hafler D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) DR15-binding myelin basic protein peptide 86-98(98A). Similar results were obtained for longer (20 residue) peptides enclosing these core sequences, suggesting that all the peptides in Table III are likely to bind to HLA-DR15 with high affinity. Taken together the data suggest that of the 17 extra masses biochemically detectable among the DR15-associated peptides of α3(IV)NC1-pulsed human B cells (in the second experiment), five correspond to peptides enclosing the core sequence LEEFRASPF, three correspond to peptides enclosing FCNVNDV, and nine remain unidentified. Class II-associated peptides have generally been studied by analyzing the responses of T cells to antigen or peptide-pulsed antigen presenting cells. Although this approach has the advantage of great sensitivity, it does not indicate the range and relative proportion of antigen-derived peptides presented nor necessarily the predominant peptides (30Viner N.J. Nelson C.A. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2214-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), because it can only detect peptides recognized by available T cells. These could be very different, especially in the case of autoantigens, both because of self-tolerance and because of practical limitations in the raising of panels of T cell clones with widely varying specificities and restrictions. In comparison, direct biochemical analysis of class II-associated peptides purified from antigen-pulsed cells potentially indicates both the range and relative proportion of antigen-derived peptides available for T cell recognition. This is advantageous because both parameters are believed important in determining the initiation of immune (and autoimmune) responses (8Nelson C.A. Roof R.W. McCourt D.W. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7380-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Buus S. Sette A. Colon S.M. Miles C. Grey H.M.

Today. 1995; 16: 90-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and the development of self-tolerance (11Cibotti R. Kanellopoulos J.M. Cabaniols J.P. Halle P.O. Kosmatopoulos K.

J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1743-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The use of a biochemical approach in the characterization of antigen-derived major histocompatability complex class II-associated peptides was first described by Nelson et al. (8Nelson C.A. Roof R.W. McCourt D.W. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7380-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, it is striking that the only reported successes with this approach have used HEL as antigen (5Vignali D. Urban R. Chicz R. Strominger J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1602-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Nelson C.A. Roof R.W. McCourt D.W. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7380-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This reflects the difficulty in analyzing the small quantity of antigen-derived peptides that can be isolated from even large numbers of antigen-pulsed cells (5Vignali D. Urban R. Chicz R. Strominger J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1602-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 34Demotz S. Grey H.M. Sette A. Science. 1990; 249: 1028-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 35Moore S. Schofield J. Watts C. Immunology. 1995; 85: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar) and perhaps the difficulty in preparing large quantities of antigen. Goodpasture disease may be particularly suitable for this approach. Unlike many autoimmune diseases, the target antigen is known and can be made in large quantities as a recombinant molecule. Also α3(IV)NC1, like HEL, is both a small molecule and cationic, factors that may promote uptake into APC (36Apple R.J. Domen P.L. Muckerheide A. Michael J.B. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3290-3295PubMed Google Scholar). However, success depended upon the recognition that α3(IV)NC1, like HEL, was likely to be presented in the form of nested sets of peptides. A strategy could then be devised by which candidate sequences for extra masses could be distinguished from other mass-matched sequences. However the numerical analysis utilized can only identify nested sets with many members; 9 extra masses were not assigned sequences and may be from nested sets with a few dominant members, as a consequence of processing or class II binding constraints, or be derived from proteins induced by antigen-pulsing. A deductive approach was necessary because insufficient α3(IV)NC1-derived peptide was obtained for sequence determination. Direct proof of the identity of the observed extra masses in peptide pools from antigen-treated cells requires sequence information. This was obtained by Nelson et al. (8Nelson C.A. Roof R.W. McCourt D.W. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7380-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), employing 70 µM HEL (70 times the quantity of antigen used in this study), but Vignali et al. (5Vignali D. Urban R. Chicz R. Strominger J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1602-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), employing 10 µM HEL, and ourselves found only sub-picomole quantities of antigen-derived peptides, and other authors have found even mass spectrometry insufficiently sensitive to distinguish T cell stimulating and nonstimulatory HPLC fractions (35Moore S. Schofield J. Watts C. Immunology. 1995; 85: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar). The successful application of this approach to other antigens has not been reported. Because it appears that adequate APC uptake of exogenous antigen is limiting, it is likely that enhancing uptake would permit extension of this approach to a broader range of antigens. One approach would be to take advantage of the greater efficiency of receptor-mediated endocytosis, for example by conjugating antigen to transferrin. Although it is striking that most autoimmune diseases exhibit strong HLA class II associations, the mechanism is unknown. If the association is to the HLA molecule and not to a linked gene, then current understanding of the function of HLA molecules would suggest that HLA-determined differences in antigen presentation is the mechanism. However, whereas there is evidence that the immune response to exogenous antigens is directed at the predominant antigen-derived peptides presented and that these are generally among those with highest class II binding affinity, data for autoantigens is lacking. Indeed there are theoretical arguments and experimental results that suggest that other peptides presented at lower level are important. In particular it may be expected that self-tolerance will be most securely established to the predominant self-peptides presented (11Cibotti R. Kanellopoulos J.M. Cabaniols J.P. Halle P.O. Kosmatopoulos K. Sercarz E. Kourilsky P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). If the rapidly accumulating knowledge on the peptide binding characteristics of class II molecules is to be utilized in the prediction of autoimmune disease-associated epitopes, it is important to clarify the relation between self-antigen-derived peptide presentation, class II type, and autoreactivity. Our data identify for the first time some of the predominant peptides derived from a human autoantigen presented on a disease-associated class II type, laying a foundation for investigating this relationship in human autoimmunity. We are grateful to Prof. J. Fothergill and I. Davidson in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology for access to and assistance in the use of a mass spectrometer."

Activation of the A2aR caused a marked stimulation of calcium entry and cell contractility, which were blocked by verapamil or nifedipine. The effects elicited by maximal concentrations of the A2aR agonist 2-[4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino]-5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine and the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol were additive, indicating that the two receptors do not share a common stimulatory mechanism. The cAMP antagonist (Rp)-adenosine cyclic 3′:5′-monophosphorothioate was ineffective in inhibiting the A2aR-mediated stimulation of contractility or the L-type calcium channel, while it completely abolished the isoproterenol effects. Activation of the A2aR had no effect on Na+/Ca2+ exchange or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation. Blocking of the A2aR resulted in unopposed A1 receptor-mediated inhibitory effects and led to an inhibition of basal contractility and an enhanced anti-adrenergic effect by A1 agonist.

The adenosine A2a receptor mediates a new cyclic AMP-independent mechanism and a new contractile function in the cardiac cell. INTRODUCTIONMultiple pathways mediate stimulation of cardiac cell contractility. The classical and best characterized pathway is that mediated by the β-adrenergic receptor, giving rise to an increase in cAMP with subsequent calcium entry and increase in myocyte contractility (1Walsh D.A. Clippinger M.S. Sivaramakrishnan S. McCullough T.E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Hartzell H.C. Mery P. Fischmeister R. Szabo G.

Trautwein W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The α-adrenergic receptor-mediated augmentation of cardiac contractility involves stimulation by inositol phosphates and protein kinase C that is cyclic AMP-independent (5Buckner R. Scholz H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 82: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Steinberg S.F. Chaow Y.K. Robinson R.B. Bilezikian J.P.

Buxton I.L. Brunton L.L. Circ. Res. 1985; 57: 532-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adenosine exerts pronounced contractile effects in the heart. In the cardiac ventricular cell, adenosine attenuates the increase in the force of contraction elicited by β-adrenergic agonist, known as the anti-adrenergic effect, while adenosine by itself has no direct effect on the basal level of contractility. The anti-adrenergic effect is mediated by the inhibitory A1 subtype of the adenosine receptor (for review, see Refs. 9Belardinelli L.B. Linden J. Berne R.M. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1989; 32: 93-97Crossref Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 10Olsson R.A. Pearson J.D. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 761-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 11Liang B.T. Trends Cardiovasc.

Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). Using fetal chick embryo ventricular cells as a model, prior studies demonstrated the presence of a high affinity adenosine A2a receptor capable of mediating positive inotropic response when the A1 receptor is blocked (14Xu D. Kong H. Liang B.T. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The marked positive inotropic response mediated by the A2a receptor suggests a significant physiological or pathophysiological role of this receptor in the cardiac cell. Since the inhibitory A1 receptor coexists with the stimulatory A2a receptor and since the A1 receptor mediates the anti-adrenergic effect of adenosine, the question arises regarding specifically the function of the A2a receptor in modulating the basal as well as the β-adrenergic stimulated contractile states. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the A2a receptor-mediated positive inotropic response is not known. Although activation of the A2a receptor can be coupled to stimulation of cAMP accumulation, it is not known whether cAMP mediates the increase in myocyte contractility.The objectives of this study, using cultured fetal ventricular cells as a model system, were to investigate the mechanism underlying the adenosine A2a receptor-mediated positive inotropic response and to study the contractile function subserved by the A2a receptor. Cardiac ventricular cells cultured from chick embryos retain many of the biological properties of the intact heart and represent a useful model for study of cardiac function and contractility (16DeHaan R.L.

Activation of adenosine receptors in these cultured heart cells produced physiological effects similar to those elicited by adenosine in the mammalian heart (14Xu D. Kong H. Liang B.T. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Liang B.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 249: 775-784PubMed Google Scholar). The present data demonstrate that the A2a receptor and the β-adrenergic receptor do not share a common pathway leading to stimulation of myocyte contractility or calcium entry; that a cyclic AMP-independent, Gs-mediated mechanism is largely responsible for the A2a receptor-mediated stimulatory response; and that a physiological action of the activated A2a receptor is to oppose the inhibitory effect of A1 receptor agonist on basal and β-adrenergic stimulated contractile states.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMethodsPreparation of Cultured Cardiac CellsAtrial and ventricular cells were cultured from chick embryos 14 days in ovo according to previously described procedures (15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Liang B.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 249: 775-784PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grew to confluence on day 3 of culture and exhibited rhythmic spontaneous contraction. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were carried out on day 3 of culture. Cultures were treated with adenosine deaminase (2 units/ml) for 24 h to keep the endogenous adenosine at a minimal level; they were also treated with pertussis toxin (5 ng/ml for 24 h) to uncouple the inhibitory A1 receptor from its effector(s) as described previously (14Xu D. Kong H. Liang B.T. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Blocking of the A1 receptor facilitated quantitation of the A2 receptor-mediated functional responses. In experiments in which cholera toxin was used to activate the stimulatory G protein (Gs), the cultures were treated with 2 µg/ml cholera toxin for 3 h. This dose and duration gave consistent stimulation of cyclic AMP and 45Ca2+ influx.Determination of Contractile AmplitudeMeasurement of contractile amplitude in cultured cardiac cells was carried out according to previously described methods (15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Barry W.H. Smith T.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 325: 243-260Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The contractile amplitude of the cultured cell was determined by an optico-video motion detection system with a video motion analyzer (Colorado Video Inc., Boulder, CO) as described previously. The perfusion medium contained the various adenosine analogs indicated as well as the following components: 4 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 137 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM CaCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, and 6% horse serum. Measurement of contractile amplitude was carried out on only one cell/coverslip, and each culture dish contained five coverslips. After achieving a steady state of beating in medium without adenosine analogs, the medium was switched to that containing the indicated adenosine drugs. Both the basal contractile amplitude and the amplitude measured during adenosine analog exposure were determined. The stimulatory effect of the various adenosine analogs on the contractile state was predominantly on the amplitude of contraction (14Xu D. Kong H. Liang B.T. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). There was no significant consistent effect of any of the analogs on the spontaneous rate of contraction.Measurement of Cyclic AMP LevelCultured ventricular cells were treated with pertussis toxin and adenosine deaminase as described above. On day 3 of culture, the media were replaced with culture medium lacking fetal bovine serum, and cells were incubated with the indicated agonist(s) and antagonist(s). Cyclic AMP was extracted and assayed according to a previously described radioimmunoassay method (Ref. 15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar; Amersham Corp.). The effect of agonist on cyclic AMP accumulation was linear for 10 min, at which time, cyclic AMP was extracted for assay.Measurement of 45Ca Uptake into Myocardial CellsDetermination of 45Ca uptake was made according to a modification of a previously described method (18Barry W.H. Smith T.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 325: 243-260Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated with L-[3,4,5-3H]leucine (152.2 Ci/mmol) for 24 h prior to the 45Ca uptake measurement. [3H]Leucine incorporated into the cellular protein allowed normalization of 45Ca content to milligrams of cellular protein. For measurement of 45Ca uptake, growth media in which ventricular cells were grown and maintained on 12-well culture plates were replaced with HEPES-buffered solution (pH 7.35) containing 1.0 mM CaCl2, 4 mM KCl, and 0.5 mM MgCl2 (buffer A) at 37°C for 10 min and then incubated in the same medium except that calcium was omitted and 1 mM EGTA was added (buffer B) and subsequently incubated in buffer A containing 45Ca (5-10 µCi/ml) and adenosine analogs for the times indicated. The step of exposure of myocytes to calcium-free medium helped minimize mixing of 45Ca with unlabeled Ca2+ near or at the cell surface, optimized 45Ca at the cell surface for subsequent uptake, and resulted in reproducible quantitation of 45Ca uptake. Cells were then washed free of the 45Ca media by four rinses with ice-cold buffer A containing 1 mM lanthanum. This washing procedure removed >99% of the extracellular marker 51Cr-labeled EDTA and thus ensured complete removal of the extracellular 45Ca. The presence of lanthanum in the wash buffer allowed displacement of any 45Ca that may have attached to the extracellular surface of the cells. Influx of 45Ca was quantitated for 90 s to allow determination of its uptake into the rapidly exchanging pool, which has been shown to be due either to calcium entry through the L-type calcium channel or to Na+/Ca2+ exchange (18Barry W.H. Smith T.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 325: 243-260Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Determination of 45Ca influx during this initial phase of its uptake in the presence of various agents permitted assessment of their effects on the activity of the calcium channel or Na+/Ca2+ exchange (24Laurent S. Kim D. Smith T.W. Marsh T.D. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Laurent S. Marsh T.D. Smith T.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For all data comparing the effect of different agents on 45Ca influx, one-way ANOVA 1The abbreviations used are: ANOVAanalysis of varianceIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate(R)-PIAN6-(R)-phenyl-2-propyladenosineCSC8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine(Rp)-cAMP-S(Rp)-adenosine cyclic 3′:5′-monophosphorothioate. followed by group comparison with the t test was carried out at each time point of 45Ca influx.Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Radioreceptor AssayThe effect of CGS21680 (2-[4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino]-5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) on the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) level in the cultured ventricular cells was determined. Growth media in which ventricular cells were grown were replaced with HEPES-buffered solution (pH 7.35) containing 1.0 mM CaCl2, 4 mM KCl, and 0.5 mM MgCl2. Cells were then exposed to CGS21680, carbamylcholine, or ATP at the concentrations indicated. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 volume of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid was removed by extraction with a solution of 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane/trioctylamine. The IP3 in the aqueous phase was determined by competing with [3H]IP3 for binding to the IP3 receptor supplied (DuPont). The concentration of IP3 in the sample was inversely proportional to the amount of [3H]IP3 in the membrane pellet. The increase in IP3 in response to carbamylcholine or ATP was detectable within 15 s, and the level remained elevated at 30 s. Data obtained at 30 s of exposure are presented as means ± S.E. of triplicates and are typical of four experiments.MaterialsThe adenosine analogs (R)-PIA and CGS21680 were from Research Biochemicals Inc.

Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies carried out in this laboratory have demonstrated the existence of a high affinity adenosine A2a receptor capable of mediating a marked positive inotropic response in cultured fetal chick embryo ventricular cells (14Xu D. Kong H. Liang B.T. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying the A2a receptor-mediated positive inotropic effect is not known. Although the A2a receptor is coupled to stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation, it is not clear whether cyclic AMP mediates all of the positive inotropic effect of A2a receptor agonist. It is not known whether the A2a receptor and the β-adrenergic receptor share a similar mechanism of positive inotropic effect. Furthermore, the role of the A2a receptor in regulating the contractile state of the cardiac cell is not known. Since the inhibitory A1 receptor coexists with the stimulatory A2a receptor in these cultured ventricular cells and since the A1 receptor mediates the anti-adrenergic effect of adenosine, the question arises regarding the specific role of the A2a receptor in modulating the basal as well as the β-adrenergic stimulated contractile states. The main findings of this study are as follows. The mechanism underlying the A2a receptor-mediated positive inotropic effect involves a cyclic AMP-independent, A2a receptor/Gs-mediated stimulation of the L-type calcium channel and differs from the mechanism of the β-adrenergic stimulated inotropic response. A normal function of the activated A2a receptor is to attenuate the A1 receptor-mediated anti-adrenergic response.Four lines of evidence support the existence of a new mechanism responsible for the A2a receptor-mediated positive inotropic response. First, the positive inotropic effects elicited by maximally effective concentrations of isoproterenol and CGS21680 were additive, indicating that the β-adrenergic and adenosine A2a receptors do not share a common positive inotropic mechanism. Similarly, the stimulation of calcium influx caused by maximally effective concentrations of isoproterenol and CGS21680 was also additive, providing further evidence for the distinct pathways used by the two receptors. Second, while the β-adrenergic receptor is coupled to pronounced stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation, A2a receptor activation caused only a modest increase in cyclic AMP, with nearly 10-fold less stimulation of the cyclic AMP level. Third, at a concentration of isoproterenol that caused an increase in the cyclic AMP level similar to the increase elicited by the maximally effective concentration of CGS21680, there was no increase in either myocyte contractile amplitude or calcium influx. Fourth, while (Rp)-cAMP-S was able to block all of the positive inotropic and calcium influx responses elicited by isoproterenol, (Rp)-cAMP-S could inhibit only a small portion of the calcium influx response stimulated by CGS21680. These data indicate that a distinct mechanism, different from that used by the β-adrenergic receptor, mediates the stimulatory contractile and calcium influx responses to adenosine A2a receptor agonist.Since verapamil or nifedipine (1 µM) was able to block all of the CGS21680-stimulated increase in calcium influx, an A2a receptor-mediated stimulation of the L-type calcium channel appeared to be responsible for the increase in calcium influx. Lowering the extracellular sodium in the presence of verapamil caused a marked stimulation of calcium influx, secondary to a Na+/Ca2+ exchange-mediated increase in calcium entry. The inability of CGS21680 to cause a further increase in calcium influx in this type of medium suggests that CGS21680 does not stimulate Na+/Ca2+ exchange. In the absence of verapamil, CGS21680 was able to cause a further increase in the level of calcium influx that was stimulated by lowering the extracellular sodium. These data provide further evidence for the notion that the CGS21680-induced calcium effect is mediated by the L-type calcium channel and does not involve Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Since CGS21680 could not stimulate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation, it is unlikely that the inositol trisphosphate is involved in mediating the CGS21680-induced stimulatory responses.Although (Rp)-cAMP-S inhibited partially the A2a receptor-mediated calcium influx response, the percent inhibition was modest (25%). These data indicate that a cAMP-independent pathway is capable of, and likely plays a primary role in, mediating the A2a agonist-induced increase in calcium influx. Activation of Gs by A2a receptor agonist likely mediates the cAMP-independent stimulation of the L-type calcium channel, based on the following evidence. First, direct activation of Gs by cholera toxin resulted in stimulation of both cAMP and calcium influx; cholera toxin-stimulated calcium influx exhibited both (Rp)-cAMP-S-sensitive and -insensitive components. Both components can be blocked by the L-type channel antagonists verapamil and nifedipine. Since activation of Gs can stimulate the L-type calcium channel independent of cAMP (32Yatani Y. Brown A.M. Science. 1989; 245: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 33Pelzer S. Shuba Y.M. Pelzer D.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 459: 228PGoogle Scholar), these data are consistent with the notion that cholera toxin-activated Gs can cause a cAMP-independent stimulation of the L-type calcium channel. Second, A2a agonist-stimulated calcium influx also exhibited (Rp)-cAMP-S-sensitive and -insensitive components, which were blocked by verapamil or nifedipine. These data indicate that the A2a receptor is also capable of mediating a cAMP-independent activation of the L-type channel. Similarities in the action and effect of CGS21680 compared with those of cholera toxin are consistent with the notion that the A2a agonist-induced augmentation of nifedipine-sensitive calcium influx involves a cAMP-independent, A2a receptor/Gs-mediated stimulation of the L-type calcium channel. Preliminary data demonstrate that transfection of the myocytes with rat Gαs causes an increased A2a agonist-mediated, nifedipine-sensitive 45Ca influx in the presence of (Rp)-cAMP-S, providing evidence that exogenous Gαs can couple the A2a receptor to a cAMP-independent stimulation of the calcium channel. Although β-adrenergic receptor activation, via Gs, can stimulate the L-type calcium channel directly independent of cAMP in the cardiac cell membrane (32Yatani Y. Brown A.M. Science. 1989; 245: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 33Pelzer S. Shuba Y.M. Pelzer D.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 459: 228PGoogle Scholar), the present data suggest that a cyclic AMP-independent, Gs-mediated pathway, which functionally coupled the cell-surface A2a receptor to stimulation of the L-type calcium channel, exists in the intact cardiac cell.These results indicate that cAMP mediates most if not all of the β-adrenergic stimulated increases in myocyte contractility and calcium influx in the cultured chick embryo ventricular cell, similar to findings in other cardiac cells (1Walsh D.A. Clippinger M.S. Sivaramakrishnan S. McCullough T.E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Hartzell H.C. Mery P. Fischmeister R. Szabo G.

Trautwein W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The reason for the ability of the Gs-linked adenosine A2a receptor, but not the Gs-linked β-adrenergic receptor, to couple to stimulation of the calcium channel independent of cAMP is not clear. Whether this differential ability of the two Gs-linked receptors to couple to activation of the calcium channel can be explained by a predetermined coupling of the A2a receptor to a pool of Gs capable of mediating a cAMP-independent stimulation of the calcium channel, which are separate from those coupled to the β-adrenergic receptor, remains unknown.The existence of an A2a receptor-mediated signaling mechanism distinct from that of the β-adrenergic receptor raised the possibility that activation of the A2a receptor can modulate not only the basal but also the anti-adrenergic contractile responses elicited by adenosine A1 receptor agonist. Prior studies indicated that (R)-PIA is an A1 receptor agonist capable of inhibiting basal (atrial cells) and isoproterenol-stimulated (both atrial and ventricular cells) increases in contractile amplitude (9Belardinelli L.B. Linden J. Berne R.M. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1989; 32: 93-97Crossref Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 10Olsson R.A. Pearson J.D. Physiol.

The present data demonstrate that (R)-PIA at the higher concentration can also activate the A2a receptor in the cultured ventricular cell. Blocking the A2a receptor with the selective antagonist CSC caused not only a decrease in basal contractile amplitude, but also a further inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated contractility in response to (R)-PIA. These data indicate that activation of the A1 receptor, if unopposed by the A2a subtype, could cause a direct negative inotropic effect as well as an enhanced anti-adrenergic response in the ventricular cell. The lack of effect of CSC on the A1 receptor-mediated anti-adrenergic or direct negative inotropic effect in atrial cells, which do not express an A2 receptor-mediated functional response (14Xu D. Kong H. Liang B.T. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), provides an important control and suggests that the effect of CSC in ventricular cells is not due to a nonspecific contractile response to CSC. These data are consistent with a prior study indicating that CSC acts as a selective antagonist at the adenosine A2a receptor in the cultured chick embryo ventricular cell (15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The data also indicate that potential agonist effect on the A2a receptor should be considered when studying the cardiac action of adenosine agonist.Overall, this study demonstrates a new stimulatory signaling mechanism mediated by the adenosine A2a receptor and elucidates a novel contractile function of the A2a receptor in the intact cardiac ventricular cell. Whether other cell-surface cardiac receptor(s) are also coupled to such Gs-mediated stimulatory pathway remains to be determined. Demonstration of this new cAMP-independent, Gs-mediated stimulatory mechanism in the cardiac cell, however, should have significant general implications for the regulation of basic cardiac function. INTRODUCTIONMultiple pathways mediate stimulation of cardiac cell contractility. The classical and best characterized pathway is that mediated by the β-adrenergic receptor, giving rise to an increase in cAMP with subsequent calcium entry and increase in myocyte contractility (1Walsh D.A. Clippinger M.S. Sivaramakrishnan S. McCullough T.E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Hartzell H.C. Mery P. Fischmeister R. Szabo G.

Trautwein W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The α-adrenergic receptor-mediated augmentation of cardiac contractility involves stimulation by inositol phosphates and protein kinase C that is cyclic AMP-independent (5Buckner R. Scholz H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 82: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Steinberg S.F. Chaow Y.K. Robinson R.B. Bilezikian J.P.

Buxton I.L. Brunton L.L. Circ. Res. 1985; 57: 532-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adenosine exerts pronounced contractile effects in the heart. In the cardiac ventricular cell, adenosine attenuates the increase in the force of contraction elicited by β-adrenergic agonist, known as the anti-adrenergic effect, while adenosine by itself has no direct effect on the basal level of contractility. The anti-adrenergic effect is mediated by the inhibitory A1 subtype of the adenosine receptor (for review, see Refs. 9Belardinelli L.B. Linden J. Berne R.M. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1989; 32: 93-97Crossref Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 10Olsson R.A. Pearson J.D. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 761-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 11Liang B.T. Trends Cardiovasc.

Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). Using fetal chick embryo ventricular cells as a model, prior studies demonstrated the presence of a high affinity adenosine A2a receptor capable of mediating positive inotropic response when the A1 receptor is blocked (14Xu D. Kong H. Liang B.T. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The marked positive inotropic response mediated by the A2a receptor suggests a significant physiological or pathophysiological role of this receptor in the cardiac cell. Since the inhibitory A1 receptor coexists with the stimulatory A2a receptor and since the A1 receptor mediates the anti-adrenergic effect of adenosine, the question arises regarding specifically the function of the A2a receptor in modulating the basal as well as the β-adrenergic stimulated contractile states. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the A2a receptor-mediated positive inotropic response is not known. Although activation of the A2a receptor can be coupled to stimulation of cAMP accumulation, it is not known whether cAMP mediates the increase in myocyte contractility.The objectives of this study, using cultured fetal ventricular cells as a model system, were to investigate the mechanism underlying the adenosine A2a receptor-mediated positive inotropic response and to study the contractile function subserved by the A2a receptor. Cardiac ventricular cells cultured from chick embryos retain many of the biological properties of the intact heart and represent a useful model for study of cardiac function and contractility (16DeHaan R.L.

Activation of adenosine receptors in these cultured heart cells produced physiological effects similar to those elicited by adenosine in the mammalian heart (14Xu D. Kong H. Liang B.T. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Liang B.T. Haltiwanger B. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Liang B.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The present data demonstrate that the A2a receptor and the β-adrenergic receptor do not share a common pathway leading to stimulation of myocyte contractility or calcium entry; that a cyclic AMP-independent, Gs-mediated mechanism is largely responsible for the A2a receptor-mediated stimulatory response; and that a physiological action of the activated A2a receptor is to oppose the inhibitory effect of A1 receptor agonist on basal and β-adrenergic stimulated contractile states."

To begin to establish a comprehensive protein map of the human centromere, affinity chromatography was used to identify nuclear proteins that specifically interact with CENP-C. Whereas a number of polypeptides appeared to interact with the full-length CENP-C protein, only a pair of similarly sized proteins of ~100 kDa specifically interacted with the isolated carboxyl-terminal third of the CENP-C protein. Neither protein of the doublet bound to control affinity columns. Affinity purification and microsequence analysis of the proteins in the doublet identified them as the two highly related nucleolar transcription factors, UBF1 and UBF2 (also known as the nucleolar autoantigen NOR-90). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that both proteins also interacted with the full-length CENP-C polypeptide with similar affinities. Double indirect immunofluorescence using monospecific antibodies demonstrated that a subset of CENP-C and UBF/NOR-90 is colocalized at nucleoli of interphase HeLa cells, suggesting that the in vitro interaction detected by affinity chromatography may reflect an interaction that occurs in vivo. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of the properties of interphase centromeres and the role of the nucleolus in scleroderma autoimmunity.

The genetic material of eukaryotes is packaged into chromosomes through its interactions with both histones and non-histone chromosomal proteins. Each of the histones is present in vast quantities in the cell and, as a component of nucleosomes, is responsible for the most basic level of chromatin organization. In contrast, individual non-histone chromosomal proteins are considerably less abundant and have more specialized roles, including the structural and functional organization of specific chromosomal elements. One such element is the centromere, the chromosomal region responsible for the precise and accurate segregation of the genetic material during mitosis and meiosis. The centromere directs the segregation of mitotic chromosomes through a differentiated trilaminar structure called the kinetochore, which serves as the binding site for spindle microtubules and for the mechanochemical motors that move chromosomes along those microtubules. The centromere also regulates the separation of sister chromatids at the metaphase-anaphase transition. A complete understanding of how the centromere coordinates these important functions requires comprehensive knowledge of the proteins involved. The identification of the protein components of the human centromere initially seemed a daunting task until it was discovered that patients with scleroderma spectrum disease produce circulating autoantibodies that recognize several centromeric polypeptides (1Brenner S. Pepper D. Berns M.W. Tan E. Brinkley B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Moroi Y. Hartman A.L. Nakane P.K. Tan E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding three ntromere roteins, CENP-A, -B, and -C, have now been cloned, and the proteins have been studied in detail. CENP-A is a novel centromere-specific core histone related to histone H3 (3Sullivan K.F. Hechenberger M. Masri K. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). CENP-B is an α-satellite DNA-binding protein that is localized throughout the centromeric heterochromatin located beneath the kinetochore (4Matsumoto H. Masukata H. Muro Y. Nozaki N. Okazaki T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 5Earnshaw W.C. Sullivan K.F. Machlin P.S. Cooke C.A. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. J.

CENP-C is also a DNA-binding protein and is located at the interface between the centromeric heterochromatin and the innermost region of the kinetochore (7Saitoh H. Tomkiel J. Cooke C.A. Ratrie III, H. Maurer M. Rothfield N.F. Earnshaw W.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, several obstacles have hindered the identification of other proteins that compose the human centromere and kinetochore. First, centromere proteins are very minor constituents in the cell. For example, it has been estimated that CENP-B is present in 20,000-50,000 copies/cell (8Muro Y. Matsumoto H. Okazaki T. Ohashi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 378-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 9Bernat R.L. The Human Centromere Proteins CENP-A, -B, and -C: An In Vivo Analysis of Centromere Structure and Function. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore1991Google Scholar). Second, like many structural proteins, centromere proteins are relatively insoluble, a property that complicates their isolation and characterization. Finally, there are no good functional assays available to screen for mammalian centromere proteins, nor are there any widely applicable methods for directly purifying these chromosomal structures. Despite these difficulties, two different approaches have identified a handful of new centromere proteins. One of these involves the visual/empirical survey of known proteins suspected of being involved in centromere function using monospecific antibody probes and immunoelectron microscopy of mitotic cells (10Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Wordeman L. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. Mitchison T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the other approach, centromere proteins are identified by generating monoclonal antibody probes to chromosomal protein fractions enriched in known centromeric autoantigens. This type of experiment has now been done using human, chicken, and Xenopus cells as starting material and has resulted in the identification of CENP-E, a kinesin-related microtubule-binding protein (12Yen T.J.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2053-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar); and the 3F3/2 kinetochore-localized phosphoepitopes that may be involved in cell cycle signaling (16Cyert M.S. Scherson T.

In addition, routine screening of patient autoimmune sera continues to occasionally yield a novel centromere-associated autoantigen (e.g. CENP-F) (18Casiano C.A. Landberg G. Ochs R.L. Tan E.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1045-1056PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rattner J.B. Rao A. Fritzler M.J. Valencia D.W. Yen T.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These approaches are unlikely to have identified all (or even a majority) of the protein components of the human centromere and kinetochore. Furthermore, none of these approaches begins to characterize the protein-protein interactions that functionally and structurally define the centromere and kinetochore. Mounting evidence suggests that the 140-kDa human centromeric autoantigen, CENP-C, plays a pivotal role in centromere structure and function. First, the demonstration that CENP-C is found only at the active centromere of a stable dicentric chromosome, while CENP-B is found at both the active and inactive centromeres, suggests a direct role for CENP-C in centromere function (20Earnshaw W.C. Ratrie H. Stetten G. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1989; 98: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Second, CENP-C has been immunolocalized to the inner plate of the kinetochore, a structure intimately involved in the attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle (7Saitoh H. Tomkiel J.

Third, evidence from antibody microinjection experiments indicates that CENP-C is involved in the assembly of a structurally sound, morphologically normal kinetochore and is required for the cell's timely transition into anaphase (21Tomkiel J. Cooke C.A. Saitoh H. Bernat R.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We have developed a biochemical approach to identify chromosomal proteins involved in centromere function. By exploiting CENP-C as an affinity handle to dissect protein interactions at the centromere, we have identified a specific interaction with two protein components of the nucleolus. Our results are consistent with known properties of interphase centromeres and the observed involvement of the nucleolus in the autoimmune response in scleroderma spectrum disease.

The full-length CENP-C open reading frame was isolated from pTCATG by digestion with NdeI followed by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase and EcoRI digestion and cloned into BamHI-digested and T4 DNA polymerase-treated pGEX2T, which was also digested with EcoRI. The correct reading frame of the resulting construct, pGEX2T/C1-943 (in which the numbers refer to the amino acid residues of CENP-C), was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. glutathione S-transferase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. pGEX2T/C1-943 was digested with BglII and EcoRI, and the resulting 5.9-kilobase fragment containing the entire pGEX2T sequence and the amino-terminal third of the CENP-C open reading frame was gel-isolated, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and self-ligated to create pGEX2T/C1-315. The 1074-base pair BglII-EcoRI fragment resulting from this same digestion was cloned into BamHI- and EcoRI-digested pGEX2T to create pGEX2T/C635-943. Oligonucleotide primers CENPC8 (5′-CAGTTGGATTACAATA-C-3′) and CENPC9 (5′-CTTGTAGAACAATCAAG-3′) were used to polymerase chain reaction-amplify the middle third of the CENP-C open reading frame from pTCATG. The resulting fragment was gel-isolated, digested with BamHI (sites underlined), and cloned into BamHI-digested and alkaline phosphatase-treated pGEX2T to create pGEX2T/C315-635. Constructs encoding GST-CENP-C fusion proteins were transformed into DH5α or CAG456 (pGEX2T/C1-943). Fusion protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.4 with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C (GST-C1-315 and GST-C635-943) or at 30°C (GST-C1-943 and GST-C315-635). Fusion proteins containing the middle or amino- or carboxyl-terminal third of CENP-C were affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) from bacterial lysates made by sonication at 0°C in XB buffer (20 mM NaPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, protease inhibitors, and either 150 mM NaCl (GST-C635-943) or 300 mM NaCl (GST-C1-315 and GST-C315-635). GST-C1-943 failed to bind glutathione-agarose and was therefore partially purified from induced bacteria as follows. Cells were lysed by sonication at 0°C in Solution I (10 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 25 mM NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitors. The supernatant resulting from centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min was brought to 33% ammonium sulfate, rotated for several hours at 4°C, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in Solution I and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer lacking detergent and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was adjusted to 10 mM MgCl2, incubated on ice for 45 min, and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in Solution I containing 400 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors and centrifuged for 10 min at 120 × g. The resulting supernatant was enriched for GST-C1-943. Control baits were purchased from Sigma (lysozyme) or affinity-purified as described above from induced bacteria transformed with pGEX2T (GST). Purified baits were coupled with Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) essentially as described (22Formosa T. Barry J. Alberts B.M. Greenblatt J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 24-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 1-2 mg of protein/ml of Affi-Gel. Columns containing 2-4 ml of coupled Affi-Gel were constructed in plastic disposable syringes. HeLa nuclei were typically isolated from 20 liters of cells grown to a density of 5-8 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1 mixture) with 2% calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were resuspended in 50-100 mM PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors and then lysed by sonication on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 2800 × g in a Sorvall SS34 rotor for 10 min. The resulting nuclear pellets were resuspended in the same buffer and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For extract preparation, frozen nuclei were thawed quickly in a room temperature water bath, and their volume was estimated. 0.5 volume of cold H2O containing protease inhibitors, 5 mg/ml RNase A, and 2 mg/ml nuclease P1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Digested nuclei were homogenized by douncing on ice and then aliquotted to 40-ml Sorvall tubes. To each tube (containing 10 ml of nuclei) were added 10 ml of cold 1 × TEE (10 mM triethanolamine HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 9.0) and 20 ml of cold 2 × lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 9.1, 20 mM EDTA, 20 mM EGTA, 4 M NaCl, 0.2% Ammonyx Lo, and 60 mM 2-mercaptoethanol), both containing protease inhibitors. The contents of each tube were then homogenized by douncing on ice followed by sonication to decrease the viscosity of the mixture and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were pooled, adjusted to 10-15% glycerol and 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, and dialyzed against several changes of RB buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 9.1, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Ammonyx Lo, 2 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, and 30 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) at 4°C. Dialyzed extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were pooled and used for affinity chromatography. Affinity columns coupled with protein baits were equilibrated with at least 20 volumes of RB buffer at 4°C and then loaded with nuclear extract, which was recirculated over experimental and control columns overnight in parallel. The following day, columns were washed with at least 20 volumes of RB buffer, and specifically bound proteins were eluted with RB buffer containing a 150 mM to 1 M NaCl gradient. Gradient fractions containing eluted proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated in the presence of tRNA, resolved on 5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels, and visualized by silver staining (Bio-Rad). The ~100-kDa doublet was affinity-purified from HeLa nuclear extract (~150 liters of cells) on three different GST-C635-943 affinity columns. Fractions containing the doublet, determined by silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, were pooled, concentrated by dialysis against Aquacide (Calbiochem), and then precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting pellet was washed with 90% acetone and 10% HCl, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, resolved on a 6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Bands corresponding to each protein of the doublet were visualized by staining the membrane with 0.2% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid and excised from the membrane. Internal microsequence analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (23Earnshaw W.C. Halligan N. Cooke C. Rothfield N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Immunodetections using ECL (Amersham Corp.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human and anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Corp.) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described (24Pluta A.F. Saitoh N. Goldberg I. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).

Hernandez-Verdun; affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-UBF was obtained from H. Beckmann and R. Tjian. Polyclonal anti-CENP-C antibody (anti-g296-943) was as described (7Saitoh H. Tomkiel J. Cooke C.A. Ratrie III, H. Maurer M. Rothfield N.F. Earnshaw W.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to begin to develop a structural map of the human kinetochore, starting with CENP-C, a well characterized component of the inner kinetochore plate. CENP-C is a particularly suitable subject for such studies as it has been previously shown that this protein is important for determining the overall diameter of the human kinetochore plates (21Tomkiel J. Cooke C.A. Saitoh H. Bernat R.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Four methods have recently come into wide use for the identification of ligands that interact with a protein of interest. 1) Genetics provides a powerful means of detecting interactions between gene products in certain organisms, especially those where the ability to manipulate chromosomal DNA sequences has been developed. 2) The yeast two-hybrid interaction trap provides a way of detecting protein domains that interact with sufficient affinity to generate a transcriptional activator whose activity can be monitored by the expression of reporter constructs (26Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 27Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). 3) Co-immunoprecipitation is frequently used to detect associations between various soluble proteins. 4) Finally, affinity chromatography, the least widely used of these methods, provides a way of detecting interacting components and assessing their relative affinities for one another (28Formosa T. Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2442-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the case of CENP-C, the repertoire of methods that can be used to search for interacting proteins is limited. CENP-C has yet to be detected in any genetically tractable organism outside of mammals. Likewise, co-immunoprecipitation is excluded by the fact that CENP-C is a structural protein that is soluble only under denaturing conditions that disrupt most biologically relevant protein-protein interactions. 3A. F. Pluta, unpublished data. Thus, the yeast interaction trap 4A. F. Pluta, I. Goldberg, and W. C. Earnshaw, manuscript in preparation. and affinity chromatography, which forms the subject of this report, are left as the two viable methods to search for proteins that interact with CENP-C. Affinity chromatography requires the purification of significant quantities of the protein that is to be used as the “bait” and the development of an appropriate extract of soluble cellular proteins, which is the source of potential interacting proteins or ligands (22Formosa T. Barry J. Alberts B.M. Greenblatt J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 24-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both of these requirements presented unique challenges for the identification of proteins that interact with CENP-C because of the nature of human centromere proteins. Human centromere proteins (and, presumably, the proteins with which they interact) are not only exceedingly minor components in the cell, but are also associated with the chromosome scaffold fraction (23Earnshaw W.C. Halligan N. Cooke C. Rothfield N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Chromosome scaffold proteins are distinguished from other chromosomal proteins by their unusual degree of insolubility. Solubilization of these proteins typically requires not only conditions designed to disrupt protein-protein interactions, such as high salt or low salt in the presence of polyanions, but also requires the addition of substantial levels of a reducing agent, such as β-mercaptoethanol (29Adolph K.W. Cheng S.M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1977; 12: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 30Paulson J.R. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1977; 12: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). This combination of low abundance and insolubility precluded the purification of endogenous CENP-C from human cells for use as an affinity bait. Therefore, to obtain the milligram quantities of CENP-C necessary to make useful affinity columns, full-length CENP-C and several portions of the CENP-C polypeptide were affinity-purified as GST fusion proteins from induced bacterial cells that had been transformed with the appropriate pGEX/CENP-C construct. Fig. 1 diagrams the CENP-C-derived GST fusion proteins used as baits in our experiments and lists their predicted properties. The hydropathy plot shown in Fig. 1A predicts that GST-CENP-C is a hydrophilic and highly basic (pI 9.2) protein. Two control baits were also included in all affinity chromatography experiments. One of these, lysozyme (pI ~10), was included as a control for nonspecific binding of acidic ligands to the three basic CENP-C-derived baits. The second control bait consisted of GST alone since this bacterial peptide was fused to all CENP-C-derived constructs. In Fig. 1C, the expressed CENP-C baits are displayed on Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. All partial CENP-C baits were affinity-purified on GST-agarose. GST-C1-943, which contains the full-length CENP-C open reading frame, failed to bind GST-agarose and was instead partially purified from induced bacterial extracts by standard biochemical fractionation (see “Materials and Methods”). The development of a suitable extract to be used as the source of putative interacting proteins was also dictated by the known properties of human centromere proteins described above. A protein extract derived from purified human mitotic chromosomes would, in theory, be the ideal source for identifying proteins that interact with a component of the inner kinetochore plate. In practice, however, the vast amounts of purified chromosomes required as starting material if sufficient amounts of interacting proteins are to be recovered for subsequent analysis and identification make this impractical. The compromise was to develop a protein extract from crude preparations of interphase nuclei obtained from HeLa cells grown in large chemostat cultures. Interphase nuclei are a reasonable source of proteins that interact with centromere proteins because several of the CENP proteins, including CENP-C, are constitutive components of interphase centromeres (2Moroi Y. Hartman A.L. Nakane P.K. Tan E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Earnshaw W.C. Ratrie H. Stetten G. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1989; 98: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 31Matsumoto H. Sugimoto K. Okazaki T. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 181-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). While it is certainly possible that some interactions that require mitosis-specific post-translational protein modifications would not be detected using a nuclear extract as a source of interacting proteins, it is also possible that previously unsuspected interactions that are specific to interphase centromeres could be identified by using such an extract. Among the requirements for a successful affinity chromatography experiment is that the putative interacting ligands exist as soluble proteins in the extract. In practice, this requirement proved difficult to satisfy. To produce a nuclear extract containing soluble proteins, the putative (unknown) interactors were assumed to behave biochemically like known centromere proteins, which can be monitored by immunoblotting. If an initial high salt nuclear lysate was made by solubilizing isolated nuclei in a buffer containing 2 M NaCl and 30 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2), the majority of nuclear proteins detected by Coomassie Blue staining, including CENP-A, -B, and -C, which were detected by immunoblotting, were recovered in the supernatant or soluble fraction. Such a high salt lysate cannot, however, be used to detect ionic interactions by affinity chromatography. It was therefore necessary to reduce the ionic strength of the solubilized nuclear ligands prior to their passage over the affinity columns by either dialysis or dilution. Initially, either step resulted in the abrupt precipitation of the bulk of the chromosomal proteins including all of the CENP antigens. Eventually, buffer conditions were established that permitted the reduction of the salt concentration of the nuclear lysate to near physiological levels (150 mM) while maintaining the solubility of the majority of total protein as well as significant amounts of centromere proteins detectable by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). This soluble low salt extract was used as the source of interacting proteins in subsequent affinity chromatography experiments. In a typical affinity chromatography experiment, a low salt nuclear extract derived from ~2 × 1010 HeLa cells was pumped simultaneously over four affinity columns, which were set up in parallel, and recirculated overnight at 4°C. Two of these affinity columns were coupled with the control baits, GST and lysozyme. The remaining two affinity columns were each coupled with a different experimental bait consisting of a CENP-C-derived GST fusion protein. Following extensive washing of the affinity columns with running buffer containing 150 mM NaCl to remove nonspecifically associated nuclear proteins, specifically bound proteins were eluted from each column with a linear salt gradient and visualized on silver-stained polyacrylamide gels. The protein elution profiles from a typical experiment in which the two experimental columns were coupled with GST-C1-943 and GST-C635-943 are shown in Fig. 3. It is immediately obvious that while very few proteins could be eluted from either control column (panels A and B), a unique spectrum of proteins could be eluted from each of the experimental columns (panels C and D). This ranged from no proteins specifically eluted from the column baited with the amino-terminal 315 amino acids of CENP-C (data not shown), to a complex mixture of proteins that was eluted from the column baited with full-length CENP-C (panel C).

It has been shown recently that the dodecamer plays an important role in the dissociation and reassociation of the HBL structure (12Sharma P.K. Kuchumov A.R. Chottard G. Martin P.D. Wall J.S.

Furthermore, a preliminary x-ray diffraction study of oxydodecamer crystals has shown that it has an almost planar conformation (13Martin P.D. Eisele K.L. Doyle M.A. Kuchumov A.R. Walz D.A.

Materials—L. terrestris Hb was prepared as described previously in 0.1 M Tris·Cl buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, ~2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride from live worms from around London, Ontario (Carolina Wholesale Bait Co., Canton, NC) (3Vinogradov S.N. Sharma P.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Blood was the supernatant from the first centrifugation to remove cellular debris. The dodecamer was isolated by preparative gel filtration at neutral pH, subsequent to exposure to 4 M urea (11Vinogradov S.N. Sharma P.K. Qabar A.N. Wall J.S. Westrick J.A. Simmons J.H. Gill S.J. J.

Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and were pooled on the basis of their subunit content. The concentration was calculated from the absorbance of the cyano-met form at 540 nm using the extinction coefficient 0.656 ± 0.011 ml·mg−1·cm−1 for the monomer subunit (6Vinogradov S.N. Shlom J.M. Hall B.C. Kapp O.H. Mizukami H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 492: 136-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). GdmCl was purum grade from Fluka AG (9470 Buchs, Switzerland), and urea was from Sigma. The heteropolytungstates SiW and AsW were synthesized as described by Klemperer (15Klemperer W.G. Inorganic Syntheses. Vol 27. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 71Google Scholar). Scattering experiments were performed using a Kratky compact camera with slit collimation, a position-sensitive detector (MBraun PSD-50M), and a Philips PW2253/11 x-ray tube with a copper target, operated at 50 kV and 30 mA. Sample solutions were placed in a 1-mm diameter Mark capillary and kept at 4°C during the measurements. A 30-µm nickel filter was employed to eliminate polychromatic effects. Using a sample to detector distance of about 20.9-cm, the width per detector channel corresponded to 0.00964 nm−1 on the h scale (h = (4π/λ)sinθ; 2θ is the scattering angle, λ = 0.154 nm is the wavelength of the CuKα line). Significant scattering data were collected in 300 channels corresponding to h values ranging from 0.056 to 2.0 nm−1. The counting time was typically 1800 s, and each scattering curve was recorded several times in order to reduce the statistical errors. Two series of measurements for the oxy and deoxy forms of the dodecamer were performed using five different concentrations ranging from 5 to 53 mg/ml in 0.1 M Tris·Cl buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA. Data evaluation, including smoothing, desmearing, and indirect Fourier transformation, was carried out with the computer program ITP. Details of the experimental technique and the evaluation procedure are described elsewhere (16Pilz I. Glatter O. Kratky O. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 148-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982: 1Google Scholar). A finite element method (small identical spheres) was used for model calculations to simulate the experimentally obtained scattering curves and distance distribution functions (18Glatter O. Acta Phys. Austriaca. 1980; 52: 243-250Google Scholar). Deoxygenation of the oxydodecamer solution was performed directly in the Mark capillary by repeated evacuation and equilibration with purified nitrogen. The spectral alterations attendant upon the conversion of oxy to deoxy forms, namely the disappearance of the two peaks at 540 and 575 nm and the appearance of a broad peak at 550 nm, were followed via the measurement of visible absorption spectra over the 490-650-nm region using the Mark capillary as the sample cell in a specially constructed device equipped with two adjustable slits and an attenuation filter as reference, placed in a Zeiss PMQII spectrophotometer. The reversibility of the oxy to deoxy spectral alteration was checked by reoxygenation of the sample in the capillary in the presence of air. For velocity sedimentation studies, 3- and 12-mm optical path double sector analytical ultracentrifuge cells were filled with oxydodecamer solutions (14 to 0.04 mg/ml) in 0.1 M Tris·Cl buffer, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0, using the dialysate for dilution of the stock solutions. The cell thickness (3 or 12 mm) and the wavelength of the light used to detect the gradient (280, 310, or 412 nm) were chosen so that the initial absorbance was ~2 for the high and ~0.1 for the low concentration samples. The appropriate dialysate was loaded in the reference side of each cell. The cells were centrifuged at 1, 25, and 40°C at 55,000 rpm in a Beckmann XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, and the absorbance was measured radially for several hours until the boundaries had sedimented almost to the bottom of the cell. For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, oxydodecamer solutions were diluted using the dialysate to provide concentrations of 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.08, and 0.04 mg/ml. Approximately 25 or 100 µl were loaded into the sample channels of 6-channel sedimentation equilibrium cells (19Yphantis D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1960; 88: 586-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 20Ansevin A.T. Roark D.E. Yphantis D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with 3- and 12-mm optical paths and 3 and 10 µl of high density fluorocarbon oil (M&M FC-43) added, respectively, in order to raise the bottom of the solution and provide column heights of 2 mm in all cases. The solvent channels were filled with about 30 and 110 µl of dialysate, respectively. The concentration gradients were measured from the absorbance at 280, 418, and 540 nm, depending on the protein concentration. The cells were centrifuged in a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 14,000 rpm at 1°C for dodecamer from urea and 10,000 rpm at 1 and 25°C for dodecamer from SiW dissociation, respectively. Absorbance data were taken radially at 0.001-cm intervals and scans made every 3 h. Sedimentation equilibrium was determined to have been reached when successive scans were not detectably different as determined by a program (MATCH developed by D. Yphantis). Data sets were also obtained upon reaching equilibrium at 19,000 and 24,000 rpm for dodecamer from urea dissociation and 20,000 rpm for dodecamer from SiW dissociation. This range of speeds was necessary to resolve species from monomer to dodecamer. A nonlinear least squares program (21Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) was used for data analysis. Low pressure, isocratic gel filtration was carried out at room temperature (20 ± 2°C) employing an FPLC system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and 1 × 30-cm columns of Superose S12 or S6 (Pharmacia). Flow rate was 0.4 ml/min, and the eluate was monitored at 280 nm. A constant amount of protein in a constant sample volume, ~800 µg/200 µl, was loaded each time. The FPLC elution curves were acquired using the Easyest System 8 (Keithley Instruments, Inc. Rochester, NY) and an IBM PC386 computer and fitted with EMG's representing the undissociated dodecamer D, the trimer T, and the monomer subunit M, employing least squares minimization (Peak Fit Version 2.0, Jandel Scientific). The EMG function is a convolution of gaussian and decreasing exponential +functions, f(x)=aOexpa222a32+(a1−x)a31+erf22(x−a1a2−a2a3(Eq. 1) where a0 is the amplitude, a1 is the center, a2 is the width of the gaussian, and a3 is the width of the exponential. The EMG is asymmetric with an exponential tail on the right side, whose fall-off rate is controlled by the parameter a3. The EMG represents well the shape of chromatographic elution peaks (22Jonsson J.A. Chromatographic Theory and Basic Principles. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1987Google Scholar, 23Reh E. Trends Anal. Chem. 1995; 14: 1-5Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Urea, GdmCl, or SiW was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris·Cl buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, and stock solution of the oxydodecamer added to obtain the desired concentration (~1.0 mg/ml). Conversion of oxy- to metdodecamer was affected by the addition of potassium ferricyanide (Fisher) or of sodium nitrite (Aldrich) at molar ratios relative to heme, ranging from 1 to 1000. Upon completion of the spectral alterations over the 450-650-nm range the oxidizing agent was removed by gel filtration on a 1.5 × 20-cm column of Sephadex G-25. The dissociations at neutral pH and at pH 8.0 were followed by FPLC. The areas of the individual peaks representing undissociated dodecamer D, trimer T, and monomer M expressed as percent of total were plotted versus time and fitted to sums of two exponentials, f(t)=a1exp[−k1t]+a2exp[−k2t](Eq. 2) employing PSI-Plot software (Poly Software Int., Salt Lake City, UT) and the Marquardt-Levenberg method. The fit was judged acceptable only in the absence of systematic trends in the plot of residuals with time. O2 binding equilibria were measured at 25 and 10°C, using a modified gas diffusion chamber allowing stepwise increases in O2 pressure (24Weber R.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 386-387Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Cox R.P. J. Comp. Physiol. B Metab. Transp. Funct. 1987; 157: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Variation in pH was obtained by adding Tris·Cl buffers of different pH. The chamber was coupled to cascaded Woesthoff (types M301, M201 and M101a-f) gas pumps for mixing pure N2 (99.998%), atmospheric air, and O2. The P50 and n50 were interpolated from linear plots of log(S/(1 − S)) versus log PO2 for S (fractional saturation) between 0.3 and 0.7. The O2 equilibrium measurements at extremes of saturation were measured as described previously (26Weber R.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 27Weber R.E. Malte H. Braswell E.H. Oliver R.W.A. Green B.N. Sharma P.K. Kuchumov A. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 703-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Errors resulting from possible incomplete saturation in the presence of pure O2 were minimized by upper end point extrapolation of log(A) versus 1/PO2 plots to 1/PO2 = 0. Lower end point correction was carried out applying an A versus PO2 plot. The extrapolations were performed by fitting a cubic polynomial. The data were analyzed in terms of the two-state MWC equation (28Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar): S=LKTP{1+KTP}(q−1)+KTP{1+KRP}(q−1)L(1+KTP)q+(1+KRP)q(Eq. 3) where S denotes saturation, P the partial pressure of O2, L the allosteric constant, KT and KR the association equilibrium constants for the low affinity (T, tense) and high affinity (R, relaxed) forms, respectively, and q the number of interacting binding sites. Nonlinear least squares fitting of the data in the form log(S/(1 − S)) versus log(P) was performed using the software package Mathematica (Wolfram Research Inc., Champaign, IL 61820) employing the Marquardt-Levenberg method. The final scattering curves I(h) for the oxy and deoxy forms of dodecamer from Hb dissociation in urea, obtained after extrapolation to zero concentration, are shown in Fig. 1A and the corresponding pair distance distribution functions p(r) in Fig. 1B. The molecular parameters derived from the two functions are provided in Table I; they appear to be identical within the error limits.Table I.SAXS molecular parameters for dodecamer and modelParameterDodecameraFrom Hb dissociation in urea.ModelbConsensus model (Fig. 2) based on averaging 33 well-fitting models using 265 overlapping spheres, 0.661 nm in diameter.OxyDeoxyRadius of gyration (nm)3.74 ± 0.013.73 ± 0.013.74 ± 0.05Maximum diameter (nm)10.59 ± 0.0110.59 ± 0.0110.7 ± 0.1Volume (nm3)255 ± 10250 ± 10249 ± 2Molecular mass (kDa)cBased on a calculated specific volume of 0.733.190 ± 19191 ± 19a From Hb dissociation in urea.b Consensus model (Fig. 2) based on averaging 33 well-fitting models using 265 overlapping spheres, 0.661 nm in diameter.c Based on a calculated specific volume of 0.733. Open table in a new tab The scattering curves and p(r) functions of a large number of models were calculated using small overlapping identical spheres to represent the protein mass (17Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982: 1Google Scholar) and compared with the experimental results. Only a few models were found to exhibit scattering equivalent to the dodecamer, i.e. fulfilling the following requirements within the mean square deviation, 1) same radius of gyration, 2) same scattering curve up to h = 1.9 nm−1 (corresponding to about 3 orders of magnitude in intensity), 3) same maximum diameter and shape of p(r) functions, and 4) similar volume. Fig. 2A shows the consensus model obtained by averaging 33 slightly different models, all of them fulfilling the above requirements. As a consequence of averaging, the spheres comprising the consensus model (265 spheres, radius 0.661 nm) are no longer all of equal weight. In the figure, the filled spheres have a high weight (i.e. common to at least 32 models), the empty spheres have a low weight (common to only one or two models), and the gray spheres have an intermediate weight. If this weighting is taken into account the I(h) and p(r) functions of the consensus model provide excellent agreement with the experimental curves (Fig. 3). Its x, y, and z dimensions are 9.6 ± 0.2, 8.5 ± 0.1, and 4.9 ± 0.3 nm, respectively; the molecular parameters are given in Table I.Fig. 3Comparison of the experimental scattering curve I(h) (A) and the pair distance distribution function p(r) of the oxydodecamer from Hb dissociation in urea (filled squares) with the curves calculated for the consensus model (solid line) and for the planar model (dashed line) in Fig. 2 (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Attempts to fit the experimental data with more oblate models were unsuccessful. Fig. 2B shows a planar model (223 spheres, radius 0.661 nm−1) which had the following molecular parameters, radius of gyration 3.75 nm, maximum dimension 10.8 nm, volume 270 nm3, dimensions x = y = 9.5 nm, and dimension z = 4.2 nm. The scattering curve of this model deviates from the experimental one (Fig. 3A) in the angular range h ≥1 nm−1), whereas the model shown in Fig. 2A fits the experimental curve up to h = 1.9 nm−1. Comparison of the pair distance distribution functions in Fig. 3B also shows considerable discrepancies in the case of the planar model. As a consequence of planarity, the shape of the p(r) function is changed in a way that the frequency of distances representing the “thickness” of the model is increased, leading to a shift of the p(r) function maximum to the left. The scans were analyzed by the dc/dt method (29Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) to provide weight distributions of sedimentation coefficients (s), called g*s.

The program calculates the value of the reduced molecular weight (M′ = M{1 − vρ}, where v is the specific volume, M is the molecular weight of the molecule, and ρ is the density of the solution), the values of other constants related to the model, i.e. second virial coefficient, equilibrium constants, etc., and the value of the r.m.s. error. M′ was converted to molecular weight using v = 0.733, calculated from the amino acid compositions (30Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Proteins.

The time course of oxydodecamer dissociation in 1.75 molal urea is shown in Fig. 7, B-D. The points represent averages of two separate experiments. The dissociation of the dodecamer was followed to >80% completion, ~1400 h. The insets show the initial 10% of the processes. In all cases, the data could be properly fitted only with two exponentials. The resulting residuals are shown at the bottom of the plots.

Whether bile salts directly suppress 7α-hydroxylase expression at the level of the hepatocyte or do so indirectly by promoting the release or absorption of an intestinal factor has not been resolved. We have investigated the ability of primary bile salts to suppress hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression in bile-diverted hamsters. Biliary diversion was accompanied by derepression of both hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity (4-5-fold) and bile salt secretion (~3-fold). Derepression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression could be prevented by several interventions that increase the availability of bile salts within the hepatocyte including 1) overexpression of an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, 2) obstruction of the common bile duct, and 3) intravenous infusions of taurocholate. In contrast, none of these interventions prevented derepression of hepatic cholesterol synthesis or significantly down-regulated hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor expression over the relatively short time course (24 h) of these studies. Together, these data indicate that primary bile salts contribute to the regulation of bile salt synthesis through feedback repression of 7α-hydroxylase expression at the level of the hepatocyte.

Derepression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression could be prevented by several interventions that increase the availability of bile salts within the hepatocyte including 1) overexpression of an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, 2) obstruction of the common bile duct, and 3) intravenous infusions of taurocholate. In contrast, none of these interventions prevented derepression of hepatic cholesterol synthesis or significantly down-regulated hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor expression over the relatively short time course (24 h) of these studies. Together, these data indicate that primary bile salts contribute to the regulation of bile salt synthesis through feedback repression of 7α-hydroxylase expression at the level of the hepatocyte. Conversion of cholesterol to bile salts is the principal regulated pathway whereby cholesterol is eliminated from the body. The first and rate-limiting step in this pathway is catalyzed by hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (1Shefer S. Hauser S. Berkersky I. Mosbach E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 404-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity appears to be regulated at the transcriptional level by the quantity of bile salts fluxing through the enterohepatic circulation (2Myant N.B. Mitropoulos K.A. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 135-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Thus, interventions that accelerate bile salt loss from the enterohepatic circulation (thereby reducing bile salt pool size) lead to derepression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression and enhanced bile salt synthesis. Conversely, expansion of the enterohepatic pool of bile salts leads to suppression of 7α-hydroxylase activity and reduced rates of bile salt formation. How bile salts fluxing through the enterohepatic circulation regulate the expression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase remains unclear. In the bile-diverted rat, depletion of the enterohepatic pool of bile salts leads to derepression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity and an increase in the rate of bile salt synthesis, effects that can be prevented by the intraduodenal administration of bile salts (4Heuman D.M. Hernandez C.R. Hylemon P.B. Kubaska W.M. Hartman C. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Shefer S. Nguyen L. Salen G. Batta A.K. Brooker D. Zaki F.G. Rani I. Tint G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The conventional interpretation of these experiments is that the flux of bile salts through the hepatocyte (or, more likely, the concentration of bile salts within the hepatocyte) is being sensed, resulting in feedback repression of the rate-limiting enzyme in the bile salt biosynthetic pathway. However, early studies using hepatocyte suspensions or cultures failed to demonstrate any direct regulatory effect of exogenous bile salts on the secretion of bile salts into the media (6Botham K.M. Lawson M.E. Beckett G.J. Percy-Robb I.W. Boyd G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 666: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Kubaska W.M. Gurley E.C. Hylemon P.B. Guzelian P.S. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13459-13463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, additional studies in the rat failed to support a direct role for bile salts in the regulation of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression. Thus, obstruction of the common bile duct, which leads to an accumulation of bile salts within the liver, paradoxically increases hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity and bile salt synthesis in the rat (8Kinugasa T. Uchida K. Kadowaki M. Takase H. Nomura Y. Saito Y. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Takita M. Ikawa S. Ogura Y. J. Biochem.

In addition, the creation of a thoracic duct lymph fistula in rats with an intact enterohepatic circulation leads to derepression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase, suggesting the presence of an intestinally derived inhibitory factor carried in lymph (11Akerlund J.-E. Bjorkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2159-2166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Pandak et al. (12Pandak W.M. Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Chiang J.Y.L. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) administered equimolar amounts of taurocholate intravenously or intraduodenally to bile-diverted rats and found that intraduodenal, but not intravenously administered, taurocholate exerted negative feedback inhibition on hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression. Together, these data suggest that bile salts may have no direct effect on hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression. Rather, these studies suggest that an intestinal factor, released or absorbed in the presence of bile salts, may play a role in the regulation of bile salt synthesis. Most of the work cited above has been carried out in the rat, an animal model that differs significantly from humans with respect to sterol and lipoprotein metabolism. In contrast to the rat, the hamster more closely resembles humans with respect to basal rates of cholesterol and bile salt synthesis (13Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Spady D.K. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1637-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), composition of the bile salt pool (14Singhal A.K. Finver-Sadowsky J. McSherry C.K. Mosbach E.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Nutr. 1993; 13: 355-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, we recently noted that primary overexpression of an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene in the hamster resulted in reciprocal down-regulation of the endogenous gene, suggesting that bile salts may directly regulate expression of the 7α-hydroxylase gene in this species (18Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M. Meidell R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In these studies, however, primary overexpression of the exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene was accompanied by expansion of the enterohepatic pool of bile salts, raising the possibility that suppression of the endogenous gene may have resulted from an increased flux of bile salts in the expanded enterohepatic pool. The purpose of the present work was to determine if bile salts directly regulate hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression in the bile-diverted hamster, an animal model that more closely resembles the human situation than does the rat (13Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Spady D.K. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1637-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Singhal A.K. Finver-Sadowsky J. McSherry C.K. Mosbach E.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Three independent approaches were used to increase bile salt availability within the liver: 1) overexpression of an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene, 2) complete biliary obstruction, and 3) intravenous infusion of taurocholate. All three approaches resulted in suppression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression, indicating that bile salts suppress their own synthesis at the level of the hepatocyte through feedback repression of 7α-hydroxylase expression. Male Golden Syrian hamsters (Sasco, Inc., Omaha, NE) were housed in colony cages and subjected to light cycling for at least 3 weeks prior to use in specific experiments. During this time, animals were maintained on commercial rodent diet (Wayne Lab Blox, Allied Mills, Chicago, IL). Under brief diethyl ether anesthesia, gallbladder bile was aspirated, the cystic duct was tied, and a polyurethane cannula (0.012-inch inner diameter, Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA) was placed in the common bile duct. In addition, each animal was fitted with a femoral vein catheter. The animals were placed in individual cages and received a glucose-electrolyte infusion at the rate of 1.2-2 ml/h. The infusate contained glucose (10%), NaCl (80 mM), KCl (20 mM), K2HPO4 (20 mM), and NaHCO3 (30 mM). The enterohepatic pool was allowed to drain out for 12-14 h. After an additional 24 h of biliary diversion, animals were sacrificed, and aliquots of plasma and liver were taken for specific determinations. Timed bile collections were obtained throughout the 36-h period of biliary diversion. Generation of the recombinant adenoviruses AdCMV7α (carrying a gene encoding rat 7α-hydroxylase), AdCMVLuc (carrying a gene encoding firefly luciferase), and AdCMVβgal (carrying a gene encoding a nuclear localizing variant of Escherichia coli β-galactosidase) have been previously described (18Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M. Meidell R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Large scale production of recombinant adenovirus was carried out by infecting confluent monolayers of 293 cells grown in 15-cm tissue culture plates with primary stock at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1-1.0 (20Willard J.E. Landau C. Glamann D.B. Burns D. Jessen M.E. Pirwitz M.J. Gerard R.D. Meidell R.S. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2190-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Infected monolayers were lysed with Nonidet P-40 (final concentration 0.1%) when >90% of the cells showed cytopathic changes. Recombinant virus was purified by precipitation with polyethylene glycol 8000, centrifugation on a discontinuous d = 1.3-1.4 g/ml density gradient, and desalting by chromatography on Sepharose CL4B in an isotonic saline buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2). Purified virus eluting in the void volume was collected and, after the addition of sterile bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80° until used. The titer of infectious viral particles in purified stocks was determined by plaque assay in monolayers of 293 cells (21Graham F.I. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar) and was routinely >1010 plaque-forming units (pfu) 1The abbreviations used are: pfuplaque-forming unitsLDLlow density lipoprotein(s)HMG-CoA3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme AHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. /ml. plaque-forming units low density lipoprotein(s) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A high pressure liquid chromatography glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity was measured using an HPLC-spectrophotometric assay that quantifies the mass of 7α-hydroxycholesterol formed from endogenous microsomal cholesterol after enzymatic conversion to 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one using cholesterol oxidase (22Chiang J.Y.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One-half g aliquots of liver, along with tracer amounts of sodium tauro[14C]cholate as an internal standard, were refluxed at 80°C in absolute ethanol containing 0.1% NH4OH for 2 h. After evaporation of the ethanol, the residue was resuspended in 9 ml of 0.1 N NaOH and applied to a prewetted C18 Bond Elut® column (Varian, Harbor City, CA). The Bond Elut® column was washed with 5 ml of 0.1 N NaOH, 10 ml of H2O, 10 ml of Hexane, and 10 ml of H2O. Bile salts were eluted from the column with 20 ml of methanol/H20, 75:25. After evaporation, the dried residue was resuspended in 500 µl of buffered saline (pH 7) containing 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Fifty-µl aliquots were taken for the determination of total bile salts using a 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/diaphorase enzymatic kit (Sigma). The same kit was used to quantify total bile salts in plasma and in diluted aliquots of bile. The bile salt composition of bile was determined by HPLC. Individual bile salts were separated on a 4.6 × 250-mm Hypersil ODS (C18) column (Altech, Deerfield, IL) and detected using a Waters 410 differential refractometer. Rates of hepatic cholesterol synthesis were measured in vivo using [3H]water. As described previously (23Spady D.K. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 303-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the animals were administered ~100 mCi of [3H]water intravenously and then returned to individual cages under a fume hood. One h after the injection of [3H]water, the animals were anesthetized and exsanguinated through the abdominal aorta. Aliquots of plasma were taken for the determination of body water specific activity, and samples of liver were taken for the isolation of digitonin-precipitable sterols. Rates of sterol synthesis are expressed as nanomoles of [3H]water incorporated into digitonin-precipitable sterols per hour per gram of liver (nmol/h/g). Plasma was obtained from normocholesterolemic hamster and human donors. The LDL was isolated from plasma by preparative ultracentrifugation in the density range of 1.020-1.055 g/ml and labeled with 125I- or 131I-tyramine cellobiose as described previously (24Glass C.K. Pittman R.C. Keller G.A. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7161-7167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human LDL was also reductively methylated to completely eliminate its recognition by the LDL receptor (25Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Melchior G.W. Innerarity T.L. Holcombe K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rates of hepatic LDL uptake were measured using primed infusions of 125I-tyramine cellobiose-labeled LDL (26Horton J.D. Cuthbert J.A. Spady D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The infusions of 125I-tyramine cellobiose-labeled LDL were continued for 4 h, at which time each animal was administered a bolus of 131I-tyramine cellobiose-labeled LDL as a volume marker and killed 10 min later by exsanguination through the abdominal aorta. Tissue samples along with aliquots of plasma were assayed for radioactivity in a γ-counter (Packard Instrument Co., Inc., Downers Grove, IL). The amount of labeled LDL in the various tissues at 10 min (131I disintegrations per minute per gram of tissue divided by the specific activity of 131I in plasma) and at 4 h (125I disintegrations per minute per gram of tissue divided by the specific activity of 125I in plasma) was then calculated. The increase in the tissue content of LDL cholesterol or LDL protein with time represents the rate of LDL uptake in micrograms of LDL cholesterol or LDL protein taken up per hour per gram of tissue. Hepatic 7α-hydroxylase, HMG-CoA reductase, LDL receptor, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, used as an invariant control) mRNA levels were determined by nuclease protection as described previously (18Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M. Meidell R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Probes were synthesized using 0.5 µM [32P]dCTP and 1 µM (7α-hydroxylase, HMG-CoA reductase, and LDL receptor) or 300 µM (GAPDH) unlabeled dCTP. Samples of hamster liver were homogenized in guanidinium thiocyanate, and the RNA was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63139) Google Scholar). Total RNA (40 µg) was hybridized with the 32P-labeled cDNA probes simultaneously at 48°C overnight. Unhybridized probe, present in excess relative to the amount of specific mRNA, was then digested with 40 units of mung bean nuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.). The mRNA-protected 32P-labeled probes were separated on 7 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gels together with 32P-labeled MspI-digested pBR322 size standards. The radioactivity in each band, as well as background radioactivity, was quantified using an isotopic imaging system (Ambis, Inc., San Diego, CA). The level of GAPDH mRNA did not vary among the various experimental groups and was used to correct for any procedural losses. Liver cholesterol was quantified by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. The cholesterol distribution in plasma was determined by gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 6 column (Sigma). Two-ml aliquots were collected and assayed for cholesterol using an enzymatic kit (Boehringer Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The data are presented as means ± S.D. To test for differences among experimental groups, one-way analysis of variance was performed. Significant results were further analyzed using the Tukey multiple comparison procedure. Under in vivo conditions, >95% of the bile salts secreted into bile are primary and secondary bile salts fluxing through the liver in the enterohepatic circulation (28Carey M.C. Cahalone M.J. Arias I.M. Jakoby W.B. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Enterohepatic Circulation. Raven Press Ltd., New York1988: 573Google Scholar). Consequently, the potential role of specific bile salts in the regulation of 7α-hydroxylase expression is necessarily investigated following removal of the enterohepatic pool of bile salts by biliary diversion. Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, we recently noted that primary overexpression of an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene in hamsters with an intact enterohepatic circulation resulted in reciprocal down-regulation of the endogenous gene (18Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M. Meidell R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, it was not possible to determine from these studies whether suppression of 7α-hydroxylase was due to a direct effect of the newly synthesized bile salts (or their precursors) on 7α-hydroxylase at the level of the hepatocyte, or due to an increased transhepatic flux of bile salts (primary or secondary) in the expanded enterohepatic pool. Our initial studies were therefore undertaken to characterize the effect of biliary diversion on bile salt synthesis and 7α-hydroxylase expression in the hamster and to determine if primary overexpression of an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene in bile-diverted animals leads to inhibition of endogenous gene expression. Biliary catheters were placed, and the enterohepatic pool of bile salts was allowed to drain out over the next 12-14 h. Following drainage of the enterohepatic pool of bile salts, animals were administered 1010 pfu AdCMV7α or control virus intravenously, after which biliary diversion was continued for an additional 24 h. As illustrated in Fig. 1, rates of bile salt secretion during the first hour after insertion of the biliary catheter equaled 2-2.5 µmol/h/100 g of body weight. Rates of bile salt secretion fell rapidly with depletion of the bile salt pool and reached a nadir of ~0.2 µmol/h/100 g of body weight 12-14 h after initiation of biliary diversion. Over the ensuing 24 h, the rate of bile salt secretion increased ~3-fold in animals administered control virus (or vehicle alone) and 4-5-fold in animals administered AdCMV7α. In animals administered control virus, cholate and chenodeoxycholate conjugates accounted for 85 and 11%, respectively, of total secreted bile salts. In animals administered AdCMV7α, these values equaled 72 and 23%. Hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity equaled 61 pmol/h/mg of protein shortly after drainage of the enterohepatic pool and, over the subsequent 24 h, increased ~10-fold in animals administered AdCMV7α and 4-5-fold in animals administered control virus or vehicle alone (Fig. 1, bottom panel). Only small amounts of 7α-hydroxycholesterol (the product of the 7α-hydroxylase reaction) were present in hepatic microsomes prior to incubation, even in animals overexpressing 7α-hydroxylase. In animals with the highest level of 7α-hydroxylase activity (bile-diverted animals administered AdCMV7α), hepatic microsomes contained 5-10 pmol of 7α-hydroxycholesterol/mg of protein, an amount equaling 1-2% of the 7α-hydroxycholesterol formed per hour per milligram of microsomal protein. Fig. 2 illustrates the changes in expression of mRNAs encoding the endogenous and transduced 7α-hydroxylase genes in bile-diverted hamsters. Total liver RNA was prepared from bile-diverted hamsters 24 h after administration of AdCMV7α or control virus and assayed for 7α-hydroxylase mRNA by nuclease protection using 32P-labeled cDNA probes specific for hamster or rat 7α-hydroxylase. In this assay, the RNA-protected rat 7α-hydroxylase probe is 388 nucleotides, whereas the hamster 7α-hydroxylase probe is 240 nucleotides. RNA isolated from hamsters infected with control virus protected the hamster-specific 7α-hydroxylase probe but did not protect the rat probe. In these animals, biliary diversion significantly increased the abundance of mRNA encoding hamster 7α-hydroxylase (lane 2 compared with lane 1). Hamsters infected with recombinant virus encoding rat 7α-hydroxylase expressed transgene (rat)-specific mRNA, whereas expression of mRNA from the endogenous (hamster) gene was suppressed as summarized in Fig. 3. Based on the length and specific activity of the hamster and rat probes, it could be estimated that animals administered 1010 pfu of AdCMV7α accumulated ~2-fold higher overall levels of 7α-hydroxylase mRNA in the liver than did uninfected animals or animals infected with the same dose of control virus. Infection of animals with smaller quantities of AdCMV7α produced less expression of transgene-specific mRNA and, in a reciprocal manner, less suppression of the endogenous hamster gene. In contrast to AdCMV7α, neither control virus (AdCMVLuc or AdCMVβgal at 1010 pfu) altered hepatic 7α-hydroxylase mRNA or activity in the hamster. Thus, overexpression of an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene resulted in suppression of endogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene expression even in the absence of an enterohepatic circulation of bile salts, suggesting that primary bile salts suppress their own synthesis in the liver by feedback inhibition of 7α-hydroxylase expression.Fig. 3Hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression in hamsters administered AdCMV7α. Hepatic RNA was prepared from hamsters 24 h after the intravenous injection of 1 × 109 to 10 × 109 pfu of AdCMV7α. The values are expressed as percentage of endogenous 7α-hydroxylase mRNA present in control bile-diverted hamsters. Control viruses (AdCMVLuc or AdCMVβgal) had no effect on endogenous 7α-hydroxylase mRNA in bile-diverted hamsters. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. for data obtained in three or four animals. Endogenous (hamster) 7α-hydroxylase mRNA was significantly reduced in animals administered 5 × 109 and 10 × 109 pfu of AdCMV7α (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If bile salts synthesized in the liver exert feedback inhibition on 7α-hydroxylase expression, then ligation of the common bile duct, which is known to increase bile salt levels in the liver, should also result in down-regulation of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression. As illustrated in Fig. 4 (top panel) biliary catheters were placed, and the enterohepatic pool of bile salts was allowed to drain out over a 12-14-h period of time. Following depletion of the enterohepatic pool of bile salts, the biliary catheters were tied, and total biliary obstruction was continued for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4 (bottom panel), hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity in control bile-diverted animals increased ~4-fold but remained essentially unchanged in bile duct-ligated animals. These data suggest that bile salts synthesized in the liver suppress their own synthesis by exerting feedback inhibition on hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression. Studies were next undertaken to determine if intravenously administered bile salts exert negative feedback control on hepatic 7α-hydroxylase expression in bile-diverted hamsters. As illustrated in Fig. 5 (top panel), biliary catheters were placed, and after 12-14 h (to allow the enterohepatic pool to drain out) animals were infused intravenously with taurocholate at a rate of ~10 µmol/h/100 g of body weight for 24 h. Trace amounts of tauro[14C]cholate were added to the infusions to assess recovery of the infused bile salt in bile. Under the conditions employed in these studies, recovery of infused tauro[14C]cholate in bile was essentially complete (87-96%). In addition, the mass of taurocholate secreted into bile equaled the rate of bile salt infusion (93-102%). As shown in Fig. 5 (bottom panel), intravenously administered taurocholate at rates of ~10 µmol/h/100 g of body weight prevented the 4-fold derepression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity observed in control bile-diverted animals. Although not shown, infusion of taurocholate at rates of ~10 µmol/h/100 g of body weight also prevented the derepression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase mRNA observed in control bile-diverted animals. The dose-response relationship between the rate of taurocholate infusion and the activity of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase was next investigated using a protocol identical to that shown in Fig. 5, and these data are summarized in Fig. 6. Intravenously administered taurocholate at infusion rates of up to 6 µmol/h/100 g of body weight had little effect on hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity. At an infusion rate of ~8 µmol/h/100 g of body weight, intravenously administered taurocholate partially prevented the derepression of 7α-hydroxylase activity associated with biliary diversion, and at rates of ≥10 µmol/h/100 g of body weight, derepression of 7α-hydroxylase activity was largely prevented. Fig. 7 shows the effect of AdCMV7α administration, taurocholate infusion, or bile duct ligation on the concentration of bile salts in liver and plasma. Hamsters were fitted with biliary and femoral vein catheters. After 12-14 h (to allow for drainage of the enterohepatic pool of bile salts), groups of animals were administered 1010 pfu of AdCMV7α, infused intravenously with taurocholate at a rate of 10 µmol/h/100 g of body weight, or subjected to bile duct ligation. Animals were sacrificed 24 h later, and samples of liver and plasma were taken for the determination of total bile salt content. The hepatic bile salt concentration equaled 55 ± 15 nmol/g in control bile-diverted hamsters and was significantly elevated in animals administered AdCMV7α (~3-fold), infused with taurocholate (~4-fold), or subjected to bile duct ligation (~6-fold). The hepatic bile salt concentration in control animals with an intact enterohepatic circulation equaled 167 ± 35 nmol/g (data not shown). The plasma bile salt concentration in control bile-diverted hamsters equaled 2 ± 1 nmol/ml. Administration of AdCMV7α had no effect on plasma bile salt concentrations. Plasma bile salt concentrations were significantly elevated in animals infused with taurocholate (~4-fold) or subjected to bile duct ligation (~9-fold). The plasma bile salt concentration in control hamsters with an intact enterohepatic circulation equaled 4 ± 1 nmol/ml (data not shown). The"

We have determined the specific prenyl group present on the β1γ1, β1γ2, and β1γ3 dimers purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells by specific binding to G protein α subunits immobilized on agarose. These recombinant dimers undergo the same post-translational modifications determined for γ1 and γ2 isolated from mammalian tissues. Furthermore, infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus encoding an alteration of the γ1 CaaX sequence (γ1-S74L) resulted in geranylgeranylation of the resulting γ1 subunit, and alteration of the γ2 CaaX sequence to CAIS (γ2-L71S) resulted in farnesylation. Both of these altered γ subunits were able to associate stably with β1, and the resulting βγ dimer bound tightly to α-agarose and eluted specifically with aluminum fluoride. These results indicate that Sf9 insect cells properly process the CaaX motif in G protein γ subunits and are a useful model system to study the role of prenylation in the protein-protein interactions in which the βγ subunits participate.

Furthermore, infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus encoding an alteration of the γ1 CaaX sequence (γ1-S74L) resulted in geranylgeranylation of the resulting γ1 subunit, and alteration of the γ2 CaaX sequence to CAIS (γ2-L71S) resulted in farnesylation. Both of these altered γ subunits were able to associate stably with β1, and the resulting βγ dimer bound tightly to α-agarose and eluted specifically with aluminum fluoride. These results indicate that Sf9 insect cells properly process the CaaX motif in G protein γ subunits and are a useful model system to study the role of prenylation in the protein-protein interactions in which the βγ subunits participate.

Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Prenylation of the γ subunit is necessary for the formation of an active transducin αβγ complex (13Fukada Y. Takao T.

In addition, the ability of the βγ subunit to support ADP-ribosylation of Gαi subunits by pertussis toxin and to regulate adenyl cyclase activity both require the presence of the prenyl modification (17Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prenylated synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the γ subunit can inhibit ADP-ribosylation of α subunits, but the same peptides lacking the prenyl thioether have no effect (18Matsuda T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Murata M. Asano T. Yoshizawa T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30358-30363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the carboxyl terminus of the γ subunit is an important domain for the interaction between the α subunit and the βγ dimer.We have taken advantage of the ability of the baculovirus Sf9 cell system to produce µg quantities of highly purified βγ subunits to investigate further this central role of prenylation in βγ function. We have altered the γ1 and γ2 subunit cDNAs to code for alternate prenyl modifications by changing the codon for the last amino acid in the CaaX motif. We report here the expression of these constructs in the baculovirus Sf9 cell system and purification to homogeneity of the wild type and altered γ subunits complexed with the β1 subunit. We have verified using mass spectrometric techniques that wild type and altered CaaX sequences result in the expected post-translational modifications in the baculovirus Sf9 cell expression system. The accompanying report describes the effect of these prenyl modifications on the ability of the heterotrimeric G protein to interact with the A1 adenosine receptor (19Yasuda H. Lindorfer M.A. Woodfork K.A. Fletcher J.E. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18588-18595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).RESULTSThis study had two objectives: first, to determine the stoichiometry and fidelity of prenylation of the baculovirus Sf9 cell system for wild type G protein γ subunits; and second, to determine the effect of alterations in the CaaX sequence of the γ subunit on subsequent prenylation. The results presented here help define γ subunit prenylation in the Sf9 cell system and provide the basis upon which to investigate the role prenylation plays in the interaction of the βγ dimer with receptors and with effectors.Fig. 1 shows purified recombinant βγ complexes separated on a Tricine gel as described under “Experimental Procedures” and stained with silver. These βγ dimers were purified by ion exchange and α-agarose affinity chromatography, and all dimers shown are essentially free of contaminating proteins. Approximately 90% of the βγ dimers extracted from the Sf9 cells with Genapol were recovered from the α-agarose affinity column. In this gel system, the differences in mobility of γ1, γ2, and γ3 are apparent. The γ1 mutant, γ1-S74L, which differs from γ1 only by the exchange of farnesyl for geranylgeranyl, does not exhibit a detectable difference in mobility compared with γ1. Similarly, the γ2 mutant, γ2-L71S, which is predicted to be farnesylated, has electrophoretic mobility similar to that of γ2.To determine the nature of the post-translational modifications, purified βγ subunits were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Under the conditions employed, only signals for the γ subunit were observed. Mass spectra of γ1 are displayed in Fig. 2, A and B. Fig. 2A shows the profile of ions due to multiply protonated γ subunits. Fig. 2B displays the deconvoluted mass spectrum containing only (M+H)+ ions for each of the molecules in the mixture. The γ1 subunit, when expressed in Sf9 cells, shows an (M+H)+ ion at m/z 8,334 Da, in agreement with the molecular mass predicted from the DNA sequence, including the post-translational modifications of: removal of the amino-terminal methionine, attachment of a farnesyl group to cysteine 71, removal of the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide, and methylation of the new carboxyl terminus. Fig. 2, C and D, displays the multiply charged ion spectrum and deconvoluted spectrum, respectively, for the γ1-S74L subunit. This change in the CaaX sequence from CAIS to CAIL is predicted to direct prenylation with a geranylgeranyl group. The observed m/z value for the (M+H)+ ion at 8,403 Da is consistent with exchange of the farnesyl group for geranylgeranyl and clearly demonstrates the predicted change in post-translational processing. Thus, in the context of the β1γ1 dimer, this alteration of the last amino acid in the CaaX sequence is sufficient to alter prenylation.Fig. 2Electrospray ionization mass spectra of recombinant β1γ1 and β1γ1-S74L combinations. For each analysis, purified, recombinant βγ subunits were injected onto a reverse phase microcapillary column and the γ subunit eluted into the electrospray source of a Finnigan MAT TSQ 700 mass spectrometer using a 0-80% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1 M acetic acid, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel A, profile of ions due to multiply protonated γ1 subunits.

One corresponds to the fully processed molecule, and the second set (indicated by asterisks) corresponds to the fully processed molecule minus the prenyl group. Since there is strong evidence that the prenylation reaction precedes endoproteolysis and carboxylmethylation (5Casey P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1731-1740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Higgins J.B. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9067-9073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and previous fast atom bombardment mass analysis of prenylated synthetic peptides (yeast a-factor and analogs) has shown the allylic thioether bond to be labile (31Tuinman A.A. Thomas D.A. Cook K.D. Xue C. Naider F. Becker J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that the loss of the prenyl group was occurring in the mass spectrometer as a consequence of the analysis. We first extracted ion chromatograms corresponding to the +10 ion of the γ1 subunit, with and without the farnesyl group, from the mass spectrum shown in Fig. 2A. As shown in Fig. 3A, the signals corresponding to the +10 ion of the γ1 subunit, with and without farnesyl, both appear in the mass spectrum recorded at the elution time of the farnesylated parent molecule. If both molecular species were present in the original sample, they would be expected to show considerably different chromatographic retention times on the microcapillary HPLC and thus show up in different scans of the mass spectrometer. We next introduced intact β1γ1 into the mass spectrometer as before, but now the +9 ion corresponding to the fully processed γ1 subunit was selected for analysis in the second quadrupole under CAD conditions and the resulting mass spectrum analyzed for fragmentation corresponding to the loss of the farnesyl group. The predominant fragment in the resulting CAD spectrum corresponded to the +8 ion for the γ1 without the farnesyl group (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the farnesylated molecule fragments with loss of the farnesyl molecule in the collision cell and also during the ionization process itself.Fig. 3Panel A, ion chromatograms of two m/z values, corresponding to the +10 fully processed γ1 subunit (833-835 Da) and the γ1 subunit without a farnesyl (812-814 Da), plotted as a function of scan number. Time for each mass scan was 1.5 s. Microcapillary HPLC was employed to introduce the sample to the mass spectrometer as described in the legend of Fig. 2 and under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel B, ion chromatograms of two m/z values corresponding to the (M+2H)+2-C15 ion for the yeast a-factor minus the farnesyl group, and the (M+2H)+2 ion for the farnesylated and methylated yeast a-factor.

Experimental conditions for recording the mass spectra were as described in the legend of Fig. 2 and under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A similar analysis was also performed on a synthetic sample of yeast a-factor. This synthetic sample had been purified by HPLC, and the presence of the farnesyl and carboxyl methyl groups had been verified (31Tuinman A.A. Thomas D.A. Cook K.D. Xue C. Naider F. Becker J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 32Xue C. Ewenson A. Becker J.M. Naider F. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1990; 36: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We observed two families of multiply protonated molecules in the microcapillary HPLC, electrospray ionization mass spectrum of the synthetic yeast a-factor (data not shown). These corresponded to a-factor with and without the farnesyl group. The chromatography conditions used to introduce the a-factor peptide into the electrospray source are capable of resolving peptides with the large difference in hydrophobicity predicted for a farnesylated and nonfarnesylated peptide. Fig. 3B shows that these two species coelute from the microcapillary used to introduce the sample. Therefore, based on the observation of a similar fragmentation with the a-factor and the γ1 subunit, and coelution of the intact and fragmented ions, we conclude that the loss of the farnesyl group occurs during the ionization process and is not due to an inherent heterogeneity of processing on the part of the Sf9 cell.To determine the amino acid sequence of the recombinant γ1 subunit, it was prepared for tryptic digestion by direct injection of the βγ complex in elution buffer onto a reverse phase column. Under the conditions of the separation, the γ subunit is eluted in a well defined peak, but we and others (33Wilcox M.D. Schey K.L. Busman M. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Morishita R. Fukada Y. Kokame K. Yoshizawa T. Masuda K. Niwa M. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have been unable to detect the elution of the β subunit. Presumably the acidic conditions of the separation result in not only the dissociation of the βγ dimer but also in the irreversible adsorption of the denatured β subunit to the hydrophobic stationary phase. The isolated γ1 subunit was digested with trypsin, and the resulting mixture of peptides was analyzed by CAD in the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Amino acid sequence information deduced from the tryptic fragments is summarized in Table I. To confirm these data, CAD spectra were also recorded on methyl ester and acetylated derivatives of these peptides. All γ1 tryptic peptides were isolated except the peptides corresponding to residues 30-40 and the carboxyl-terminal peptide. There was no evidence of any additional side chain modifications. The amino-terminal methionine has been removed from the γ1 subunit, and the new amino-terminal proline is not acetylated. A similar but less extensive analysis was performed on the γ2 subunit. The isolated γ2 subunit was cleaved with cyanogen bromide and the amino-terminal peptide sequenced by CAD (Table I). Amino acid sequence information deduced from the cyanogen bromide fragment is summarized at the bottom of Table I. The amino-terminal methionine is removed, and the newly revealed amino-terminal alanine is acetylated.Table IMass assignments and sequences of peptides generated by tryptic digestion of γ1 and cyanogen bromide cleavage of γ2Tryptic peptides from γ1Observed massm/zPositionSequenceDa74737424–29EVTLER84542247–54SGEDPLVK1,51650655–67GIPEDKNPFKELK1,345448 (674)57–67PEDKNPFKELK(fragment)99233216–23MEVDQLKK1,756585 (439)1–15PVINIEDLTEKDKLK81040641–46DYVEER86443216–22MEVDQLK1,14438255–64GIPEDKNPFKCyanogen bromide fragment from γ2Observed massm/zPositionSequenceDa2,1717241–20AcASNNTASIAQARKLVEGKLM Open table in a new tab Electrospray ionization mass spectra were also recorded for the γ2, γ3, and γ2-L71S subunits.

Several groups have demonstrated by labeling with tritiated mevalonolactone that γ subunits, when coexpressed with β subunits, are prenylated (25Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Kalman-Maltese V.K.

We have demonstrated here, by direct mass spectral analysis, the exact isoprenoid modification and stoichiometry for three wild type and two γ subunits with altered CaaX sequences. We have also obtained direct structural information for the γ1 and γ2 subunits expressed in Sf9 cells.The wild type γ1 subunit, when coexpressed with the β1 subunit and subjected to α-agarose affinity purification, is modified as expected with the farnesyl group. Greater than 95% of the purified material was farnesylated. Likewise, more than 90% of the wild type γ2 subunit was geranylgeranylated. The γ3 subunit was completely geranylgeranylated (Table III). Previous mass spectral analysis of Ras proteins expressed in the Sf9 cell system (41Page M.J. Aitken A. Cooper D.J. Magee A.I. Lowe P.N.

Trans. 1992; 20: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the CaaX motif in the context of the Ras sequence was appropriately prenylated. Our results with the G protein βγ dimers show that the Sf9 prenyltransferases also recognize the βγ dimer as a substrate, with the same prenyl specificity as displayed for the Ras sequences.The γ1 subunit isolated from rod outer segments has been subjected to proteolytic digestion and the resulting peptides completely sequenced by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (13Fukada Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal methionine has been removed, revealing a free amino-terminal proline, the carboxyl-terminal cysteine has a farnesyl thioether, and the carboxyl terminus is methylated (13Fukada Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The mass spectroscopic results presented here (see Fig. 4) for γ1 purified from Sf9 cells coinfected with recombinant β1 and γ1 baculovirus are consistent with the post-translational modifications observed for γ1 isolated from rod outer segments.βγ isolated from bovine brain is a complex mixture. To date, β1, β2, γ2, γ3, γ5, and γ7 have been identified (33Wilcox M.D. Schey K.L. Busman M. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The Escherichia coli phosphate/sugar phosphate antiport carrier, UhpT, is a polytopic membrane protein resembling others within the Major Facilitator Superfamily (1Marger S.D. Saier Jr., M.H.

That work suggested that the seventh transmembrane segment, TM7, extending roughly between residues 260 and 282, is an amphipathic α-helix whose hydrophilic face lines the transport pathway. In studies reported here, we sought to determine which residues within and beyond TM7 are available to probes whose sizes limit their sites of action to the external phase. For this purpose, we exploited the protease, trypsin, as well as a biotin-linked maleimide, MPB, whose presence was detected by decoration with streptavidin. We find that residues 283-294 are fully exposed to the bacterial periplasm and provide for the docking and binding of trypsin or streptavidin. By contrast, residue 276 and the more proximal positions of TM7 are more deeply buried or otherwise shielded from the external phase, since they are either inaccessible to MPB, or, if accessible, require cell lysis and protein denaturation before a decoration by streptavidin.

Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was constructed by inserting a 1.8-kilobase NsiI-BamHI fragment encoding UhpT into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) in which the multiple cloning region was modified to remove restriction sites duplicated within uhpT. In this construct, UhpT expression is controlled by the lac promoter. Earlier work (5Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) had described a UhpT variant in which the six natural cysteine residues are replaced by serine residues; this cysteine-less UhpT served as parent to most of the cysteine-substitution mutants used here (6Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). New mutants (K291C and K294C in the cysteine-less background; R9C, R449C, and a K291N-K294C double mutant, all in wild type background) were obtained by the method of Kunkel (7Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar), as described (5Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and were confirmed by sequencing (8Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52237) Google Scholar). Plasmids were housed in strain RK5000 (9Friedrich M.J. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3556-3563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where chromosomal lac and uhp deletions allow constitutive expression of plasmid-encoded UhpT. Overnight broth cultures were diluted 100-fold in LB medium with ampicillin and harvested after 4-5 h growth at 33°C. Freshly grown cells were washed and resuspended in one-fifth volume of 0.5 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) and placed on ice for 30 min to provide access to external trypsin in strain RK5000; neither EDTA nor lysozyme (10Leive L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2373-2380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was required. Freshly prepared trypsin was then added, and incubation was extended an additional 30 min at 30°C; we normally used trypsin in 25-fold excess (500 µg/ml) of the amount required to give about 50% cleavage of UhpT. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of twice-concentrated acidified SDS-PAGE sample buffer (11Arystarkhova E. Gibbons D.L. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8785-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 20 mM MOPS/K, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4 (pH 7) (Buffer A) at 1 or 3 µg of protein/ml. For labeling with MPB (Molecular Probes, Inc.), an aliquot (50 µg of protein) was removed, and cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge and then resuspended in 60 µl of Buffer A containing 3.3 mM EDTA and MPB at the concentrations specified (solvents were present as 1.8% dimethyl sulfoxide and 1.2% dimethylformamide). After 10 min at 23°C, 1 ml of Buffer A buffer was added, with mixing, and cells were pelleted and resuspended once again in 1 ml of Buffer A. When MPB labeling was to be followed by streptavidin (SA) (Pierce), 0.4-ml aliquots were transferred to a fresh tube, and cells were pelleted and resuspended in 20 µl of 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8) to which was added 20 µg of SA in 2.5 µl of 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), or Tris/HCl alone, before incubation at 23°C for 30 min (a 10-min incubation was sometimes used). The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer with SDS at a final concentration of 0.1% to avoid disruption of the biotin-streptavidin complex (12Qiu X-Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Slatin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7483-7488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biotin was added from a 0.1 M stock prepared in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.2). SDS-PAGE using 12% or 12.5% acrylamide (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar) was done without preheating samples, and for these conditions UhpT migrated at 40-45 kDa. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described (14Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5844) Google Scholar, 15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar), and UhpT was visualized using antiserum (1:2,500) prepared in rabbits by co-immunization with bovine serum albumin-conjugated peptides corresponding to UhpT residues 141-155 (GSCSYSTITKWTPT) and to the C-terminal 14 residues (RKIRREKKIQQLTV). Only reactivity to the C-terminal epitope was evident in Western blots (not shown). To facilitate visualization of the UhpT-SA complex, SA was removed after electrophoresis by immersing the gel, with shaking, in transfer solution (50 mM Tris, 40 mM glycine, 0.038% SDS, in 20% methanol) supplemented with 5 mM biotin. Without this intervention, steric factors prevented reaction of antibody with the UhpT-SA complex, and formation of the complex was reported only by disappearance of immunoreactivity at 40 kDa. Western blots were developed using chemiluminescence (Amersham). Cells at 0.6 µg of protein/ml in Buffer A were incubated at 23°C for 10 min with desired additives. A 100-µl aliquot was placed on Millipore GSTF filters (0.45 µm pore size), washed twice to remove residual materials, and overlaid for 1-3 min with Buffer A containing 50 µM 1-D-[14C]glucose 6-phosphate (DuPont NEN). The reaction was stopped by two washes with Buffer A. A study of the responses of UhpT single-cysteine variants to the impermeant SH-reactive agent, pCMBS, showed that part of TM7 lines the substrate translocation pathway (5Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It therefore seemed important to provide direct evidence regarding surface topography in this region. To place limits on the external boundaries of the pathway, we examined the susceptibility of residues in this vicinity to cleavage by protease (trypsin) and to decoration by streptavidin after the modification of single-cysteine variants with a biotin-linked maleimide, MPB. The presumed topology of UhpT in the neighborhood of TM7 predicts that the lysines at positions 291 and 294 may be exposed to the periplasm (Fig. 1). This suggestion was tested experimentally by exposing osmotically-sensitized cells to external trypsin and following the fate of UhpT by Western blots using an antibody selective for the UhpT C terminus. The action of trypsin was studied in detail using cysteine-less UhpT, since this protein is parent to the derivatives defining the translocation pathway (5Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cysteine-less UhpT was susceptible to tryptic cleavage, as was wild type UhpT (not shown), and exposure to excess enzyme led to loss of immunoreactivity at the usual position (about 40 kDa) along with appearance of a new band migrating as expected for the predicted C-terminal fragment (about 18 kDa) (Fig. 2). (The consistently low yield of the new band suggested added processing.) Further study implicated Lys-294 as trypsin's target, since trypsin cleaved a K291C derivative, but not the K294C variant nor the K291C/K294N double mutant (Fig. 2). Still other work (not given) indicated that trypsin sensitivity or resistance was associated with loss or retention of UhpT function, respectively. The accessibility of position 294, and the inaccessibility of position 291, was evident as well in the response to pCMBS. Thus, preincubation of cells with 200 µM pCMBS did not effect transport by cysteine-less UhpT or its K291C derivative, but did inhibit the K294C variant (Table I); substrate did not protect against this action of pCMBS. We also screened nearby lysine substitution derivatives using the K291C/K294N double mutant as parent. The L292K, S293K, and V296K derivatives were expressed at near (≥50%) parental levels, with corresponding transport activities (the A295K variant was too poorly expressed for analysis). The mutants with lysine at position 292 or 293 were trypsin- sensitive (as in Fig. 2), whereas UhpT with lysine at position 296 was largely resistant to the protease.Fig. 2Extracellular trypsin cleaves UhpT at 294. Cells of cysteine-less UhpT (Parent) and its K291C and K294C derivatives were osmotically sensitized and exposed to buffer (−) or to buffer with trypsin (+) as described under “Experimental Procedures”; the K291C/K294N double mutant (in wild type background) was examined in the same way. Each lane contained 20 µg of cell protein except the right-most lane, which was loaded with trypsin (29 kDa) equivalent in amount to that used in treatment of cells. Arrows indicate the positions of uncleaved UhpT (40 kDa) and the C-terminal UhpT fragment (about 18 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IEffect of pCMBS on single-cysteine variants of UhpTVariantRelative expressionRelative activityActivity remaining after pCMBSParent1.001.000.92 ± 0.05K291C0.580.460.93 ± 0.03K294C0.420.220.33 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab Tryptic cleavage of UhpT at position 294 should give an N-terminal 32-kDa and a C-terminal 18-kDa fragment, but only the latter could be detected by our peptide-directed antiserum (Fig. 2). We therefore also studied a UhpT derivative whose N terminus had been fused with the 14-kDa Klebsiella biotin acceptor domain (16Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After exposure of this fusion protein to trypsin, we visualized both the expected N-terminal fragment (with a streptavidin-linked detection system) and the usual C-terminal fragment (with the anti-UhpT antibody) (data not shown). This result, together with the findings summarized above (Fig. 2, Table I), lead us to conclude that external trypsin cleaves UhpT at a single site, position 294. Accordingly, this region must be fully exposed to the external environment. To evaluate the accessibility of other residues in the loop connecting TM7 and TM8 (Fig. 1), we probed single-cysteine variants with MPB, a hydrophilic SH-reactive compound of moderate size (600 daltons). Because the association between MPB and a 47-kDa streptavidin derivative (SA) is stable to SDS-PAGE (12Qiu X-Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Slatin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7483-7488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), residues modified by MPB, if sufficiently exposed, could be detected directly by treating intact cells with SA and using a UhpT-directed antibody to monitor appearance of the UhpT-SA complex. Initially, we examined MPB reactivity at position 283, since the pCMBS sensitivity of the T283C mutant suggested an accessibility to external probes (6Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Accordingly, EDTA-treated cells of the single-cysteine mutant, T283C, were exposed to 100 µM MPB for 10 min at 23°C. After removing residual MPB, cells were next exposed in varying sequence to each of the following: (i) to SA, to decorate any available MPB; (ii) to excess biotin, to prevent any subsequent reaction between MPB and SA; and (iii) to 0.1% SDS, to lyse cells and denature UhpT. Later examination of Western blots (Fig. 3) showed that when performed in the order noted (first SA, then biotin, finally SDS) there was loss of UhpT reactivity at 40 kDa and appearance of a newly reactive species at 80-90 kDa, the position expected of a 1:1 UhpT-SA complex (Fig. 3, lane 1). At lower yield, a second newly reactive band appeared at about 180 kDa, and this was taken to be a dimer of the UhpT-SA complex. There was no mobility shift when SA was omitted (see later), nor was there a shift when cysteine-less UhpT was examined (not shown). It is of special significance that the reaction between UhpT and SA (via MPB) was not seen when biotin preceded SA (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 4, and 6), as one should expect. Since addition of biotin after SA, but before cell lysis, had no effect on formation of the UhpT-SA complex (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 2), we conclude this complex arises in the intact cell, without UhpT denaturation. It is also evident the UhpT-SA complex can form after protein denaturation (e.g. Fig. 3, lane 5). In related studies, we confirmed the specificity of MPB's action at position 283 by showing that MPB modification was blocked by prior exposure to pCMBS (Fig. 4A), with 50% protection at a level (about 10 µM pCMBS) comparable to that giving 50% inhibition of UhpT function (6Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We also found that formation of the UhpT-SA complex had an MPB concentration dependence resembling that of MPB inhibition of UhpT activity. For example, assays of transport showed a 50% reduced activity after exposure to 3-10 µM MPB (Fig. 5); Western blots confirmed this same concentration range converted roughly half the UhpT population to its higher molecular weight form (Fig. 4 B). Together, such observations (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) lead us to infer that the SA-induced shift in UhpT mobility is a direct reflection of the binding of SA to MPB-modified UhpT.Fig. 5MPB inhibits UhpT function in single-cysteine variants. MPB inhibition of glucose 6-phosphate transport was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” for single-cysteine variants at positions 276 (squares), 283 (diamonds), and 284 (circles). Each point is the average ± S.E. of three to five separate determinations. For these conditions (30 min at 23°C), 50% inhibition was achieved at approximately 50, 6, or 1 µM MPB for the attack at position 276, 283, or 284, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) That SA reports MPB bound to position 283 without UhpT denaturation (Fig. 3) shows that the biotin moiety of MPB extends sufficiently from the modified residue to be enclosed by streptavidin. Since positions closer to the membrane surface might be accessible to the smaller MPB (0.6 kDa), but not the larger SA (47 kDa), we examined other single cysteine variants within and near TM7, focusing on those known to be pCMBS-sensitive (5Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, on the basis of accessibility to pCMBS from both internal and external surfaces, five positions within TM7 (positions 265, 268, 271, 273, and 276) had been assigned to the translocation pathway (Fig. 1). Four, more distal positions (282, 283, 284, and 286), were classified as external to the pathway, since they responded to only external pCMBS (5Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Along with these nine variants, we studied wild type UhpT, whose six cysteines include the two that confer sensitivity to the lipid-soluble probe, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (Cys-143 and Cys-265) (5Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), two cysteines presumed to be within the hydrophobic sector (Cys-108 and Cys-331), and a cysteine pair near the C terminus (Cys-436, Cys-438). As well, we tested cysteine substitution mutants in which the targeted position was clearly intracellular, at either the N or C terminus (R9C, R449C). In all these tests we used MPB at concentrations ranging from 5 to 1000 µM, with exposure times of up to 60 min, conditions favorable to modification of position 283 (above), and to maximize the chance of binding SA to a modified residue, we delayed addition of the reporter protein until after cell lysis (as in Fig. 3, lane 5). Of the 16 positions examined in this way, only three, 276, 283, and 284, were modified by MPB as judged by inhibition of UhpT function; the parallel tests of decoration by SA (after cell lysis) also identified these positions as the only responsive ones. 2In a 17th case, we examined a position (position 270) on the hydrophobic face of TM7. No labeling with 1 mM MPB was evident by either inhibition of UhpT activity or by decoration with SA. In this instance, we also verified the intrinsic reactivity of the target by noting the positive response to SA when MPB was given after protein denaturation. (Residual MPB was removed by a chloroform/methanol extraction (29Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10537-10543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before the addition of SA.) Each case reflects action of a relatively low probe concentration (50% effects at ≤50 µM MPB) (Fig. 5, legend), and the order of sensitivity, 284 > 283 > 276, is consistent with the idea that position 276 is the most deeply buried of the targets. We also note that the failure of high MPB concentrations (1 mM) to modify cysteines at the N or C terminus (e.g. R9C, R449C) supports the generally impermeant nature of this probe (and see Ref. 20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), since construction of functional UhpT derivatives bearing epitope tags at these termini suggests these regions are not buried. 3E. Tamai, M.-C. Fann, and P. C. Maloney, unpublished data. New experiments showed that while positions 276, 283, and 284 were each readily modified by MPB (e.g. Fig. 5), they were not equivalently accessible to the larger SA (Fig. 6). Position 284 behaved as did 283, in that decoration by SA could be observed in the intact cell. Thus, for both these positions, addition of biotin after SA, but before UhpT denaturation, did not block generation of the UhpT-SA complex (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6A, compare lanes 1 and 2). 4Positions 289, 291, and 294 were also decorated by SA without requiring UhpT denaturation. We did not study MPB inhibition of UhpT function for these cases, since exposure of this region to the periplasm had been documented by the finding of trypsin sensitivity (see text). By contrast, tests at position 276 gave no evidence that the UhpT-SA complex formed before protein denaturation. Rather, in this latter case, addition of biotin after SA but before cell lysis prevented formation of the complex (Fig. 6B, lane 2), and UhpT-SA appeared only if biotin was delayed until after lysis or omitted altogether (Fig. 6B, lanes 1, 3, or 4). It follows that position 276, but not 283 or 284, is in some way shielded from the external phase so that after its modification by MPB, SA cannot approach sufficiently close to interact with the biotin moiety. Part of the translocation pathway through UhpT has been defined by studies of pCMBS inhibition using a collection of single-cysteine variants in and around TM7 (5Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Such an approach relies on assays of activity, without reference to unambiguous physical parameters, whereas in the present work we used probes whose accessibility can be visualized directly. This latter strategy has specific benefits. In particular, because both wild type and cysteine-less UhpT were cleaved by extracellular trypsin at Lys-294 (Fig. 2), it is apparent that both forms of the protein have the same general topology and that both fully integrate into the membrane in our overexpression system. A similar conclusion is driven by the observation that after modification by MPB in the intact cell the entire UhpT population is decorated by SA (e.g. Fig. 3, Fig. 4).

The chimeric gene construct −892 5′-GAAGTGACACACTTC3′−878-CAT was sufficient for high level of expression in HeLa and placenta cells in culture. Deletion of palindromic sequences decreased levels of GR expression in these cells. By oligonucleotide-affinity chromatography with the palindromic glucocorticoid receptor enhancing factor-binding element (GREFE), we have isolated from human placenta nuclear extract two novel proteins glucocorticoid receptor enhancing factors 1 and 2 (GREF1 and GREF2), with apparent molecular masses of 80 and 62 kDa, respectively. These proteins, similar to the DNA-binding autoantigen Ku are, like Ku, heterodimers of polypeptide subunits p80 and p62, immunologically related to factors binding to proximal sequence element 1 in the promoter of small nuclear RNA (PSE1) and transferrin receptor enhancing factors. Both Ku80 and Ku70 polypeptides were present in high concentrations in human placenta and HeLa cells. In MCF-7 cells, however, only a high level of p62 was detected. While cotransfection of pcDNA-Ku80 with pHGR(−892 to −878)-CAT potentiated the expression of CAT, introduction of pcDNA-Ku70 did not affect the expression of CAT in transfected MCF-7 cells. UV cross-linking analysis showed that only GREF1 contacted DNA directly. Supershift assays with monoclonal antibodies Ab 111 (Ku80) or Ab N3H10 (Ku70) showed a direct interaction of GREF1 and GREF2 heterodimers with the palindrome. Partial peptide fingerprinting of GREF1 and GREF2 using α-chymotrypsin and immunoblotting with Ab 111 and Ab N3H10 confirmed their identities as Ku80 and Ku70, respectively.

The regulation of transcription in eukaryotes is dictated by the cooperative interaction between various sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (1Struhl K. Trends Biochem.

A number of these trans-acting factors at the start of transcription have been identified (3Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar, 4Banerji J.

The activation of gene transcription is an ability associated with a number of eukaryotic DNA-binding activators and variation in gene expression is achieved by modulating the activity of these DNA-binding transcription factors.

The human placenta is a hormone responsive tissue in which excessive levels of glucocorticoids have deleterious effects on the fetus that lead to impaired fetal growth and teratogenesis, and in the adult, may predispose the individual to hypertension (10Benedictsson R.

Considering that the glucocorticoid effects are mediated by GR, we have constructed a series of 5′ deletion mutants containing the promoter region of the hGR gene fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) chimeric gene and introduced them into human placenta cells in culture. The human GR gene contains the palindromic sequence motif 5′-GAAGTGACACACTTC-3′ (−892 to −878) in the regulatory region. We designate this sequence as GREFE, the glucocorticoid receptor enhancing factor-binding element. The human GR promoter sequence reported (14Leclerc S. Xie B. Roy R. Govindan M.V. J. Biol.

Previously, we identified by S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension the authentic GR transcription start site in the isolated genomic fragment (13Govindan M.V. Pothier F. Leclerc S. Palaniswami R.

To characterize the proteins binding to this palindromic recognition site, we have extracted nuclear proteins from human placenta and analyzed their interaction with the synthetic GREFE. Here, we describe an initial characterization of these proteins by DNA-protein interaction, purification by sequence-specific interaction chromatography, resolution of the UV cross-linked DNA-protein complexes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by Western blotting with anti-Ku antibodies (23Mimori T. Akizuki M. Yamagata H. Inada S. Yoshida S. Homma M. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these polypeptides were identified as Ku80 and Ku70 by cleavage with site-specific endopeptidase, Western blotting, and immuno detection with monoclonal antibodies (24Reeves W. J. Exp.

Finally, we demonstrate the sequence-specific interaction of Ku80 and Ku70 with the regulatory sequence by mobility-supershift assays using monoclonal antibodies against either Ku80 or Ku70. Human Placenta (3A-SUB-E, CRL-1583), HeLa, and MCF-7 cells were grown in MEM medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Human prostate cancer cells LNCaP, were propagated in RPMI medium without phenol red. Buffer A: 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 7 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Buffer B: 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol. Buffer C: Buffer B + 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Buffer D: 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 40% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF. Buffer E: 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF. Buffer F: 45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, and 1.25 EDTA (1/2 TBE). Buffer G: 12 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol. Buffer H: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 40 mM ammonium sulfate, 15% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA. Buffer I: (stock solution is 3 × concentrated) 150 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 60 mM K3PO4, 3 mM DTT, and 60% glycerol. Two placentas weighing about 600 g were homogenized with a Waring blender in 1,200 ml (final volume) of Buffer A. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 15 min at 4°C to collect the crude nuclear fraction. The nuclear extract was either prepared immediately from the crude nuclear fraction or frozen at −20°C for 4-6 weeks. The crude nuclear pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of Buffer B, centrifuged to collect the nuclear fraction and resuspended again, this time in 500 ml of Buffer C, filtered through 3 layers of cheese cloth and centrifuged to collect the nuclei. The nuclei were washed once by resuspension in 500 ml of Buffer E and centrifugation. The nuclear pellet was extracted in a total volume of 400 ml of Buffer E + 350 mM NaCl (final concentration) and incubated for 60 min on ice. The residual nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant (250 ml) was mixed with an equal volume of Buffer D + 140 g of sucrose, 700 µl of 1 M DTT, 7 ml of 1 M MgCl2, and 1 ml of 500 mM EDTA. After dissolution of the sucrose, the final volume was 650 ml. This extract was centrifuged at 26,000 rpm in SW-28 rotor for 6 h at 4°C. The supernatant was decanted into an Erlenmeyer flask and 132 g of ammonium sulfate (132 g/330 ml) were added and mixed gently to dissolve. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 N NaOH (10.5 ml) and stirred overnight at 4°C. The precipitated nuclear proteins were collected by centrifugation at 26,000 rpm in SW-28 rotor at 4°C for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded and the walls of the tubes were wiped clean with Kleenex. The pellet was redissolved in Buffer H (total volume 25 ml) and dialyzed against two changes of Buffer H + 200 mM ammonium sulfate for 6 h. The extract was clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman SW-40 rotor at 36,000 rpm for 2 h and dialyzed against Buffer H overnight at 4°C. The supernatant (40 ml) was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was adjusted to 15 mg/ml and stored in aliquots of 0.25, 0.5, or 1 ml in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear extracts from cells in culture were prepared essentially as described by Andrews and Faller (26Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 9Crossref Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Analysis of DNA-protein interaction was performed by incubating the total nuclear extract (2.5 µg, diluted in Buffer G) in a final volume of 25 µl in the presence of 1 µg/25 µl of poly(dI-dC) with 5,000 cpm (Cherenkov) of 32P-labeled probe GREFE, for 20 min at 20°C. When indicated, a 100-fold molar excess of non-labeled GREFE double-stranded as competitor DNA was included in the incubates (13Govindan M.V. Pothier F. Leclerc S. Palaniswami R. Xie B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1991; 40: 317-323Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Leclerc S. Xie B. Roy R. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8711-8719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complexes were resolved on 4% (39.2:0.8, cross-linked) acrylamide gels in Buffer F. The electrophoresis was conducted in Buffer F and at 250 V/20 × 20-cm gel (100-min running time). The gels were dried under vaccum and autoradiographed using Fuji RXO-G films with intensifying screens. The purified proteins from placenta were incubated either with 1 µl of anti-human Ku70 monoclonal antibodies (N3H10) or anti-human Ku80 monoclonal antibodies (111) for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of labeled DNA as indicated (monoclonal antibodies were generously provided by Dr. W. Reeves, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). To further define the specificity, the antigen-antibody complexes were immunoabsorbed on protein A-Sepharose and the resulting supernatants were used in DNA-protein interaction assays. To analyze the interaction of intact hGR gene fragment containing the authentic nuclear protein interaction site, a 280-base pair hGR gene fragment between SmaI (−1030) and SacI (−750) was purified and labeled at the dephosphorylated 5′ SmaI end (13Govindan M.V. Pothier F. Leclerc S. Palaniswami R. Xie B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1991; 40: 317-323Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Leclerc S. Xie B. Roy R. Govindan M.V. J. Biol.

The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels using 22.25 mM Tris, 22.25 mM boric acid, and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 (0.25 × TBE). The specific interaction of the proteins was assayed by depleting the proteins in the incubates with monoclonal antibodies and immunoabsorbtion as described above. The DNA-protein samples were incubated at 20°C in a 96-well plate and irradiated for 15 min using a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene) at room temperature. The complexes were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed using Kodak X-Omat films with or without intensifying screens. Non-labeled standard protein markers (Bio-Rad) were resolved in a slot and stained with Coomassie Blue to determine the apparent molecular weight of the UV cross-linked proteins. The oligonucleotide 5′-GGGGTGAAGTGACACACTTCACA-3′ and the complementary 5′-TGTGAAGTGTGTCACTTCA-3′ were synthesized by Oligo Express, Bio/Can Scientific at a 0.8-µmol scale and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C-18 column. The extension of four guanosines at the 5′ end was found to be suitable for coupling to the CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. 1.25 mg each of the oligonucleotides were annealed together in Sequenase buffer (500 µl) and an aliquot of 0.5 µg was labeled with [32P]ATP to determine the efficiency of coupling to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. For coupling, 1.5 g of activated Sepharose was used and procedures were as described by the manufacturer. The remaining active sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the column was washed extensively and equilibrated in Buffer G. The coupling efficiency was 435 µg of oligonucleotide/ml of packed gel (5 ml), with an overall yield of 87% measured both by counting the radioactivity and by determining the amount of oligonucleotide released in 50 µl of the packed gel by boiling at 95°C. A column containing 2 ml of the packed affinity matrix was used in the purification step. The nuclear extract was thawed and diluted to 2.5 mg/ml in protein concentration with Buffer G. The solution was clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-70 type rotor for 30 min at 4°C and loaded on the affinity matrix at 1 ml/min. The flow-through was recirculated a second time at the same rate of application and the column was washed with 100 volumes of Buffer G, followed by 10 volumes of Buffer G containing 120 mM NaCl and the column was developed with a linear gradient (25 ml each) of 0.1-1 M NaCl in Buffer G. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for specific DNA binding activity by gel mobility shift assay. Subsequently, the eluted proteins were analyzed by UV cross-linking, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting with human anti-Ku autoantibodies (27Mimori T. Ohosone Y. Hama N.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the eluted proteins was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Aliquots of nuclear extracts or affinity column eluted fractions were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P (Millipore) membranes. The membrane was treated with a solution of 2% bovine serum albumin in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, and 140 mM NaCl (TEN) to block the reactive sites and incubated with anti-Ku serum from patient OM (generously provided by Dr. J. A. Hardin, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA), diluted 1:1000 in 2% bovine serum albumin + TEN overnight at 4°C. The blot was washed for 10 min each with 200 ml of TEN, 200 ml of TEN + Tween 20 (500 µl/liter), and once again with TEN at room temperature. The blot was incubated overnight in a sealed bag containing a 10-µl aliquot of 125I-labeled protein A (Amersham) diluted in 10 ml of 2% bovine serum albumin + TEN, washed as described above, and autoradiographed using intensifying screens to visualize the labeled bands. We have introduced a BamHI site at +59 by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and generated a set of 5′ deletion mutants of the hGR gene regulatory region with intact hGR promoter and cap site (13Govindan M.V.

A mixture of deletions containing intact BamHI site at the 3′ end and blunt ended 5′ end was ligated at the SmaI/BamHI sites of a Bluescript SK(+) vector. The size of the plasmid inserts was determined by digestion with HindIII/BamHI, the fragments purified by digestion with HindIII/BamHI and ligated at the HindIII/BglII sites of pBL-CAT. The sequence of the inserted DNA and junctions was determined with appropriate primers by sequencing the double-stranded DNA using a dideoxy sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). To characterize the specificity of the palindromic sequence in the regulation, we cotransfected pHGRΔ908-CAT, pHGRΔ830-CAT, and pHGRΔ747-CAT with the β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) into semiconfluent MCF-7, HeLa, and human placenta cells in culture by the calcium phosphate procedure. The intact hGR gene chimera pHGR2.7-CAT used in this study is identical to the one described previously (13Govindan M.V. Pothier F. Leclerc S. Palaniswami R. Xie B. J.

Expression vectors of Ku70 and Ku80 were generated by cloning the appropriate cDNAs (provided by Dr. J. A. Hardins laboratory) at the BamHI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA 1 (Invitrogen). The specificity of the palindromic sequence was analyzed by using a reporter plasmid construct containing a single copy of the synthetic palindrome GREFE, inserted at the BamHI site of the heterologous CAT vector pBLtk-CAT. The CAT activity was determined in an aliquot of the extract containing 10 units of β-galactosidase activity. The expression of hGR in various target tissues and cells is subject to multiple controls. We have examined the importance of the 5′-regulatory sequences in the promoter region of the hGR gene in an effort to identify and to characterize factors involved in the regulatory pathway (Fig. 1). To identify sequences involved in the regulation of hGR gene, MCF-7, HeLa, and human placenta cells were cotransfected with hGR gene deletion mutants fused to the CAT reporter gene. In extracts prepared from MCF-7 cells transfected with pBL-CAT (Fig. 2, lane 1), pHGRΔ908-CAT (lane 2), pHGRΔ830-CAT (lane 3), and pHGRΔ747-CAT (lane 4), reporter gene transcription was only basal. In placenta and HeLa cells, CAT expression also remained basal with control pBL-tkCAT (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 9) and the deletion mutant pHGRΔ747-CAT (lanes 8 and 12). However, there was a 5-fold increase in CAT activity expressed by the chimera pHGRΔ830-CAT (lanes 7 and 11) in placenta and HeLa cells compared to the levels observed with the control pBL-CAT construct. Similarly, in placenta and HeLa cells cotransfected with pHGRΔ908-CAT (lanes 6 and 12), there was a 12-fold increase in CAT expression. These results indicate that sequences between −830 and −908 5′ to the GR promoter are involved in the cell specific and enhanced expression of the GR gene. As shown in Fig. 3, alignment of sequences in the transcriptional control elements of various genes reveals the presence of a unique palindrome adjacent to a putative Sp1 binding site (13Govindan M.V. Pothier F. Leclerc S. Palaniswami R. Xie B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1991; 40: 317-323Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Leclerc S. Xie B. Roy R. Govindan M.V. J. Biol.

To further delineate the sequences involved in the GR expression, we fused a single copy of this palindrome, GREFE, to the heterologous CAT reporter plasmid pBL-tkCAT. In human MCF-7, LNCaP, HeLa, and placenta cells transfected with control plasmid pBL-tkCAT, CAT expression was at comparable constitutive levels (Fig. 4, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6, respectively). In MCF-7 and LNCaP cells (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4), CAT expression by the palindrome-containing reporter plasmid pHGR-CAT (−892/−878) did not rise above basal levels. In HeLa (lane 7) and placenta cells (lane 8), an 8-fold increase in CAT activity was observed with pHGR-CAT (−892 to −878), confirming that the sequences between −892 and −879 function as enhancer sequences of GR gene expression.Fig. 4Cell specific expression of hGR gene involves the palindrome. Semiconfluent human MCF-7, LNCaP, HeLa, and placenta cells were cotransfected either with 10 µg of pBL-CAT control plasmid or with 10 µg of pHGR(−892 to −878)-CAT chimera and 5 µg of pCH110 as described under “Materials and Methods.” Following the determination of β-galactosidase in an aliquot of the total cell extract, CAT activity was measured in extracts containing 10 units of β-galactosidase activity. The acetylated chloramphenicol derivatives were visualized by autoradiography and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The values are the average of triplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The enriched nuclear extract from human placenta was clarified and depleted of the unspecific adsorbed proteins. Under the affinity chromatography conditions described above, 90% of the factor(s) bound to the stationary matrix. To detect and to visualize the proteins, fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (Fig. 5A). Next, we performed UV cross-linking analyses followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 5B) and finally examined the interaction of the factor(s) with the synthetic palindrome (Fig. 5, C and D) and conducted Western blotting (Fig. 5E). To define the interaction of specific factor(s) with the palindrome, we incubated samples of various fractions with the labeled oligonucleotide, GREFE. The separation of the complexes on acrylamide gels (Fig. 5C) followed the elution pattern of the factors from the affinity column. The proteins were characterized using a combination of DNA-binding and UV cross-linking analyses. The resolution of the UV cross-linked complexes on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, showed the presence of a major labeled band at 80 kDa (Fig. 5B), which comigrated with the silver-stained 80-kDa protein band (Fig. 5A, lanes fractions 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13). Two additional low molecular bands with reduced intensity at 66 and 50 kDa (Fig. 5B) were also visible. The reduction in the intensity of the retarded complexes in the presence of 100-fold molar non-radioactive competitors in parallel incubations, confirmed the specificity of the interactions (Fig. 5D).

https://openalex.org/W2060849050,"Several serpin-enzyme complexes bind to a receptor on hepatocytes that mediates their endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. Joslin et al. (Joslin, G., Fallon, R. J., Bullock, J., Adams, S. P., and Perlmutter, D. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11282-11288) proposed that a sequence near the C-terminal end of the serpin (e.g. FVFLM in α1-antitrypsin) binds to the serpin-enzyme complex receptor (SEC receptor). In experiments with synthetic peptides, they found that substitution of alanine at the fourth or fifth position in this sequence reduced the affinity of peptide binding to Hep G2 cells. To test the hypothesis that the corresponding sequence in heparin cofactor II (HCII), FLFLI (residues 456-460), mediates binding and uptake of the thrombin-HCII complex by Hep G2 cells, we constructed five recombinant HCII variants, F456A, L457A, F458A, L459A, and I460A. At 4°C, the 125I-thrombin-HCII(native) complex bound reversibly to 0.6-2.6 × 105 sites per Hep G2 cell with a Kd of 19-32 nM. Binding was inhibited by excess unlabeled thrombin-HCII(native), thrombin-antithrombin, or elastase-α1-antitrypsin, but not by free HCII or thrombin, which is consistent with the reported specificity of the SEC receptor. However, complexes of thrombin with each of the HCII variants inhibited binding as effectively as the complex with native HCII. Competitive binding experiments with various concentrations of unlabeled thrombin-HCII(native) or thrombin-HCII(I460A) indicated that these complexes bind to Hep G2 cells with equal affinity. At 37°C, complexes of 125I-thrombin with each of the five HCII variants were internalized and degraded at the same rate as the complex with native HCII. Our data suggest that the pentapeptide FLFLI in HCII is not involved in binding, internalization, and degradation of thrombin-HCII complexes by Hep G2 cells. Several serpin-enzyme complexes bind to a receptor on hepatocytes that mediates their endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. Joslin et al. (Joslin, G., Fallon, R. J., Bullock, J., Adams, S. P., and Perlmutter, D. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11282-11288) proposed that a sequence near the C-terminal end of the serpin (e.g. FVFLM in α1-antitrypsin) binds to the serpin-enzyme complex receptor (SEC receptor). In experiments with synthetic peptides, they found that substitution of alanine at the fourth or fifth position in this sequence reduced the affinity of peptide binding to Hep G2 cells. To test the hypothesis that the corresponding sequence in heparin cofactor II (HCII), FLFLI (residues 456-460), mediates binding and uptake of the thrombin-HCII complex by Hep G2 cells, we constructed five recombinant HCII variants, F456A, L457A, F458A, L459A, and I460A. At 4°C, the 125I-thrombin-HCII(native) complex bound reversibly to 0.6-2.6 × 105 sites per Hep G2 cell with a Kd of 19-32 nM.

Our data suggest that the pentapeptide FLFLI in HCII is not involved in binding, internalization, and degradation of thrombin-HCII complexes by Hep G2 cells. The serpins comprise a large family of homologous proteins that are widely distributed in nature (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 2Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many serpins inhibit extracellular serine proteases that participate in hemostasis, fibrinolysis, or inflammation. Heparin cofactor II (HCII) 1The abbreviations used are: HCIIheparin cofactor IIrHCIIrecombinant HCIISEC receptorserpin-enzyme complex receptorPPACKD-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a serpin found in mammalian plasma that inhibits thrombin >1000 times more rapidly in the presence of heparin or dermatan sulfate than in the absence of a glycosaminoglycan (3Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1014-1209Google Scholar). Like other serpins, HCII inhibits thrombin by forming a stable 1:1 complex with the protease. Thrombin-HCII and several other serpin-enzyme complexes bind to a receptor on the surface of hepatocytes (termed the “SEC receptor”), which mediates endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the complexes (4Perlmutter D.H.

Thus, the SEC receptor may be involved in clearance of serpin-enzyme complexes from the circulation. heparin cofactor II recombinant HCII serpin-enzyme complex receptor D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The serpin-enzyme complexes elastase-α1-antitrypsin, cathepsin G-α1-antichymotrypsin, thrombin-antithrombin, and thrombin-HCII compete with one another for binding to the SEC receptor on human hepatoma (Hep G2) cells (6Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uncomplexed serpins and proteases, however, do not bind to the receptor. Joslin et al. (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that a pentapeptide sequence near the C-terminal end of the serpin (i.e. FVFLM in α1-antitrypsin, FLMII in α1-antichymotrypsin, FLVFI in antithrombin, and FLFLI in HCII) becomes accessible during complex formation and mediates binding of the complex to the SEC receptor. In support of this hypothesis, they showed that binding of 125I-trypsin-α1-antitrypsin to Hep G2 cells was competitively inhibited by the synthetic peptide FVFLM. Additional experiments suggested that interaction of peptides with the SEC receptor was sequence-specific. In particular, FVFLA did not inhibit 125I-trypsin-α1-antitrypsin binding, and FVFAM was a relatively weak inhibitor of binding in comparison with FVFLM (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the presence of alanine at the corresponding positions in a serpin would be predicted to disrupt binding of the serpin-enzyme complex to the SEC receptor. To test the hypothesis that FLFLI (positions 456-460) in HCII mediates binding to the SEC receptor, we constructed five recombinant HCII (rHCII) variants, each containing an alanine substitution at one of the positions in the pentapeptide sequence. In contrast to predictions made from the synthetic peptide experiments of Joslin et al. (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that none of the mutations in the proposed SEC receptor recognition site of HCII diminished the binding, internalization, and degradation of thrombin-HCII complexes by Hep G2 cells. HCII and antithrombin were purified from human plasma as described previously (8Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human α1-antitrypsin and human leukocyte elastase were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA) and human α-thrombin from Haematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Thrombin was inactivated with D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone (PPACK, Calbiochem) as described by Kettner and Shaw (9Kettner C. Shaw E. Thromb. Res. 1979; 14: 969-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Porcine intestinal heparin and porcine skin dermatan sulfate were purchased from Sigma; the dermatan sulfate was treated with nitrous acid to degrade contaminating heparin or heparan sulfate (8Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other materials were obtained from the following sources: papain, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and deoxyribonuclease-1 from Sigma; polyethylene glycol 8000 from Union Carbide (Danbury, CT); Chromozym TH (tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide) from Boehringer Mannheim; heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, Sephacryl S-200, HiTrap heparin, Mono Q and Mono S columns from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); and medium for high density bacterial culture from BIO 101 (Vista, CA). HCII and antithrombin concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients of 1.17 mg−1·ml·cm−1 (10Tollefsen D.M. Majerus D.W. Blank M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2162-2169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.65 mg−1·ml·cm−1 (11Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), respectively. Concentrations of other proteins and serpin-enzyme complexes were determined using the protein assay kit from Bio-Rad standardized with bovine serum albumin. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5 or 10% gels under reducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Autoradiography was performed as described previously (8Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length HCII cDNA (13Blinder M.A. Marasa J.C. Reynolds C.H. Deaven L.L. Tollefsen D.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was inserted between the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pET-3d expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using oligonucleotides synthesized in the Protein and Nucleic Acids Chemistry Laboratory at Washington University. The mutations and ligation sites were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Plasmid vectors were electroporated into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells for expression. The cells were grown to an optical density (600 nm) of ~5-6 in a BioFlo III high-density fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) at 37°C and then induced with 0.3 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were harvested and lysed at 4°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 2 mM EDTA. The lysate was treated with 10 µg/ml deoxyribonuclease-1 and 10 mM MnCl2, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. rHCII was purified from the lysate by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose CL6B, Mono Q, and Mono S columns. HCII activity in the column fractions was determined in a thrombin inhibition assay in the presence of dermatan sulfate (15Zhang G.S. Mehringer J.H. Van Deerlin V.M. Kozak C.A. Tollefsen D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3632-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All reactions were carried out under pseudo-first-order conditions. In the absence of a glycosaminoglycan, residual thrombin activity was determined at various times by hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (ΔA405/min). In reactions containing heparin or dermatan sulfate, the chromogenic substrate (250 µM) was present throughout the course of the incubation, and the A405 was monitored continuously. Second-order rate constants were calculated from the data as described by Sheehan et al. (16Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin was labeled with Na125I (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) by the chloramine T method as described previously (8Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of the final product was ~2.0 × 105 cpm/ng (7.4 × 103 cpm/fmol). Serpin-enzyme complexes were prepared by incubating the inhibitor (0.1-0.5 mg/ml) with the protease at a molar ratio of ~3:1 (inhibitor:protease) for 1-2 h at 37°C in 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (~10 µM) was then added to inhibit any remaining proteolytic activity, and the reaction mixture was fractionated on a HiTrap heparin column eluted with 0-1 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Fractions containing the serpin-enzyme complexes were pooled empirically based on SDS-PAGE. The complexes were concentrated to ~1 mg/ml with an Ultrafree-MC (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) centrifugal ultrafiltrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at −70°C. The complexes were stable during storage as determined by SDS-PAGE. HCII was incubated with human leukocyte elastase as described by Pratt et al. (17Pratt C.W. Tobin R.B. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6092-6097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this treatment results in proteolytic cleavage after Ile66 and Val439 to yield an inactive 48-kDa product. Antithrombin was incubated in the absence of heparin with human leukocyte elastase as described by Carrell and Owen (18Carrell R.W. Owen M.C. Nature. 1985; 317: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) to form an inactive product cleaved after Val389 or Ile390. For unknown reasons, the mobility of cleaved antithrombin is approximately equal to that of the native protein on SDS-PAGE (58 kDa) (19Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Incubation of α1-antitrypsin with papain was performed as described by Johnson and Travis (20Johnson D. Travis J. Biochem. J. 1977; 163: 639-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); this treatment produces a 47-kDa product cleaved after Phe352 and Met358 (21Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In each case, the protease was removed from the cleaved inhibitor by chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 after loss of the inhibitor's activity was confirmed. The final preparations were assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE and stored at −70°C. Hep G2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks at 37°C in humidified air, 5% CO2 with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested and seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates 2-3 days prior to the assay. Cell counts were determined with a hemocytometer on suspensions of cells detached from the plates with trypsin/EDTA. Binding experiments were performed at 4°C. Cell monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 0.2 g/liter KH2PO4, 1.15 g/liter Na2HPO4, pH 7.1-7.2) containing 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6 nM PPACK (binding buffer). The reaction was initiated by adding 0.4 ml of binding buffer containing 125I-thrombin-HCII with or without a competing ligand. At specified times, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed rapidly three times with binding buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C. The cells were then lysed with 1 ml of 1 N NaOH for 30 min at room temperature. The radioactivity of the cell lysate was quantified by γ scintillation spectrometry. Alternatively, the cells were washed as described above, lysed with 1% SDS, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled thrombin-HCII. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. Hep G2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and grown for 2 days prior to the assay. The medium was replaced by 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 nM PPACK, and 125I-thrombin-HCII with or without a competing ligand. At specified times of incubation at 37°C, the medium was removed and assayed for trichloroacetic acid-soluble degradation products containing [125I]iodotyrosine as described by Goldstein et al. (22Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 200 µM chloroquine was included in the medium to inhibit lysosomal degradation. Before we could investigate whether mutations in HCII affect the interaction of thrombin-HCII complexes with the SEC receptor, it was necessary to characterize the binding of 125I-thrombin-HCII complexes to Hep G2 cells in greater detail than previously reported (6Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To do this, we prepared radiolabeled thrombin-HCII complexes by incubating 125I-thrombin with purified plasma HCII in the absence of a glycosaminoglycan. The complexes were separated from free 125I-thrombin and HCII by heparin-Sepharose chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fig. 1 (panel A) indicates that almost all of the radioactivity was present in an SDS-stable complex of the appropriate molecular weight (~96,000) (10Tollefsen D.M. Majerus D.W. Blank M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2162-2169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding studies were performed at 4°C to minimize internalization and degradation of the ligand. The time course of binding of 10 nM125I-thrombin-HCII to Hep G2 cells is shown in Fig. 1 (panel B). Maximal specific binding was attained after a 2-h incubation and represented ~1.5% of the total radioactivity added to the cells (closed circles). Analysis of the medium and the washed cell monolayer by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography indicated that the 125I-thrombin-HCII complex remained intact and that the bound radioactivity did not represent a labeled contaminant (Fig. 1, panel C). To determine the reversibility of binding after 2 h at 4°C, the cells were washed and then incubated with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled thrombin-HCII. During a subsequent 2-h incubation, the bound radioactivity progressively decreased to the level of nonspecific binding (Fig. 1, panel B, closed triangles). Specific binding became saturated over the concentration range of 5-80 nM125I-thrombin-HCII, whereas nonspecific binding increased linearly (Fig. 2, panel A). Scatchard analysis suggested a single class of binding sites (~0.6 × 105 sites per Hep G2 cell) with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 19 nM (Fig. 2, panel B). In an experiment with a different batch of Hep G2 cells, ~2.6 × 105 molecules of complex bound per cell with a Kd of 32 nM (data not shown). To confirm that we were detecting binding of 125I-thrombin-HCII to the SEC receptor of Hep G2 cells, as operationally defined in previous studies, we determined binding in the presence of a 40-fold molar excess of various competitors. SDS-PAGE of the proteins used as competitors in this experiment is shown in Fig. 3 (panel A). No inhibition of binding was observed in the presence of HCII, antithrombin, α1-antitrypsin, or thrombin inactivated with PPACK (Fig. 3, panel B). By contrast, purified thrombin-HCII, thrombin-antithrombin, and elastase-α1-antitrypsin complexes inhibited binding of the 125I-thrombin-HCII complex by 60-70%. These results are consistent with previous reports that the SEC receptor does not recognize the free serpin or its target protease and that several serpin-enzyme complexes compete with one another for binding to Hep G2 cells (4Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparations of HCII, antithrombin, and α1-antitrypsin inactivated by cleavage of the reactive site loop also inhibited binding of 125I-thrombin-rHCII to a modest degree (see “Discussion”). To investigate the proposed SEC receptor recognition site, we constructed the HCII variants shown in Fig. 4 (panel A). Each form of rHCII was expressed in E. coli, purified, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4 (panel B), the mutant proteins were identical in size to native rHCII and had an apparent Mr of ~58,000. The molecular weight of rHCII is less than that of human plasma HCII because of the absence of asparagine-linked glycosylation in E. coli. We determined second-order rate constants for inhibition of thrombin to assess the functional integrity of the mutant proteins. As indicated in Table I, the rate constants for inhibition of thrombin by each of the variants in the presence of heparin or dermatan sulfate were essentially identical to that of native rHCII (~1.5 × 108M−1min−1) and were approximately 5000 times higher than the rate constants determined in the absence of a glycosaminoglycan (~3.0 × 104M−1min−1). Furthermore, the affinities of the native and mutant rHCIIs for heparin were indistinguishable as determined by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (data not shown).Table I.Second-order rate constants for inhibition of thrombin by rHCII variantsrHCIIarHCII, recombinant HCII; GAG, glycosaminoglycan.No GAGarHCII, recombinant HCII; GAG, glycosaminoglycan.+ Heparin (5 µg/ml)+ Dermatan sulfate (20 µg/ml)M−1 min−1Native3.2 × 1041.5 × 1081.6 × 108F456A1.0 × 1041.0 × 1081.1 × 108L457A2.9 × 1041.1 × 1081.8 × 108F458A2.9 × 1041.4 × 1081.3 × 108L459A1.7 × 1041.7 × 1081.7 × 108I460A1.9 × 1041.8 × 1081.8 × 108a rHCII, recombinant HCII; GAG, glycosaminoglycan. Open table in a new tab Competitive inhibition studies were performed to determine whether complexes of thrombin with the rHCII variants bind to the SEC receptor. Complexes prepared by incubating the rHCII variants in Fig. 4 with thrombin were isolated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The final preparations were homogeneous by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). In control experiments, binding of 125I-thrombin-HCII to Hep G2 cells was not inhibited by a 40-fold molar excess of unlabeled native rHCII or by any of the rHCII variants (Fig. 5). By contrast, the thrombin-rHCII(native) complex inhibited binding ~70%, and binding was inhibited to an equal extent by complexes of thrombin with each of the five rHCII variants. The result obtained with thrombin-rHCII(I460A) was particularly unexpected, because substitution of alanine at the corresponding position of a synthetic pentapeptide almost completely abrogated its binding to the SEC receptor (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test for a subtle difference in the Kd values for binding of thrombin-rHCII(I460A) and thrombin-rHCII(native) to Hep G2 cells, we performed competitive binding assays with lower concentrations of both unlabeled ligands. The results (Fig. 6) indicate that thrombin-rHCII(I460A) and thrombin-rHCII(native) have similar affinities for the SEC receptor.Fig. 6Inhibition of 125I-thrombin-HCII binding by thrombin-rHCII(native) and thrombin-rHCII(I460A).

Fig. 7 (panel A, closed circles) shows the time-dependent uptake and degradation of 125I-thrombin-rHCII(native) complexes. Uptake and degradation were not inhibited by excess unlabeled PPACK-thrombin (open circles) or by HCII (closed squares) but were partially inhibited by thrombin-HCII complexes (open squares), which is consistent with involvement of the SEC receptor (5Perlmutter D.H. Joslin G. Nelson P. Schasteen C. Adams S.P. Fallon R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake and degradation were inhibited ~75% by 200 µM chloroquine (closed triangles), which suggests that degradation occurs via the lysosomal pathway. Fig. 7 (panel B) shows a separate experiment in which complexes prepared with native or mutant rHCII were incubated for 6 h at 37°C with Hep G2 cells in the absence or presence of chloroquine. Uptake and lysosomal degradation of complexes containing each of the mutant rHCIIs occurred at the same rate as that of the 125I-thrombin-rHCII-(native) complex. The observation that trypsin-α1-antitrypsin complexes are eliminated from mouse plasma in vivo ~5-10 times more rapidly than free α1-antitrypsin first suggested the existence of a specific clearance mechanism for serpin-enzyme complexes (23Fuchs H.E. Shifman M.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 716: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated uptake of radiolabeled serpin-enzyme complexes by hepatocytes (24Shifman M.A. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3243-3248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fuchs H.E. Shifman M.A. Michalopoulos G. Pizzo S.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cross-competition experiments in vivo suggested that complexes containing α1-antitrypsin, α1-antichymotrypsin, antithrombin, or heparin cofactor II are cleared by the same hepatic receptor (26Pizzo S.V. Mast A.E. Feldman S.R. Salvesen G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Pratt C.W. Church F.C. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas α2-antiplasmin-protease complexes are eliminated by a different mechanism (28Gonias S.L. Fuchs H.E. Pizzo S.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1982; 48: 208-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Rapid clearance is independent of the protease used to form the complex, which implies that the receptor recognizes a change in the structure of the serpin that follows complex formation. Receptors with similar ligand specificity have also been identified on neutrophils and monocytes. The elastase-α1-antitrypsin complex, but not free α1-antitrypsin, is chemotactic for neutrophils (29Banda M.J. Rice A.G. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Joslin G. Griffin G.L. August A.M. Adams S. Fallon R.J. Senior R.M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Clin.

(33Banda M.J. Rice A.G. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4481-4484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the C-terminal 4.2-kDa peptide derived from cleavage of α1-antitrypsin at the reactive site stimulates neutrophil chemotaxis. Similarly, Perlmutter and co-workers (4Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that biosynthesis of α1-antitrypsin in Hep G2 cells and monocytes is stimulated by synthetic peptides based on the C-terminal sequence of α1-antitrypsin. One of these peptides (SIPPEVKPNKPFVYLI,2 designated 105Y) bound to ~4.5 × 105 sites per Hep G2 cell with a Kd of ~40 nM (4Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Binding of 125I-105Y was competitively inhibited by reaction mixtures containing elastase-α1-antitrypsin, thrombin-antithrombin, cathepsin G-α1-antichymotrypsin, or C1s-C1 inhibitor complexes but not by the uncomplexed serpins or proteases. Subsequently, these investigators showed that the 125I-α1-antitrypsin-elastase complex binds to Hep G2 cells with a Kd of 30-40 nM and then undergoes internalization and lysosomal degradation (5Perlmutter D.H. Joslin G. Nelson P. Schasteen C. Adams S.P. Fallon R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since binding and internalization were competitively inhibited by unlabeled peptide 105Y, elastase-α1-antitrypsin, or trypsin-α1-antitrypsin, they suggested that a single receptor on Hep G2 cells, termed the SEC receptor, is involved both in receptor-mediated endocytosis and in triggering a signal transduction pathway that leads to increased α1-antitrypsin gene expression. In a subsequent report, Joslin et al. (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the pentapeptide FVFLM (residues 370-374) of α1-antitrypsin and the corresponding sequences in other serpins (FLMII in α1-antichymotrypsin, FLVFI in antithrombin, and FLFLI in HCII) mediate binding of the serpin-enzyme complexes to the SEC receptor. They demonstrated that binding of 125I-105Y or 125I-trypsin-α1-antitrypsin to Hep G2 cells was inhibited by excess unlabeled FVFLM. Additional experiments indicated that the pentapeptide FVYLI (contained in peptide 105Y), but not the truncated peptides FVYL or VYLI, could function as a competitive inhibitor of binding. Various amino acid substitutions in the synthetic peptide FVFLM suggested that binding to the SEC receptor is somewhat sequence-specific. Peptides in which any one of the first three amino acids was replaced with alanine (i.e. AVFLM, FAFLM, and FVALM) inhibited binding of 125I-trypsin-α1-antitrypsin to Hep G2 cells. By contrast, FVFLA was almost completely inactive in the competitive binding assay, and FVFAM had only moderate activity in comparison with that of the native peptide FVFLM (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We designed the current study as a critical test of the hypothesis that FLFLI (residues 456-460) mediates binding and endocytosis of the thrombin-HCII complex by Hep G2 cells. First, we showed that purified complexes prepared with 125I-thrombin and plasma HCII bind reversibly at 4°C to 0.6-2.6 × 105 sites per Hep G2 cell with a Kd of 19-32 nM (Fig. 1, Fig. 2), which agrees closely with the Kd values reported for binding of peptide 125I-105Y or 125I-α1-antitrypsin-elastase (see above). In the study reported previously (5Perlmutter D.H. Joslin G. Nelson P. Schasteen C. Adams S.P. Fallon R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reaction mixtures containing labeled serpin-enzyme complexes were used without purification, which precluded an estimate of the number of binding sites per cell. The number of binding sites that we observed for 125I-thrombin-rHCII was 2-8-fold less than that reported for 125I-105Y (5Perlmutter D.H. Joslin G. Nelson P. Schasteen C. Adams S.P. Fallon R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, excess unlabeled elastase-α1-antitrypsin inhibited only ~60% of the binding of 125I-105Y to Hep G2 cells (5Perlmutter D.H. Joslin G. Nelson P. Schasteen C. Adams S.P. Fallon R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which raises the possibility that the peptide binds to more than one component on the cell surface. Next, we demonstrated that binding of 125I-thrombin-HCII is inhibited by excess unlabeled thrombin-HCII and other serpin-enzyme complexes but not by free HCII or active site-blocked thrombin (PPACK-thrombin) (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the ligand specificity of the SEC receptor as previously defined. Proteolytically inactivated forms of HCII, antithrombin, and α1-antitrypsin inhibited binding of 125I-thrombin-HCII less well than equimolar concentrations of the corresponding serpin-enzyme complexes (Fig. 3), in agreement with the observation that cleaved serpins are not cleared rapidly from the circulation (19Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that endocytosis and degradation of 125I-thrombin-HCII at 37°C is partially inhibited by excess unlabeled thrombin-HCII (Fig. 7, panel A) but not by free HCII or PPACK-thrombin, consistent with involvement of the SEC receptor in this process. Finally, we constructed a series of alanine substitutions in the proposed SEC receptor recognition site of rHCII (Fig. 4) and showed that the mutant proteins are expressed as fully active inhibitors (Table I). As predicted from the results obtained with synthetic peptides (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mutation of Phe456, Leu457, or Phe458 does not affect binding or endocytosis of 125I-thrombin-rHCII by Hep G2 cells. By contrast, the synthetic peptide experiments predicted that mutation of Ile460 to alanine would greatly reduce the binding affinity of the thrombin-rHCII(I460A) complex and slow the rate of receptor-mediated endocytosis (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Figs. 5, 6, 7, however, indicate that this mutation has no effect on either process. Likewise, replacement of Leu459 with alanine has no effect, although a pentapeptide with alanine in the corresponding position had a moderately decreased affinity for Hep G2 cells (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data do not support the hypothesis that the pentapeptide FLFLI in HCII (or, by implication, the corresponding sequences in other serpins) mediates binding, internalization, and degradation of the serpin-enzyme complex by Hep G2 cells. Schulze et al. (34Schulze A.J. Huber R. Bode W. Engh R.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) also have questioned involvement of the pentapeptide in these processes, citing crystallographic evidence that this sequence is buried in the hydrophobic core of the serpin. Based on the assumption that peptide 105Y mimics binding of serpin-enzyme complexes to Hep G2 cells, Perlmutter (35Perlmutter D.H. Pediatr. Res. 1994; 36: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) has proposed that the ligand-binding subunit of the SEC receptor is an 80-kDa polypeptide identified by photoaffinity cross-linking of radioiodinated 105Y to Hep G2 cell membranes. However, Kounnas et al. (36Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, the ligand-binding subunit of which is 515 kDa in size, is responsible for endocytosis and degradation of thrombin-HCII, thrombin-antithrombin, and trypsin-α1-antitrypsin complexes by Hep G2 cells and for the in vivo clearance of 125I-thrombin-antithrombin complexes in rats. Whether the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein or the 80-kDa polypeptide participates in the signaling events attributed to the SEC receptor remains to be determined."

The glycoprotein hormone chorionic gonadotropin β subunit is a secretory protein whose folding in the ER has been demonstrated (Huth, J. R., Mountjoy, K., Perini, F., and Ruddon, R. W. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8870-8879). Because folding of wild type hCG-β subunit occurs in the ER with a t1/2 = 4-5 min, stable association of ER chaperones with hCG-β have been difficult to detect probably because they have a short half-life. However, β-chaperone complexes containing the ER chaperones BiP, ERp72, and ERp94 have been detected in slow folding mutants of hCG-β subunit that lack both of the N-linked oligosaccharides (Feng, W., Matzuk, M. M., Mountjoy, K., Bedows, E., Ruddon, R. W., and Boime, I. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 11851-11859). The questions addressed here are 1) whether the detection of chaperone-containing complexes is related to the absence of carbohydrate or to the rate of hCG-β subunit folding, 2) whether such complexes are dead-end or whether they lead to formation of a secreted, mature hCG-β form, and 3) what the nature of the hCG-β-chaperone binding is. The data obtained indicate that the amount of detectable hCG-β-chaperone complexes correlates with the rate or extent of folding, that the complexes of hCG-β with ER chaperones lead to the formation of secretable β, and that the complexes of hCG-β with chaperones involve the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds.

These proteins include foldases such as peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase and protein disulfide isomerase, which catalyze rate-limiting isomerization steps in protein folding, and binding proteins called molecular chaperones that stabilize unfolded or partially folded structures and prevent the formation of inappropriate folding interactions (1Gething M.-J.

Molecular chaperones are proteins that are expressed in cellular compartments where protein folding occurs, and those of the heat-shock protein families (e.g. hsp-70 and hsp-90) are frequently induced to higher levels during response to stress. They function in protein folding and translocation by mechanisms that involve binding to hydrophobic surfaces of unfolded proteins. This prevents aggregation and fosters conformational changes that lead to native structure (1Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.

Chaperone-mediated protein folding appears to proceed by multiple rounds of binding and release of nonnative forms (4Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and by sequential binding of various chaperones that may be involved in different steps of the folding pathway (5Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, binding of partially folded intermediates to chaperones can facilitate protein folding while the folding intermediate is still chaperone-bound (6Tian G. Vainberg I.E. Tap W.D. Lewis S.A.

The molecular chaperones of the hsp-70 and hsp-90 families in eukaroytic cells function in the stabilization, translocation, and degradation of partially folded intermediates during polypeptide folding and assembly. BiP is a member of the hsp-70 chaperone family in the ER of eukaryotic cells. It has been proposed that BiP associates transiently with unfolded or misfolded proteins to modulate protein folding (5Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 7Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). ERp94, a member of hsp-90 chaperones, appears to function with BiP to assist protein folding in the ER lumen (8Melnick J. Aviel S. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21303-21306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ERp72 has been identified as an ER protein containing protein disulfide isomerase homology units (9Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, calnexin (also called p88, IP90), an ER transmembrane protein, plays a chaperone-like role by binding with monoglucose-containing N-linked glycans of newly synthesized glycoproteins (5Hammond C.

The folding of the β subunit of hCG has proven to be an excellent model for studying the events that lead to the production of a biologically active hormone (12Huth J.R. Mountjoy K. Perini F.

Because it is a secretory glycoprotein with six intramolecular disulfide bonds and must assemble with the glycoprotein hormone α subunit to become biologically active, several lessons may be learned about the role of disulfide bonds, oligosaccharides, and chaperones in the in vivo folding, assembly, and secretion of such proteins. Using the formation of disulfide bonds as an index of conformational changes during protein folding, the intracellular kinetic folding pathway of the β subunit of hCG has been determined (12Huth J.R.

In the case of the glycosylation mutants, we found that the t1/2 for folding of the first detectable β folding intermediate, pβ1, into the second major hCG-β folding intermediate, pβ2 (the rate-determining step in hCG-β folding), was 5-7 min for wild type β but 33 min for β lacking both N-linked glycans. However, the t1/2 of conversion of pβ1 → pβ2 was 7-8 min in CHO cells expressing hCG-β subunits missing only the Asn13-linked glycan and 10 min for hCG-β subunits missing only the Asn30-linked glycan (17Feng W.

Moreover, we reported that the ER chaperones BiP, ERp74, and ERp94, but not calnexin, are co-immunoprecipitated with unglycosylated hCG-β folding intermediates (17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K.

In this report, we examine whether the formation of stable complexes of hCG-β with ER chaperones occurs in several CHO cell lines transfected with the WT β gene or a variety of mutated hCG-β genes: 1) slow folding mutants in which both Cys residues of intramolecular disulfide bonds were replaced by Ala, 2) glycosylation mutants in which Asn residues of N-linked glycosylation sites were converted to Gln, or 3) a previously undescribed CHO cell line transfected with a Pro → Gly mutant of hCG-β (P73G) that slows hCG-β folding. We have determined that the amount of hCG-β-chaperone complex correlates with the rate or extent of hCG-β subunit folding. The slower folding mutants formed a greater detectable amount of chaperone complex, but the nonfolding mutants did not form detectable amounts of chaperone complex. Moreover, the hCG-β-chaperone complexes appear to be productive in that hCG-β contained in them is ultimately folded and secreted from CHO cells. Finally, the hCG-β-chaperone complexes involve the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. The terminology used here is: CHO β WT, β Asn1, β Asn2, and β Asn(1+2) for CHO cells transfected with wild type hCG-β genes or hCG-β genes containing mutations Asn → Gln, at Asn13, Asn30, or both glycosylation sites, respectively (20Matzuk M.M.

CHO P73G cells were transfected with the pGS plasmid (a gift of Dr. Tyler White, Scios Nova, Mountainview, CA) and were grown and maintained in UltraCulture medium (BioWhittaker, Inc) supplemented with 50 µM methionine sulfoximine. CHO cells were metabolically labeled as described previously (17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol.

Briefly, 100-mm Petri dishes of 90% confluent CHO cells were starved in cysteine-free and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without G418 for 30 min. These cells were then pulse-labeled for 5 min with 200-400 µCi/ml L-[35S]cysteine (1100 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) without G418 and lacking cysteine and chased for the times indicated in the text. Then cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0) containing detergents (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), protease inhibitors (20 mM EDTA and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 50 mM sodium iodoacetate (pH 8.3) to alkylate free sulfhydryl groups of folding intermediates and to prevent further disulfide bond formation or rearrangement. The cell lysates or chase media were immunoprecipitated with an anti-hCG-β polyclonal antibody (1:1000), which recognizes all forms of the hCG-β subunit, for 16 h at 4°C, and the immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), as described previously (17Feng W.

The protein A-Sepharose-hCG-β immune complexes were eluted with 2 × concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 40 µg/ml bromphenol blue) and analyzed by 5-20% acrylamide gradient, nonreducing SDS-PAGE as described previously (12Huth J.R.

The protein A-Sepharose beads containing hCG-β immune complexes were eluted with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (pH 3) (Sequanal grade; Pierce) for 16 h with rotation at room temperature. Eluates were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Vydac 300-Å C4 column with elution by an acetonitrile gradient as described previously (12Huth J.R.

To detect the presence of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with β folding intermediates, CHO β WT, β Asn1, β Asn2, or β Asn(1+2) cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal hCG-β antisera, and the hCG-β subunits were eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads with 6 M guanidine (pH 3.0) for 16 h with rotation at room temperature and purified by C4 reversed-phase HPLC (12Huth J.R.

The 80-95 min and 100-107 min fractions (termed C1 and C2, respectively) containing β-chaperone complexes were collected and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon™ polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Millipore) in a Trans-Blot® Cell (Bio-Rad) at 480 mA for 1-2 h at 4°C. The membranes were immunoblotted with either rat anti-BiP (1:500), rabbit anti-ERp72 (1:100), rabbit anti-ERp94 (1:100), or rabbit anti-calnexin (1:2000) overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking. Rat anti-BiP polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. David Bole (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Rabbit anti-ERp72 (against the 16 C-terminal amino acids of murine ERp72) and rabbit anti-ERp94 (against the 16 C-terminal amino acids of murine ERp94) were provided by Dr. Michael Green (St. Louis University Medical Center, St. Louis, MO). The rabbit anti-calnexin (against the C-terminal 19 amino acids of canine calnexin) was provided by Dr. Ari Helenius (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Membranes were washed several times with buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaC1, 1% nonfat milk, and 0.2% Tween (pH 7.4) and incubated with anti-rat or anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (1:1000, Sigma) for 30 min at 4°C. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL™ Western blotting kit, Amersham Life Science) was used to identify the blotted proteins. Aliquots of the HPLC purified hCG-β folding intermediates and chaperone complexes were also analyzed by reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography as described previously (17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11851-11859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). [35S]Cysteine-labeled hCG-β folding intermediates (pβ1 and pβ2) and C1 and C2 chaperone complexes were quantitated by summation of the radioactivity detected in each of the respective peaks eluting in the C4-HPLC chromatogram. The values were normalized by expressing the percentage of total radioactivity of each form depicted in the chromatogram. To investigate the kinetics of association of molecular chaperones with β folding intermediates, CHO cells, transfected with the wild type (β WT) or a mutated hCG-β gene [β Asn(1+2)] containing mutations N13Q and N30Q at the two hCG-β N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences (20Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were pulse-labeled for 5 min with [35S]cysteine and chased for periods of 0-120 min. The cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal hCG-β antisera followed by protein A-Sepharose precipitation. Bound immunocomplexes were eluted with 6 M guanidine and purified by C4 reversed-phase HPLC. As previously seen (17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11851-11859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), wild type pβ1 (Fig. 1A) converted to pβ2 more efficiently than unglycosylated pβ1 (pβ1(0)) (Fig. 1, B-D). Two additional peaks, C1 and C2, were more prevalent in the HPLC profile of the β Asn(1+2) mutant (Fig. 1, B-D) than in that of WT β (Fig. 1A). The new point that we make here is that the C1 and C2 complexes are present as early as 5 min into the chase before much pβ2 is formed and that the C1 and C2 complexes disappear with the same kinetics as folding of pβ1 into pβ2. The C1 peak contained hCG-β and co-immunoprecipitated proteins, three of which were identified as the ER chaperones BiP, ERp72, and ERp94 (Fig. 2). The C2 fraction also contained these chaperones as well as hCG-β (17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11851-11859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The fact that the C1 and C2 peaks diminished with increasing chase time as the earliest folding intermediate, pβ1, was converted to the next folding intermediate, pβ2, (Fig. 1, B-D) suggested that the association of unglycosylated β with certain ER chaperones is an intermediate step in the hCG-β folding process. It should be noted that calnexin was not detected in the C1 and C2 complexes of unglycosylated β (data not shown).Fig. 2Association of BiP, ERp94, and ERp72 with unglycosylated β folding intermediates using Western blot analysis. CHO β Asn(1+2) cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 5 min and chased for 5, 30, or 120 min. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-hCG-β antibody (1:1000) followed by protein A-Sepharose precipitation. The immunocomplexes were eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads with 6 M guanidine and purified on reversed-phase HPLC. The C1 complex from the HPLC (fraction 80-95) was analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blotting. The membranes were cut horizontally by using a prestained molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad) as a guide. The top portions of the membranes containing higher molecular weight proteins (Mr = >35,000) were probed using antibodies against three ER molecular chaperones: BiP, Mr = 78,000 (panel A, I), ERp72, Mr = 72,000 (panel B, I), and ERp94, Mr = 94,000 (panel C, I). The bottom portion of the membrane was subjected to Western blot analysis using hCG-β antibody (deglycosylated hCG-β Mr = 18,000 (panels A-C, II)). Nonimmune sera were used as controls and demonstrated the absence of bands at the loci detected by the specific chaperone or β antibodies (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the absence of both N-linked oligosaccharides was necessary to form the C1 and C2 hCG-β-chaperone complexes, a similar experiment to that shown in Fig. 1 was carried out with CHO cells containing the β subunit gene mutated at only one N-linked glycosylation site (either the Asn13 or Asn30 codon). CHO cells containing the wild type β gene or these mutants were pulsed for 5 min with [35S]Cys and chased for 5 min, and the HPLC profiles of the anti-β immunoprecipitates analyzed as noted above. As can be seen in Fig. 3, there was only a small amount of immunoprecipitated radioactivity in the C1 and C2 loci for the wild type samples (Fig. 3A), intermediate amounts in the C1 and C2 complexes for the monoglycosylated mutants β Asn1 and β Asn2, (Fig. 3, B and C), and the highest amount in the C1 and C2 complexes for the β Asn(1+2) mutant (Fig. 3D). It should be noted that the rate of pβ1 to pβ2 conversion is as follows: β WT ≥β Asn1 > β Asn2 >β Asn(1+2) (17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11851-11859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and this is reflected by the data in Fig. 3 in that the formation of pβ2 was observed for wild type, β Asn1, and β Asn2 but was barely detectable for β Asn(1+2) after a 5-min chase. To quantitate the amount of hCG-β forms present as pβ1 and pβ2 folding intermediates or contained in C1 and C2 chaperone-containing complexes, experiments similar to those described in Fig. 3 were carried out with additional slow folding or nonfolding hCG-β mutants. CHO cells were pulsed for 5 min with [35S]Cys and chased for 5 min. Then the immunoprecipitated, HPLC purified pβ1, pβ2, C1, and C2 peaks were quantitated by determining the amount of radioactivity in each peak, and the relative amounts of radioactivity in each peak (compared with the total hCG-β immunoprecipitated CPM in the entire HPLC profile) were calculated for each peak and plotted as a percentage of total CPM (Fig. 4). The relative amount of immunoprecipitated CPM in the C1 + C2 fractions known to contain β and chaperones (Fig. 2 and Ref. 17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11851-11859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) correlated with the rate or extent of hCG-β folding. The P73G mutant (Fig. 4, lane 5) has a rate of pβ1 → pβ2 conversion of t1/2 = 13 min and is similar to the β Asn1 and β Asn2 mutants (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3) in the amount of C1 and C2 formed. Interestingly, the nonfolding Cys mutants C38A/C57A (Fig. 4, lane 7) and C9A/C90A (Fig. 4, lane 8) did not produce detectable amounts of C1 and C2 complexes. The C23A/C72A mutant pβ1 only partially folds into pβ2 (≤25% during a 30-min chase) (18Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and produced small amounts of C1 and C2 complexes (Fig. 4, lane 6). To determine whether BiP was present in the HPLC samples eluted in the C1 peaks of the anti-β immunoprecipitates from the wild type and glycosylation mutants, the samples eluting at 80-95 min (C1) shown in Fig. 3 (A-D) were analyzed by nonreducing or reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). The top part of the gel was Western blotted with anti-BiP and developed by ECL (Fig. 5A). The bottom half of the gel was dried and developed by autoradiography to show the radiolabeled β subunits present (data not shown). Aliquots from identically prepared samples were developed by autoradiography to detect the amount of [35S]Cys-labeled β (Fig. 5, B-E). BiP was present in the C1 fractions from β WT and from each of the glycosylation mutants (Fig. 5A). The radioactively labeled hCG-β present in the C1 and C2 fractions was present primarily as high molecular weight complexes when analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5, B and D), but under reducing conditions most of the hCG-β present in the C1 and C2 complexes collapsed to monomeric hCG-β forms (Fig. 5, C and E). The separation of hCG-β folding intermediates from chaperones under a combination of denaturing and reducing conditions but not under denaturing conditions alone indicates that disulfide bond formation is an essential characteristic of the molecular chaperone-β interaction. When the 2- or 24-h chase media were collected from [35S]Cys-labeled, β Asn(1+2)-containing CHO cells, immunopurified, and separated by HPLC, only forms that elute at the position of mature β were observed (Fig. 6). Neither the C1 and C2 complexes nor degradation products of β were observed in the chase media. Previous studies have shown that most of the C1 and C2 complexes disappear from intracellular lysates by 5 h, the time at which most of the hCG-β forms present in these complexes have been converted into pβ2 and before there is any evidence of intracellular degradation of hCG-β (17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11851-11859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, the kinetic precursor-product relationship between the disappearance of the C1 and C2 complexes and the appearance of the pβ2 folding intermediate as well as the inability to detect these complexes in the culture medium even after 24 h indicates that the C1 and C2 complexes were dissociated and suggests that association of hCG-β with chaperones is a transient step in the folding pathway of unglycosylated hCG-β subunits. The two secreted β peaks seen in Fig. 6 represent pβ2-like, folded forms that appear to differ in the amount of alkylation by iodoacetate. 2Feng, W. J., Bedows, E., and Ruddon, R. W. unpublished observation. The data presented here extend a previous observation that hCG-β subunits lacking both N-linked oligosaccharides form tight complexes with ER chaperones (17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11851-11859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and further demonstrate that WT β and β subunits lacking only one of the two N-linked chains form similar complexes that include the ER chaperone BiP. The amount of the C1 and C2 complexes containing monoglycosylated β and chaperones were intermediate between wild type β and unglycosylated β and appeared to be related to the rate at which these mutant β forms fold in transfected CHO cells. The mutant lacking both N-linked glycans has the slowest t1/2 of folding (33 min) and the highest amount of C1 and C2 hCG-β-containing complexes (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). These data raise the question whether the amount of β-chaperone complexes is related to the rate of folding or to the lack of N-linked glycans, which may simply allow for the availability of more hydrophobic sites to bind the chaperones. To test this, other slow folding or nonfolding mutants of β were examined for the amount of β-chaperone complexes formed in β gene-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 4). The data indicate that the cysteine mutants β C38A/C57A and β C9A/C90A, which do not fold to form pβ2, do not form detectable, stable β-chaperone complexes (Fig. 4). Table I summarizes the relationship of the rate of hCG-β folding (pβ1→pβ2), the relative amount of hCG-β contained in the C1 and C2 complexes, and the relative amount of BiP present in the C1 and C2 complexes. These results indicate that the rate or extent of β folding determines the amount of stable binding of hCG-β to chaperones. Although the chaperone primarily probed for in the complexes formed by the various β forms was BiP (Fig. 5), it is likely that other ER chaperones including ERp72 and ERp94 are also present in the C1 and C2 β-chaperone complexes formed with WT β and the P73G mutant because these complexes separate by HPLC with elution times identical to those containing these chaperones and unglycosylated β (data not shown).Table I.Relationship of rate of hCG-β folding, amount of C1 and C2 complex, and presence of BiPCell linet1/2 of pβ1 → pβ2 conversionRelative amount of C1 + C2 presentBiP association in C1 complexminCHO β WT5–7++CHO β Asn 17–8+++CHO β Asn 210++++CHO β Asn(1+2)33+++++CHO β P73G13+++aBiP was detected on a Western blot similar to that shown in Fig. 5.CHO β C23A/C72A15–20+/−NDCHO β C38A/C57A−bConversion of pβ1 → pβ2 does not occur in these hCG-β mutants (18, 19).−−CHO β C9A/C90A−bConversion of pβ1 → pβ2 does not occur in these hCG-β mutants (18, 19).−−a BiP was detected on a Western blot similar to that shown in Fig. 5.b Conversion of pβ1 → pβ2 does not occur in these hCG-β mutants (18Bedows E.

Open table in a new tab The C1 and C2 β-chaperone complexes are not just dead-end complexes leading to β degradation because these disappear as pβ1 is converted into pβ2 (Fig. 1) at a time when total recovery of β does not change and no β degradation products are detected (17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11851-11859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unglycosylated β does fold efficiently, though more slowly than wild type, into a mature, secretable form (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Interestingly, the C1 and C2 unglycosylated β-chaperone complexes survive treatment with 0.1% SDS (during the CHO cell lysis procedure) and 6 M guanidine (during the elution step of immunoconjugates from protein A-Sepharose beads) and boiling in 1% SDS prior to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the C1 and C2 β-chaperone complexes are covalently linked forms. This was demonstrated by the fact that these complexes were only dissociated by reduction (Fig. 5), suggesting that intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed between unfolded β and ER chaperones or that lattices of β oligomers are formed by intermolecular disulfide bonds, thus trapping chaperones in these lattices. There is precedent for the formation of such intermolecular disulfide bond-linked hCG-β oligomers being formed by unfolded or incompletely folded forms of β. For example, we have previously shown that cysteine-mutant forms of hCG-β C34A/C88A, C38A/C57A, and C9A/C90A, which do not fold into pβ2, form such oligomers (19Bedows E. Norton S.E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10574-10580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fact that these mutants do not form detectable C1 and C2 complexes does not support the lattice hypothesis but rather supports the idea that intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed between hCG-β and chaperones. Wild type hCG-β also forms a BiP-containing complex (Fig. 5A), suggesting that these tight complexes are involved in the folding pathway of WT β as well. It is not clear why the C23A/C72A mutant forms only a small amount of stable C1 and C2 complexes because this mutant also folds, albeit incompletely, to form pβ2. It may be that the cysteines at positions 23 and 72 are involved in the intermolecular disulfide bonds formed between β and the chaperones or that this mutant has a conformation that does not favor stable interaction with chaperones. The mutants that do not fold from pβ1 to pβ2 (C38A/C57A and C9A/C90A) most likely do not form stable C1 and C2 complexes because these mutant β forms do not achieve a conformation that allows stable binding to chaperones, which may relate to the fact that they do not progress down the folding pathway. When protein folding occurs under suboptimal conditions, for example, when cellular ATP levels are depleted (21Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) or when BiP or protein disulfide isomerase are present in substoichiometric amounts in relation to substrate (22Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25889-25896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), disulfide-linked aggregates of substrates can occur. In some instances, these disulfide-cross-linked aggregates can be rescued by restoring more favorable folding conditions, e.g. by adding ATP (21Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A.

What we are proposing here is unique in that our data suggest that disulfide-linked substrate-chaperone complexes are normal intermediates in the folding of wild type proteins to their native structures. Finally, the possible differences between the C1 and C2 hCG-β-chaperone complexes should be noted. It is not clear why these two complexes migrate differently on reversed-phase HPLC because they both contain hCG-β and the three chaperones BiP, ERp72, and ERp94 (17Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K.

There are some differences, however, between the C1 and C2 complexes. For example, the high molecular weight bands seen by SDS-PAGE are somewhat different between the two fractions (Fig. 5, B-E), suggesting that the array of chaperones or other binding proteins present in the two complexes may differ. Thus, it will be interesting to determine if there is a precursor-product relationship between the hCG-β forms contained in the two complexes and whether the different chaperones contained in the C1 and C2 complexes act at different steps in the folding pathway.

The enzyme reduces the α,β carbon-carbon double bond of nonactivated 2-enoates and in a reversible way that of 2-enals at the expense of NADH or reduced methyl viologen. UV-visible and EPR potentiometric titrations detect a semiquinone species in redox intermediate states characterized by an isotropic EPR signal at g = 2.0 without contribution at 580 nm. EPR redox titration shows two widely spread mid-point redox potentials (−190 and −350 mV at pH 7.0), and a nearly stoichiometric amount of this species is detected. The data suggest the semiquinone radical has an anionic nature. In the reduced form, the [Fe-S] moiety is characterized by a single rhombic EPR spectrum, observed in a wide range of temperatures (4.2-60 K) with g values at 2.013, 1.943, and 1.860 (−180 mV at pH 7.0). The gmax value is low when compared with what has been reported for other iron-sulfur clusters. Mössbauer studies reveal the presence of a [4Fe-4S]+2/+1 center. One of the subcomponents of the spectrum shows an unusually large value of quadrupole splitting (ferrous character) in both the oxidized and reduced states. Substrate binding to the reduced enzyme induces subtle changes in the spectroscopic Mössbauer parameters. The Mössbauer data together with known kinetic information suggest the involvement of this iron-sulfur center in the enzyme mechanism.
