LIMK1 is activated by the small GTPase Rho and its downstream protein kinase ROCK. We now report the site of phosphorylation of LIMK1 by ROCK. In vitro kinase reaction revealed that the active forms of ROCK phosphorylated LIMK1 on the threonine residue and markedly increased its cofilin-phosphorylating activity. A LIMK1 mutant (T508A) with replacement of Thr-508 within the activation loop of the kinase domain by alanine was neither phosphorylated nor activated by ROCK. Replacement of Thr-508 by serine changed the ROCK-catalyzed phosphorylation residue from threonine to serine. A LIMK1 mutant with replacement of Thr-508 by two glutamates increased the kinase activity about 2-fold but was not further activated by ROCK. In addition, wild-type LIMK1, but not its T508A mutant, was activated by co-expression with ROCK in cultured cells. These results suggest that ROCK activates LIMK1 in vitroand in vivo by phosphorylation at Thr-508. Together with the recent finding that PAK1, a downstream effector of Rac, also activates LIMK1 by phosphorylation at Thr-508, these results suggest that activation of LIMK1 is one of the common targets for Rho and Rac to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton.

Rosenblatt J. Mitchison T.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Various extracellular stimuli induce changes in actin organization, but little is known about signaling pathways which link the external stimuli to the machinery controlling actin polymerization and organization. Cofilin can bind to and depolymerize actin filaments and is considered to be a potent regulator of actin filament dynamics (2.Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 3.Bamburg J.R. McGough A. Ono S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 364-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The actin-binding and -depolymerizing activity of cofilin is inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser-3 (4.Agnew B.J. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17582-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We and other investigators recently provided evidence that LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK1)1 and LIM-kinase 2 (LIMK2) phosphorylate cofilin in vitro and in vivo specifically at Ser-3 and are involved in the actin-filament dynamics by phosphorylating and inactivating cofilin (5.Arber S.

Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). LIMK1 and LIMK2 are members of a novel subfamily of protein serine/threonine kinases with characteristic structural features composed of two LIM domains and a PDZ domain at the N terminus and a protein kinase domain at the C terminus (7.Mizuno K.

We and other workers also showed that LIM-kinases are activated in cultured cells by Rho family small GTPases, Rac and Rho, albeit the activation being indirect (5.Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H.

Science. 1999; 258: 895-898Crossref Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The Rho family small GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, play a central role in regulating actin reorganization through downstream effectors, the activities of which are controlled by interactions with active GTP-bound forms of the Rho family (13.Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Rho-associated kinases, termed ROCK, ROK, or Rho-kinase, are serine/threonine kinases implicated in Rho-mediated actin reorganization, such as formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions and smooth muscle contraction (15.Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K.

Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). These kinases lead to the increase in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and thereby induce actomyosin-based contractility (18.Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). Other candidate substrates for Rho-associated kinases, such as Na-H exchanger, NHE1, and adducin, were also reported (19.Tominaga T. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Barber D.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 20.Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Kinoshita N. Kawano Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We recently found that cofilin was phosphorylated in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells during lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced, Rho-mediated neurite retraction (12.Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 258: 895-898Crossref Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation was mediated by ROCK and ROCK-catalyzed activation of LIM-kinases (12.Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 258: 895-898Crossref Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). However, the site of phosphorylation in LIM-kinases required for activation by ROCK remained to be identified. Using site-directed mutants of LIMK1, we have now obtained evidence that LIMK1 is activated by ROCK by phosphorylation at Thr-508 within the activation loop of the kinase domain. Expression plasmids coding for LIMK1 and its kinase-negative mutant (D460A) were constructed in the pUcD2SRα vector (6.Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Plasmids for Myc-tagged ROCK, and its mutants were constructed in the pCAG vector (21.Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Plasmids coding for T508A and T508EE mutants of LIMK1, in which Thr-508 was replaced by Ala and two Glu residues, respectively, were constructed by PCR amplification of the cDNA fragments, using 5′ primers 5′-AGAAGCGCTACGCCGTGGTGGGCAACCCCTAC-3′ and 5′-AGAAGCGCTACGAAGAAGTGGTGGGCAACCCCTAC-3′, respectively, and the 3′ primer 5′-TCCCGCGGAGGAATCTGG-3′, and ligation into theAor51HI and SphI sites of pUcD2SRα-LIMK1. The plasmid coding for the C-terminal protein kinase fragment of LIMK1 (PK, amino acid residues 322–647) was constructed in pUcD2SRα by PCR amplification of the cDNA fragment, using primers 5′-GCCTCGAGTCTAGACCACCATGGAGTCCCTCCGCGTAGTCTGC-3′ and 5′-CGCCCGATGATCTCGCA-3′ (AS-5), and ligation into the XhoI and Aor51HI sites of pUcD2SRα-LIMK1. The plasmid pET-GST coding for glutathione S-transferase (GST) was constructed by PCR amplification of GST cDNA and subcloning into pET17b vector (Novagen). The plasmid coding for GST-PK, GST fused with the kinase domain of LIMK1, was constructed by PCR amplification, using primers 5′-CTGGATCCCTCCGCGTAGTCTGCC-3′ and AS-5, and ligation into theBamHI and Aor51HI sites of pBluescript-LIMK1(XhoI-EcoRI) coding for nucleotides 856–3103 of LIMK1 cDNA. The resulting plasmid was cut with BamHI and NotI, and the insert was subcloned into BamHI and NotI sites of pET-GST. Plasmids coding for T508A and T508S mutants of GST-PK were constructed as in the case of plasmids for Thr-508 mutants of pUcD2SRα-LIMK1. The authenticity of plasmids was verified by nucleotide sequencing. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with plasmids coding for LIMK1, ROCK, or their mutants by DAC30 liposome (Eurogentec) or the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After 36–48 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in the lysis/kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and incubated on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation, supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1 h, centrifuged to remove debris, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with C-10 anti-LIMK1 antibody (10.Okano I. Hiraoka J. Otera H. Nunoue K. Ohashi K. Iwashita S. Hirai M. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31321-31330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) or 9E10 anti-Myc epitope monoclonal antibody (Roche Diagnostics) and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the lysis/kinase buffer containing 300 mmNaCl and twice with the lysis/kinase buffer. LIMK1 or its mutants were eluted with the lysis/kinase buffer containing 30 μg/ml C-10 peptide and used for the in vitro kinase reaction. The immunoprecipitates of ROCK or its mutants were used for reaction with LIMK1. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (22.Nagata K. Ohashi K. Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 99-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were eluted with the lysis/kinase buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. LIMK1 or its mutants, eluted with the lysis/kinase buffer, were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with anti-Myc (9E10) immunoprecipitates from COS-7 cell lysates transfected with pCAG vector (mock) or plasmids coding for ROCK or ROCK mutants, in 20 μl of the lysis/kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In experiments for phosphoamino acid analysis, reaction was carried out in buffer containing 10 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After centrifugation, the supernatants were added to an equal volume of lysis/kinase buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml cofilin and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. The reaction mixture was suspended in Laemmli's sample buffer, and aliquots were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), using 15% and 9% gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad). The membrane from a 15% gel was analyzed by autoradiography to measure32P-labeled cofilin, using the BAS1000 Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji Film), and Amido Black staining. The membrane from a 9% gel was analyzed by immunoblotting with C-10 anti-LIMK1 antibody, as described previously (22.Nagata K. Ohashi K. Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 99-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase activity was normalized by dividing the radioactivity incorporated into cofilin by the immunoreactive density of LIMK1 estimated by densitometer. For detection of ROCK and its mutants, 9E10 immunoprecipitates were suspended in Laemmli's sample buffer, run on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with 9E10 antibody. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (23.Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The membrane containing the32P-labeled protein was cut and incubated with 6n HCl at 105 °C for 2 h. Hydrolysates were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography by comparing with the positions of internal phosphoamino acid standards stained with ninhydrin. N1E-115 cells were serum-starved for 18 h, and incubated first for 30 min with or without 10 μm Y-27632, a specific inhibitor for ROCK (17.Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar), and then for 4 min with or without 10 μm LPA. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with the lysis/kinase buffer and then LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated with C-10 antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase reaction, as described above. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids for N-terminally hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged LIMK1 or its mutants in pUcD2SRα vector, and plasmids for Myc-tagged ROCKΔ3 in pCAG vector or pCAG vector alone. After 36 h, cells were lysed and LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics) and subjected to in vitro kinase reaction, as described above. To examine the mechanism of ROCK-induced LIMK1 activation, wild-type LIMK1 and its C-terminal protein kinase fragment (PK) were incubated with ROCK derivatives, after which the kinase activity of LIMK1 was measured, using recombinant cofilin as a substrate (Fig.1). The cofilin-phosphorylating activity of LIMK1 was enhanced about 2–17-fold by preincubation with wild-type ROCK and its constitutively active mutants, ROCKΔ1 and ROCKΔ3. In contrast, preincubation with a kinase-negative mutant of ROCK (KD-IA) (21.Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) had no apparent effect on the kinase activity of LIMK1, indicating that LIMK1 is activated by ROCK as the result of phosphorylation. The kinase activity of the C-terminal PK fragment of LIMK1 was also increased about 6-fold by preincubation with ROCKΔ3. Thus ROCK seems to activate LIMK1 by phosphorylating the C-terminal PK domain of LIMK1. To determine the residue(s) of ROCK-catalyzed phophorylation of LIMK1, wild-type LIMK1 and its kinase-negative mutant, LIMK1(D460A), in which Asp-460 was replaced by alanine (6.Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar), were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of ROCKΔ3 (Fig.2 A). In the absence of ROCKΔ3, wild-type LIMK1 but not LIMK1(D460A) was radiolabeled, indicating that wild-type LIMK1 underwent autophosphorylation. Phosphoamino acid analysis of 32P-labeled LIMK1 revealed that LIMK1 autophosphorylated primarily on serine and tyrosine residues (Fig. 2 B). When LIMK1 and LIMK1(D460A) were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of ROCKΔ3, both were radiolabeled (Fig. 2 A). Phosphoamino acid analyses revealed that wild-type LIMK1 was phosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, while LIMK1(D460A) was phosphorylated primarily on the threonine residue (Fig. 2 B). The appearance of phosphothreonine in LIMK1 and LIMK1(D460A), only after incubation with ROCKΔ3, indicates that ROCKΔ3 phosphorylates LIMK1 primarily on the threonine residue. The short sequence between the conserved DFG motif in subdomain VII and the PE motif in subdomain VIII of protein kinase domains is referred to as the “activation loop” (24.Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Various protein kinases are activated by phosphorylation of serine/threonine/tyrosine residue(s) within this region (24.Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Human LIMK1 contains two threonine residues, Thr-490 and Thr-508, within the activation loop (7.Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1605-1612PubMed Google Scholar), of which only Thr-508 is conserved among species; Thr-490 is replaced by glycine and asparagine in rat and mouse LIMK1, respectively (9.Bernard O. Ganiatsas S. Kannourakis G. Dringen R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1159-1171PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Nunoue K. Ohashi K. Okano I. Mizuno K. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 701-710PubMed Google Scholar). Thus we considered that Thr-508 may be the site of phosphorylation for LIMK1 activation. To test this, we constructed LIMK1(T508A), a LIMK1 mutant with replacement of Thr-508 by alanine (Fig. 3 A). LIMK1(T508A), when incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, autophosphorylated on serine and tyrosine residues (Fig. 3 B), in a manner similar to wild-type LIMK1 (Fig. 2 B), which means that the T508A mutant retained autophosphorylation activity. On the other hand, when LIMK1(T508A) was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of ROCKΔ3, there was no increase in threonine phosphorylation by ROCKΔ3, which is in contrast to the case of wild-type LIMK1 (compare Fig. 3 B with Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that Thr-508 is the site of phosphorylation of LIMK1 by ROCK. To further confirm the site of phosphorylation, a GST fusion protein with the kinase domain of LIMK1 (GST-PK) and its mutants with replacement of Thr-508 by alanine (GST-PK-T508A) or serine (GST-PK-T508S) were constructed. GST-PK expressed in E. colihad only faint autophosphorylation activity (data not shown). When GST fusion proteins were incubated with ROCKΔ3, wild-type GST-PK and its T508S mutant, but not the T508A mutant, were phosphorylated (Fig.3 C). Phosphoamino acid analyses revealed that GST-PK was phosphorylated on threonine, but its T508S mutant was phosphorylated on serine. Taken together these results suggest that ROCKΔ3 phosphorylates LIMK1 specifically at Thr-508. To further examine the role of ROCK-catalyzed Thr-508 phosphorylation for the kinase activity of LIMK1, we measured changes in kinase activity of LIMK1 and its derivatives, with or without ROCKΔ3 treatment (Fig.4). Wild-type LIMK1 was activated by treatment with ROCKΔ3, while LIMK1(D460A) had no kinase activity even after treatment with ROCKΔ3. LIMK1(T508A), in the absence of ROCKΔ3, exhibited cofilin-phosphorylating activity to the level similar to that of wild-type LIMK1, but in contrast to wild-type LIMK1, the kinase activity of LIMK1(T508A) was not enhanced by treatment with ROCKΔ3. We also constructed the LIMK1(T508EE) mutant, in which Thr-508 of LIMK1 was replaced by two glutamate residues. As reported (25.Edwards D.C. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), LIMK1(T508EE) had about a 2-fold higher kinase activity, compared with the wild-type LIMK1, probably because two glutamate residues partially mimic the phosphorylated state of Thr-508. On the other hand, the kinase activity of this mutant was not increased by incubation with ROCKΔ3. These observations suggest that ROCK specifically phosphorylates LIMK1 at Thr-508 and this phosphorylation is responsible for the activation of LIMK1. We then investigated whether LIMK1 is activated by ROCK-catalyzed phosphorylation at Thr-508in vivo. We previously reported that LPA induces cofilin phosphorylation through ROCK activation in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (12.Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 258: 895-898Crossref Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined if LIMK1 is activated by LPA. As shown in Fig.5A, endogenous LIMK1 in N1E-115 cells was activated by LPA stimulation within 4 min, and this activation was blocked by exposure of the cells to Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK. These findings indicate that activation of LIMK1 in response to LPA is mediated by ROCK in vivo. We further examined whether active ROCK would induce activation of LIMK1 by Thr-508 phosphorylationin vivo (Fig. 5 B). Expression of LIMK1 with ROCKΔ3 in COS cells resulted in a marked increase in the kinase activity of LIMK1, as reported previously (12.Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 258: 895-898Crossref Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). In contrast, the kinase activity of the T508A mutant of LIMK1 was not increased by co-expression with ROCKΔ3. These results strongly suggest that ROCK activates LIMK1 in cultured cells by phosphorylation of LIMK1 at Thr-508. The Rho family small GTPases, Rho, Rac and Cdc42, regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization (13.Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Each member of the Rho family induces distinct patterns of actin organization. In fibroblasts, Rho induces the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas Rac and Cdc42 induce the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively (14.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). In neuronal cell lines, Rho induces neurite retraction and cell rounding, while Rac induces cell spreading and formation of neurite-like extensions (26.Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 27.Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kraneburg O.W. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of Rho and Rac often produces opposite phenotypes and they antagonize each other. Rho-associated kinase, ROCK, functions as one of the downstream effectors of Rho to increase MLC phosphorylation by phosphorylating and inhibiting MLC phosphatase, which results in increase in actomyosin-based contractility (18.Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). In contrast, PAK1, a downstream effector of Rac, was recently found to phosphorylate and inhibit MLC-kinase, which leads to the decrease in MLC phosphorylation and to loss of actomyosin-based contractility, an event opposite that induced by Rho activation (28.Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the extent of MLC phosphorylation oppositely regulated by ROCK and PAK1 importantly contributes to the opposing phenotypes induced by Rho and Rac and to the mutual interference between them. LIMK1 phosphorylates cofilin specifically at Ser-3. As the actin-depolymerizing activity of cofilin is inhibited by this phosphorylation, activation of LIMK1 leads to suppression of actin depolymerization and thereby to accumulation and stabilization of assembled actin filaments. LIMK1 is activated downstream of Rho and Rac. In the present study we obtained evidence that ROCK activates LIMK1 in vitro and in vivo by phosphorylation at Thr-508. Edwards et al. (29.Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) recently showed that PAK1 activates LIMK1 by phosphorylation at the same Thr-508 residue. Thus, in contrast to the MLC phosphorylation, Rho-ROCK and Rac-PAK1 pathways commonly activate LIMK1 through the same mechanism involved in Thr-508 phosphorylation, which converges the signals from Rho and Rac to increase in cofilin phosphorylation and stabilization of actin filaments (Fig. 6). Taken together, we suggest that Rho and Rac induce distinct patterns of actin reorganization by orchestrating several pathways, including the pathway which commonly activates LIM-kinases for actin filament stabilization, the pathway that oppositely regulates MLC phosphorylation and actomyosin-based contractility, and others (Fig. 6). To further elucidate the roles of LIMK1 in Rho-ROCK- and Rac-PAK-mediated actin remodeling, the nonphosphorylatable T508A mutant and the constitutively active T508EE mutant of LIMK1 will be useful. In this study we show that LIMK1 autophosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues. TESK1, a protein kinase containing the kinase domain related to that of LIM-kinases, phosphorylates both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues in its sequence and in exogenous substrates (30.Toshima J. Tanaka T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12171-12176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that LIMK/TESK family kinases are dual specificity kinases and LIM-kinases may have a cellular function to phosphorylate tyrosine residues of unknown targets other than cofilin. Since the T508A mutant of LIMK1 has autophosphorylation activity to an extent similar to the wild-type LIMK1, phosphorylation of Thr-508 is not a prerequisite for the autophosphorylation of LIMK1. Identification of sites of autophosphorylation will be important to further elucidate mechanisms by which the kinase activity of LIMK1 is regulated. We thank T. Amano, C. Ikebe, Dr. I.

We have recently obtained genetic evidence indicating that the high mobility group domain containing transcription factor Sox9 is required for cartilage formation and for expression of chondrocyte-specific genes including the gene for type II collagen (Col2a1). We show here that IL-1 and TNF-α cause a marked and rapid decrease in the levels ofSox9 mRNA and/or protein in chondrocytes. A role for the transcription factor NFκB in Sox9 down-regulation was suggested by the ability of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor of the NFκB pathway, to block the effects of IL-1 and TNF-α. This role was further supported by the ability of a dominant-negative mutant of IκBα to block the IL-1 and TNF-α inhibition of Sox9-dependent Col2a1 enhancer elements. Furthermore, forced expression of the NFκB subunits p65 or p50 also inhibited Sox9-dependent Col2a1 enhancer. Because Sox9 is essential for chondrogenesis, the marked down-regulation of the Sox9 gene by IL-1 and TNF-α in chondrocytes is sufficient to account for the inhibition of the chondrocyte phenotype by these cytokines.

The disease is thought to be due to SOX9 haploinsufficiency, i.e. 50% of SOX9 being insufficient to fulfill the physiological function of SOX9. Recent work from our laboratory based on mouse embryo chimeras derived from Sox9homozygous mutant embryonic stem cells obtained by gene targeting has demonstrated that Sox9 is a master regulatory factor for chondrocyte differentiation. Indeed, in these mouse embryo chimeras,Sox9 −/− mutant cells were blocked in their differentiation to become chondrocytes and persisted as mesenchymal cells; these cells were unable to express the genes for chondrocyte-specific markers such as collagen types II, IX, and XI and aggrecan (Col2a1, Col11a2, Col9a2, andaggrecan). In addition, no cartilages were formed in teratomas derived from Sox9 homozygous mutant embryonic stem cells, although the other types of tissues normally present in these tumors were formed (12.Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). SOX9 binds to and activates chondrocyte-specific enhancer elements in the Col2a1 andCol11a2 genes and ectopic expression of SOX9 in transgenic mice activates the endogenous Col2a1 gene, providing evidence that these genes are direct targets for Sox9 (13.Lefebvre V.

Binding of IL-1 and TNF-α to their receptors activates several signaling pathways, including the NFκB and AP-1 pathways. While IL-1 and TNF-α signals that lead to AP-1 activation have been implicated in the up-regulation of metalloproteinase genes (30.Brenner D.A. O'Hara M. Angel P. Chojkier M. Karin M.

The activity of aCol2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer, which is dependent on an intact SOX9-binding site, was also strongly inhibited by these cytokines. We present evidence that these effects are both mediated by the NFκB pathway. We hypothesize that in inflammatory joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, a major mechanism by which IL-1 and TNF-α inhibit the chondrocyte phenotype is by down-regulation ofSox9, a master cartilage regulatory gene.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant human IL-1β was obtained from the National Cancer Institute.

Mouse costal chondrocytes were obtained from 1–5-day-old mice and cultured as described previously (34.Lefebvre V. Garofalo S. Zhou G. Metsäranta M. Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).RNA Preparation and Northern AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was extracted from cultures with the modified guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (35.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar) using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Aliquots of 10 or 20 μg of RNA/lane were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 0.22 mformaldehyde, transferred onto nylon filters (Zeta-Probe GT, Bio-Rad) by capillary blotting, and cross-linked to the filters by exposure to ultraviolet light. The filters were prehybridized for 20 min in hybridization solution containing 0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 7% SDS. The Sox9 and Col2a1probes were as described previously (13.Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell.

These probes were radiolabeled by random primer method using Klenow fragment (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) as described by Feinberg and Vogelstein (37.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16567) Google Scholar) to a specific activity greater than 108 cpm/μg DNA. Hybridization was performed in hybridization solution supplemented with 1 × 106cpm/ml of denatured 32P-labeled probe for 16 h at 65 °C. Filters were washed in 2× SSC (1× SSC: 150 mmNaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min, followed by 20 min of washing in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The filters were subjected to autoradiography using x-ray films (Fuji Photo Film Co., Minamiashigara, Japan) and intensifying screens (DuPont) at −80 °C. Hybridization signals were quantified by scanning densitometry (Intelligent Quantifier, Bio Image Systems Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Col2a1 and Sox9 mRNA levels were corrected for RNA loading by normalization with 18 S rRNA levels.Western Blot AnalysisMouse primary chondrocytes were cultured as indicated in figure legends. Total cell lysates were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (38.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar), and 40 μg of each sample was separated by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar).

Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5867) Google Scholar). The filters were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with antibodies against p50 (H-119, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p65 (Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA), IκBα (H-4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or SOX9. The SOX9 antibody was as described previously (13.Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h, and the signal was detected by autoradiography using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Transient TransfectionCol2a1-luciferase constructions harboring 12 tandem copies of the 18-bp and 4 tandem copies of the 48-bp enhancer elements were described previously (41.Lefebvre V.

Verma (Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA). Primary chondrocytes were transiently transfected using the FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1.7 μl of FuGene6 was mixed with a total of 600–750 ng of plasmid DNA in 50 μl of standard medium. The mixture was preincubated for 15 min and added to preestablished monolayers of 3 × 105cells/4-cm2 well. Cells were harvested after 44–48 h of transfection. Reporter plasmids and pSVβgal, pSV2βgal, and pGL3-Promoter (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), used as an internal control for transfection efficiency, were cotransfected in a 3:1 ratio. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described previously (41.Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter activities were corrected for transfection efficiency.DISCUSSIONIn our study, both IL-1 and TNF-α markedly decreased expression of Sox9 in chondrocytic cells. This inhibition was very likely transcriptional, since IL-1 had no effect on the half-life ofSox9 mRNA when mRNA synthesis initiation was blocked. Since the levels of Sox9 mRNA returned to normal levels after IL-1 withdrawal (data not shown), it is likely that the IL-1 inhibition of Sox9 expression was not due to nonspecific effects. The cytokine-mediated decrease inCol2a1 mRNA levels occurred more slowly, probably because the half-life of Col2a1 mRNA is longer than that of the Sox9 transcript. Since our recent genetic results have demonstrated that homozygous inactivation of the Sox9gene prevents chondrocyte differentiation and Col2a1expression (12.Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar), the marked IL-1 and TNF-α down-regulation ofSox9 should be sufficient to account for the inhibition ofCol2a1 expression by these cytokines.Other previous studies from our laboratory showed that SOX9 binds to a sequence essential for chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity within a 48-bp Col2a1 enhancer and a 18-bp subsegment of that enhancer (13.Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SOX9 also activated these enhancers in co-transfection experiments of nonchondrocytic cells, whereas a mutation that prevented SOX9 binding to these enhancers abolished their activity in chondrocytes. We, therefore, used the activity of these enhancers as a functional measurement of Sox9. Inhibition of these Col2a1enhancer elements by IL-1 and TNF-α in chondrocytic cells was very likely due to the marked decrease in Sox9 levels produced by these cytokines. In support of this hypothesis, we found that transfection of a SOX9-expressing plasmid in chondrocytes overcame the inhibitory effect of IL-1 on the activity of the 48- and 18-bp enhancers.Several lines of evidence strongly suggested that NFκB mediates the IL-1/TNF-α down-regulation of Sox9. First, addition of PDTC, an inhibitor of IκB degradation, blocked IL-1 and TNF-α inhibition of Sox9 expression. This inhibitor also blocked the effects of IL-1 and TNF-α on the Sox9-dependent 48-bpCol2a1 enhancer (data not shown). Second, expression of a dominant-negative IκBα mutant abolished the IL-1 and TNF-α inhibition of both the 48- and 18-bp SOX9-dependent cartilage-specific Col2a1 enhancers. Finally, forced expression of the p50 and p65 NFκB subunits mimicked the IL-1 inhibition of the enhancer. Interestingly, the expression of the dominant-negative IκBα mutant increased the activity of the chondrocyte-specific enhancer in the absence of IL-1. One possible explanation for this increase might be that the dominant-negative IκBα mutant inhibited endogenous NFκB activity.The precise mechanism whereby NFκB inhibits Sox9expression remains to be elucidated. One possible mechanism is that NFκB binds to regulatory sequences of the Sox9 gene. This possibility is suggested by the role of Drosophila homolog of NFκB, Dorsal, in repressing zen, dpp, andtolloid by binding to κB-like motifs in the regulatory sequences in these genes (58.Ip Y.T. Kraut R. Levine M. Rushlow C.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 439-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 59.Kirov N. Childs S. O'Connor M. Rushlow C. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, in the developing chick limb bud, c-Rel, another subunit of the NFκB family, inhibits expression of the gene for BMP-4, a vertebrate homolog of dpp, indicating the conservation of this pathway in vertebrates (61.Bushdid P.B.

Alternatively, activation of NFκB could lead to the expression of a repressor for the Sox9 gene or the activation of such a repressor. The identification and detailed analysis of Sox9regulatory elements should help clarify the mechanism ofSox9 inhibition by IL-1 and TNF-α.IL-1 and TNF-α inhibit expression of a number of other genes encoding chondrocyte-specific matrix molecules including collagen types IX and XI and aggrecan (16.Goldring M.B.

The pronounced inhibition of Sox9by these cytokines, together with our recent observation that in mouse chimeric embryos Sox9 null cells are unable to express these markers, strongly suggest that down-regulation of Sox9 is sufficient to account for the inhibition of expression of these genes. Given that IL-1 and TNF-α are present at elevated levels in arthritic joints (20.Fontana A. Hengartner H. Weber E. Fehr K. Grob P.J. Cohen G. Rheumatol. Int. 1982; 2: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 21.Wood D.D. Ihrie E.J. Dinarello C.A. Cohen P.L.

Cell Immunol. 1989; 122: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the inhibition of expression of the master regulatory Sox9 gene could account for the poor healing capacity of cartilage in arthritis.IL-1 and TNF-α also activate other cellular pathways distinct from the NFκB pathway that can result in changes in expression or activity of transcription factors (30.Brenner D.A. O'Hara M. Angel P. Chojkier M. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 337: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 31.Conca W. Kaplan P.B. Krane S.M. J. Clin.

This notion is illustrated by the following results. The activity of a construct containing a 309-bpCol2a1 promoter and two tandem copies of a 231-bpCol2a1 enhancer that includes the 48-bp enhancer is chondrocyte-specific and dependent on SOX9; indeed, a 10-bp deletion in this 231-bp element that removed the SOX9 binding site resulted in loss of activity of this enhancer (13.Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although IL-1 strongly inhibited the activity of this enhancer construct, this down-regulation was only partially overcome by cotransfection with a SOX9-expressing vector. In addition, coexpression of a dominant-negative IκBα mutant did not block the down-regulation of this promoter-enhancer construct (data not shown). Thus, in addition to their inhibition of Sox9, both IL-1 and TNF-α may affect the expression or activity of other transcription factors controlling the activity of the construct containing this 231-bp enhancer by mechanisms that are independent of the NFκB pathway. However, because Sox9 is completely required for expression of Col2a1 and other chondrocyte marker genes, the almost complete down-regulation of its expression by cytokines is sufficient to account for the IL-1 and TNF-α inhibition of the chondrocyte phenotype.Although IL-1 and TNF-α are not thought to have major roles in skeletal development, since mice deficient in IL-1β, TNF-α, or their receptors did not show any skeletal phenotype (62.Rothe J.

Recent reports demonstrated a role for c-rel in chick limb bud development as regulator of the expression ofBMP-4, Sonic Hedgehog, and twist (61.Bushdid P.B. Brantley D.M. Yull F.E. Blaeuer G.L. Hoffman L.H. Niswander L. Kerr L.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar,67.Kanegae Y. Tavares A.T. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Since expression of c-rel appears to be inhibited prior to cartilage formation, it is possible that the NFκB pathway is involved in the control of the Sox9 gene during embryonic development.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that IL-1 and TNF-α markedly down-regulate the gene for Sox9, a factor that is required for chondrocyte differentiation, and also inhibit the activity of Sox9-dependent Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer elements in chondrocytes. Furthermore, our results strongly suggest that inhibition of Sox9 is mediated by the NFκB pathway. Down-regulation of Sox9 should be a major mechanism by which expression of Col2a1 and other chondrocyte-specific genes is inhibited by IL-1 and TNF-α. Further studies on the role of the NFκB pathway in regulating Sox9 may provide insights into the mechanisms of cartilage degeneration in arthritis. Cartilage is a highly specialized connective tissue with distinct biochemical and biomechanical properties. Its extracellular matrix is composed of a series of proteins such as collagen types II, IX, and XI; link protein; and aggrecan. The coordinated regulation of the genes for these proteins is likely to be essential for normal skeletal development and maintenance of cartilage in postnatal life, as mutations in these molecules lead to chondrodysplasias and degenerative joint diseases (1.Spranger J.

Germ line missense mutations at one of six codons specifying extracytoplasmic cysteines are responsible for two related cancer disorders as follows: multiple endocrine neoplasia type2A (MEN2A) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). MEN2A and FMTC mutations result in a constitutive catalytic activity and as a consequence convert RET into a dominantly acting transforming gene. Although it has been shown that RET-MEN2 mutants activate several transduction pathways, their respective contribution to the neoplastic phenotype remains poorly understood. Over the past few years, it has become increasingly clear that the transforming ability of several viral and cellular oncoproteins depends on their capacity to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We now report that RET carrying a representative MEN2A mutation at Cys-634 (termed RET-MEN2A) activates PI3K and its downstream effector, the serine/threonine kinase AKT/protein kinase B. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutation of Tyr-1062, which is the intracellular docking site for Shc and Enigma on RET, abolishes the RET-MEN2A transforming activity. We provide evidence that mutation of Tyr-1062 abrogates the binding of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to RET-MEN2A and the subsequent stimulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Furthermore, infection of rat fibroblasts with a retrovirus expressing a dominant-interfering form of PI3K suppresses RET-MEN2A-dependent transformation, whereas overexpression of AKT enhances the RET-MEN2A oncogenic potential. In summary, these data are consistent with the notion that RET-mediated cell-transforming effect is critically dependent on the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.

Buma Y. Iwamoto T. Inaguma Y. Ideka H. Hiai H. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 571-578PubMed Google Scholar). RET is a component of a multiprotein complex that acts as a receptor for four closely related molecules, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF),1 neurturin, artemin, and persephin (see Ref. 2.Airaskinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar for review). In addition to RET, this complex contains glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptors called GFRαs that directly interact with the different ligands and induce homodimerization of RET, thereby leading to the activation of the tyrosine kinase (2.Airaskinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). To date, four homologous GFRαs have been identified, and the ligand specificity of the multisubunit receptor is dictated by the nature of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-bound protein since GFRα-1, -2, -3, and -4 exhibit a higher affinity for GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin, respectively (2.Airaskinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Gene knock out studies have revealed that null mice lacking either RET,GFRα-1, or GDNF die soon after birth and share strikingly analogous phenotypes including renal agenesis and absence of the enteric nervous system in the intestine (2.Airaskinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Evidence has been further provided that GDNF is both a neurotrophic and a urotrophic factor capable of both protecting enteric neurons from apoptotic cell death and promoting growth and branching of the ureteric bud, respectively (2.Airaskinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Germ line mutations of RET are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome that encompasses three related clinical subtypes, each typified by the involvement of a specific spectrum of endocrine tissues involved. MEN type 2A (MEN2A) is characterized by the association of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a malignant tumor arising from calcitonin-secreting C-cell, pheochromocytoma, and more occasionally parathyroid hyperplasia or adenoma. MEN type 2B (MEN2B) is a more rare and a more severe syndrome defined by the presence of MTC, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, hyperplasia of the enteric nervous plexuses, and skeletal abnormalities. Finally, in the familial form of MTC (FMTC), thyroid cancer is the sole clinical manifestation (see Ref.3.Ponder B.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1736-1741PubMed Google Scholar for review). Missense mutations at one of six cysteines codons (Cys-609, -611, -618, -620, -630, and -634), which result in the substitution of any one of these extracytoplasmic cysteines by a different amino acid, are responsible for the majority of MEN2A and a large fraction of FMTC cases (3.Ponder B.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1736-1741PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Donis-Keller H.

Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 276: 1575-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, FMTC and rare cases of MEN2A have been also ascribed to five mutations singly affecting amino acids within the tyrosine kinase domain (3.Ponder B.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1736-1741PubMed Google Scholar). MEN2B is exclusively caused by two distinct mutations involving residues located within the kinase catalytic domain and resulting in the replacement of either Ala-883 for a Phe or Met-918 for a Thr, the latter mutation being found the most frequently (3.Ponder B.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1736-1741PubMed Google Scholar). All MEN2 mutations tested so far have been shown to induce a ligand-independent constitutive activation of RET (7.Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell.

Taken together, these results demonstrate thatMEN2 mutations transform RET into a dominantly acting oncogene and suggest that the uncontrolled stimulation of signaling pathways downstream of RET accounts for its transforming ability. Upon RET activation, the autophosphorylated tyrosine residues Tyr-905, Tyr-1015, Tyr-1062, and Tyr-1096 act as docking sites for the transduction effectors Grb7/Grb10/Grb14, phospholipase Cγ, Shc/Enigma, and Grb2, respectively (15.Santoro M.

Furthermore, it is known that RET-MEN2 relays an intracellular signal by activating several signaling cascades including the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase and the Jun and Src kinases (25.van Weering D.

However, evidence that the sustained stimulation of these respective pathways contributes to the RET-MEN2 transforming capacity is still limited. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) are crucial transducers that control multiple biologic responses, such as mitogenesis, protection from programmed cell death, and cellular motility (reviewed in Refs. 30.Marte B. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar and31.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Class I of PI3K is a heterodimeric enzyme comprising a regulatory subunit of 85 kDa, p85, and a catalytic component of 110 kDa, p110. The p85 subunit contains two SH2 domains that can interact with phosphotyrosine. PI3K binds activated receptor tyrosine kinases either directly via the interaction of p85 to phosphorylated tyrosines or indirectly through the association of p85 with other transduction effectors possessing tyrosine docking sites, such as IRS-1, Gab-1, or c-Cbl (30.Marte B. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 31.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). The translocation of PI3K to the inner face of the plasma membrane locates the enzyme closer to upstream regulators (such as Ras) and recruits PI3K in proximity to its lipid substrates. Once activated, class I PI3Ks catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide on position 3 of the inositol ring and generate PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. These lipid products act as binding sites for transduction effectors, and this interaction regulates their subcellular localization and modulates their activity. The serine/threonine kinase protein kinase B/AKT has been identified as a crucial downstream effector that mediates the effects of PI3K on cell survival, cell proliferation, and on the response to insulin (32.Coffer P. Jin J. Woodgett J. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 33.Khwaja A. Nature. 1999; 401: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We now report that Rat1 cell line expressing an MEN2A form of RET displays a constitutive PI3K activity. Furthermore, mutation of Tyr-1062 blocked the RET-mediated activation of PI3K, and expression of a dominant-interfering mutant form of PI3K drastically reduced the transforming ability of RET-MEN2A. The construction of the pBabe Puro retroviral vectors containing the cDNAs coding for the human RET9 and RET9-MEN2A was described previously (34.Pasini A. Geneste O. Legrand P. Schlumberger M.

The USE Mutagenesis Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to introduce the mutations Y981F and Y1062F with the following primers: 5′-CTGCAGCGAGGAGATGTTCCGCCTGATGCTGCAATGCTG-3′ and 5′-GAAAACAAACTCTTTGGTAGAATTTCCCAT-3′. The vectors expressing Δp85 and HA epitope-tagged AKT were described previously (36.Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 37.Franke T. Yang S. Chan T. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D. Kaplan D. Tsichlis P. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). The cDNA coding for HA-AKT was subcloned in the pLXSN retroviral vector. Ecotropic retroviruses were obtained by transient transfection of the retroviral vectors into the BOSC 23 packaging cell line according to the protocol described by Pear et al. (38.Pear W. Nolan G. Scott M. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the supernatants were harvested and filtered on 0.45-μm pore size filters. The Rat1 fibroblast cell line and the human embryonic kidney epithelial Bosc 23 cell line were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. For retroviral infections, 2 × 106 cells were seeded on 100-mm culture plates. The following day, cells were incubated for 7 h with 1 × 106 infectious retroviral particles in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Forty-eight hours after infection, Rat1 cells were trypsinized and seeded at a dilution of 1:50 to 1:100 in complete medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Then, cells expressing LacZ, RET wt, or RET mutants were single cell-cloned. For the experiments with Δp85 and AKT, Rat1 cell clones expressing either LacZ, RET wt, or RET-MEN2A were infected with recombinant retrovirus carrying the neo selectable marker and expressing the genes of interest. Mass population of antibiotic-resistant cells was selected with 400 μg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 1 week of selection, G418-resistant cells were analyzed for protein expression and seeded in soft agar to assess their capacity to grow without anchorage. To inhibit PI3K activity with chemical compounds, cells were treated with wortmannin (100 nm), LY294002 (10 μm), or rapamycin (20 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. The polyclonal anti-RET serum used in this study was described previously (35.Rossel M. Pasini A. Chappuis S. Geneste O. Fournier L. Schuffenecker I. Takahashi M. Van Grunsven L. Urdiales J. Rudkin B. Lenoir G. Billaud M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody specific for antiphosphotyrosine (4G10) and the anti-p85 polyclonal antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Detection of the phosphorylated form of AKT was performed by immunoblotting using a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes AKT only when phosphorylated at Ser-473 (New England Biolabs). A control antibody that recognizes AKT (phosphorylation-state independent) was also used as a control (New England Biolabs). All these commercially available reagents were used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Phosphorylated FKHRL1 (39.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Juo P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar) was detected by Western blot analysis using antiphospho-specific antibodies that recognize FKHRL1 phosphorylated either on Thr-32 (diluted 1:500) or Ser-253 FKHRL1 (diluted 1:350). Western blot analysis using antibody FKHRL1 (diluted 1:500), which detects both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of FKHRL1, was used as a control (39.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Juo P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments were performed as described by Rossel et al. (35.Rossel M. Pasini A. Chappuis S. Geneste O. Fournier L. Schuffenecker I. Takahashi M. Van Grunsven L. Urdiales J. Rudkin B. Lenoir G. Billaud M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rat1 cell clones were directly lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmEDTA), supplemented with a mixture of proteases and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was estimated by a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Cleared cell lysates containing 400 μg of total cell proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 3 μg of GST p85/N-SH2 protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The GST protein complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer, and the beads then were resuspended in 25 μl of Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1.4 mm of β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μg of bromphenol blue per ml) and then fractionated on SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblots were incubated with the anti-RET polyclonal serum previously described (diluted 1/100), incubated with an anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and revealed by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The AKT catalytic activity was assayed by an in vitro immunokinase assay using histone 2B as a substrate. Comparable amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with the anti-AKT polyclonal serum (New England BioLabs). The kinase assay was essentially carried out according to Cheng et al. (40.Cheng J. Altomare D. Klein M. Lee W.-C. Kruh G. Lissy N. Testa J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2793-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, 10 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.4)) and then incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm cold ATP, and 20 μg of histone 2B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, samples were fractionated on 12% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore), and then autoradiographed at −80 °C. In vitro PI3K assays were performed as described previously (41.Mothe I. Tartare S. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Kaliman P. Van Obberghen E. Ballotti R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) except that cells at confluence were starved for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum. The transformed phenotype was assessed by the capacity of cells to grow without anchorage. Rat1 cells were trypsinized, and 2.5 × 103 cells were seeded into culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.3% agar. Colonies were scored 3 weeks after plating. Three RET isoforms containing 1114, 1106, and 1072 amino acids (referred as RET9, RET43, and RET51) that diverge in the carboxyl termini have been characterized (reviewed in Ref. 3.Ponder B.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1736-1741PubMed Google Scholar). Rat 1 fibroblasts were infected with recombinant ecotropic retroviruses expressing either the short RET isoform (RET9) or an MEN2A form of RET (RET9–634R) (Fig. 1 A), and individual clones of puromycin-resistant cells were isolated. Two representative clones, one expressing a high level and the other one a lower level of exogenous RET wild type (RET wt) or RET-MEN2A, were expanded and further analyzed (Fig. 1 B). Two RET species migrating at 150 and 170 kDa, which are known to correspond, respectively, to the incompletely glycosylated form present in the endoplasmic reticulum and to the fully glycosylated RET species (42.Taniguchi M. Iwamoto T. Hamaguchi M. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were detected in each cell clone (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with previous reports, RET-MEN2A was constitutively active and exhibited a clear increase of the phosphotyrosine content compared with the RET wt (Fig. 1 B, upper panel) (7.Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romano A. Bottaro D. Dathan N. Grieco M. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Matoskova B. Kraus M. Di Fiore P. Science. 1995; 267: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). We also established several cell clones stably expressing RET-MEN2A carrying a mutation at Tyr-981 (Y981F) or Tyr-1062 (Y1062F) (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig.1 B, in two of these independent cell clones the RET mutant protein was correctly synthesized, and the level of phosphorylation on tyrosine residues was approximately comparable to RET-MEN2A (Fig.1 B). As previously reported (16.Asai N. Murakami H. Iwashita T. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17644-17649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), Rat1 fibroblasts expressing RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2A/981F displayed the morphologic changes characteristic of a transformed phenotype: cells were refractile, rounded, piled up, formed foci, and had the tendency to detach from the plates to grow without anchorage (data not shown). On the contrary, Rat1 cells expressing RET wt or RET-MEN2A/1062F formed the typical monolayer of fibroblasts and did not grow in soft agar (data not shown). To examine the lipid kinase activity of PI3K in Rat1 cells expressing either RET wt or RET-MEN2A, proteins were immunoprecipitated with an antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, and the immunocomplex was subjected to an in vitro PI3K assay. In this assay the levels of the products of PI3K, i.e.PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, were determined by thin layer chromatography. To reduce the basal level of PI3K activity due to growth factors contained in the serum of the culture medium, cells were serum-starved during 4-h prior lysis. As shown in Fig. 2, a marked increase of PI3K activity was detected in cell clones expressing RET-MEN2A compared with RET wt. Quantification of this effect revealed that PI3K activity was enhanced 4- and 2-fold in clones 1 and 2, respectively, and this difference correlated with the level of RET-MEN2A expression. To determine whether RET forms a complex with PI3K, Rat1 cell clones were lysed with mild conditions of detergent to preserve protein-protein interactions. Cell lysates were subjected to an immunoprecipitation with anti-RET polyclonal serum and then Western-blotted with an anti-p85 antibody. By using these conditions, p85 was detected in RET-MEN2A immunoprecipitates but not or very weakly in RET wt and LacZ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3). To test whether the SH2 domains of p85 were involved in the RET-MEN2A-p85 interaction, we performed a “GST-pull down assay” using glutathione-Sepharose coated with a GST fusion protein containing the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85 (GST-p85/N-SH2, Fig.4 A). Total cell lysates from cells expressing RET wt or RET-MEN2A were incubated with the GST-p85 fusion protein, and bound proteins were fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-RET polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, RET-MEN2A specifically bound to GST-p85/N-SH2, whereas RET wt was unable to interact with the GST fusion protein. Similar results were obtained with a GST recombinant protein containing the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of p85, although the interaction appeared weaker than with N-SH2 (data not shown). The levels of exogenously expressed RET were comparable in the cell lysates tested (Fig. 4 D). It has been previously reported that mutation of Tyr-1062 drastically impairs the transforming activity of MEN2A and MEN2B forms of RET (16.Asai N. Murakami H. Iwashita T. Takahashi M. J. Biol. C"

EEA1 binds to both phosphtidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and to Rab5-GTP in vitro, but the functional role of this dual interaction at the endosomal membrane is unclear. Here we have determined the structural features in EEA1 required for binding to these ligands. We have found that the FYVE domain is critical for both PtdIns3P and Rab5 binding. Whereas PtdIns3P binding only required the FYVE domain, Rab5 binding additionally required a 30-amino acid region directly adjacent to the FYVE domain. Microinjection of glutathione S-transferase fusion constructs into Cos cells revealed that the FYVE domain alone is insufficient for localization to cellular membranes; the upstream 30-amino acid region required for Rab5 binding must also be present for endosomal binding. The importance of Rab5 in membrane binding of EEA1 is underscored by the finding that the increased expression of wild-type Rab5 increases endosomal binding of EEA1 and decreases its dependence on PtdIns3P. Thus, the levels of Rab5 are rate-limiting for the recruitment of EEA1 to endosome membranes. PtdIns3P may play a role in modulating the Rab5 EEA1 interaction.

These effects coincide with an inhibition of EEA1 binding to early endosomal membranes (3.Patki V. Virbasius J. Lane W.S. Toh W.S. Shpetner H.S. Corvera S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7326-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15.Mills I.G. Jones A.T. Clague M.J. Curr.

Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar,17.Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Conversely, mutations in Rab5, which render it resistant to exchange, result in small endosomes and inhibition of endocytosis (16.Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar,17.Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). A relationship between Rab5 and PI3 kinase with respect to endosome fusion was first indicated by the ability of Rab5Q79L to rescue an in vitro assay of homotypic endosome fusion from a wortmannin block (14.Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The nature of this relationship was clarified with the identification of EEA1 as a critical effector protein downstream of both Rab5 and PI3 kinase (18.Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Exogenous EEA1 added to anin vitro endosome fusion assay was sufficient to rescue fusion both from a wortmannin block and from a block induced by removal of Rab5 by the addition of GDP dissociation inhibitor (19.Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). From these studies it has been proposed that EEA1 is a critical factor required for endosome fusion, where it acts as a docking/tethering protein between vesicles to promote soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusionattachment receptor (SNARE)-mediated fusion reactions (20.Corvera S. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21.Waters M.G. Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Although it is clear that EEA1 binds directly to both PtdIns3P and to Rab5-GTP in vitro, the functional role of a dual interaction at the endosomal membrane is not clear. EEA1 co-localizes with Rab5 at early endosomes (2.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) but, unlike Rab5, does not associate with early endosome precursors such as clathrin-coated or adaptin-coated vesicles. It has been proposed that the combinatorial interaction of EEA1 with both Rab5-GTP and PtdIns3P ensures its precise localization to endosomes containing both signals, as opposed to cellular membranes containing exclusively one or the other (18.Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PtdIns3P and Rab5 may play a regulatory role in EEA1 function. The half-life of PtdIns3P and the duration of the GTP-bound state of Rab5 may influence the rate and extent of the endosome fusion reaction. In this regard, it is worth noting that introduction of a GFP tag at the COOH terminus of EEA1 results in the gross enlargement of early endosomes in vivo, coinciding with a loss of specificity for PtdIns3P binding (4.Patki V. Lawe D.C. Corvera S. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Nature. 1998; 394: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).To begin to understand the mechanisms and functional significance of the dual interaction of EEA1 with PtdIns3P and Rab5, we have determined the structural features in EEA1 required to bind these ligands. Our studies indicate that the integrity of the FYVE domain in conjunction with a stretch of 30 amino acids upstream are essential for Rab5 association. Thus, the PtdIns3P binding FYVE domain is nested within the Rab5 binding site, which explains the overlapping influence of both PI3 kinase and Rab5 activities on early endosome fusion. Microinjection of diverse constructs of EEA1 into cells revealed that the FYVE domain alone, which binds PtdIns3P in vitro with high affinity, is insufficient for membrane localization. The upstream 30 amino acids were absolutely required for membrane binding, which was further enhanced by the presence of the IQ motif. Thus, additional protein-protein interactions play a critical role in establishing FYVE/PtdIns3P-mediated protein-membrane associations.DISCUSSIONRecent work from many laboratories has contributed to the identification of the specific molecular elements involved in the process of endosome fusion (20.Corvera S. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 23.Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin.

Biocell. 1996; 20: 325-330PubMed Google Scholar). Among these elements are the small GTPase Rab5, PI3 kinase, and the protein EEA1, which interacts functionally with both of these effectors and is thought to provide a tethering system necessary for membrane fusion. Endosome fusion also depends critically on SNARE proteins, an integral part of the fusion system, which directly mediate the formation of the fusion pore (27.Chao D.S. Hay J.C. Winnick S. Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,28.Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). How these systems of tethering and fusion, each of which have components that are likely to play regulatory roles, operate in the context of intact cells is currently an unanswered question.In this manuscript, we have addressed two specific questions related to the mechanisms that regulate endosome fusion in intact cells. First, what is the structural basis for the interaction between Rab5, PtdIns3P, and EEA1, and second, what is the physiological relevance of these interactions in intact cells. Our results indicate that (a) Rab5 binding by EEA1 requires the integrity of the FYVE domain plus a 30-amino acid NH2-terminal extension; (b) the FYVE domain of EEA1 alone, although capable of high affinity binding to PtdIns3P, cannot bind to endosomes nor to any other membrane system in intact cells; both PtdIns3P and Rab5 binding are required for binding of EEA1 to endosomes; and (c) that the rate-limiting factor for EEA1 association with endosomes in vivo is the level of activated Rab5.Our conclusion that an efficient interaction between EEA1 and Rab5 requires both the integrity of the FYVE domain and a 30-amino acid sequence to the NH2 terminus contrasts with that reached by Simonsen et al. (18.Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). In these studies the minimal Rab5 binding region of EEA1 was defined as being comprised of residues 1277–1348, excluding the FYVE domain. It is possible that a weak interaction between this region and a persistently active mutant of Rab5 may be detectable in the two-hybrid system used in these studies but not in a biochemical pull-down assay such as the one used here. However, this weak interaction is clearly functionally insufficient, as mutations in the FYVE domain completely prevent binding of EEA1 to endosomes even in the presence of persistently active Rab5 (2.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this mutant form of Rab5 abrogates the normal requirement of PtdIns3P association for EEA1 binding to endosomal membranes (18.Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Thus the inability of the FYVE domain mutants to localize to endosomes in cells expressing persistently activated Rab5 is likely to be due to the disruption of Rab5 binding.A dual role of the FYVE domain in mediating the interaction both with PtdIns3P and Rab5 underscores the functional similarity between EEA1 and the yeast protein Vac1p. Point mutations in the FYVE domain of Vac1p abolished its interaction with Vps21p, a Rab GTPase that functions in Golgi to endosome transport (29.Peterson M.R. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Similarly, other Zn2+ binding domains are present in Rab effector proteins and contribute directly or indirectly to the interaction with activated Rab GTPases. For example, Rabphilin-3A contains a Zn2+binding domain within its Rab3A binding region, and mutations that disrupt Zn2+ binding abolish Rab3A association (30.Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Comparison of the crystal structure of the FYVE domain of Vps27 with that of the Rab3A-Rabphilin-3A complex suggests a potential interaction between the COOH terminus of Rab5 and the FYVE domain of EEA1 (31.Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).What is the physiological role of the dual interaction of EEA1 with PtdIns3P and Rab5? PI3 kinase, Rab5, and EEA1 have been recognized as critical components in the control of endosome fusion, but the mechanisms underlying their interplay are not understood. One current hypothesis is that Rab5 provides a mechanism to ensure targeting of EEA1 to early endosomes and not to other cellular membranes that might contain PtdIns3P (18.Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). However, the finding that PtdIns3P binding by the FYVE domain is not sufficient for EEA1 association with any cellular membrane suggests that Rab5 binding is fundamentally required for the binding event itself. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type Rab5 enhances EEA1 binding to the point where the FYVE-PtdIns3P interaction becomes unnecessary for endosomal localization. These results suggest that the principal role of Rab5 is to direct the membrane binding of EEA1 and that the FYVE-PtdIns3P interaction is likely to be regulatory.What type of regulatory role might PtdIns3P play in endosome fusion? Experiments using fusion proteins of the COOH domain of EEA1 indicate that both Rab5 and PtdIns3P are required to achieve the binding of EEA1 to endosomal membranes (Fig. 3). These results suggest that these signals play a synergistic role in mediating EEA1 binding to endosomal membranes and in subsequent endosome fusion. The prediction from this conclusion would be that inhibition of PI3 kinase activity with wortmannin would result in an inhibition of endosome fusion. Although this result is indeed observed in in vitro endosome fusion assays (13.Jones A.T. Clague M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14.Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), results in intact cells differ significantly. For example, wortmannin increases the accumulation of the fluid phase marker Lucifer Yellow and of transferrin in early endosomes and causes only a small decrease in the rate of transferrin recycling (9.Martys J.L. Wjasow C. Gangi D.M. Kielian M.C. McGraw T.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10953-10962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11.Shpetner H. Joly M. Hartley D. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12.Spiro D.J. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Wessling-Resnick M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a pronounced enlargement and tubulation of endosomes containing these markers is observed after treatment with this toxin (11.Shpetner H. Joly M. Hartley D. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This phenotype is not consistent with a block in endosome fusion. In fact, it more closely resembles the phenotype of enhanced endosome fusion produced by expression of persistently activated forms of Rab5 (16.Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar).The discrepancy between the apparent requirement for PtdIns3P to bind EEA1 to membranes and the enhanced fusion of endosomes observed in intact cells after wortmannin treatment suggests more than one specific role for PtdIns3P during the process of endocytosis. For example, PtdIns3P might serve to initiate the recycling of EEA1 and other components of the fusion machinery after endosome fusion, thus preventing the formation of large endsomes while promoting the continual formation of new ones. An intriguing possibility supported by results shown here (Fig. 6) is that PI3 kinase activity may be a critical factor in regulating Rab5 function. Whereas in control cells Rab5 was diffusely distributed, in wortmannin-treated cells it was largely concentrated in enlarged juxtanuclear endosomes that also contained EEA1. These enlarged endosomes might arise from a persistent activation of Rab5 resulting in enhanced EEA1 binding and an uncontrolled increase in the number of endosome fusion events. Further studies aimed at better understanding the interplay among PtdIns3P, EEA1, and Rab5 are necessary to clarify these questions.Microinjection experiments shown here indicate that whereas the presence of both the FYVE and the upstream sequence required for Rab5 binding are sufficient for endosome localization, the presence of the IQ motif amino-terminal to these sites enhances this interaction. This enhanced interaction might be due to oligomerization of the carboxyl terminus of EEA1 with itself, as amino acids 1277–1411 but not 1307–1411 were able to homodimerize in a yeast two-hybrid assay (22.Callaghan J. Simonsen A. Gaullier J.M. Toh B.H. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of the protein would result in multiple Rab5-GTP/PtdIns3P binding sites in one complex, increasing its affinity for membranes containing both signals, thereby stabilizing the protein at the membrane. Alternatively, additional interactions with other endosome components might be involved. In the case of Vac1p, interactions with components of the SNARE fusion machinery have been demonstrated (29.Peterson M.R. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Such interactions might also occur in mammalian cells. Whether these interactions directly involve the IQ domain of EEA1 remains to be determined. Early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1)1 is a protein that was originally identified as the primary antigen in a patient with a subacute form of lupus erythematosus (1.Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P. Tock E.P. Toh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Cloning and biochemical characterization of EEA1 revealed distinct structural features, including an extensive region of coiled-coil, an IQ calmodulin binding motif, and two Zn2+ finger motifs, one at the amino terminus, and one at the extreme carboxyl terminus (2.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This latter motif is conserved among several yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammalian proteins and was named “FYVE,” after four proteins that contain this motif (2.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The FYVE of EEA1 and of other proteins has been found to bind directly to PtdIns3P, a major product of PI3 kinase activity in mammalian cells (3.Patki V. Virbasius J. Lane W.S. Toh W.S. Shpetner H.S.

The activity of PI3 kinase has been strongly implicated in the control of endosomal membrane traffic. Treatment of cells with PI3 kinase inhibitors results in a decrease in transferrin receptor recycling, platelet-derived growth factor receptor down-regulation, and transcytosis in epithelial cells (7.Hansen S.H.

Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Wessling-Resnick M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, wortmannin inhibits endosome fusion in in vitro assays (13.Jones A.T. Clague M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14.Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These effects coincide with an inhibition of EEA1 binding to early endosomal membranes (3.Patki V. Virbasius J. Lane W.S. Toh W.S. Shpetner H.S. Corvera S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7326-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15.Mills I.G. Jones A.T. Clague M.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 881-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which accounts for the inhibition of endosome fusionin vitro, and may account for some of the wortmannin-induced phenotypes observed in intact cells. Rab5 has been recognized as a critical regulatory factor in endosome fusion; a mutation in Rab5, which renders it resistant to GTP hydrolysis (Rab5Q79L), results in enlarged endosomes in vivoand enhanced fusion in in vitro endosome fusion assays (16.Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar,17.Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Conversely, mutations in Rab5, which render it resistant to exchange, result in small endosomes and inhibition of endocytosis (16.Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar,17.Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). A relationship between Rab5 and PI3 kinase with respect to endosome fusion was first indicated by the ability of Rab5Q79L to rescue an in vitro assay of homotypic endosome fusion from a wortmannin block (14.Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The nature of this relationship was clarified with the identification of EEA1 as a critical effector protein downstream of both Rab5 and PI3 kinase (18.Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Exogenous EEA1 added to anin vitro endosome fusion assay was sufficient to rescue fusion both from a wortmannin block and from a block induced by removal of Rab5 by the addition of GDP dissociation inhibitor (19.Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). From these studies it has been proposed that EEA1 is a critical factor required for endosome fusion, where it acts as a docking/tethering protein between vesicles to promote soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusionattachment receptor (SNARE)-mediated fusion reactions (20.Corvera S. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21.Waters M.G. Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that EEA1 binds directly to both PtdIns3P and to Rab5-GTP in vitro, the functional role of a dual interaction at the endosomal membrane is not clear. EEA1 co-localizes with Rab5 at early endosomes (2.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) but, unlike Rab5, does not associate with early endosome precursors such as clathrin-coated or adaptin-coated vesicles. It has been proposed that the combinatorial interaction of EEA1 with both Rab5-GTP and PtdIns3P ensures its precise localization to endosomes containing both signals, as opposed to cellular membranes containing exclusively one or the other (18.Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PtdIns3P and Rab5 may play a regulatory role in EEA1 function. The half-life of PtdIns3P and the duration of the GTP-bound state of Rab5 may influence the rate and extent of the endosome fusion reaction. In this regard, it is worth noting"

Although the accumulated evidence suggests a role of decreased GSH in the pathogenesis of HIV, significant controversy remains concerning the mechanism of GSH depletion, especially in regard to envisioning appropriate therapeutic strategies to help compensate for such decreased antioxidant capacity. Tat, a transactivator encoded by HIV, is sufficient to cause GSH depletion in vitro and is implicated in AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma and B cell lymphoma. In this study, we report a decrease in GSH biosynthesis with Tat, using HIV-1 Tat transgenic (Tat+) mice. A significant decline in the total intracellular GSH content in liver and erythrocytes of Tat+ mice was accompanied by decreased γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase regulatory subunit mRNA and protein content, which resulted in an increased sensitivity of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase to feedback inhibition by GSH. Further study revealed a significant reduction in the activity of GSH synthetase in liver of Tat+ mice, which was linearly associated with their GSH content. Therefore, Tat appears to decrease GSH in vivo, at least partially, through modulation of GSH biosynthetic enzymes. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) progressively depletes GSH content in humans.

The importance of this decreased GSH is suggested by the fact that decreased GSH can enhance HIV expression via activation of NF-κB (4.Garaci E. Palamara A.T. Ciriolo M.R.

In fact, such decline in the GSH content may play a role in the increased drug toxicity and oxidative damage, often found in HIV-infected individuals (12.Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev.

Retroviruses. 1996; 12: 1537-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GSH content may even predict the survival of HIV-seropositive (HIV+) individuals (19.Herzenberg L.A. De Rosa S.C. Dubs J.G. Roederer M. Anderson M.T. Ela S.W. Deresinski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1967-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 20.Marmor M. Alcabes P. Titus S. Frenkel K. Krasinski K. Penn A. Pero R.W. Aids. 1997; 11: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is perhaps crucial to determine whether this decrease in GSH occurs through an accelerated loss of GSH or specific modulation of its synthesis, especially as it relates to potential therapeutic strategies to compensate for such decreased antioxidant capacity. However, despite over a decade of intensive research on this subject, the exact mechanism(s) causing decreased GSH content with HIV remains unclear. Cells maintain their high GSH content in part by reducing GSSG back to GSH, preventing the loss of GSH as GSSG (12.Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (6000) Google Scholar). Also, GSH is synthesized from its amino acid constituents via two consecutive reactions catalyzed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS; glutamate-cysteine ligase, EC 6.3.2.2) and GSH synthetase (GS; EC6.3.2.3). In multiorgan systems, GSH can be supplied from one organ to help supply necessary amino acids for intracellular synthesis of GSH in other organs (21.Anderson M.E. Bridges R.J. Meister A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,22.Lauterburg B.H. Adams J.D. Mitchell J.R. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Some cells may even take up GSH in its intact form (23.Deneke S.M. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L163-L173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HIV-associated reduction in the GSH content can result from decreased GSH synthesis or an increased rate of loss due to increased consumption, degradation, or transport/leakage of GSH or from a combination of these factors. It has been suggested that GSH consumption may increase in HIV infection as a result of increased oxidative stress (14.Favier A. Sappey C. Leclerc P. Faure P. Micoud M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 91: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15.Sappey C. Leclercq P. Coudray C. Faure P. Micoud M. Favier A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 230: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24.Roulston A. Lin R. Beauparlant P. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. Microbiol.

Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is not clear whether this can explain the systemic GSH depletion in HIV+ patients, since even severe oxidative stress cannot deplete systemic GSH contentin vivo (29.Adams Jr., J.D. Lauterburg B.H. Mitchell J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 227: 749-754PubMed Google Scholar). This is especially true because GSH synthesis can increase in an adaptive response to oxidants and xenobiotics via multiple mechanisms (23.Deneke S.M. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L163-L173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Shi M.M. Kugelman A.

Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In fact, even if the cells were losing a significant amount of GSH or GSSG to the outside of the cells, total GSH, or at least cysteine, would be expected to increase, rather than decrease, in the plasma. Therefore, increased oxidative stress may not be sufficient to explain the systemic GSH depletion in HIV infection. Alternatively, GSH can be suppressed as a result of decreased synthesis. Helbling et al. (33.Helbling B. von Overbeck J. Lauterburg B.H. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 26: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) reported that GSH input into circulation is reduced in HIV+ individuals. In addition, a systemic decrease in total GSH content (2.Buhl R. Jaffe H.A. Holroyd K.J. Wells F.B. Mastrangeli A. Saltini C. Cantin A.M. Crystal R.G. Lancet. 1989; 2: 1294-1298Abstract PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 33.Helbling B. von Overbeck J. Lauterburg B.H. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 26: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and decreased metabolic labeling of GSH in HIV+ individuals (34.Jahoor F. Jackson A. Gazzard B. Philips G. Sharpstone D. Frazer M.E. Heird W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E205-E211PubMed Google Scholar) all suggest reduced GSH biosynthesis in HIV infection. Indeed, decreased GSH content may allow development of oxidative stress rather than oxidative stress causing the decrease in GSH concentration. GSH synthesis may be compromised in HIV+ individuals because of the reduced availability of cysteine (1.Eck H.P. Gmunder H. Hartmann M. Petzoldt D. Daniel V. Droge W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1989; 370: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 35.de Quay B. Malinverni R. Lauterburg B.H.

Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a limiting substrate for GSH biosynthesis, and cysteine supplementation may restore the GSH content in these individuals (19.Herzenberg L.A. De Rosa S.C. Dubs J.G. Roederer M. Anderson M.T. Ela S.W. Deresinski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1967-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 34.Jahoor F. Jackson A. Gazzard B. Philips G. Sharpstone D. Frazer M.E. Heird W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E205-E211PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been debated whether the restoration of cysteine content truly restores intracellular GSH content in HIV+ patients (33.Helbling B. von Overbeck J. Lauterburg B.H. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 26: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36.Witschi A. Junker E. Schranz C. Speck R.F. Lauterburg B.H. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting some defect in the utilization of cysteine for GSH biosynthesis. Therefore, the molecular basis of decreased GSH synthesis in HIV infection has been obscure. HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Tat is a transactivator protein encoded by HIV that is essential for efficient viral replication (37.Gaynor R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 193: 51-77PubMed Google Scholar). Tat is associated with AIDS-related dementia (38.Rosenblatt J.D. Miles S. Gasson J.C. Prager D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 193: 25-49PubMed Google Scholar) as well as two of the most frequent cancers associated with AIDS: Kaposi's sarcoma (39.Ensoli B. Gendelman R. Markham P. Fiorelli V. Colombini S. Raffeld M. Cafaro A. Chang H.K. Brady J.N. Gallo R.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and B cell lymphoma (40.Kundu R.K. Sangiorgi F. Wu L.-Y.W. Pattengale P.K. Hinton D.R. Gill P.S. Maxson R. Blood. 1999; 94: 275-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tat has been shown to lower total and reduced GSH concentration in vitro in various cell lines and also the total sulfhydryl content in vivo in a transgenic animal model (27.Prakash O. Teng S. Ali M. Zhu X. Coleman R. Dabdoub R.A. Chambers R. Aw T.Y. Flores S.C. Joshi B.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41.Flores S.C. Marecki J.C. Harper K.P.

Los M. Krammer P.H. Droge W. Lehmann V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In addition, Tat is sufficient to cause both the enhanced activation of NF-κB and the increased susceptibility to apoptosis, observed with HIV (42.Westendorp M.O. Shatrov V.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Frank R. Kraft M. Los M. Krammer P.H. Droge W. Lehmann V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 43.Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J.

Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Tat also enhances drug toxicityin vivo (27.Prakash O. Teng S. Ali M. Zhu X. Coleman R. Dabdoub R.A. Chambers R. Aw T.Y. Flores S.C. Joshi B.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, Tat may be a viral agent that participates in many of the pathological changes that occur upon HIV infection. Consequently, determining the mechanism whereby Tat decreases GSH content may serve as an important step toward understanding how HIV suppresses the GSH content in humans. The aim of the present investigation, therefore, was to test whether GSH synthesis is decreased in Tat-transgenic (Tat+) mice and, in the process, determine the mechanism underlying such reduced GSH synthesis with Tat. A significant decrease in the GSH content in liver and erythrocytes of Tat+ mice was associated with specific modulation of GCS and GS, the enzymes involved in GSH de novosynthesis. C57Bl mice (Jackson Laboratory) had been previously engineered to express HIV-1 Tat constitutively and ubiquitously under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter (40.Kundu R.K. Sangiorgi F. Wu L.-Y.W. Pattengale P.K. Hinton D.R. Gill P.S. Maxson R. Blood. 1999; 94: 275-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the Tat+ mice used were homozygous for Tat and were derived from a single line. Food and water were provided ad lib. On the day of the experiment, 14-month-old Tat+ mice and age-matched control mice (NIA, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) were sacrificed in CO2 chambers. Immediately, blood was drawn directly from the heart and collected in EDTA-containing test tubes (VWR Scientific, San Diego, CA). All high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) solvents were Baker Analyzed HPLC-grade reagents from VWR Scientific. All other chemicals were at least analytical grade and obtained from Sigma, unless indicated otherwise. Total intracellular GSH ([GSH] + 2 × [GSSG]) and total cysteine ([cysteine] + 2 × [cystine]) concentrations were measured by HPLC according to the well established method of Fariss and Reed (45.Fariss M.W. Reed D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Immediately after obtaining samples, both erythrocytes and liver samples were washed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and acidified in 10% perchloric acid, 2 mm EDTA that contained the internal standard, γ-glutamylglutamic acid (Bachem, Torrance, CA). Liver samples were precipitated and sonicated twice in this solution to ensure complete GSH recovery. Samples were further processed and analyzed for their GSH and cysteine contents as described previously (46.Liu R.M. Gao L. Choi J. Forman H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L861-L869PubMed Google Scholar). Liver samples were homogenized in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and total RNA was isolated, following the manufacturer's protocol. The amount of GCS light subunit (GCS-LS), GCS heavy subunit (GCS-HS), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs was measured by Northern analysis and quantitated with an InstantImager (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT), as described previously (46.Liu R.M. Gao L. Choi J. Forman H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L861-L869PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse liver samples were sonicated briefly in 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) solution that contained a 2 μg/ml concentration each of leupeptin and aprotinin and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Erythrocytes were lysed by adding a 10× volume of distilled water. Following 20 min of centrifugation at 12,000 rpm and 1 h centrifugation at 100,000 rpm at 4 °C, supernatants were concentrated in Microcon-10 tubes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Then 10 μg of liver and 40 μg of erythrocyte cytosolic protein samples were denatured in 2% SDS, 6 m urea, and 300 mm dithiothreitol. Subsequently, GCS-HS and GCS-LS protein content was determined by Western analysis, using rabbit anti-rat GCS-HS and GCS-LS antibodies, as described previously (46.Liu R.M. Gao L. Choi J. Forman H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L861-L869PubMed Google Scholar). GCS activity was determinedin vitro, according to the method described by Yan and Huxtable (47.Yan C.C. Huxtable R.J. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1995; 672: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. After concentrating liver and erythrocyte proteins in Microcon-10 tubes as described under “Western Analysis of GCS Proteins,” samples were washed further by repeatedly adding GCS lysis solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EDTA) to remove endogenous inhibitors, acceptors, and substrates. The reaction mixture consisted of GCS lysis solution that was supplemented with 25 mm sodium glutamate, 5 mm cysteine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, and 0.04 mg/ml acivicin. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37°C upon adding protein at a final concentration of 0.1–1 mg/ml. Reactions were then terminated with 5% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicylic acid. After adjusting pH to 8–9 with 40 mm KOH/400 mm N-ethylmorpholine, samples were derivatized for 20 min in the dark with 3 mmmonobromobimane (Calbiochem). Next, samples were acidified again with 5-sulfosalicylic acid and, after removing precipitated protein, were analyzed by HPLC, as described previously (46.Liu R.M. Gao L. Choi J. Forman H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L861-L869PubMed Google Scholar). For the GS activity assay, glutamate was substituted with 30 mm glycine, and l-cysteine was substituted with 3 mm γ-glutamylcysteine (48.Nardi G. Cipollaro M. Loguercio C. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 530: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol concentration was 6 mm. Protein was added to the reactions at a final concentration of 0–0.25 mg/ml. Base-line levels of γ-glutamylcysteine and GSH were negligible, if present, in both GCS and GS activity assays; nevertheless, the base-line absorbance at the points where these compounds eluted was subtracted from each reaction. GCS and GS activities were both linear for at least 30 min at the protein concentrations used. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. unless indicated otherwise and evaluated by Student'st test or one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test. Pearson product moment correlation and linear regression analysis were used to identify statistically significant correlation or association between variables. For all analyses, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The number of samples used in each experiment is indicated under “Results” or in the figure legends. HIV-1 Tat+ mice used in this investigation had been previously reported to develop B-cell lymphoma, but their livers did not display any histological abnormalities (40.Kundu R.K. Sangiorgi F. Wu L.-Y.W. Pattengale P.K. Hinton D.R. Gill P.S. Maxson R. Blood. 1999; 94: 275-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, total intracellular GSH content was significantly decreased to 57 ± 3% (Fig.1 A) and 80 ± 5% (Fig.1 B) of the age-matched control level in liver and erythrocytes of these mice, respectively. There was no significant difference in total GSH content between genders within each group (data not shown). A significant, positive linear correlation existed between liver and erythrocyte GSH content (r = 0.56;p < 0.05). The samples were also examined for their intracellular cysteine content. No significant change in the total cysteine content could be detected in liver (0.36 ± 0.07 and 0.23 ± 0.04 nmol/mg protein in control and Tat+ mice, respectively, p > 0.05) or erythrocytes (0.13 ± 0.02 and 0.12 ± 0.05 nmol/mg protein in control and Tat+ mice, respectively, p > 0.05) of control (n = 10) versus Tat+ mice (n = 6) with the statistical tests employed. There was no significant correlation between liver and erythrocyte total cysteine content (r = 0.38; p > 0.05). Furthermore, comparing the data with those in Fig. 1, no significant correlation was found between total GSH and cysteine concentrations in either liver (r = 0.31, p > 0.05) or erythrocytes (r = −0.31, p > 0.05). To test whether Tat modulated GCS, the first enzyme in GSHde novo synthesis, we determined the level of GCS heavy (catalytic, GCS-HS) and light (regulatory) subunit mRNAs in livers from control and Tat+ mice. Northern analysis detected one GCS-HS and two GCS-LS mRNA species in mouse liver, as in rat liver (Fig.2 A). GCS-HS mRNA content was not different between two groups of mice. There was also no significant change in the higher molecular weight GCS-LS mRNA band. However, the lower molecular weight GCS-LS mRNA content was significantly decreased to 56 ± 4% of the control level in Tat+ mice (Fig. 2 B). Next, we examined whether the GCS-LS protein content was likewise reduced in Tat+ mice relative to controls by Western analysis. GCS-HS and -LS proteins were identified, based on the size of rat kidney GCS-HS and -LS proteins (data not shown). GCS-LS protein content was significantly decreased to 41 ± 16% of the control level in livers from Tat+ mice (Fig.3 A), consistent with the decrease in the lower molecular weight GCS-LS mRNA band (Fig. 2). Erythrocytes from the same mice exhibited a similar decline in the GCS-LS protein content, to 48 ± 20% of the control level (Fig.3 B). There was no statistically significant decline in GCS-HS protein content. GCS-HS exhibits all of the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme and is feedback-inhibited by GSH (49.Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GCS-LS, on the other hand, is believed to decrease theK m of GCS-HS for glutamate and increase itsK i for GSH (50.Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of any change in the GCS-HS protein content, GCS activity was not decreased in liver or erythrocytes of Tat+ mice measured with saturating substrate concentration (5.2 ± 0.4 in control versus 6.2 ± 0.4 nmol/mg/min in Tat+ mouse liver; 0.81 ± .05 in controlversus 0.81 ± 0.03 nmol/mg/min in Tat+ mouse erythrocytes). To determine the effect of decreased GCS-LS protein content in Tat+ mice, we examined the effect of GSH on GCS activity in liver and erythrocytes from the two groups of mice. GCS activity from control and Tat mouse liver and erythrocytes were measured at low (0.5 mm) and high (25 mm) glutamate concentrations in the absence and presence of 10 mm GSH, and the ratios of the GCS activity in the absence and presence of GSH at low and high glutamate within the same sample were compared between the Tat and control groups. The results suggest that the major difference between the GCS activity in control and Tat is that the latter is inhibited to a greater extent by GSH (Fig. 4). This greater GSH feedback inhibition would be expected to contribute to a lowering of the GSH steady state that was observed. We also examined the possibility of a change in the activity of GS, the next enzyme in GSH biosynthesis. GS activity was significantly decreased to 73 ± 4% of the control level in Tat+ mouse liver (Fig. 5) but not in the erythrocytes (0.53 ± 0.03 in control versus 0.54 ± 0.01 nmol/mg/min in Tat+ mice, p > 0.05). Interestingly, GS activity was linearly associated with total intracellular GSH content of liver (r = 0.72; p < 0.01;r 2 = 0.51). Acute infection of C57Bl mice with murine AIDS virus can diminish their liver GSH content 2 weeks postinfection (51.Chen L.H. Xi S. Cohen D.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1996; 99: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that HIV-1 Tat expression is sufficient to decrease GSH content in the same strain of mice and, furthermore, present a potential mechanism for this decreased GSH content: a specific modulation of GCS and GS. Specifically, down-regulation of GCS-LS in Tat+ mice was associated with an increased sensitivity of GCS to inhibition by GSH. No change in cysteine concentration could be demonstrated with the tests employed, perhaps due to the limitations in the instrument and the sample size. Regardless of whether cysteine content is altered in Tat+ mice, GCS is believed to be the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis (52.Tateishi N. Higashi T. Shinya S. Naruse A. Sakamoto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 75: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and therefore, such a decline in GCS-LS protein content is likely to result in a decreased rate of GSH biosynthesis. This, together with the down-regulation of manganese superoxide dismutase by Tat, may allow the observed reduction in GSH content. It is presently unknown whether the down-regulation of GCS-LS by Tat is sufficient to cause GSH depletion. The role of GS modulation in decreased GSH concentration is less obvious. Although the high correlation between GS activity and GSH content (r = 0.72; p < 0.05) suggests a possible role of GS in determining GSH status, at least in mouse liver, GS is generally not believed to govern the rate of GSH synthesis. It is perplexing, therefore, how GS activity could be related to the GSH status. However, similar association between GS activity and GSH content has been reported by others (53.Luo J.L. Hammarqvist F. Andersson K. Wernerman J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E359-E365PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Loguercio C. Del Vecchio Blanco C. Coltorti M. Nardi G. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1992; 52: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, while GCS is usually regarded as the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis (52.Tateishi N. Higashi T. Shinya S. Naruse A. Sakamoto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 75: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), increasing evidence also suggests that GS activity can be regulated (55.Sun Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 56.Chang M.L. Klaidman L.K. Adams Jr., J.D. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1997; 30: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 57.Marin E. Kretzschmar M. Arokoski J. Hanninen O. Klinger W. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1993; 147: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 58.Willmore W.G. Storey K.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R219-R225PubMed Google Scholar, 59.Kumar S. Ganguly N.K. Kohli K.K. Folia Microbiol. 1994; 39: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 60.Kumar S. Ganguly N.K. Kohli K.K. Biochem. Int. 1992; 26: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar, 61.Sethna S.S. Holleschau A.M. Rathbun W.B. Curr. Eye Res. 1982; 2: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 62.Xie P.Y. Kanai A. Nakajima A. Kitahara S. Ohtsu A. Fujii K. Ophthalmic Res. 1991; 23: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Obviously, if GS activity falls significantly, it could become the rate-limiting step. γ-Glutamylcysteine, produced by GCS, has been suggested to be channeled efficiently to GS (63.Orlowski M. Wilk S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is known that physical interaction or close spatial arrangement of proteins that participate in a given signal transduction or biochemical pathway enables an efficient relay of signals to effector molecules as well as the channeling of intermediates between interacting metabolic enzymes (64.Cheung C.W. Cohen N.S. Raijman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4038-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is not at all surprising that the enzymes in GSH biosynthesis may be regulated coordinately and perhaps even interdependently, through protein-protein interaction. Nevertheless, the observed decline in the GCS-LS protein content may be sufficient to explain the decreased GSH content in Tat+ mice, and therefore, the physiological significance of ∼30% decline in the GS activity in Tat+ mice remains unclear at the moment. Our findings on Tat+ mice apparently lead to the next question, which is whether the modulation of GSH biosynthetic enzymes also occurs in HIV infection. A similar decline in GSH content has been found in the liver and erythrocytes of HIV+ individuals (34.Jahoor F. Jackson A. Gazzard B. Philips G. Sharpstone D. Frazer M.E. Heird W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E205-E211PubMed Google Scholar, 65.Barbaro G. Di Lorenzo G. Soldini M. Parrotto S. Bellomo G. Belloni G. Grisorio B. Barbarini G. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 91: 2569-2573PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatic GSH depletion is particularly interesting, as liver serves as a reservoir for HIV, and various cells found in liver, such as Kupffer cells, lymphocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and even the hepatocytes themselves, can be infected by the virus (66.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Thus, Tat may directly decrease GSH synthesis in the liver of HIV+ patients. This may explain the systemic decrease in the GSH content found in these individuals, because liver is the organ primarily responsible for GSH in circulation (21.Anderson M.E. Bridges R.J. Meister A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22.Lauterburg B.H. Adams J.D. Mitchell J.R. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, although HIV is not found ubiquitously in infected individuals, Tat is secreted by HIV-infected cells and also taken up rapidly by various cells (37.Gaynor R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 193: 51-77PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, any cell that Tat enters can potentially suffer from decreased GSH biosynthesis. Moreover, Tat may affect GSH biosynthesis through an indirect mechanism, such as by production of diverse cytokines, which may also exert a systemic effect on GSH synthesis. Therefore, Tat is a potential viral agent that causes the systemic GSH depletion observed in humans infected with HIV. Whether GSH synthetic enzymes are indeed suppressed in HIV+ individuals in a Tat-dependent manner should be tested in the future. It is uncertain whether a partial depletion in the GSH content will have significant effects on metabolism, and the answer is likely to depend on the GSH concentration and metabolic demands of each tissue. However, any effect of decreased GSH concentration will certainly be amplified in situations of increased oxidative burden. Due to the primary and secondary infections, HIV+ individuals tend to have activated respiratory burst of the immune cells, elevated level of pro-oxidative cytokine (24.Roulston A. Lin R. Beauparlant P. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 481-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Ishii Y. Partridge C.A. Del Vecchio P.J. Malik A.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and increased intake of pharmaceutical compounds that either cause oxidative damage (e.g.zidovudine (27.Prakash O. Teng S.

This may worsen various aspects of viral pathogenesis such as enhanced viral replication, potentiation of apoptotic cell death (44.Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J.

A 10–40% decrease in GSH content can completely inhibit lymphocyte activation in vitro (8.Suthanthiran M. Anderson M.E. Sharma V.K. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Indeed, the very fact that Tat modulates GSH biosynthesis in addition to suppressing the activity of manganese superoxide dismutase (27.Prakash O. Teng S. Ali M. Zhu X. Coleman R. Dabdoub R.A.

Specifically, these pro-oxidative effects of Tat may enhance its NF-κB-dependent transactivating potential (6.Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A.

It should be noted, however, that this study was aimed at discovering the mechanism by which Tat decreases GSH content. The role that the decrease in GSH plays in HIV pathology was not addressed in the present investigation. Finally, it is interesting that the symptoms of GS/GCS deficiencies and AIDS overlap. Both are associated with neurological complications (24.Roulston A. Lin R. Beauparlant P. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 481-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,67.Kosower N.S.

It will be interesting to determine the possible role of GSH deficiency in these AIDS-associated symptoms as well as B-cell lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, the two most frequent AIDS-associated cancers that are both associated with Tat (39.Ensoli B.

Indeed, the wide spectrum of various aspects of HIV pathogenesis that may be related to changes in the GSH status is striking. The possible therapeutic value of strategies for restoring GSH in HIV infection remains a debatable issue. Nonetheless, the results here suggest potential avenues for further exploration.

https://openalex.org/W2028509054,"Activity-dependent regulation of neuronal events such as cell survival and synaptic plasticity is controlled by increases in neuronal calcium levels. These actions often involve stimulation of intracellular kinase signaling pathways. For example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signaling cascade has increasingly been shown to be important for the induction of gene expression and long term potentiation. However, the mechanisms leading to ERK activation by neuronal calcium are still unclear. In the present study, we describe a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent signaling pathway that may link neuronal calcium influx to ERKs via the small G-protein, Rap1, and the neuronal Raf isoform, B-Raf. Thus, in PC12 cells, depolarization-mediated calcium influx led to the activation of B-Raf, but not Raf-1, via PKA. Furthermore, depolarization also induced the PKA-dependent stimulation of Rap1 and led to the formation of a Rap1/B-Raf signaling complex. In contrast, depolarization did not lead to the association of Ras with B-Raf. The major action of PKA-dependent Rap1/B-Raf signaling in neuronal cells is the activation of ERKs. Thus, we further show that, in both PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons, depolarization-induced calcium influx stimulates ERK activity in a PKA-dependent manner. Given the fact that both Rap1 and B-Raf are highly expressed in the central nervous system, we suggest that this signaling pathway may regulate a number of activity-dependent neuronal functions.

Johnson Jr., E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In many cases, this involves stimulation of calcium influx, particularly via voltage-operated L-type channels or receptor-operatedN-methyl-d-aspartate channels (1.Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C.

Many of the downstream functional consequences of calcium influx involve the regulation of gene transcription (5.Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E.

As such, numerous studies have begun to examine signal transduction pathways that link neuronal calcium to the regulation of transcription factor activity. These studies have revealed a complexity of calcium-dependent kinase signaling cascades (8.Ghosh A. Ginty D.D. Bading H. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAP kinases or ERKs)1 are emerging as important targets for neuronal calcium signaling. ERK activation by neuronal calcium influx has been demonstrated bothin vitro, using isolated neuronal cultures and the PC12 cell line (9.Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E.

In addition, a role for ERK activity has been demonstrated for both hippocampal long term potentiation (18.Impey S. Obrietan K. Wong S.T. Poser S. Yano S. Wayman G. Deloulme J.C. Chan G. Storm D.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13498-13502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These actions may underlie a requirement for ERKs in learning and memory (22.Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C.

Xue-Bian J.J. Siddiqi V. Kang Y. Neary J.T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3480-3487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major issue concerns the mechanism by which calcium influx stimulates ERK activity. ERKs have been best examined in the context of growth factor signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases (26.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). These studies have identified a ubiquitous ERK cascade involving the stimulation of the small G-protein, Ras, and the kinases, Raf-1 and MEK (26.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Since both growth factors and neuronal calcium often exhibit synergistic actions, it is possible that they may share common signaling pathways. Thus, in both in vitro neuronal cultures and PC12 cells, it has been demonstrated that depolarization-mediated opening of L-type calcium channels can activate Ras (9.Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 27.Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, but it may involve Shc phosphorylation, perhaps via transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (28.Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29.Zwick E. Daub H. Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar), or activation of the calmodulin-sensitive Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Ras-GRF (27.Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies have also identified a novel Ras GEF that can be activated directly by calcium and that may contribute to neuronal calcium stimulation of ERKs (31.Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 32.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P.

Although Ras represents an important target for neuronal calcium activation of ERKs, it is possible that calcium influx may additionally signal via alternate routes that are Ras-independent. We have recently identified a novel pathway regulating ERK activation via nerve growth factor (NGF) and cAMP (33.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 34.York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Unlike the well studied Ras-dependent ERK cascade, this pathway involves the PKA-dependent stimulation of the Ras-related small G-protein, Rap1, and the downstream kinase, B-Raf (33.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Given the ability of neuronal calcium to increase intracellular cAMP levels and PKA activity via calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclases (36.Xia Z. Storm D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), this pathway may represent an additional target for activity-dependent signaling. Indeed, studies inAplysia have shown that long term facilitation involves PKA activation of ERKs, consistent with a role for Rap1/B-Raf (16.Martin K.C. Michael D. Rose J.C. Barad M. Casadio A. Zhu H. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 899-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In addition, the identification of two novel families of Rap1 GEFs that can activated by direct binding to calcium and cAMP, respectively, also suggest a role for Rap1 in neuronal calcium signaling (37.de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 38.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the possible contribution of Ras-independent signaling pathways to the activation of ERKs by neuronal calcium. Using depolarization-mediated activation of L-type calcium channels in both PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons, we show that calcium influx stimulates ERKs in a PKA-dependent manner. Consistent with these findings, we further demonstrate that depolarization activates both Rap1 and B-Raf via PKA and also induces formation of a Rap1/B-Raf signaling complex. Rap1 is highly expressed in the CNS, and B-Raf is the predominant neuronal Raf isoform. As such, we propose that the PKA-dependent activation of a Rap1/B-Raf signaling pathway may represent a novel target for neuronal calcium signaling to ERKs. Taken together with previous findings, we suggest that the ability of neuronal calcium to activate both PKA/Rap1-dependent and Ras-dependent ERK pathways may be important in the regulation of events such as synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. PC12-GR5 cells were kindly provided by R. Nishi (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). Agarose-conjugated antibodies to ERK1 and ERK2 (c-16), antibodies to B-Raf and Raf-1, and recombinant MEK-1 protein were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Flag (M2) antibody was purchased from Sigma. Forskolin, KT5720, andN-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H89), N-(4-aminobutyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, HCl (W12), and N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-choloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, HCl (W13) were purchased from Calbiochem. Phosphorylation-specific ERK antibodies that recognize phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 at residues threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Nickel-agarose (Ni-NTA-agarose) was purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Chatswoth, CA). Radioisotopes were from NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents were from Sigma. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum on 100-mm plates to 50–60% confluence at 37 °C in 5% CO2 prior to harvesting. For immune complex assays and Western blotting, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% horse serum for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 prior to treatment with various reagents. All inhibitors were added to plates 20 min prior to treatment. Where indicated, PC12 cells were differentiated by culturing in 50 ng/ml NGF for 10 days. Hippocampal cells were harvested from embryonic (day 18) rats as described (39.Goslin K. Banker G. Banker G. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT, Cambridge, MA1991: 251-281Google Scholar). Briefly, dispersed hippocampal cells were plated on coverslips on top of a monolayer of glial cells. Cells were grown for 4–5 days in vitro, and tetrodotoxin was added 14 h prior to treatment to decrease basal activity and to eliminate action potential firing during depolarizing treatments. For immunohistochemistry, coverslips containing hippocampal cells were treated as described and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose. Subsequent immunohistochemistry was performed using primary phospho-ERK and ERK1/2 antibodies (New England Biolabs; 1:1000) and rhodamine-goat anti-rabbit or fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:500). Cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. The signal intensity within cell bodies was quantified for each treatment condition using NIH Image and expressed as -fold increase over untreated conditions after subtracting background levels. Cell lysates were prepared as described (33.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were assessed using the Bradford protein assay. For detection of phospho-ERK1/2, equal protein amounts of cell lysate per treatment condition were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters, and probed with phospho-ERK antibodies as per the manufacturer's instructions. Fifty percent confluent PC12 cells were co-transfected with the indicated cDNAs using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp.) was added to each set of transfections to ensure that each plate received the same amount of DNA. Four hours following transfection, cells were glycerol-shocked and allowed to recover in serum-containing media for 24 h. Cells were then starved overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before treatment and harvest. For ERK assays, treated and untreated cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10% sucrose, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride. The lysates were spun at low speed to remove nuclei, and the supernatant was collected. ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from lysates containing equal protein amounts per treatment condition, and kinase activity was measured by immune complex assay as described (33.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) using [γ-32P]ATP with myelin basic protein as substrate. For Raf assays, untreated and treated cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were spun at low speed to remove nuclei, and the supernatant was collected. Raf-1 or B-Raf was immunoprecipitated from equal protein amounts of lysate per treatment condition, and activity was measured by an immune complex assay as described (33.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) using [γ-32P]ATP with MEK as substrate. The reaction products of all kinase assays were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For studies examining polyhistidine-tagged Rap1, transfections were performed using calcium phosphate. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 30 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mg/ml aprotinin, and supernatants were prepared. Transfected His-Rap1 proteins were precipitated from supernatants containing equal amounts of protein using Ni-NTA-agarose, washed with 20 mmimidazole in lysis buffer, and eluted with 500 mmimidazole, 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. Eluates containing His-tagged proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and B-Raf protein was detected by Western blotting (33.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of each eluate were immunoprecipitated with B-Raf antisera, and B-Raf activity was measured by immune complex assay. Equal amounts of His-Ras or His-Rap1 in the eluates were confirmed by Western blotting. PC12 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Rap1B. Following treatments, cells were lysed, FLAG-Rap1b was immunoprecipitated, and the GTP-loading assay was performed as described previously (33.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S.

Membrane depolarization of PC12 cells following the addition of KCl activated ERK2 in a concentration-dependent manner. (Fig.1 A). Sixty millimolar KCl induced a rapid and sustained increase in ERK activity as assessed by both immune complex kinase assay (Fig. 1 B) and phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 1 C), with maximal increases occurring at 5–10 min. This increase in ERK activity was abolished by pretreatment with the L-type calcium channel antagonist, nifedipine (5 μm), consistent with a role for calcium influx (Fig.2, A and B). Interestingly, inhibition of PKA, using either H89 (40.Engh R.A. Girod A. Kinzel V. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol.

This requirement for PKA in the actions of depolarization is consistent with the possible stimulation of calcium/calmodulin-activated adenylate cyclases. To address this, we also examined the requirement of calmodulin for the activation of ERKs by depolarization. Pretreatment with W13, a calmodulin antagonist (43.Hidaka H. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), blocked the depolarization-mediated increase in ERK activation (Fig.2 D). In contrast, W12, a structurally related, inactive analog of W13 (43.Hidaka H. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), had no effect. Finally, this PKA-dependent activation of ERKs appeared specific for depolarization; ERK activation by ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, was unaffected by pretreatment with H89 (Fig. 2 E).Figure 2Membrane depolarization activates ERKs via calcium influx, calmodulin, and PKA in PC12 cells. A, PC12 cells were treated with KCl (60 mm, 10 min) alone, following a pretreatment with H89 (10 μm) or nifedipine (5 μm). Equal amounts of cell lysate were assayed for ERK activity by either ERK2 immune complex kinase assay (upper panel) or Western blotting with phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (lower panels). Blots were stripped and reprobed with ERK1/2 antibody (lower panel). B, the data from multiple ERK2 immune complex kinase assay experiments are shown as -fold activation over basal (untreated cells) (n = 3 ± S.E.). Black bars, KCl alone; hatched bars, KCl plus H89;white bars, KCl plus nifedipine. C, PC12 cells were left untreated as control (cont) or treated with KCl (60 mm) or forskolin (10 μm) (Forsk.) for 10 min in the presence or absence of the PKA inhibitor KT5720 (1 μm). Cells were harvested, and immune complex kinase assays were performed. A representative autoradiogram is shown. D, PC12 cells were treated with KCl (60 mm) for 10 min either in the absence (cont) or presence of W12 (50 μm) or W13 (50 μm). Western blots were performed using either phospho-ERK1/2 or ERK1/2 antibodies. E, PC12 cells were treated with ionomycin (5 μm), with or without H89 pretreatment (10 μm), for 5 min as indicated, and Western blots were performed using phospho-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further examined this requirement for PKA in the activation of ERKs in two other neuronal model systems. We first looked at PC12 cells that had been neuronally differentiated by culturing for 10 days in the presence of nerve growth factor. As with undifferentiated cells, depolarization of neuronal PC12 cells also activated ERKs in a PKA-dependent manner as assessed by H89 inhibition of ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). We next examined the actions of depolarization in dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures. Using immunofluorescence, we found that depolarization of neurons for 10 min induced a marked increased in the phosphorylation of ERKs both within the soma and dendrites (Fig. 3, B andC). Interestingly, ERK phosphorylation appeared largely absent from axons (data not shown). Pretreatment with H89 inhibited this activation of ERKs (Fig. 3, B and C). This requirement for PKA in ERK phosphorylation within hippocampal neurons was further confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 3 C(iii)). Taken together, these data suggest that the PKA-dependent activation of ERKs may be a common target for calcium influx signaling in neuronal systems. Previous studies have identified Raf-1 as the primary Raf isoform involved in signaling to ERKs, particularly with respect to growth factor actions in nonneuronal cells. In contrast, B-Raf is the major neuronal Raf isoform, being highly expressed within the CNS and PC12 cells. The involvement of these Raf isoforms in neuronal calcium-mediated signaling has not been well established. We therefore examined the contribution of these two isoforms to depolarization-induced calcium signaling. Membrane depolarization of PC12 cells activated B-Raf, an effect that was completely blocked by pretreatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig.4 A). In contrast, Raf-1 was not activated by depolarization, even in cells where depolarization induced a robust phosphorylation of ERKs (Fig. 4 B). B-Raf can be activated by both Ras and Rap1. The mechanism by which this occurs involves the recruitment of B-Raf by either active Rap1 or Ras to the membrane, where it can then subsequently be stimulated. A requirement for PKA in the activation of ERKs suggests a possible role for Rap1. Thus, we next determined the relative contribution of Rap- and Ras-dependent pathways by first examining a requisite step in B-Raf activation: association of the kinase with its upstream small G-protein activator. Membrane depolarization of PC12 cells led to a strong association of Rap1 with B-Raf (Fig.5 A (i)). This effect was similar to that seen with RapV12, a constitutively activated mutant of Rap1. Furthermore, the B-Raf that associated with Rap1 was capable of phosphorylating MEK-1 (Fig. 5 A (ii)). In contrast, while NGF led to a robust association of Ras with B-Raf, membrane depolarization had no effect (Fig. 5 B(i)). The data above suggest that calcium influx may target a Rap1-dependent signaling pathway. Therefore, we directly examined the activation of Rap1 by monitoring GTP loading. Depolarization of PC12 cells led to a marked increase in Rap1 GTP loading (Fig. 6 A). This effect was similar in magnitude to that observed with both the activator of adenylate cyclase, forskolin, and the constitutively active form of Rap1, RapV12 (Fig. 6 A). Moreover, the depolarization-induced stimulation of Rap1 was completely reversed by pretreatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 6 B). The present study describes a novel mechanism by which calcium influx may stimulate ERKs in neurons (Fig.7). Depolarization of PC12 cells, which stimulates calcium influx via L-type calcium channels induced the binding and activation of B-Raf by Rap1. Moreover, the stimulation of both Rap1 and B-Raf occurred via PKA. The major downstream consequence of Rap1/B-Raf signaling is the stimulation of ERKs (33.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that activation of ERKs following depolarization-mediated calcium influx in both PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons occurred via a PKA-dependent pathway. This is consistent with the involvement of a Rap1/B-Raf signaling cascade. While previous studies have either shown or inferred a role for Ras/Raf1 signaling to ERKs in neurons, the present data identify the Rap1/B-Raf pathway as an important additional target for neuronal calcium signaling. Both proteins are highly expressed in the CNS, possibly at postsynaptic sites. Additionally, B-Raf expression is specifically up-regulated during long term potentiation (44.Thomas K.L. Laroche S. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V. Hunt S.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 737-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As such, the Rap1/B-Raf pathway may be an important regulator of activity-dependent neuronal function. Although a requirement for Ras in calcium-induced ERK activation has been previously reported (9.Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E.

There are two IgA isotypes in the human system, IgA1 and IgA2, encoded by two different genes, one in each of the two duplication units that compose the human immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (5.Flanagan J.G.

Both genes contain, upstream of their switch regions, almost identical TGF-β1 responsive promoter/enhancer elements designated intron (I) α1 and Iα2, respectively (6.Nilsson L. Islam K.B. Olafsson O.

The importance of the I region promoter/enhancer elements for proper guiding of a given immunoglobulin heavy chain locus toward a certain class has been repeatedly illustrated by elegant gene targeting experiments where disruption of I region elements prevented rearrangement of the targeted alleles (10.Snapper C.M.

A portion of the above sequences, containing a directly repeated motif (referred to as TβRE) for TGF-β responsive element (12.Lin Y.C. Stavnezer J. J.

The AML proteins, also known as core-binding factors (CBF) (15.Wang S. Wang Q. Crute B.E. Melnikova I.N. Keller S.R. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell.

Three α chains are encoded by the AML1 (CBFA2/PEBP2αB), AML2(CBFA3/PEBP2αC), and AML3(CBFA1/PEBP2αA) genes and one β subunit is encoded by the PEBP2β (CBFβ) gene. The α subunits contain the DNA binding runt homology domains, as well as sequences necessary for association with the β subunit and trans-activation, whereas the β subunit does not bind DNA but increases the strength of the DNA binding of the AML α subunits (15.Wang S.

Studies conducted during the last few years have demonstrated that a family of molecules known as Smad proteins mediate intracellular signaling for the TGF-β superfamily of secreted polypeptides, which includes the TGF-βs, the activins, and the bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) (18.Heldin C-H.

Smads are composed of an N-terminal Mad homology domain-1 and a C-terminal MH2 domain connected with a proline-rich linker region.

Smad2 and Smad3 interact with and thus mediate signaling from the activin type IB receptor (ActR-1B/ALK-4), the TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I/ALK-5), and orphan ALK-7.

Following their phoshorylation the R-Smads form complexes with Co-Smads,i.e. Smad4, which translocate into the nucleus and regulate transcription.

Here we demonstrate that the Iα1 promoter contains an array of interspersed functional Smad and AML-binding sites that mediate in a cooperative manner the TGF-β responsiveness of this element. Our findings extend the repertoire of Smad interacting transcription factors and provide the framework for characterizing the signals that regulate the interplay between AMLs and Smads in the context of the Iα1 promoter and other promoter/enhancer elements that contain neighboring AML- and Smad-binding sites.

The calcineurin-mediated nuclear localization of NFATc is opposed by poorly defined protein kinases that act either to directly antagonize nuclear import or, alternatively, to promote nuclear export. Here, we provide evidence that the cellular protein kinases JNK, ERK, p38, and CK2 (formerly casein kinase II) are involved in the regulation of NFATc subcellular localization. We show that JNK, ERK, and p38 physically associate with the NFATc N-terminal regulatory domain and can directly phosphorylate functionally important residues involved in regulating NFATc subcellular localization, namely Ser172 and the conserved NFATc Ser-Pro repeats. Moreover, we found that overexpression of JNK, ERK, or p38 is able to block ionomycin-induced NFATc nuclear translocation, whereas treatment of cells with both PD98059 and SB202190, which inhibit MAPK/SAPK signaling pathways, is sufficient to trigger NFATc nuclear localization. Finally, we show that CK2 also binds the N terminus of NFATc and phosphorylates functionally important amino acid residues, including a conserved amino acid motif located downstream of each of the NFATc Ser-Pro repeats that appears to be important for regulating NFATc nuclear export.

The NFAT (nuclear factor ofactivated T cells) transcription factor family plays a pivotal role in this process and is involved in the expression of a number of immunologically important genes, including the cytokines IL-2,1 IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as several cell-surface molecules such as CD40L and FasL (2.Crabtree G.R.

In most cases, NFAT target genes have not been identified in these latter cell types, although it is apparent that NFAT acts as a calcium-dependent transcription factor and serves to couple gene expression to changes in intracellular calcium levels. NFAT family members appear to be regulated primarily at the level of their subcellular localization and are located exclusively in the cytoplasm of resting T cells (2.Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A.

In response to antigen receptor signaling, the calcium-regulated phosphatase calcineurin acts to directly dephosphorylate NFAT proteins, causing their rapid translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they cooperatively bind their target sequences together with AP-1 proteins and initiate transcription (16.Clipstone N.A.

It is now apparent that the regulation of NFAT subcellular localization is a highly dynamic process. In fact, NFAT proteins are able to rapidly shuttle between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in response to quantitative changes in the intracellular calcium concentration (21.Shibasaki F.

Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In this respect, the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT are counteracted by, as yet, poorly defined NFAT kinase(s), which act to phosphorylate NFAT proteins, thereby either directly antagonizing their nuclear translocation or, alternatively, promoting their export from the nucleus back into the cytoplasm (18.Ruff V.A.

Consequently, the nuclear localization of NFAT proteins is absolutely dependent upon the sustained activity of the calcium/calcineurin signaling pathway, which is required to counteract the actions of the NFAT kinase(s) and to maintain NFAT in a predominantly dephosphorylated state and hence nuclear location. In the absence of sustained calcineurin activity, nuclear NFAT proteins are rapidly rephosphorylated and exported back into the cytoplasm (18.Ruff V.A. Leach K.L. J. Biol.

As a direct result, the level of NFAT-dependent gene expression is exquisitely sensitive to temporal changes in the intracellular calcium concentration (30.Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C.

Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 40.Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, most, if not all, of the sites of regulatory phosphorylation are found within this domain (36.Beals C.R. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified a number of conserved sequence motifs located within this region that appear to be important sites of regulatory phosphorylation and to play important roles in the calcineurin-mediated regulation of NFAT subcellular localization (28.Chow C. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar,29.Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G.

It has been proposed that the phosphorylation status of these conserved sequence motifs modifies the activity of the two redundant NFAT NLSs and so determines the subcellular distribution of NFAT proteins. In this study, we have focused our attention on the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution of one member of the NFAT family, namely NFATc. First, we show that the MAPK/SAPKs JNK, ERK, and p38 physically associate with the NFATc N terminus and directly phosphorylate functionally important amino acid residues involved in the regulation of NFATc subcellular localization. Second, we provide in vivo evidence to suggest that the JNK, ERK, and p38 protein kinases act to antagonize NFATc nuclear localization by showing that treatment of cells with inhibitors of MAPK/SAPK signaling pathways is sufficient to trigger NFATc nuclear localization, whereas overexpression of JNK, ERK, or p38 is able to block ionomycin-induced NFATc nuclear translocation. Finally, we show that CK2 also binds the N terminus of NFATc and phosphorylates functionally important amino acid residues, including the highly conserved Ser-Pro repeat-associated (S/T)XX(E/D)(E/D) motif that appears to be important for regulating NFATc nuclear export. Collectively, these studies afford new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of NFATc subcellular localization. COS and Jurkat T cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2. For transfections, cells (107) were resuspended in 0.4 ml of growth medium and placed into an electroporation cuvette (0.4-cm gap; Bio-Rad) together with the indicated amount of plasmid DNA. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, cells were exposed to an electric field of either 250 V (Jurkat) or 230 V (COS) at a capacitance of 960 microfarads (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad) and, after a 5-min recovery period, were replated in growth medium and placed at 37 °C. The wild-type FLAG epitope-tagged NFATc expression construct in the mammalian expression vector pBJ5 has been previously described (36.Beals C.R. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions in NFATc were generated by in vitromutagenesis using overlap extension polymerase chain reaction, and DNA fragments containing the desired mutations were subcloned into the relevant NFATc construct using appropriate restriction enzyme sites. All constructs made by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis were verified by DNA sequencing. GST-SRD/SP123 and GST-S187A/SP123 were generated by introducing a DraIII/SfiI fragment of either wild-type NFATc or NFATc-S187A, respectively, encoding amino acids 139–313, in frame with glutathione S-transferase in vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GlutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins were purified from bacterial cell lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate a polyhistidine-tagged version of the NFATc N terminus, amino acids 2–418 of NFATc were introduced into pQE-31 (QIAGEN Inc.) in frame with a 6-histidine N-terminal epitope tag. The polyhistidine-tagged NFATc N terminus (His-CΔ418) was purified from bacterial cell lysates under denaturing conditions and renatured exactly according to the manufacturer's instructions. pEFplinkV12Rac and pEXV3MAPKK217E/221E (constitutively active MEK) were provided by D. A. Cantrell; pcDNA3-MKK6b(E) (constitutively active MKK6) was provided by J. Han; and pMT2-HASAPKp46β1 (HA-JNK3), pMT3-ERK1 (HA-ERK1), and pMT3-p38α (HA-p38α) were generous gifts of J. Kyriakis. The constitutively active calcineurin construct pBJ5-CNmut has been previously described (41.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For NFATc association with MAPK/SAPK family members, whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared by lysis in WCE buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.3m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin) from COS cells transiently transfected with 3 μg of expression vector for HA-JNK3, HA-ERK1, or HA-p38α. The WCEs were diluted with an equal volume of 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) and incubated with 10 μg of His-CΔ418 coupled to Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (QIAGEN Inc.) or, as a control, Ni2+-NTA beads alone. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 150 mmNaCl, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 mm imidazole), and specifically bound material was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed using the 12CA5 mAb (1:1000 dilution of ascites) followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and visualized with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Association of NFATc with endogenous CK2 was performed essentially as described above, except that nontransfected COS WCEs were used for the binding assays, and CK2 was detected by immunoblotting with a CK2α-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and visualized by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and ECL. For all subcellular localization studies, COS cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and cultured in LabTekII chamber slides (Nunc) for 36–48 h prior to stimulation. Cells were stimulated with either medium alone or medium containing ionomycin (2 μm) or ionomycin + FK506 (10 ng/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. A final concentration of 10 mm CaCl2 was added to the media of all COS cell stimulations containing ionomycin, except the JNK/ERK/p38 overexpression studies, where 5 mmCaCl2 was used. For kinase inhibitor studies, cells were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with PD98059 (20 μm), SB202190 (40 μm), a combination of both drugs, or an equivalent amount of Me2SO as a vehicle control. For studies involving the export of NFATc from the nucleus, cells were stimulated with ionomycin for 30 min to ensure complete nuclear translocation, washed once with medium, and then treated with medium containing FK506 (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. After the indicated treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated with the anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) at 1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline and 1% bovine serum albumin followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals) at 15 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline and 1% bovine serum albumin. Slides were washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline between antibody steps and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Labs, Inc.). Immunofluorescent cells were visualized with a Nikon Optiphot fluorescent microscope. Quantitation of the data was performed by scoring cells for their patterns of NFATc subcellular localization. Approximately 150 individual cells were counted in triplicate for each determination, and the data are representative of numerous independent experiments. As an additional control, the expression of each of the various NFATc constructs was verified by immunoblot analysis to check for equivalent levels of expression. Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of the indicated expression construct together with 3 μg of an NFAT-luciferase reporter construct in which three copies of the human IL-2 antigen receptor response element-2 site are located upstream of the luciferase gene (23.Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.5 μg of pRL-TK (Promega) to control for transfection efficiencies. Cells were stimulated 36 h post-transfection with medium alone, PMA (50 ng/ml; Calbiochem), or PMA + ionomycin (2 μm; Calbiochem). After 8 h, the cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cell lysates were prepared. Luciferase assays were performed according to protocols for the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and analyzed using a Turner Designs Model TD-20/20 luminometer. After controlling for transfection efficiencies, data are presented as the mean percent of maximal stimulation observed with ionomycin + PMA of triplicate determinations and are representative of at least three independent experiments. For kinase assays involving MAPK/SAPKs, active kinases were immunoprecipitated from COS cells transfected with the relevant HA-tagged kinase and its corresponding upstream activator. Thus, COS cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of HA-JNK3 + 3 μg of V12Rac, 3 μg of HA-ERK1 + 3 μg of constitutively active MEK, or 3 μg of HA-p38α + 3 μg of constitutively active MKK6 and lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin), and the active kinases were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with the 12CA5 mAb coupled to protein G-Sepharose. The beads were washed extensively with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer + 1m NaCl, and immune complex kinase assays were performed in immunoprecipitation kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) with 1 μg of synthetic peptide substrate and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heating to 100 °C, fractionated on 16.5% Tris/Tricine Ready-Gels (Bio-Rad), fixed, dried under vacuum, and analyzed by autoradiography. For peptide maps involving CK2 phosphorylation of NFATc, 250 units of rCK2 (New England Biolabs Inc.) was used in in vitro kinase assays using GST-SRD/SP123 or GST-S187A/SP123 fusion protein as substrate (5 μg). Reactions were carried out in 20 μl of CK2 kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C and were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heating to 100 °C. Samples were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and gels were fixed, dried under vacuum, and analyzed by autoradiography. Radiolabeled species were eluted from the dried gel, oxidized with performic acid, digested with chymotrypsin (Worthington), and resolved by thin-layer electrophoresis in the first dimension with pH 1.9 buffer followed by ascending thin-layer chromatography in phospho chromatography buffer in the second dimension exactly as described previously (42.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). CK2 phosphorylation of NFATc peptides was performed using 250 units of rCK2 in 20 μl of CK2 kinase buffer and 1 μg of SP1 or SP1-T214A/T215A peptide for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were fractionated on 10–20% gradient Tris/Tricine Ready-Gels, fixed, dried under vacuum, and analyzed by autoradiography. The wild-type NFATc peptides SRD (YRDPSCLSPASSLSSRSCNSEASSYESN) and SP1 (YASPQTSPWQSPCVSPKTTDPEEGF) as well as the mutant peptides SRD-S172A (YRDPSCLAPASSLSSRSCNSEASSYESN) and SP1-T214A/T215A (YASPQTSPWQSPCVSPKAADPEEGF) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Synergy 432A peptide synthesizer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The N-terminal region of NFATc contains several highly conserved serine-rich motifs that are thought to be important sites of regulatory phosphorylation and to be involved in the regulation of NFATc subcellular localization (36.Beals C.R. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These motifs are referred to as the SRD, located between amino acids 166 and 194, and the three Ser-Pro repeats (SP1, SP2, and SP3), located at amino acids 199–219, 229–249 and 278–298, respectively (Fig.1). Inspection of these conserved motifs reveals the presence of several conserved substrate recognition sites for a number of well characterized cellular protein kinases.

In T cells, it colocalizes with the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)·CD3 complex in antigen-stimulated T cells and is involved in the transcriptional activation of the interleukin-2 gene. In the present study, we report that PKCθ is tyrosine phosphorylated in Jurkat T cells upon TCR·CD3 activation. The Src family protein-tyrosine kinase, Lck, was critical in TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ. Lck phosphorylated and was associated with the regulatory domain of PKCθ both in vitro and in intact cells. This association was constitutive, but it was enhanced by T cell activation, with both Src-homology 2 and Src-homology 3 domains of Lck contributing to it. Tyrosine 90 (Tyr-90) in the regulatory domain of PKCθ was identified as the major phosphorylation site by Lck. A constitutively active mutant of PKCθ (A148E) could enhance proliferation of Jurkat T cells and synergized with ionomycin to induce nuclear factor of T cells activity. However, mutation of Tyr-90 into phenylalanine markedly reduced (or abolished) these activities. These results suggest that Lck plays an important role in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ, which may in turn modulate the physiological functions of PKCθ during TCR-induced T cell activation.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar and 2.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Products of the 10 known mammalian PKC genes are classified into four subfamilies of Ca2+-dependent (or conventional, PKCα, -β, and -γ), Ca2+-independent (or novel, PKCδ, -ε, -η, and -θ), atypical (PKCζ and ι/λ), and PKCμ/D enzymes. Activity of PKC enzymes is regulated by phosphorylation and binding of defined cofactors. Enzyme activation is associated with its redistribution among different cellular compartments, commonly from the cytosolic to the particulate (membrane) fraction. Studies indicate that PKC is also important during T cell activation. This is indicated by the ability of physiological T cell receptor (TCR) ligands to activate PKC and induce its translocation from the cytosol to the particulate fraction; by the ability of PKC inhibitors, or PKC depletion by prolonged phorbol ester treatment, to block lymphocyte signaling and activation; by the requirement for persistent PKC activation during mitogenic T cell activation; and, finally, by the diminished TCR·CD3-mediated proliferation in PKC-deficient T cells (reviewed in Ref. 3.Altman A. Coggeshall K.M. Mustelin T. Adv. Immunol. 1990; 48: 227-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKCθ is a novel Ca2+-independent PKC isoform. It is characterized by a unique tissue distribution, i.e. in skeletal muscle, lymphoid organs, and hematopoietic cell lines, in particular T cells (4.Osada S. Mizuno K. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kuroki T. Ohno S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3930-3938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Baier G. Telford D. Giampa L. Coggeshall K.M. Baier-Bitterlich G. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol.

Liu Y.C. Collins T.L. Bonnefoy-Bérard N. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that among several PKC isoforms tested, only PKCθ was capable of significantly stimulating Ras-dependent transcription from an AP-1 element in EL4 leukemic T cells (10.Baier-Bitterlich G. Übberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grünicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKCθ also specifically cooperates with calcineurin and plays a critical role in c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation and induction of the interleukin-2 gene (11.Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 12.Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Bauer B. Altman A. Utermann G. Uberall F. Baier G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicated that among different T cell-expressed PKC isoforms, PKCθ was the only one to colocalize precisely with the TCR·CD3 complex in the contact region between antigen-specific T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Importantly, this colocalization occurred at a high stoichiometry and correlated with positive activation signals leading to proliferation, as opposed to activation conditions, which result in anergy or apoptosis (13.Monks C.R.F. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 14.Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that PKCθ plays specialized role(s) in T cells as a specific constituent of signaling cascades that are involved in TCR·CD3-mediated T cell activation. One of the earliest signaling events in T cell activation via the TCR·CD3 complex is the activation of the Src and Syk families of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), which in turn leads to the phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins (15.Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). There is evidence that cross-talk among PTKs and Ser/Thr kinases occurs commonly in different cell types and serves as an important regulatory mechanism. In this regard, recent studies have shown that a novel PKC, PKCδ, can be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon activation (16.Li W., Yu, J.C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the close structural relationship between PKCδ and PKCθ (5.Baier G. Telford D. Giampa L. Coggeshall K.M. Baier-Bitterlich G. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4997-5004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the finding that PKCθ colocalizes to the activated TCR complex (which includes activated PTKs) in antigen-specific T cells (13.Monks C.R.F. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), we have decided to examine whether PKCθ can become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Anti-Lck and -glutathioneS-transferase (GST) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An anti-phosphotyrosine Tyr(P) mAb (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and the anti-PKCθ mAb was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-human CD3 mAb, OKT3, was purified from culture supernatants of the corresponding hybridoma by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. The anti-hemagglutinin (clone 12CA5) and -Xpress™ tag mAbs were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), respectively. A goat anti-mouse Ig antibody was obtained from Pierce. GST fusion proteins containing the amino-terminal SH2 and SH3 or the combined amino-terminal, SH2, and SH3 domains of Lck (GST-Lck/N, GST-Lck/SH2, GST-Lck/SH3, and GST-Lck/N+3+2, respectively) were generated as described previously (17.Amrein K.E.

A GST-PKCθ-RD fusion protein was prepared by cloning the corresponding cDNA into the pGEX-5X-1 Escherichia coli expression vector and purifying the expressed, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced protein on glutathione-Sepharose beads (22.Bonnefoy-Bérard N.

The NFAT/AP-1 and AP-1-luciferase reporter constructs were provided by G. Crabtree and M. Karin, respectively. A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene driven by five repeats of the NFAT site (κ3 element) derived from the tumor necrosis factor α promoter was obtained from A. Rao. Jurkat-TAg and COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 5–10 μg of cDNA by electroporation (260 V, 950 microfarads). Cells were cultured for 48–60 h before they were used in various assays. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm NaPP, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. Cell lysates were mixed with antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for an additional hour. Binding reactions containing 10 μg of GST fusion proteins and cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled in 30 μl of sample buffer for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature. After a brief wash, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-1 cells transiently transfected with Lck were lysed, and Lck was immunoprecipitated from 1 × 106 cells as described above. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer and one time in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg of peptide substrate were added to immunoprecipitates and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by placing the samples on ice. After a brief spin, 25 μl of the reaction supernatant were transferred to SpinZyme phosphocellulose units (Pierce) and washed as per the manufacturer's instructions. 32PO4incorporation was determined in a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. Jurkat-TAg cells were transfected with 5 μg of the appropriate reporter plasmid together with 5 μg of the indicated expression plasmids. Identical amounts of the corresponding empty vectors were used as controls. Transfection efficiencies were monitored by cotransfection of a thymidine kinase promoter luciferase reporter and using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured for 24 h and either left unstimulated or activated for the final 6 h of culture with the indicated stimuli. The cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined as described previously (23.Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as normalized luciferase activity of triplicate samples. Jurkat-Tag cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmid and plated on 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well). Cells were cultured for 48 h, pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for the last 6 h, and then harvested. [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined in a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. Recent studies have shown that activation of different receptors leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in various cell types (16.Li W., Yu, J.C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because of the similarity between PKCδ and PKCθ we have decided to examine whether PKCθ can also become phosphorylated on tyrosine. As shown in Fig.1 A, PKCθ from resting Jurkat T cells contained a low level of Tyr(P). Anti-CD3 or pervanadate stimulation caused a marked increase in this phosphorylation. Unlike PKCδ in a murine myeloid progenitor cell line 32D (16.Li W., Yu, J.C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PKCθ was not phosphorylated on tyrosine in Jurkat T cells when stimulated with phorbol ester. To determine the kinetics of OKT3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ, Jurkat T cells were either left unstimulated or treated with OKT3 for different times. As shown in Fig. 1 B, OKT3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ peaked at 1 min, decreased thereafter, and returned to the baseline level within 30 min. To determine which T cell-expressed PTKs mediate the phosphorylation of PKCθ, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with PKCθ plus Lck, Fyn, ZAP-70, Syk, Itk (Emt), or combinations of Lck plus ZAP-70 or Lck plus Itk. PKCθ was immunoprecipitated, and its tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. All these tyrosine kinases, with the exception of Lck, did not induce detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ (data not shown). As shown in Fig.1 C, PKCθ was phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) in cells coexpressing Lck. This phosphorylation was not present in PKCθ plus empty vector-cotransfected cells. Moreover, immunoprecipitated endogenous PKCθ was phosphorylated in vitro on tyrosine by purified Lck (Fig. 1 D). PKCθ expression in the immunoprecipitates was monitored by immunoblotting and was found to be equivalent among different groups in each experiment (Fig. 1,bottom panels). Several recent studies reported that PKCδ associates with Src family PTKs, and is phosphorylated on tyrosine, in transformed cells (28.Zang Q. Lu Z. Curto M. Barile N. Shalloway D. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13275-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29.Shanmugam M. Krett N.L. Peters C.A. Maizels E.T. Murad F.M. Kawakatsu H. Rosen S.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and in activated mast cells (27.Song J.S. Swann P.G. Szallasi Z. Blank U. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKCθ associates with Lck, we first performed in vitro binding assays using GST-Lck fusion proteins. Whole cell lysates from unstimulated, OKT3-, or pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells were incubated with GST alone, GST-Lck/N+3+2 (amino acid residues 1–244), GST-Lck/SH2 (residues 120–226), GST-Lck/SH3 (residues 54–120), or GST-Lck/N (residues 1–95). The precipitates were then analyzed with an anti-PKCθ antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, endogenous PKCθ from unstimulated cells was precipitated by GST-Lck/N+2+3, GST-Lck/SH2, and GST-Lck/SH3 proteins, but not by GST or GST-Lck/N. The association between PKCθ and GST-Lck/N+2+3 was enhanced when the cells were stimulated with pervanadate, whereas the association between PKCθ and GST-Lck/SH3 or GST-Lck/SH2 was enhanced by either OKT3 or pervanadate stimulation. Conversely, a GST-PKCθ-RD fusion protein (amino acids 1–378) was capable of binding Lck present in T cell lysates (Fig. 2 B). To address the question whether Lck and PKCθ associate with each other in vivo, Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with Lck and PKCθ expression plasmids. Probing of Lck immunoprecipitates from these cells with an anti-PKCθ mAb revealed that PKCθ coimmunoprecipitated with Lck; however, the amount of PKCθ associated with Lck did not change following anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig.2 C). When the reverse experiments were conducted using the anti-PKCθ mAb for immunoprecipitation, no Lck could be detected in association with PKCθ. It is possible that our immunoprecipitating antibody, which binds to the amino-terminal region of PKCθ, disrupts the association between Lck and PKCθ, because we found that the regulatory domain of PKCθ is involved in the interaction with Lck (Fig. 2 B). Overlay binding experiments were next carried out to examine whether the association between PKCθ and Lck is direct. Endogenous PKCθ from Jurkat cells was immunoprecipitated and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with GST-Lck fusion proteins, and membrane-bound fusion proteins were detected with an anti-GST mAb. As shown in Fig. 3, the SH3, SH2, and the full regulatory domain of Lck (Lck/N+3+2) bound directly to PKCθ. This binding was not significantly affected by stimulation, with the exception of pervanadate stimulation, which enhanced the binding of the Lck SH2 domain to the membrane-bound PKCθ. To address the role of Lck versus ZAP-70 in the phosphorylation of PKCθ, we compared the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ in wild-type Jurkat T to that occurring in two mutant Jurkat cell lines, i.e. Lck-deficient (J.CaM1.6 (18.Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar)) or ZAP-70-deficient (P116 (19.Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar)) Jurkat T cells. As shown in Fig.4, the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ was abrogated in the Lck-deficient cells, whereas the OKT3- or pervanadate-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation was greatly reduced in the same cells. In contrast, the basal as well as the prominent pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ was maintained in P116 cells, but its anti-CD3-induced phosphorylation was reduced to a level approaching the basal one. These data suggest that Lck plays a critical role in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ in T cells and that ZAP-70 may contribute to this event under basal conditions or in anti-CD3-stimulated cells, although it is largely dispensable for the pervanadate-induced phosphorylation of PKCθ. To map the site(s) in PKCθ phosphorylated by Lck, we first determined whether the RD, the CD, or both can be phosphorylated by Lck in transiently transfected cells. The regulatory domain of PKCθ was prominently phosphorylated on tyrosine in COS-1 cells coexpressing Lck (Fig. 5 A, left panels), whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of the catalytic domain was not detectable under the same conditions (Fig. 5 A,right panels). Next, a series of PKCθ-derived 15-mer peptides containing the various tyrosine residues present in the regulatory domain were used as substrates in in vitro Lck kinase assays. All of these peptides contained tyrosine in the center position, with the exception of the peptide representing Tyr-237 and Tyr-239 (Fig. 5 B). Only the peptide containing Tyr-90 was a good substrate for Lck isolated by immunoprecipitation from Lck-overexpressing COS-1 cells (Fig. 5 C). To determine whether Tyr-90, which is located in the V1 region within the regulatory domain of PKCθ, represents a substrate for Lck in intact cells, we replaced this tyrosine residue with phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis and then compared the tyrosine phosphorylation of this mutant versus wild-type PKCθ in transfected COS-1 or Jurkat cells. Both full-length PKCθ and its regulatory domain were assayed in these experiments. When cotransfected with Lck into COS-1 cells, the level of Tyr(P) in both the regulatory domain (Fig. 6 A, top left panel) and the full-length (Fig. 6 A, top right panel) Y90F-mutated proteins was markedly reduced (≥90%) in comparison with the corresponding wild-type PKCθ proteins, despite the similar expression levels of both PKCθ (middle panels) and Lck (bottom panels) in the two transfected groups. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ was not observed in cells transfected with empty vector instead of Lck (data not shown; Fig.1 C). Similarly, the anti-CD3- or pervanadate-induced tyrosine phsophorylation of the transfected PKCθ-RD in Jurkat T cells was greatly reduced when Tyr-90 was mutated to phenylalanine (Fig.6 B, top panel). All groups expressed similar levels of the transfected PKCθ-RD (bottom panel). Together, these experiments reveal that Tyr-90 in the regulatory domain of PKCθ is most likely the major phosphorylation site for Lck. To determine whether phosphorylation of Tyr-90 is important for the proper function of PKCθ in T cells, we compared two forms of constitutively active PKCθ (A148E), i.e. one containing the wild-type Tyr-90 and another in which the Y90F mutation has been introduced, in several functional assays. First, we evaluated the effect of mutating Tyr-90 on the in vitro catalytic activity of transfected PKCθ immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-1 cells (which do not express endogenous PKCθ), using myelin basic protein as a substrate. No significant differences were detected between wild-type and Y90F-mutated PKCθ either in the presence or absence of lipid cofactors (data not shown). Next, we evaluated the effect of the mutation on two downstream events that we recently found to be selectively induced by PKCθ, i.e. enhanced proliferation of Jurkat T cells; and second, we activated the NFAT-luciferase reporter gene in conjunction with a second signal provided by Ca2+ ionophore. As shown in Fig.7 A, the constitutively active PKCθ mutant containing Tyr-90 enhanced the proliferation of Jurkat cells by ∼50%. The actual level of enhancement is most likely considerably higher given the fact that only a relatively small fraction of the cells actually expresses the A148E mutant under these transient transfection conditions. Under the same conditions, the double PKCθ mutant (A148E/Y90F) was devoid of this activity. Similarly, the A148E/Y90F double mutant was deficient in inducing the activity of a reporter gene driven by an NFAT/AP-1 element derived from the interleukin-2 gene promoter (Fig. 7 B). These deficiencies did not reflect lower expression of the Y90F mutant, because immunoblotting with a tag-specific antibody indicated that the Y90F mutant was expressed as well as, or even better than, the single A148E mutant (Fig. 7, A and B, bottom panels). To further evaluate the specificity of this effect, as well as rule out the possibility that mutation of Tyr-90 nonselectively inactivates the enzyme or confers upon it a dominant-negative phenotype, we compared the ability of the same PKCθ mutants to activate reporter genes driven by isolated AP-1 or NFAT response elements. The results demonstrate that the double mutant was fully active in inducing AP-1 activity (Fig. 7 C) but was deficient relative to the single A/E mutant in stimulating NFAT activity (Fig. 7 D). These results indicate that Tyr-90 in PKCθ plays a role in NFAT, but not AP-1, activation and, furthermore, that the Tyr-90-mutated PKCθ does not behave in a nonselective inhibitory manner. Protein kinase C isozymes consist of an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a highly conserved carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. The activation and localization of PKC enzymes are regulated by the binding of lipid cofactors and, in the case of conventional PKCs, also Ca2+, to the regulatory domain of PKC (2.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). PKC is also regulated by trans- and autophosphorylation on serine and threonine residues in the activation loop and the carboxyl-terminal region of the catalytic domain, modifications that are necessary for processing catalytically competent enzymes and for the correct subcellular localization of PKC (30.Newton A.C.

Pex8p is tightly associated with the lumenal face of the peroxisomal membrane. Consistent with its intraperoxisomal localization, Pex8p contains a peroxisomal targeting signal 1, and it interacts with the PTS1 receptor Pex5p. However, the Pex5p/Pex8p association is also observed upon deletion of the PTS1 of Pex8p, suggesting that Pex8p contains a second binding site for Pex5p. The pex8Δ mutant phenotype and the observed PTS1-independent interaction with the PTS1 receptor suggest that Pex8p is involved in protein import into the peroxisomal matrix. In pex8Δ cells, the PTS1 and PTS2 receptor still associate with membrane bound components of the protein import machinery, supporting the assumption that the Pex8p function in protein translocation follows the docking event.

Proteins destined for the peroxisomal matrix are synthesized on free polyribosomes and are imported posttranslationally in pre-existing organelles (1.Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Two well characterized peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1 and PTS2)1 are responsible for the sorting of matrix proteins to the organelle (for review see Refs.2.Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. J. Biol.

The PTS1 sequence consists of the C-terminal tripeptide Ser-Lys-Leu and species-specific variations (for review see Ref. 5.McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 54-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The PTS2 is an N-terminal stretch of nine amino acids with the consensus sequence RLX 5(H/Q)L and thus far is found in only a few peroxisomal proteins (for review see Refs. 6.De Hoop M.J. AB G.

Recognition of PTS1 is performed by the tetratricopeptide repeat family protein, Pex5p, whereas the PTS2 is recognized by the WD40 protein Pex7p (for review see Refs. 8.Subramani S. J. Biol.

Cells deficient in either of the two proteins display partial import deficiencies:pex5Δ cells correctly import PTS2 proteins but are affected in the import of PTS1 proteins, and pex7Δ cells exhibit the reverse phenotype (for review see Ref. 10.Elgersma Y. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The intracellular localization of both targeting signal receptors is still a matter of debate. A predominantly cytosolic, membrane-bound, or even intraperoxisomal localization has been reported for either of them (for review see Ref. 3.Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. Cell. 1995; 83: 525-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). An attractive model that reconciles the different localization of the import receptors is the “extended shuttle hypothesis” (9.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 400-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11.van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

This model is a modification of the original “hypothesis of shuttling receptors” (13.Marzioch M. Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4908-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and it suggests that the import receptors Pex5p and Pex7p bind their cargo proteins in the cytosol, dock to specific proteins at the periphery of the peroxisomal membrane, subsequently enter the peroxisome, release their cargo in the peroxisomal lumen, and shuttle back to the cytoplasm. The observation that peroxisomes are capable of importing folded and oligomeric proteins is in line with this model (for review see Ref. 5.McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 54-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). So far, two peroxisomal membrane proteins have been described that display the necessary properties to serve as peroxisomal docking sites for the PTS receptors. Pex13p, an integral peroxisomal membrane protein, specifically binds by means of its cytosolic SH3 domain to the PTS1 receptor Pex5p (14.Elgersma Y. Kwast L. Klein A. Voorn-Brouwer T. van den Berg M.

Recently, it has been reported that Pex13p also interacts with the PTS2 receptor and that the protein is required for the peroxisomal localization of Pex14p (17.Girzalsky W. Rehling P. Stein K.

Here, we describe the cloning of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PEX8 gene by functional complementation of the peroxisome biogenesis mutant pex8-1, which is characterized by the inability to grow on fatty acids as single carbon source, the absence of morphologically detectable peroxisomes, and the mislocalizaion of peroxisomal matrix proteins to the cytosol. We also identified thePEX8 gene product by sequence determination of isolated peroxisomal membrane proteins. The ScPex8 protein shows significant sequence similarity to three proteins of other yeasts that were shown to be required for peroxisome biogenesis: HpPex8p (22.Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 3: 737-749Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar), PpPex8p (23.Liu H. Tan X. Russell K.A. Veenhuis M. Cregg J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10940-10951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and YlPex8p (24.Smith J.J. Szilard R.K. Marelli M. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Even though the overall sequence identity between ScPex8p and these proteins is surprisingly low (13–21%), clusters of similarity spread over the entire length of the protein as well as thepex phenotype of the corresponding null mutant suggest that the four proteins are orthologues. The ScPEX8 gene product is characterized by the presence of a C-terminal PTS1, which, however, is not required for the targeting of Pex8p to peroxisomes. We show that ScPex8p is a peroxisomal membrane protein located at the matrix side of the membrane. Our data indicate that Pex8p is required for import of both PTS1 and PTS2 proteins; however, it seems to be dispensable for the targeting and insertion of peroxisomal membrane proteins. We provide evidence for a direct involvement of Pex8p in protein transport across the peroxisomal membrane, indicated by the fact that the PTS1 receptor Pex5p interacts with Pex8p independent of its C-terminal SKL tripeptide. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that Pex8p is a component of the peroxisomal transport machinery.

Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Complete and minimal media used for yeast culturing have been described previously (28.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). YNO medium contained 0.1% oleic acid, 0.05% Tween 40, 0.1% yeast extract and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, adjusted to pH 6.0. 0.025 g/liter CuSO4 was added to YNO medium in all experiments that required induction of the CUP1 promotor (29.Butt T.R. Sternberg E.J. Gorman J.A. Clark P. Hamer D. Rosenberg M. Crooke S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3332-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). After mutagenesis of UTL-7A cells using ethyl methanesulfonate (30.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), mutants defective in the growth on oleic acid as single carbon source were isolated (28.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Three of these mutant strains fell into the same complementation group designated pex8. The screening protocol included replica plating on YNO-agar plates, fractionation of yeast cells, and electron microscopy as described by Erdmann et al. (28.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis was performed by standard yeast techniques (31.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing, New York1992Google Scholar). Preparation and high salt extraction of peroxisomal membranes, HPLC separation of peroxisomal membrane proteins, and N-terminal sequence analysis of peroxisomal membrane proteins were performed as described (32.Erdmann R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The pex8-1mutant was used for cloning PEX8 by functional complementation with a yeast genomic library of S. cerevisiae in the Escherichia coli-yeast shuttle vector YCp50 (33.Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Transformation of S. cerevisiae was carried out by a modified lithium acetate method (34.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). Leu+transformants were replicated on YNO-agar plates. One out of about 20,000 transformants was able to grow on medium containing oleic acid as sole carbon source (YNO). Isolation of the complementing plasmid was done as described (31.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing, New York1992Google Scholar). The complementing plasmid contained a 16.0-kb insert and was designated YCpPEX8/16.0. Fragments obtained by Sau3AI digestion as well as defined restriction fragments were subcloned into the low copy CEN4-URA3plasmid pRS316 (35.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were tested for complementation by transformation of the pex8-1 mutant, selection for Ura+, and subsequent screening on YNO-agar plates for oleic acid utilization. pRSPEX8/3.2 contained a 3.2-kb genomic PvuII/SacI fragment, which comprised the full complementing activity. For sequencing, the genomic 3.2-kbPvuII/SacI fragment of plasmid pRSP6/3.2, subclones of defined restriction fragments, and DNaseI deletion fragments were introduced into pBluescript vectors (Stratagene). Sequence analysis was carried out using the dideoxy chain termination method (36.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52667) Google Scholar). The predicted protein sequence of PEX8 was used to search EMBL nucleotide sequence data base for similarities with other known protein sequences using the GENEPRO program (Riverside Scientific Enterprise, Seattle, WA) as well as Blast and FASTA programs. Hydropathy analysis was carried out according to the methods of Kyte and Doolittle (37.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17213) Google Scholar). For the construction of the PEX8 gene deletion construct (YEpGD/6), a complementing 3.5-kb KpnI/HindIII fragment of YCpPEX8/16.0 was subcloned into YEp352 (38.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) resulting in YEpPEX8/3.5. TheS. cerevisiae LEU2 gene of plasmid pJJ252 (39.Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was isolated by digestion with BamHI and XbaI and used to substitute the internal 1.65-kb BamHI/XbaI fragment of the PEX8 open reading frame leading to YEpGD/6. The LEU2 gene with flanking regions of PEX8 was isolated after digestion of YEpGD/6 with PstI andHindIII and subsequently introduced into wild-type strain UTL-7A. The resultant leucin-prototrophic transformant was crossed to wild-type XDC-10A, the diploid was induced to sporulate, and the meiotic progeny were examined by standard tetrad analysis. Crossing the original mutants with the resultant leucin-prototrophic transformant led to diploid cells that were unable to grow on YNO-agar. Plasmid YEp105 (40.Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains the polyubiquitin gene UBI4 fused downstream of the c-Myc epitope under the control of the inducible CUP1 promotor (29.Butt T.R. Sternberg E.J. Gorman J.A. Clark P. Hamer D. Rosenberg M. Crooke S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3332-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To generate myc-PEX8 fusions, the BamHI/KpnI CUP1mycUb cassette from YEp105 was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), resulting in plasmid SK/mycUb. Using theBglII site 3′ of the c-Myc and the vector-derivedKpnI site, UBI4 was replaced by a 2.2-kbBamHI/KpnI PEX8 fragment, resulting in SK/mycP6. In this c-mycPEX8 fusion, the first 54 base pairs of PEX8 open reading frame are replaced by the c-Myc epitope. The c-Myc PEX8 gene fusion under control ofCUP1 was subcloned in BamHI/KpnI restricted pRS316 (35.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and YEp352 (38.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), resulting in pRSmycPEX8-SKL and YEpmycPEX8-SKL, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the fusion protein is as follows: MCEQKLISEEDLGMQIQYDQR- Pex8p. Mutagenesis of the PTS1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: primer 1 (5′-TATATGAGCTCAGTACTTAATGATACTATAATTTTCAAGA-3′) and primer 2 (5′-TATATGAGCTCAGTACTTAATGATACTATCATTTAGAAGA-3′) (modified nucleotides are in bold type), and T3 sequencing primer (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′). The template used was a 1.2-kbClaI/SpeI fragment of PEX8 subcloned in pBluescript vector SK. Primers 1 and 2 included the PEX8 ScaI site and an additional primer-derived SacI site. Primer 1 was used to substitute the codon for serine by a stop and primer 2 for the substitution of the leucine codon by a stop. Polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ by the use of the PEX8 internalClaI and primer-derived SacI sites. Furthermore, the internal ClaI/ScaI fragment was fused to the 5′ noncoding region of PEX8 ScaI/KpnI (of plasmid SK/P6 BamHI/HindIII) by three-piece ligation into pBluescript SK+. The mutagenizedPEX8 constructs were used to replace the corresponding wild-type fragment by use of the internal ClaI and the vector-derived KpnI site of pRSmycPEX8 or YEpmycPEX8, respectively. The resulting plasmids were designated pRSmycPEX8ΔSKL (or pRSmycPEX8SKΔL) and YEpmycPEX8ΔSKL. Other plasmids are specified in the sections describing the isolation of the PEX8 gene, the two-hybrid analysis and the construction of a pex8 null allele. Recombinant DNA techniques, including enzymatic modification of DNA, fragment purification, bacterial transformation, and plasmid isolation were performed essentially as described by either Maniatis et al.(41.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) or Ausubel et al. (31.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing, New York1992Google Scholar). Organelle preparation by differential centrifugation of yeast lysates was performed as described (28.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For separation of cell organelles by density gradient centrifugation, cell lysates of wild-type and mutant strains were loaded onto continuous 20–53% (w/w) sucrose density gradients (24 ml). Centrifugation, fractionation of the gradient, and preparation of samples for SDS-PAGE were carried out as described (42.Höhfeld J. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1167-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Organellar pellets of oleate-induced wild-type and mutant strains were prepared according to the methods of Erdmannet al. (28.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and electroblotting onto nitrocellulose was carried out according to standard protocols (43.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 451-511Google Scholar). Anti-thiolase (Fox3p), anti-Pcs60p, anti-Pex3p, anti-Pex14p, anti-Pex13p, and anti-Pex17p antibodies have been described previously (18.Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A.K.W.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as the second antibody, and blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The two-hybrid assay was based on the method of Fields and Song (46.Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). The tested genes were fused to the DNA-binding domain or trans-activating domain of GAL4 in the vectors pPC86 and pPC97 (27.Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). To generate a PEX8 construct in pPC97, a BamHI/ScaI genomic fragment was isolated from pRSPEX8/3.2 and cloned into pPC97 digested with BglII and SacI (the SacI site was blunt ended with T4 polymerase). This construct (pPR6/56) encoded a Gal4-Pex8p fusion protein consisting of amino acids 19–589 of Pex8p. To generate PTS1 mutant alleles of PEX8 in the two-hybrid vector, the 3′ coding region of PEX8 with the mutation of interest was excised from pRSmycPEX8ΔSKL or pRSmycPEX8SKΔL, respectively, using the internalXhoI site and the vector KpnI site. These fragments were used to replace the corresponding wild-type portion ofPEX8 in a pUC18 (Promega)-based construct (pUC18PEX8 that contained a genomicBamHI/HindIII PEX8 fragment), again making use of the internal XhoI site and the vector-derivedKpnI site. The resulting constructs were designated pPR6/78 (encoding for the SKΔL mutation) and pPR6/82 (encoding for the ΔSKL deletion). The inserts of both pPR6/78 and pPR6/82 were subsequently excised with BamHI and SacI (derived from the mutagenesis primers see below) and subcloned intoBglII/SacI-digested pPC97. Cotransformation of two-hybrid vectors into the strain PCY2was performed according to Ref. 34.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar. Transformed yeast cells were plated onto SD synthetic medium without tryptophane and leucine. β-Galactosidase filter assays were performed according to Rehlinget al. (47.Rehling P. Marzioch M. Niesen F. Wittke E. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2901-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PEX5 truncation constructs and the luciferase two-hybrid constructs were kindly provided by Henk Tabak (48.Tabak H.F. Elgersma Y. Hettema E. Fransen M.M. Voorn-Brouwer T. Distel B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed essentially according to Ref. 49.Rout M.P. Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1913-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar with modifications described (26.Erdmann R. Yeast. 1994; 10: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CY3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were used as 6 μg/ml solutions for detection. Potassium permanganate fixation and preparation of intact yeast cells for electron microscopy were performed as described (28.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Membrane preparation from an organelle pellet enriched for peroxisomes and mitochondria has been described (50.Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For protease protection assays, an organelle pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (28.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) but without protease inhibitors. Equal amounts were incubated for 30 min on ice with increasing amounts of trypsin. The proteinase was inhibited by the addition of trypsin inhibitor and immediately precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Samples were subsequently processed for SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged Pex7p from cell lysates was performed as described (7.Rehling P. Albertini M. Kunau W.-H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with the exception that the 35,000 × g step was omitted. For immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged Pex8p from organelles, yeast cells expressing Myc-tagged Pex8p with or without C-terminal tripeptide SKL were grown on 0.3% SD medium to late log phase and, subsequently, for 15 h in YNOG (0.1% glucose, 0.1% oleic acid, 0.05% Tween 40, 0.1% yeast extract, and 0.67% yeast nitrogene base). Yeast cells were spheroplasted and homogenized, and organelles were sedimented by differential centrifugation at 25,000 × g according to Erdmann et al. (28.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins of the resulting organelle sediments were solubilized with 1.2 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm NaF, 0.02% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml of bestatin, 1.5 μg/ml of pepstatin, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin). Samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min (Sorvall AH650, 40,850 rpm). Supernatants were normalized for protein and volume and incubated with 50 μl of sheep anti-mouse Dynabeads (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany) covered with monoclonal anti-Myc IgG (51.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed five times for 10 min with 1 ml of buffer A with protease inhibitors, and Dynabead-bound proteins were eluted with 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For decoration with antibodies, 50 μl of Dynabeads were saturated with monoclonal anti-Myc antiserum at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed five times with 1 ml of buffer A and resuspended in 50 μl of buffer A with protease inhibitors. Acetyl-CoA acyltransferase (3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase; EC 2.3.1.16), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1), and fumarate hydratase (fumarase; EC 4.2.1.2) were assayed by established procedures (52.Moreno de la Garza M.

Suzuki H. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The observations that K protein also interacts with RNA and DNA suggest that K protein may do so at sites of nucleic acid-dependent processes. K protein is phosphorylated in vivo in response to treatment of cells with cytokines, acute phase reactants, and other changes in the extracellular environment (21.Schullery D.S. Ostrowski J.

Taken together, the biochemical and functional studies suggest a model where K protein serves to bridge signal transduction pathways to sites of transcription, translation, and/or RNA processing. The bridge model for K protein function predicts that inducible phosphorylation of K protein, which results from changes in the extracellular environment, modulates the interaction of K protein with its molecular partners. Here we present data that support this prediction. The human thymoma Jurkat (24.Gillis S. Watson J. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) cell line was grown in suspension. HeLa cells were grown on plastic plates (25.Davidson I. Xiao J.H. Rosales R. Staub A. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 931-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum or Fetal Clone (Hyclone), 2 mm glutamine, 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.01%), and humidified with 7% C02, 93% air gas mixture. H2O2, glutathione-agarose beads, enolase, and reduced glutathione were obtained from Sigma. Protein A/G-Sepharose was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Poly(C) RNA-agarose beads and anti-FLAG antibody (M2) were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-K protein antibody 54 was made in rabbits as described previously (22.Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J.

After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp.) for 1 h. Membranes were blocked with 20% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer for 30 min. Membranes that were used in anti-phosphotyrosine blots were blocked in TBST containing 2% bovine serum albumin. After blocking, membranes were washed three times with TBST for 5 min and were then incubated for 1 h with TBST containing the primary antibody (25 °C). Rabbit anti-K protein (antibody 54) was used at 1:10,000 dilution, mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99, Santa Cruz) at 1:1000 dilution, and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M3, Sigma) at 1:200 dilution. Membranes were then washed three times with 10 ml of TBST and then incubated with secondary antibody in TBST for 30 min (25 °C). The following concentrations of secondary antibodies were used: alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Promega) at 1:3000 and anti-mouse Ig at 1:3000 (Promega); horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1:2000 and anti-rabbit at 1:5000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For colorimetric detection using alkaline phosphatase, the membranes were developed using the phosphatase 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate solution (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). For chemiluminescence, using horseradish peroxidase, membranes were developed using the ECL kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The point mutations of Ser302 to Ala or Glu and of Tyr236, Tyr230, and Tyr234 to Phe were generated using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The triple point mutant, where Tyr236, Tyr230, and Tyr234 were all mutated to Phe, was generated by a two-stage polymerase chain reaction protocol that allows the simultaneous introduction of multiple mutations (29.Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient before use in transient transfections, and the mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing using the DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). In vitrotranscription and translation was performed in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System as per the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA bound to the beads bearing K protein was eluted with 100 μl of RNA elution buffer. RNA was phenol-purified and ethanol-precipitated. RNA pellets were dissolved in 10 μl of water and were translated in vitro using Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System as per the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. 35S-Labeled translational products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by autoradiography. In K protein-mRNA interaction assay extractions, binding and phosphorylation reactions were carried out in the presence of 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor. PKC phosphorylation buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 18.75 μm ATP, and 3.7 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. PKC binding buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Standard binding buffer contained 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. HKMT buffer contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 100 mm KCl. Washing buffer contained 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 175 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 1.0% Nonidet P-40. SDS-loading buffer contained 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. TBST buffer contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20.

Lck phosphorylation buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmMnCl2. RNA elution buffer contained 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS. Analysis of K protein amino acid sequence reveals that Tyr230, Tyr234, Tyr236, and Tyr380 meet the criteria (CANSITE) for phosphorylation by the Src family of tyrosine kinases. To test if K protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated, increasing amounts of purified GST-K fusion protein was incubated with the tyrosine kinase, Lck (30.Perlmutter R.M. Levin S.D. Appleby M.W. Anderson S.J. Alberola-Ila J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 451-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), in Lck phosphorylation buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (20 min, 30 °C). Phosphorylation of increasing amounts of enolase, an established tyrosine kinase substrate (31.Cooper J.A. Esch F.S. Taylor S.S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7835-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was done in parallel. Phosphorylation of GST protein was also done as a control. After phosphorylation, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, gels were stained (Fig.1 C) and autoradiographed (Fig.1 B), and radioactivity of the relevant bands was measured in a scintillation counter (Fig. 1 A). These results show that full-length GST-K protein was as good a substrate for phosphorylation by Lck as was enolase (Fig. 1 A, compare enolase,bars 1–5 with GST-K, bars 6–10). These results also show that Lck was autophosphorylated (Fig. 1,B, lane 11, and A, bar 11) to a level lower than either enolase or GST-K phosphorylation. Because GST was not phosphorylated by Lck (Fig. 1, B andC, lane 11, and A, bar 12),Lck-mediated phosphorylation of GST-K fusion protein reflects phosphorylation of K protein itself. GST-K was also effectively phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase Src (32.Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochi. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 D). To begin to identify sites that are phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase, beads bearing either wild-type or mutated GST-K fusion protein were phosphorylated (20 min, 30 °C) in vitro by either Src or Lck. Mutation of either Tyr230 or Tyr236to Phe (GST-KY230F and GST-KY236F) greatly reduced the level of GST-K protein phosphorylation by Src. Mutation of Tyr234(GST-KY234F) also reduced the level of phosphorylation, but not as much as the mutations of the other two sites (Fig. 1D, upper panel, compare lanes 2–4 with lane 1). These results suggest that all three sites are phosphorylated by this enzyme in vitro. Compared with the wild-type GST-K protein (Fig. 1 D, lower panel, lane 1), the level of Lck-mediated phosphorylation of GST-KY236F and GST-KY234F (Fig. 1 D, lower panel, lanes 2 and3) was greatly reduced, but not the level of phosphorylation of GST-KY230F (Fig. 1 D, lower panel, lane 4). These experiments suggest that Tyr236 and Tyr234 are the preferable sites for phosphorylation by Lckin vitro. These results show that although both Src and Lck effectively phosphorylate K protein in vitro, their phosphorylation site preferences overlap but are not identical. Treatment of cells with H2O2 induces oxidative stress and stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of many intracellular proteins (33.Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34.Zick Y. Sagi-Eisenberg R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This effect is thought to result from both protein tyrosine kinase activation and the inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. We used this agent, in combination with the Na3VO4phosphatase inhibitor, to test if K protein is inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo. Human Jurkat thymoma cells (24.Gillis S. Watson J. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were treated with H2O2/Na3VO4, and cells were harvested after different time intervals. Extracts were prepared, and K protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation using a highly specific anti-K protein antibody (number 54) (22.Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1–4) and polyclonal anti-K protein (Fig.2 A, lanes 5–8) antibodies. The anti-phosphotyrosine blot revealed a major 65-kDa band whose intensity was higher in extracts from cells treated with H2O2/Na3VO4; the peak effect occurred at 30 min and returned to base line after 60 min of treatment. This inducible 65-kDa band (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4) overlaps with the K protein band seen on the anti-K protein blot (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–8), indicating that the transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated 65-kDa band is probably K protein. The anti-phosphotyrosine blot also shows that there are several other well defined and inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with K protein. These bands may represent proteins that inducibly bind to K protein. To ensure that the 65-kDa inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated band is K protein, we transfected HeLa cells with either wild-type FLAG tag K fusion protein, FLAG-K, or a mutant, FLAG-KY3F, where the predominant three sites, Tyr230, Tyr234, and Tyr236, of in vitro phosphorylation by Src/Lck (Fig. 1), were all mutated to Phe. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated for 5 min with either media or H2O2/Na3VO4. After treatment, cells were harvested, cell extracts were prepared, and FLAG-K protein was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. The same samples of precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using both anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1–4) and anti-K protein (Fig. 2 B,lanes 5–8) antibody. The anti-K protein blot revealed one 65–70-kDa band. The size of this protein is identical to a strongly inducible band seen in the anti-phosphotyrosine blot from cells transfected with the wild-type FLAG-K. Compared with the wild-type K protein, a much weaker level of tyrosine phosphorylation induction of the FLAG-KY3F mutant was seen (compare lanes 1 and2 with lanes 3 and 4). These results confirm that K protein is tyrosine-phosphorylatedin vivo in response to H2O2/Na3VO4 treatment. Mutation of three Tyr sites, Tyr230, Tyr234, and Tyr236, to Phe was required to reproducibly decrease the H2O2/Na3VO4inducibility of FLAG-K protein phosphorylation, suggesting that all three tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in vivo in response to this treatment at the 5-min time point. Specific mapping is required to be certain which of the three sites are phosphorylatedin vivo, but precise mapping may be difficult to do because these sites are clustered so closely together. Nonetheless, even with the three point mutations, there was constitutive and small inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of the FLAG-KY3F mutant, indicating that there are sites in addition to Tyr230, Tyr234, and Tyr236 that are phosphorylated in vivo. The slightly higher constitutive level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the FLAG-KY3F compared with wild-type FLAG-K (compare lanes 1 and 3) may, in part, be accounted for by the higher level of FLAG-KY3F expression (compare lanes 5 and6). It is also possible that the FLAG-KY3F mutant structure is sufficiently altered to allow slightly increased constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation on another site(s). The above experiments show that K protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress in cells grown in culture. Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diseases of many organs as well as in aging (35.Bast A. Goris R.J. Pharm. Weekbl. 1989; 11: 199-206Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Next we wished to test if oxidative stress alters tyrosine phosphorylation of K proteins in an intact organ. Portal vein injections into livers of anesthetized mice is a useful model to study the effects of growth factors and other agents in an intact organ. Portal veins were infused with either saline or H2O2/Na3VO4 in six anesthetized mice, three animals in each treatment group (36.Ostrowski J. Florio S.K. Denis G.V. Suzuki H. Bomsztyk K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After 30 min, livers were harvested, and liver extracts were prepared (36.Ostrowski J. Florio S.K. Denis G.V. Suzuki H. Bomsztyk K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of K protein (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–6) revealed that there is low constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of K protein in the liver (Fig. 2 C,lanes 1–3), and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation is increased following oxidative stress induced by intrahepatic administration of H2O2/Na3VO4 (Fig.2 C, compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 1–3). The results in the mouse liver suggest that inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of K protein transmits a signal in intact organs in response to systemic changes. This observation is consistent with a recent report that K protein may participate in hepatic response to sepsis (4.Miau L.-H. Chang C.-J. Shen B.-J. Tsai W.-H. Lee S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10784-10791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). K protein interacts with a number of factors, including tyrosine kinases, which it can complex in vivo (14.Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X.R. Sleath P.R. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The results from the above experiments suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may stimulate the association of K protein with some of its partners that are also tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to changes in the extracellular environment (Fig. 2). Jurkat cells express high levels of the tyrosine kinase Lck (37.Weber J.R. Bell G.M. Han M.Y. Pawson T. Imboden J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that may, in part, be responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of K protein seen in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 A). We next tested if K protein associates with Lck and whether this interaction is altered by tyrosine phosphorylation of K protein. Beads bearing GST-K protein were phosphorylated (2 h, 30 °C) with or without baculovirus-expressed Lck and after extensive washes that removed Lck (see Amido Black staining in Fig. 7 C, lane 8), beads were mixed with 35S-Lck and then washed again. Proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in SDS-loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography and Amido Black staining (Fig. 3 A). These results showed that 35S-Lck binding to GST-K was greatly increased after tyrosine phosphorylation of K protein (Fig.3 A, Autoradiograph, compare lanes 2and 3). Densitometry measurements revealed that 58% of35S-Lck used in the reaction bound to GST-K. Following tyrosine phosphorylation, the electrophoretic mobility of GST-K protein was slower, and the band became broader (Fig. 3 A,Amido black, compare lanes 2 and 3). The unphosphorylated and the tyrosine-phosphorylated bands do not overlap, indicating high stoichiometry of Lck-mediated phosphorylation. This shift was not seen in Fig. 1, because those reactions were carried out for 20 min compared with the 2-h reaction carried out here (Fig.3 A).Figure 3Tyrosine phosphorylation of K protein regulates its interaction with Lck in vitro andin vivo. A, glutathione-agarose beads (40 μl) bearing GST-K protein were suspended in 50 μl of reaction buffer with or without 1 μl of baculovirus-expressed Lck, and phosphorylation reactions were carried out for 2 h (30 °C). After phosphorylation, beads were washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer and were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 2.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-Lck. The suspension was mixed for 40 min (4 °C), beads were washed three times with standard binding buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in loading buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and visualized by autoradiography (Autoradiograph) and protein staining (Amido Black). 100% of load is shown in lane 1. B, Jurkat cells (100 × 106 cells at 1.0 × 106cells/ml) were either treated or not treated with 3.5 mmH2O2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4. After 20 min of treatment, cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm, 4 °C. Half of each lysate was incubated in a sonicator for 2 h (4 °C) with 40 μl of anti-Lck monoclonal antibody (αLck), and the other half was incubated with 40 μl of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (αFlag). After sonication, 20 μl of protein A/G beads was added to each sample. Suspensions were mixed for 2 h (4 °C), beads were washed four times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in loading buffer.

Although the phenomenon is called “contact inhibition,” little is known about the cellular mechanisms involved. Here we show that the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (SOV) induced the reentry of contact-inhibited human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) into the cell cycle and that reentry was associated with activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K)/Akt pathways. SOV stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake of contact-inhibited HUVECs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. SOV-induced increase in [3H]thymidine uptake was significantly inhibited by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 and by the PI 3-K inhibitor LY294002. SOV also stimulated the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin A, and the activity of CDK2 kinase, whereas it decreased the expression of p27 kip1. In marked contrast, growth media alone did not induce these changes. Furthermore, these SOV-induced changes were abolished by pretreatment with PD98059 and LY294002. SOV stimulated phosphorylation of ERK and Akt in contact-inhibited HUVECs, while growth media alone did not. This phosphorylation was associated with inhibition of phosphatase activity in the cells. Finally, overexpression of high cell density-enhanced protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 inhibited c-fos and cyclin A promoter activity. Taken together, our results suggest that in contact-inhibited HUVECs, increased phosphatase activity suppressed the ERK and PI 3-K/Akt pathways, resulting in exit from the cell cycle by down-regulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin A and by up-regulation of p27 kip1.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar). ECs are unique because they grow as a strict monolayer, and they exit from the cell cycle once they come into contact with each other. Although the phenomenon is well known and called “contact inhibition,” little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. Several lines of evidence suggest that up-regulation of phosphatase activity may be implicated in density-dependent growth arrest. NRK-1 cells were transformed by treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (SOV), and transformation was accompanied by increases in protein phosphorylation in the cells (2.Klarlund J.K. Cell. 1985; 41: 707-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity was increased in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) harvested at high density (3.Gaits F. Li R.Y. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The increase in PTPase activity was also observed in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts whose growth was arrested at high density (4.Pallen C.J. Tong P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6996-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel class of receptor-like PTPases was isolated and named high cell density-enhanced PTPase 1 (DEP-1). DEP-1 has an extracellular domain that contains eight fibronectin type III motifs, a single transmembrane domain, and a single intracellular PTPase domain. The expression level and the PTPase activity of DEP-1 were increased in WI-38 and AG1518 cells harvested at high density (5.Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although these findings suggest that increased PTPase activity in the cells might counteract with protein phosphorylation, which leads to cell proliferation, little is known as to which intracellular signaling pathways are affected by the increase in PTPase activity and how the increased PTPase activity finally affects the cell cycle regulatory machinery. Cell cycle progression is regulated by serine/threonine kinases termed cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), the activities of which oscillate during the cell cycle. CDKs are associated with the positive coactivators cyclins and the negative regulators, CDK inhibitors (6.Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar,7.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, cyclin D-CDK4/CDK6, cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin A-CDK2, and cyclin B-Cdc2 are the main cyclin-CDK complexes that regulate the progression of G1, G1/S, S, and G2/M phases, respectively. CDK inhibitors comprise two families, the Ink4 and Cip/Kip families. CDK inhibitors of the Cip/Kip family are of particular interest in that they inhibit the activity of a broader spectrum of CDKs including CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 (8.Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K.

The Cip/Kip family is composed of p21 waf1/cip1, p27 kip1, and p57 kip2 (9.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

The expression level of p27 kip1 is reportedly increased in growth-arrested cells by contact inhibition or by stimulation with transforming growth factor-β (13.Hengst L. Dulic V. Slingerland J.M.

Recent evidence suggests that several intracellular signaling pathways are linked to the cell cycle regulatory machinery. Among them, the p21 ras (RAS)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is the most characterized pathway. It is reported that constitutively active MEK is sufficient to transform cells or induce differentiation (18.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 19.Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar), suggesting that the MEK/ERK pathway is implicated in the cell cycle regulation. Several studies have indicated, using a dominant-negative Ras mutant, that the Ras signaling pathway is involved in the induction of cyclin D1 protein, CDK4 kinase activity, and CDK2 kinase activity and in the down-regulation of p27 kip1 (20.Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 21.Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ERK pathway is reportedly implicated in vascular endothelial cell growth factor-induced EC proliferation by stimulating cyclin D1 synthesis and CDK4 kinase activity (22.Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) stimulates cell proliferation or induces cell cycle arrest in vascular ECs, which appears to depend upon the timing of PKC activation during the cell cycle and PKC isozymes expressed in the cells (23.Tang S. Morgan K.G. Parker C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28704-28711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24.Harrington E.O. Loffler J. Nelson P.R. Kent K.C. Simons M.

The PI 3-K-mediated pathways also seem to be implicated in cell cycle progression, because a retrovirus-encoded PI 3-K could transform fibroblasts (27.Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 276: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear as to how these intracellular signaling pathways are regulated in contact-inhibited vascular ECs. To investigate the cellular mechanisms for density-dependent growth arrest and to apply those mechanisms to the regulation of the growth of other cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells, we examined in the present study whether treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor SOV induced reentry of contact-inhibited vascular ECs into the cell cycle by examining [3H]thymidine incorporation, expression levels of cyclins, CDKs and CDK inhibitors, and CDK2 kinase activity. We also studied the effects of inhibition of the ERK-, PKC-, and PI 3-K-mediated pathways on SOV-induced cell cycle reentry. Finally, we examined the effect of overexpression of DEP-1 on c-fos and cyclin A promoter activity. HUVECs and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were purchased from Sanko Junyaku (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-cyclin D1, -cyclin E, -cyclin A, -CDK4, -CDK2, -p21 waf1/cip1, -p27 kip1, -ERK1, and -Akt1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphospecific anti-ERK1/2 antibody and phosphospecific anti-Akt antibody that recognize catalytically active ERK1/2 and Akt, respectively, were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Histone H1, histone H2B, and myelin basic protein were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Calphostin C, GF109203X, wortmannin, and LY294002 were purchased from Sigma, and PD98059 was obtained from New England Biolabs. HUVECs were maintained in medium 199 containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml EC growth supplement, and 50 units/ml heparin. BAECs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After reaching confluence, medium was replaced with fresh growth medium, and the cells were further incubated for 48 h. Cells were then stimulated with fresh growth medium in the presence and absence of SOV. For Western blot analyses and the CDK2 kinase assay, we used Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected by centrifugation. Cells were then lysed in Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. For the ERK1 and Akt kinase assay, we used Triton X-100 cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were lysed in the buffer for 30 min on ice and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was used for the ERK1 and Akt kinase assay. Protein concentration was measured according to Bradford's method (Bio-Rad). Protein extracts were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a semidry blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). After blocking in 1× PBS, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.2% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies in blocking buffer (1× PBS, 2% nonfat dry milk, 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100, except for phosphospecific anti-ERK1/2 antibody and phosphospecific anti-Akt antibody, which were diluted at 1:500. The membranes were washed three times with the blocking buffer and then incubated with secondary antibodies, which were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) at a final dilution of 1:7,000. After final washes with 1× PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, the signals were detected using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the CDK2 kinase assay, 75 μg of each protein extract was precleaned with protein A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C in the Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer. The extracts were then incubated with 1 μg of anti-CDK2 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and with protein A-agarose beads for another 1 h at 4 °C with constant rocking. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed twice with the Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer and then three times with a kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The pellets were then incubated in 30 μl of the kinase buffer containing 3 μg of histone H1, 10 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were terminated by adding 30 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer. After boiling for 5 min, half of the samples were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The ERK1 kinase assay was also performed in the same way. Fifty μg of each protein extract was precleaned in the Triton X-100 cell lysis buffer in the presence of protein A-agarose beads, and the extract was incubated with 1 μg of anti-ERK1 antibody. After incubation with protein A-agarose beads, the beads were washed twice with Triton X-100 cell lysis buffer and three times with the kinase buffer. The pellets were incubated in 20 μl of the kinase buffer containing 1 μg of myelin basic protein, 10 μmATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, for 30 min at room temperature. Half of the samples were separated by electrophoresis using a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For the Akt kinase assay, 100 μg of each protein extract was precleaned in the Triton X-100 cell lysis buffer, and the extract was incubated with 1 μg of anti-Akt antibody. After incubation with protein A/G PLUS agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the beads were washed twice with Triton X-100 cell lysis buffer and three times with the kinase buffer. The pellets were incubated in 20 μl of the kinase buffer containing 2 μg of histone H2B, 10 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. Half of the samples were separated by electrophoresis using a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To confirm that almost equal amounts of CDK2, ERK1, or Akt protein were used for the kinase assays, the same amounts of the protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK2, -ERK1, or -Akt antibody and immunoblotted with the same antibody as the internal controls. The signals were visualized using an image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film, Tokyo) and the intensities of the signals were analyzed by densitometry. Confluent HUVECs were maintained in growth medium for 48 h and restimulated with fresh growth medium for 8, 16, and 24 h in the presence and absence of 50 μm SOV. [3H]Thymidine (2 μCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each well 2 h before the end of the incubation period. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS and incubated with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. After washing them twice with distilled water, the cells were lysed with 0.2 nNaOH, neutralized with 0.2 n HCl, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Phosphatase activity was measured as previously reported (28.Guan K. Broyles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In brief, protein extracts were incubated in 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mmimidazole (pH 7.5), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 800 μl of 0.25 n NaOH. Absorbance at 410 nm was measured to estimate the amount of hydrolyzedp-nitrophenyl phosphate. The 5′-flanking region of the mouse c-fos gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. One μg of mouse genomic DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) was subjected to polymerase chain reaction using LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara shuzo, Osaka, Japan). The polymerase chain reaction conditions were 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 63 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles, with final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified product was digested with SacI andXhoI and subcloned in the pGL2 vector (pGL2-c-fos). Primer sequences used for the reaction were as follows: sense primer, 5′-GAGCTCTTGCTTCTCCTAATACCAGAGACT-3′; antisense primer: 5′-CTCGAGTGCAGTCGCGGTTGGAGTAGTA-3′. The nucleotide sequence of the construct was confirmed by cycle sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). pGL2-cyclin A/−3200/+245 encodes approximately 3.2 kilobase pairs of the promoter region of the human cyclin A gene upstream of the luciferase gene (29.Yoshizumi M.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). pME18S-mouse DEP-1 encodes the full length of mouse DEP-1 cDNA in the expression vector pME18S (30.Kuramochi S. Matsuda S. Matsuda Y. Saitoh T. Ohsugi M. Yamamoto T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-HA-mouse RasS17N encodes the amino-terminally HA-tagged mouse Ras cDNA in which Ser17 was replaced with Asn, and pcDNA3-HA-mouse RasG12V encodes the amino-terminally HA-tagged mouse Ras cDNA in which Gly12 was replaced with Val, as described previously (31.Suzuki E. Nagata D. Kakoki M. Hayakawa H. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). pRL-TK, which encodes the sea pansy luciferase gene, was purchased from Toyo Ink (Tokyo, Japan) and used as the internal control for the luciferase assays. BAECs were transiently co-transfected with pGL2-cyclin A/−3200/+245 or pGL2-c-fosand pRL-TK, along with pcDNA3-HA-mouse RasS17N or pcDNA3-HA-mouse RasG12V or pME18S-mouse DEP-1 using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, cells were harvested, and the dual luciferase assay was performed using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The values are the mean ± S.E. The effects of SOV on cyclins/CDKs/CDK inhibitors, kinase activities, and [3H]thymidine uptake were assessed using analysis of variance followed by the Student-Neumann-Keul test. Differences with ap value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. We first examined whether the phosphatase inhibitor SOV induced reentry of contact-inhibited HUVECs into the cell cycle. Contact-inhibited HUVECs were stimulated with fresh growth medium in the presence and absence of SOV. SOV, at concentrations of 25 and 50 μm, stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). SOV-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake peaked around 16 h poststimulation (0 m SOV, 71162 ± 2606 cpm; 25 μm SOV, 183023 ± 11247 cpm, p < 0.0001 versus 0 m; 50 μm SOV, 217582 ± 5650 cpm, p < 0.0001 versus0 m and p < 0.05 versus 25 μm) and remained at increased levels until 24 h (0m SOV, 69425 ± 2347 cpm; 25 μm SOV, 148175 ± 9950 cpm, p < 0.0001 versus0 m; 50 μm SOV, 172971 ± 20088 cpm,p < 0.0001 versus 0 m). SOV, at a concentration of 100 μm, had a cytotoxic effect, because almost all cells were rounded up and detached within 3 days. Thus, we used SOV at a concentration of 50 μm in subsequent experiments. We next examined the effects of SOV on protein expression levels of cell cycle regulatory factors, including cyclins, CDKs and CDK inhibitors, in contact-inhibited HUVECs. The basal levels of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A, and p21 cip1 were minimal. SOV significantly increased the expression of cyclin D1 (2.21 ± 0.30-fold increase, 16 h poststimulation, p < 0.01, n = 4), cyclin E (2.54 ± 0.63-fold increase, 16 h poststimulation, p < 0.05,n = 3), cyclin A (5.17 ± 0.87-fold increase, 24 h poststimulation, p < 0.01, n= 4), and p21 cip1 (1.76 ± 0.18-fold increase, 16 h poststimulation, p < 0.01, n = 3) in a time-dependent fashion, whereas it significantly down-regulated that of p27 kip1 (36.8 ± 10.5% of control level, 24 h poststimulation, p < 0.001,n = 6) (Fig.2 A, left panels). SOV did not affect the expression of CDK2 and CDK4. On the contrary, growth medium without SOV did not affect the expression of those factors (Fig. 2 A, right panels). We next examined CDK2 kinase activity using histone H1 as the substrate. The basal CDK2 kinase activity was negligible. SOV stimulated CDK2 kinase activity in a time-dependent manner. CDK2 kinase activity was substantially increased 16 h (3.95 ± 1.15-fold increase versus 0 h, p < 0.05, n = 4) and 24 h (5.66 ± 1.65-fold increase versus 0 h, p < 0.05,n = 4) poststimulation (Fig. 2 B,left panels). In contrast, growth medium alone did not induce CDK2 kinase activity (Fig. 2 B,right panels). Collectively, the results described above suggest that growth medium containing 50 μm SOV induced reentry of contact-inhibited HUVECs into the cell cycle, whereas growth medium alone did not.Figure 2SOV-induced changes of cell cycle regulatory factors and CDK2 kinase activity in contact-inhibited HUVECs. A, time course of SOV-induced changes in the expression levels of cell cycle regulatory factors. Confluent HUVECs were stimulated with growth medium in the presence (SOV) and the absence (GM) of 50 μm SOV for the indicated periods. Seventy-five μg of each protein extract was immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The same protein extracts were used for all of the immunoblots. Note that some photographs in theright panels were exposed longer to show the faint bands. B, time course of SOV-induced changes in CDK2 kinase activity.

We therefore examined the intracellular signaling pathways that might be implicated in reentry of contact-inhibited HUVECs into the cell cycle induced by SOV. We studied the effects of the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, the PKC inhibitor calphostin C, and the PI 3-K inhibitor LY294002 on [3H]thymidine uptake after stimulation of contact-inhibited HUVECs by 50 μm SOV. The changes in [3H]thymidine incorporation were assessed at 16 h poststimulation. SOV-induced increase in [3H]thymidine uptake in confluent HUVECs was significantly suppressed by pretreatment with PD98059 and LY294002 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.1 B). We also used another PI 3-K inhibitor, wortmannin, and obtained basically the same results (data not shown). Calphostin C, at a concentration of 100 nm, which seems to be sufficient to inhibit PKC (32.Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), tended to inhibit [3H]thymidine uptake; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Calphostin C, at a concentration of 200 nm, significantly inhibited [3H]thymidine uptake (data not shown). However, some cells were rounded up and detached in 48 h, probably because of its cytotoxic effects at that concentration. We also used GF109203X, another PKC inhibitor. GF109203X, at concentrations varying from 0 to 3.5 μm, did not significantly inhibit [3H]thymidine uptake (data not shown). Overall, PKC inhibitors used in the experiments did not significantly inhibit SOV-induced increase in [3H]thymidine uptake in contact-inhibited HUVECs. We therefore focused on the effects of MEK and PI 3-K inhibition on SOV-induced reentry of contact-inhibited HUVECs into the cell cycle. We next examined the effects of MEK and PI 3-K inhibition on the protein expression levels of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A, and p27 kip1, because their expression was significantly affected by SOV treatment (Fig. 2 A). The basal expression of these factors was not affected by pretreatment with PD98059 or LY294002. SOV-induced increase of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin A was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with 50 μmPD98059 (Fig. 3 A) or 50 μm LY294002 (Fig. 3 B), while SOV-induced decrease of p27 kip1 was restored by these inhibitors. We also examined the effects of MEK and PI 3-K inhibition on SOV-induced activation of CDK2 kinase. The basal CDK2 kinase activity was not affected by pretreatment with PD98059 or LY294002. SOV-induced increase of CDK2 kinase activity was significantly inhibited to 26.5 ± 12.6% (24 h poststimulation, p < 0.01,n = 3) and 19.8 ± 15.3% (24 h poststimulation,p < 0.01, n = 3), respectively, by pretreatment with 50 μm PD98059 (Fig.4 A) and 50 μmLY294002 (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Effects of PD98059 (PD) and LY294002 (LY) on SOV-induced changes in CDK2 kinase activity in contact-inhibited HUVECs.

However, biochemical and immunocytochemical studies indicate that CFTR can be found also in endosomal and recycling compartments (8.Webster P. Vanacore L. Nairn A.C. Marino C.R. Am. J.

Functionally active CFTR can be found in purified clathrin-coated vesicles derived from cultured cells and native tissues that constitutively express CFTR (11.Bradbury N.A. Cohn J.A. Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8296-8302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies examining CFTR internalization demonstrate that perturbation of clathrin-coated vesicle formation inhibits the removal of CFTR from the plasma membrane (12.Bradbury N.A.

J. 1997; 328: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that in polarized epithelial cells, CFTR is internalized solely through clathrin-coated vesicles and is excluded from other endocytic pathways such as caveolae (12.Bradbury N.A. Clark J.A. Watkins S.C. Widnell C.C. Smith H.S. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L659-L688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CFTR is specifically recruited to the clathrin-coated vesicle pathway for endocytosis.Specific association of membrane proteins with clathrin-coated vesicles is mediated by an interaction of such proteins with clathrin adaptor complexes. Two distinct but related sets of adaptor complexes, AP-1 and AP-2, are associated with clathrin-coated vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane, respectively (14.Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 293-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15.Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The endocytic AP-2 complex is thought to target integral membrane proteins for endocytosis by recognizing specific internalization signals in the cytoplasmic tails of such proteins (18.Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 19.Sorkin A.

One such identified internalization motif is based on tyrosine residues (YXXΦ or NPXY, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue) and is exemplified by the transferrin receptor and low density lipoprotein receptor (21.Collawn J.F.

Recent studies report that the amino and carboxyl tail regions of CFTR individually are sufficient to promote the internalization of the transferrin receptor in the context of a CFTR/transferrin receptor chimera (25.Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskienne L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we evaluated the hypothesis that internalization motifs present on the cytoplasmic tails of CFTR directly interact with the endocytic adaptor complex AP-2 to facilitate entry into clathrin-coated vesicles.DISCUSSIONCurrent investigations of the traffic of CFTR argue that it is internalized from the plasma membrane through a clathrin-mediated pathway. Thus, immunologically detectable and functionally active CFTR is present in clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from both cultured epithelial cells and intact native tissue (11.Bradbury N.A. Cohn J.A. Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8296-8302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Bradbury N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 (suppl.): 175-191Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, we and others have recently shown that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis causes a retention of CFTR at the cell surface (12.Bradbury N.A. Clark J.A. Watkins S.C. Widnell C.C. Smith H.S. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L659-L688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Lukacs G.L. Segal G. Kartner N. Grinstein S. Zhang F. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of alternate internalization pathways, such as caveolae, has no effect on cell surface CFTR levels (12.Bradbury N.A. Clark J.A. Watkins S.C. Widnell C.C. Smith H.S. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L659-L688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The molecular interactions involved in the nucleation of clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane include the binding of adaptor complexes to the cytoplasmic side of plasma membranes. During coated vesicle formation, adaptors are believed to mediate at least three functions, including sequestration of the cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins or receptors, initiation of clathrin polymerization, and localization of clathrin polymerization to the appropriate domain (plasma membrane for AP-2 and trans-Golgi network for AP-1) within the cell. Indeed, both in vivo cross-linking studies in human epithelial cells and in vitro studies using full-length CFTR (translated in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes) incubated with isolated bovine brain adaptor complexes demonstrate that CFTR and AP-2 adaptors do associate. Such an association would allow for the efficient entry of CFTR into clathrin-coated pits and vesicles.The association of AP-2 complexes with membrane proteins is mediated by the presence of specific endocytosis motifs present on the carboxyl tails of such membrane proteins (18.Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 19.Sorkin A.

Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). A motif that encompasses a critical tyrosine residue has been found in a wide variety of membrane proteins. These motifs take the form YXXΦ or NPXY (where X is an unknown amino acid and Φ is a large hydrophobic amino acid) and have been shown to mediate internalization of plasma membrane proteins (including the transferrin and low density lipoprotein receptors), bearing such motifs into clathrin-coated vesicles (19.Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 23.Ktistakis N.T. Thomas D. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24.Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the carboxyl cytoplasmic tails of CFTR from 10 species shows the presence of a conserved tyrosine residue in all sequences except one. In this case, a phenylalanine residue substitutes for the tyrosine in dogfish CFTR. In seven of the CFTR sequences, the motif YDSI is conserved, suggesting that this sequence conforms to the paradigm of a YXXΦ motif and may be an internalization signal for CFTR. Indeed, recent work by Prince et al. (25.Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskienne L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) suggests that this possibility is correct.To evaluate the role of Tyr1424 in the carboxyl tail of CFTR as a binding motif for the endocytic adaptor complex AP-2, we generated a GST fusion protein coupled to the terminal 76 amino acids of CFTR. A paradigm utilizing GST fusion proteins that contain tyrosine-based motifs has been used to demonstrate AP-2 binding to several proteins (18.Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 31.Boge M. Wyss S. Bonifacino J.S. Thali M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15773-15778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of CFTR in the context of a GST fusion protein binds the AP-2 adaptor complex. Although both Golgi AP-1 and plasma membrane AP-2 adaptor complexes were present in our in vitro binding assay, it was interesting to note that whereas there was a strong binding of the carboxyl terminus of CFTR to AP-2, AP-1 did not bind.Having established that the carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain of CFTR in the context of a GST fusion protein can bind to AP-2, we sought to define the requirements for such an interaction. As noted, the carboxyl terminus of CFTR contains a single YXXΦ motif, Y1424DSI, that is entirely conserved across seven species, including mammalian, piscine, and amphibian CFTR, suggesting that this may form an AP-2 binding motif. Mutation of Tyr1424 to Ala resulted in a significant inhibition of AP-2 binding to the CFTR-GST fusion protein, indicating the importance of this residue in AP-2 binding. However, binding of AP-2 to Y1424A-CFTR was not completely abolished. The same mutation (Tyr → Ala) in the human immunodeficiency virus, type I envelope glycoprotein (Y712A) results in a complete inhibition of AP-2 binding, leading to the speculation that CFTR may contain more than one endocytic internalization motif, as is the case for the CD3-γ chain and the epidermal growth factor receptor (32.Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33.Letourner F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In this context, the carboxyl tail of CFTR also contains a dileucine motif that has been shown to be involved in protein sorting and endocytosis (34.Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Of note are the observations of Collawn and colleagues (25.Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskienne L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), who have shown that a Y1424A mutation in transiently expressed CFTR results in a 40% inhibition of CFTR endocytosis rates, a finding consistent with the extent to which Y1424A mutations inhibit AP-2 binding. Dogfish CFTR contains a phenylalanine residue in place of tyrosine. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that phenylalanine can substitute for tyrosine in the transferrin receptor internalization signal without appreciable loss of internalization activity (35.McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Such is also the case for CFTR, as a Y1424F mutation resulted in a construct that was unimpaired in its ability to bind AP-2 adaptors.A peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of CFTR was tested for its ability to inhibit AP-2 binding to GST-CT. AP-2 binding was blocked by the Y19P peptide and was sequence-specific since the Ez147 peptide, corresponding to the protein-protein interaction domain of the protein kinase A anchoring protein ezrin (27.Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), was without effect at equivalent molar concentrations. Although in molar excess, the Y19P peptide did not completely abolish AP-2-CFTR interactions. As noted, this may reflect the presence of additional AP-2 binding motifs in the carboxyl tail of CFTR. For example, the synthetic peptides used overlapped with the tyrosine signal only and did not include the putative dileucine motif. Indeed, similar experiments using peptides derived from the cytoplasmic tail of the epidermal growth factor receptor were unable to completely inhibit AP-2 binding to this receptor (36.Nesterov A. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8719-8723Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Taken as a whole, these results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR contains a tyrosine-based internalization motif that is recognized by the AP-2 endocytic adaptor complex. Clearly, CFTR functions as an ion channel in the apical membrane of various epithelial cells, so it is intriguing to speculate why such a protein would require an endocytosis signal. We have proposed that CFTR is present both in the apical membrane and in a rapidly recycling cytoplasmic pool (29.Bradbury N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 (suppl.): 175-191Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37.Bradbury N.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1-C24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Bradbury N.A. Jilling T. Berta G. Sorscher E.J. Bridges R.J. Kirk K.L. Science. 1992; 256: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In a fashion analogous to the GLUT4 transporter, stimulation of epithelial cells leads to a rapid redistribution of CFTR toward an increased concentration in the cell surface to facilitate chloride transport. Thus the ability to efficiently sequester CFTR within clathrin-coated pits would enhance the cells' ability to rapidly regulate the endocytosis and cellular distribution of CFTR. Cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal genetic disease of Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 (1.Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L. Ianuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C.

Bridges R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8296-8302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies examining CFTR internalization demonstrate that perturbation of clathrin-coated vesicle formation inhibits the removal of CFTR from the plasma membrane (12.Bradbury N.A.

J. 1997; 328: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that in polarized epithelial cells, CFTR is internalized solely through clathrin-coated vesicles and is excluded from other endocytic pathways such as caveolae (12.Bradbury N.A. Clark J.A. Watkins S.C. Widnell C.C. Smith H.S. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L659-L688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CFTR is specifically recruited to the clathrin-coated vesicle pathway for endocytosis. Specific association of membrane proteins with clathrin-coated vesicles is mediated by an interaction of such proteins with clathrin adaptor complexes. Two distinct but related sets of adaptor complexes, AP-1 and AP-2, are associated with clathrin-coated vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane, respectively (14.Robinson M.S.

The endocytic AP-2 complex is thought to target integral membrane proteins for endocytosis by recognizing specific internalization signals in the cytoplasmic tails of such proteins (18.Ohno H.

One such identified internalization motif is based on tyrosine residues (YXXΦ or NPXY, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue) and is exemplified by the transferrin receptor and low density lipoprotein receptor (21.Collawn J.F.

Recent studies report that the amino and carboxyl tail regions of CFTR individually are sufficient to promote the internalization of the transferrin receptor in the context of a CFTR/transferrin receptor chimera (25.Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskienne L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we evaluated the hypothesis that internalization motifs present on the cytoplasmic tails of CFTR directly interact with the endocytic adaptor complex AP-2 to facilitate entry into clathrin-coated vesicles. DISCUSSIONCurrent investigations of the traffic of CFTR argue that it is internalized from the plasma membrane through a clathrin-mediated pathway. Thus, immunologically detectable and functionally active CFTR is present in clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from both cultured epithelial cells and intact native tissue (11.Bradbury N.A. Cohn J.A.

Rev. 1999; 79 (suppl.): 175-191Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, we and others have recently shown that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis causes a retention of CFTR at the cell surface (12.Bradbury N.A. Clark J.A. Watkins S.C. Widnell C.C.

J. 1997; 328: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of alternate internalization pathways, such as caveolae, has no effect on cell surface CFTR levels (12.Bradbury N.A. Clark J.A. Watkins S.C. Widnell C.C. Smith H.S. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L659-L688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The molecular interactions involved in the nucleation of clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane include the binding of adaptor complexes to the cytoplasmic side of plasma membranes. During coated vesicle formation, adaptors are believed to mediate at least three functions, including sequestration of the cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins or receptors, initiation of clathrin polymerization, and localization of clathrin polymerization to the appropriate domain (plasma membrane for AP-2 and trans-Golgi network for AP-1) within the cell. Indeed, both in vivo cross-linking studies in human epithelial cells and in vitro studies using full-length CFTR (translated in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes) incubated with isolated bovine brain adaptor complexes demonstrate that CFTR and AP-2 adaptors do associate. Such an association would allow for the efficient entry of CFTR into clathrin-coated pits and vesicles.The association of AP-2 complexes with membrane proteins is mediated by the presence of specific endocytosis motifs present on the carboxyl tails of such membrane proteins (18.Ohno H.

These motifs take the form YXXΦ or NPXY (where X is an unknown amino acid and Φ is a large hydrophobic amino acid) and have been shown to mediate internalization of plasma membrane proteins (including the transferrin and low density lipoprotein receptors), bearing such motifs into clathrin-coated vesicles (19.Sorkin A.

Comparison of the carboxyl cytoplasmic tails of CFTR from 10 species shows the presence of a conserved tyrosine residue in all sequences except one. In this case, a phenylalanine residue substitutes for the tyrosine in dogfish CFTR. In seven of the CFTR sequences, the motif YDSI is conserved, suggesting that this sequence conforms to the paradigm of a YXXΦ motif and may be an internalization signal for CFTR. Indeed, recent work by Prince et al. (25.Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskienne L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) suggests that this possibility is correct.To evaluate the role of Tyr1424 in the carboxyl tail of CFTR as a binding motif for the endocytic adaptor complex AP-2, we generated a GST fusion protein coupled to the terminal 76 amino acids of CFTR. A paradigm utilizing GST fusion proteins that contain tyrosine-based motifs has been used to demonstrate AP-2 binding to several proteins (18.Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15773-15778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of CFTR in the context of a GST fusion protein binds the AP-2 adaptor complex. Although both Golgi AP-1 and plasma membrane AP-2 adaptor complexes were present in our in vitro binding assay, it was interesting to note that whereas there was a strong binding of the carboxyl terminus of CFTR to AP-2, AP-1 did not bind.Having established that the carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain of CFTR in the context of a GST fusion protein can bind to AP-2, we sought to define the requirements for such an interaction. As noted, the carboxyl terminus of CFTR contains a single YXXΦ motif, Y1424DSI, that is entirely conserved across seven species, including mammalian, piscine, and amphibian CFTR, suggesting that this may form an AP-2 binding motif. Mutation of Tyr1424 to Ala resulted in a significant inhibition of AP-2 binding to the CFTR-GST fusion protein, indicating the importance of this residue in AP-2 binding. However, binding of AP-2 to Y1424A-CFTR was not completely abolished. The same mutation (Tyr → Ala) in the human immunodeficiency virus, type I envelope glycoprotein (Y712A) results in a complete inhibition of AP-2 binding, leading to the speculation that CFTR may contain more than one endocytic internalization motif, as is the case for the CD3-γ chain and the epidermal growth factor receptor (32.Sorkin A.

Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In this context, the carboxyl tail of CFTR also contains a dileucine motif that has been shown to be involved in protein sorting and endocytosis (34.Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Of note are the observations of Collawn and colleagues (25.Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskienne L. Cotlin L.F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), who have shown that a Y1424A mutation in transiently expressed CFTR results in a 40% inhibition of CFTR endocytosis rates, a finding consistent with the extent to which Y1424A mutations inhibit AP-2 binding. Dogfish CFTR contains a phenylalanine residue in place of tyrosine. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that phenylalanine can substitute for tyrosine in the transferrin receptor internalization signal without appreciable loss of internalization activity (35.McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Such is also the case for CFTR, as a Y1424F mutation resulted in a construct that was unimpaired in its ability to bind AP-2 adaptors.A peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of CFTR was tested for its ability to inhibit AP-2 binding to GST-CT. AP-2 binding was blocked by the Y19P peptide and was sequence-specific since the Ez147 peptide, corresponding to the protein-protein interaction domain of the protein kinase A anchoring protein ezrin (27.Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), was without effect at equivalent molar concentrations. Although in molar excess, the Y19P peptide did not completely abolish AP-2-CFTR interactions. As noted, this may reflect the presence of additional AP-2 binding motifs in the carboxyl tail of CFTR. For example, the synthetic peptides used overlapped with the tyrosine signal only and did not include the putative dileucine motif. Indeed, similar experiments using peptides derived from the cytoplasmic tail of the epidermal growth factor receptor were unable to completely inhibit AP-2 binding to this receptor (36.Nesterov A. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8719-8723Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Taken as a whole, these results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR contains a tyrosine-based internalization motif that is recognized by the AP-2 endocytic adaptor complex. Clearly, CFTR functions as an ion channel in the apical membrane of various epithelial cells, so it is intriguing to speculate why such a protein would require an endocytosis signal. We have proposed that CFTR is present both in the apical membrane and in a rapidly recycling cytoplasmic pool (29.Bradbury N.A. Physiol.

In a fashion analogous to the GLUT4 transporter, stimulation of epithelial cells leads to a rapid redistribution of CFTR toward an increased concentration in the cell surface to facilitate chloride transport. Thus the ability to efficiently sequester CFTR within clathrin-coated pits would enhance the cells' ability to rapidly regulate the endocytosis and cellular distribution of CFTR.

https://openalex.org/W2047433270,"The regulation of Col2a1, which encodes type II collagen, likely results from a balance of both positive and negative proteins. Here we present evidence that the transcription factor δEF1 participates in the negative regulation ofCol2a1 transcription. A deletion analysis suggested that a region between −100 and −307 of the rat Col2a1 gene was required for activity in differentiating chick limb bud mesenchymal cells; however, mutation of a conserved E2 box site in this region actually increased promoter activity. Supershift analysis demonstrated that δEF1, a known transcriptional repressor, bound to the E2 box in a sequence-dependent manner. Chick limb bud mesenchymal cells, which do not express type II collagen, expressed abundant δEF1 mRNA, but, following differentiation in micromass culture, δEF1 mRNA expression was lost. Primary embryonic chick sternal chondrocytes, which express abundant type II collagen, displayed minimal levels of δEF1 mRNA. The inhibition of Col2a1transcription following treatment of chick sternal chondrocytes with growth factors was accompanied by increased δEF1 expression. Overexpression of δEF1 in differentiated chondrocytes resulted in decreased expression of a reporter construct containing a collagen II promoter/enhancer insert; however, this negative regulation was not dependent on the proximal E2 box. This is the first report of a specific transcription factor involved in the negative regulation ofCol2a1."
https://openalex.org/W1965981355,"Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric mucosa is accompanied by an activated histamine metabolism. Histamine plays a central role in the regulation of gastric acid secretion and is involved in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulcerations. Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the rate-limiting enzyme for histamine production, and its activity is regulated through transcriptional mechanisms. The present study investigated the effect of H. pylori infection on the transcriptional activity of the human HDC (hHDC) promoter in a gastric epithelial cell line (AGS) and analyzed the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our studies demonstrate that H. pylori infection potently transactivated the hHDC promoter. The H. pylori-responsive element of the hHDC gene was mapped to the sequence +1 to +27 base pairs, which shows no homology to known cis-acting elements and also functions as a gastrin-responsive element. H. pylori regulates the activity of this element via a Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway, which was activated in a Ras-independent manner. Furthermore, we found that H. pylori-induced transactivation of the hHDC promoter was independent of the cag pathogenicity island and the vacuolating cytotoxin A gene and therefore may be exerted through (a) new virulence factor(s). A better understanding of H. pylori-directed hHDC transcription can provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of H. pylori-dependent gene regulation in gastric epithelial cells and may lead to new therapeutic approaches.

Our studies demonstrate that H. pylori infection potently transactivated the hHDC promoter. The H. pylori-responsive element of the hHDC gene was mapped to the sequence +1 to +27 base pairs, which shows no homology to known cis-acting elements and also functions as a gastrin-responsive element. H. pylori regulates the activity of this element via a Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway, which was activated in a Ras-independent manner. Furthermore, we found that H. pylori-induced transactivation of the hHDC promoter was independent of the cag pathogenicity island and the vacuolating cytotoxin A gene and therefore may be exerted through (a) new virulence factor(s). A better understanding of H. pylori-directed hHDC transcription can provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of H. pylori-dependent gene regulation in gastric epithelial cells and may lead to new therapeutic approaches. cytotoxin-associated gene A pathogenicity island nuclear factor κB activator protein 1 interleukin enterochromaffin-like histidine decarboxylase human HDC c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate epidermal growth factor mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kilobase(s) thymidine kinase multiplicity of infection inhibitory protein κBα luciferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay gastrin-responsive element base pair(s) GAS-RE-binding protein human immunodeficiency virus Helicobacter pylori has been identified as a major pathogen associated with the development of chronic gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcer disease as well as gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (1.Figura N.

H. pyloristrains expressing the vacuolating toxin A and genes encoded by the cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA)1-associated pathogenicity island (PAI) have been considered associated with enhanced pathogenic potential of the bacterium (1.Figura N.

Individuals infected with PAI-positive H. pylori strains display more severe courses of gastric inflammation and gastroduodenal ulcer disease and appear to develop more frequently gastric adenocarcinomas and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas (9.Telford J.L. Ghiara P. Dell'Orco M. Comanducci M. Burroni D. Bugnoli D. Tecce M.F. Censini S. Covacci A. Xiang Z. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1653-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 10.Marchetti M.

The PAI represents a cluster of 31 genes that encode presumably a specialized secretion system that enables the bacterium to expose or secrete particular proteins that are involved in induction of intracellular signaling cascades of target cells (7.Covacci A. Rappuoli R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A molecular concept for the enhanced pathogenicity of PAI-positive H. pylori strains has been provided by the observation that genes located within the PAI are indispensable for activation of NF-κB and AP-1 as well as stimulation of IL-8 production and secretion in gastric epithelial cells and therefore seem to elicit a more pronounced immune response (7.Covacci A.

In addition to cag-related genes, factors outside the PAI also appear to contribute to the differences in the pathogenic potential of H. pylori (16.Chang C.S Chen L.T. Yang J.T. Lin J.T. Chang K.C.

The gastric inflammatory response to H. pylori is characterized by mucosal infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes leading to enhanced release of cytokines and chemokines (3.Nedrud J.G. Czinn S.J. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 1997; 13: 71-78Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18.Bodger K. Crabtree J.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, increased gastric histamine secretion appears to contribute to the inflammatory changes and tissue damage associated with chronicH. pylori infection of the gastric mucosa (19.Peek R.M.

Histamine represents the major stimulus controlling gastric acid secretion and is produced and secreted by enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells of the corpus mucosa (22.Modlin I.V. Tang L.H.

Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the key enzyme for histamine production in gastric ECL cells, and its enzymatic activity is to a large extent regulated through enhanced transcription of the HDC gene (27.Dimaline R.

In addition to its central role in regulation of gastric acid secretion, increased HDC gene expression has also been found to be associated with gastric inflammation and development of gastroduodenal ulceration (31.Bouclier M.

Furthermore, we found that oxidative stress, which is commonly increased in ulcerative and inflammatory diseases affecting the gastric mucosa, is capable of transactivating the hHDC promoter in vitro (36.Höcker M.

Aside from its ulcerogenic potential, histamine has also been shown to possess immunomodulatory properties in the context of mucosal inflammations, contributes to the healing of ulcerative lesions of the gastric and intestinal mucosa, and has also been shown to stimulate the growth of gastric epithelial cells (37.Fujioto K.

A current in vivo study demonstrated that H. pylori infection is associated with increased mucosal histamine levels as well as an expansion of the gastric ECL cell lineage (42.Bechi P. Romagnoli P. Bacci S. Die R. Amorosi A. Cianchi F. Masini E. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 91: 2339-2343Google Scholar). The hypothesis that these changes could be at least in part be attributed to a direct effect of H. pylori on ECL cells has been substantiated by the finding thatH. pylori can stimulate histamine secretion from isolated rat ECL cells as well as ECL cell proliferation in vitro(43.Kidd M. Miu K. Tang L.H. Prez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Sandor A. Modlin I.M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1110-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although these findings strongly suggested that H. pylori can directly influence the histamine metabolism of gastric ECL cells, potential molecular mechanisms that could underlie this effect are unclear. It has been demonstrated that in gastric epithelial cells H. pylori infection elevates the abundance of “classical” second messenger molecules such as Ca2+, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and inositol trisphosphate (44.Chan E.C. Chen K.T. Lin Y.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). AlthoughH. pylori has been shown to stimulate phosphorylation of several cellular proteins in gastric cancer cells in vitro(44.Chan E.C. Chen K.T. Lin Y.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 45.Segal E.D. Lange C. Covacci A. Tompkins L.S. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), intracellular signaling cascades activated by the bacterium are largely unknown. In a current study, we investigated the effect ofH. pylori on the AP-1 transcription factor complex in gastric cancer cells in vitro and found that AP-1 activity is regulated by H. pylori through activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (13.Naumann M. Wessler S. Bartsch C. Wieland B. Covacci A. Haas R. Meyer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31655-31662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which belongs to the superfamily of “mitogen-activated protein kinases” (MAP kinases) (46.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In addition to the JNK cascade, the MAP kinase superfamily comprises the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (46.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although some overlap between both pathways has been described (46.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the JNK cascade activates primarily transcription factors involved in the “stress response” of eukaryotic cells, whereas the ERK pathway has been linked to genes involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation (46.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Recently we demonstrated that ERK-related signaling cascades also play a central role in the transmission of the effects of gastrin and oxidative stress on the hHDC promoter in gastric cancer cells, whereas the JNK pathway is not involved in hHDC gene regulation (36.Höcker M. Rosenberg I. Henihan R.J. Xavier R. Wiedenmann B. Rosewicz S. Podolsky D.K. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23046-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 49.Höcker M. Henihan R.J. Rosewicz S. Riecken E.-O. Zhang Z. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is highly likely that the ERK cascade represents a potential target signaling route through which activators of hHDC gene transcription exert their transactivating effect on the hHDC promoter. To investigate whether H. pylori can directly influence the transcriptional activity of the hHDC promoter, we performed in vitro studies employing hHDC-luciferase reporter gene constructs as well as various hHDC promoter mutants. Furthermore, we aimed to analyze the signal transduction pathways and nuclear factors responsible for transmission of this effect on the hHDC promoter. Finally, we analyzed the virulence factors involved in regulation of the hHDC promoter by H. pylori. The human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (AGS) was grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 100 units ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. AGS-B cells express the cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor through stable transfection and were described before (30.Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tågerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G619-G633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were treated with 50 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 4 h or treated with 200 ng/ml EGF (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) for 6 h. AGS-B cells were stimulated with 10−7m gastrin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 12 h. To block MEK activation, cells were preincubated with 50 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem) for 30 min before infection. The following H. pyloristrains were used for infection experiments: P12 strains (wild type) and the isogenic cagA *(cagA with a probable polar effect), vacA (50.Schmitt W. Haas R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and PAI (missing the cag pathogenicity island (PAI); and G27 (wild type) and the isogenic cagIstrain (8.Censini S. Lange C.

For the construction of the PAI strain two approximately 2-kb DNA fragments upstream of the cag-PAI (region 545254–547164) and downstream of the PAI (584570–586563) (51.Tomb J.F. White O.

The plasmid was transformed into H. pylori (P12), and one transformant was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for correct allelic exchange of the PAI with the resistance gene. H. pylori strains were grown on agar plates containing 10% horse serum in a microaerophilic atmosphere (generated by Campy-Gen, Oxoid, Basingstoke, U. K.) at 37 °C for 48–72 h. 24 h after infection H. pyloriwas harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), diluted corresponding to the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.), and incubated with the epithelial monolayer. Infection with H. pylori was monitored routinely by light microscopy. 24 h prior to transfection, cells were seeded in tissue culture plates and grown to 60–70% confluence. Transient transfections of 1–2 μg of reporter constructs were carried out using cationic liposomes (Dac-30, Eurogentec, Sart Tilman, Belgium) according to a protocol reported previously (13.Naumann M.

After transfection the cells were deprived of serum and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 4 mm glutamine and 0.1% fetal calf serum for 20–24 h. The expression of the transfected dominant negative kinase constructs was controlled by immunoblotting. For measurement of transactivation activity transfected cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was assayed as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The results were recorded on a Wallac 409 β-counter (Berthold-Wallac, Bad Wildbach, Germany). The data represent the mean ± S.D. calculated from three independent experiments as fold activation compared with the control. Activities varied <15% among transfection experiments. To detect activated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 total AGS cell extracts were prepared in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1.25% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol. Equal amounts of protein extracts were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted on membranes. Western blot analysis was performed using phospho-specific antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to detect pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2. Each sample was probed with anti-MEK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to indicate equivalent protein amounts in all lanes. To detect IκBα, samples were probed with an anti-IκBα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared by using a non-ionic detergent method as described previously (55.Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For the detection of gastrin-responsive element (GAS-RE) DNA binding activity, equal amounts of nuclear protein extracts were incubated with labeled oligonucleotides containing the +1 +27 GAS-RE binding site sequence of the human HDC promoter: 5′-ACCCTTTAAATAAAGGGCCCACACTGG-3′ 5′-CCAGTGTGGGCCCTTTATTTAAAGGGT-3′. The oligonucleotide containing the GAS-RE recognition site was labeled using T4 kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The DNA binding reactions were performed using a binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4% Ficoll for 20 min at room temperature. For competitions, increasing amounts of an unlabeled oligonucleotide were included in the bandshift reaction. The DNA binding activity of NF-κB was performed with an Igκ oligonucleotide as described previously (55.Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The DNA binding reactions were performed using a binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.4), 60 mm KCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel using 12.5 mm Tris, 12.5 mm boric acid, and 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 8.3). The gels were dried and exposed to Amersham TM films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C using an intensifying screen. AGS cells were transiently transfected with the hHDC1.8kb-luc construct and colonized withH. pylori (P12) at different m.o.i. values for 4 h. H. pylori stimulated hHDC promoter activity in a m.o.i.-dependent manner already at a m.o.i. of 5 compared with noninfected cells (Fig.1 A). Further increase of the infection-dose up to a m.o.i. of 50 raised the hHDC promoter activity to maximal stimulation. To identify the H. pylori-responsive element of the hHDC promoter sufficient for the transcriptional response, we analyzed a series of hHDC 5′-deletion constructs (Fig. 1 B). Removal of nucleotides from the 5′-end down to 125 bp upstream of the Cap site (+1) had no significant influence on the H. pylori-induced luciferase activity. Similar results were obtained in cells treated with PMA (data not shown). Because this region comprises the +1 to +27 bp GAS-RE of the hHDC proximal promoter, we used a luciferase construct in which the GAS-RE sequence hHDC +1 to +27 was ligated upstream of the enhancerless herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. We found that this element was capable of conferring H. pyloriresponsiveness to the same extend as the longest hHDC 5′-flanking fragments. To underline that the GAS-RE is activated by H. pylorithrough enhanced binding of nuclear factors, we analyzed the DNA binding activity of nuclear proteins to the +1 to +27 sequence in EMSAs. Enhanced binding of AGS nuclear proteins was observed within 30 min postinfection (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–4). Treatment of AGS cells with PMA, a strong inducer of hHDC promoter activity, resulted in a strong increase of DNA binding activity of transcription factors within 10 min (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5–7). Because H. pylori- and PMA-induced complexes produced identical bandshifts it can be concluded that the H. pylori-stimulated complex consists of GAS-RE-binding proteins (GAS-RE-BPs). This was further confirmed by the finding that the complex stimulated by H. pylori could be competed away by an excess of unlabeled hHDC +1/+27 bp oligonucleotide (Fig. 1 C,lanes 8–10). Based on these data, H. pylori was identified to induce very specific (m.o.i. of 5–50) enhanced hHDC promoter activity through activation of the GAS-RE-BP1/2 transcription factors that bind to the +1 to +27 bp minimal element. To investigate the role of cag genes for activation of the hHDC promoter by H. pylori, AGS cells were colonized with different isogenic mutants lacking certaincag genes. AGS cells transfected with the 1.8-kb hHDC-luc construct exerted after infection with H. pylori wild type strains (P12 and G27) a strong increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 2 A,left panel). Similar activation was obtained in AGS cells, infected with isogenic mutants, lacking the vacA, cagA*, andcagI genes. Additionally, the isogenic H. pyloristrain PAI, which lacks the entire PAI, potently induced the hHDC promoter activity, supporting the notion of acag-independent activation of the hHDC promoter by H. pylori. In contrast, in AGS cells transfected with a reporter gene construct in which luciferase expression was under control of the NF-κB consensus element of the HIV promoter, H. pylorimutants lacking cagA*- cagI genes or the entire PAI did not stimulate reporter gene expression (Fig. 2 A,right panel). The cag-independent activation of the HDC promoter activity was also investigated by EMSA. Enhanced DNA binding of the GAS-RE-BP1/2 to the HDC enhancer element was observed in AGS cells infected with any H. pylori (Fig. 2 B,lane 1–8, left panel). Using the Igκ-NF-κB oligonucleotide to detect NF-κB DNA binding activity, colonization with the H. pylori strains P12, vacA, and G27 induced strong activation of NF-κB (Fig.2 B, lanes 1–3 and 6, right panel), whereas the knockout mutants cagA*,cagI, and PAI showed a strongly reduced NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4,7, and 8, right panel). To study the signaling that is induced byH. pylori in a cag-independent manner, we investigated the capability of H. pylori to induce activation of certain MAP kinase pathways. Subconfluent monolayers of AGS cells were infected with H. pylori (P12), and cell lysates were prepared after different time points postinfection and analyzed for activated and p"
https://openalex.org/W2017763545,"The expression of the CII splice variant of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase 4 (PMCA4) was down-regulated in granule neurons when they were cultured under conditions of partial membrane depolarization (25 mm KCl), which are required for long term in vitro survival of the neurons. These conditions, which cause a chronic increase of the resting free Ca2+ concentration in the neurons, have recently been shown to promote up-regulation of the PMCA2, 3, and 1CII isoforms. Whereas the chronic, i.e. >3 days, Ca2+ increase was necessary for the up-regulation of the PMCA1CII, 2, and 3, the down-regulation of the PMCA4CII mRNA was already evident 1–2 h after the start of culturing in 25 mm KCl. The immunosuppressant calcineurin inhibitor FK506 inhibited the down-regulation of the PMCA4CII at both the protein and the mRNA level but did not affect the changes of the other PMCA pumps. Direct evidence for the involvement of calcineurin in the down-regulation of the PMCA4CII was obtained by overexpressing a truncated, constitutively active, and Ca2+-independent form of calcineurin; under these conditions, depolarization was not required for the down-regulation of the PMCA4CII pump. De novosynthesis of (transcription) factors was required for the down-regulation of the PMCA4CII mRNA. Calcineurin, therefore, controls the neuronal transcription of PMCA4CII, a splice variant of the pump isoforms that is found almost exclusively in brain.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). These transporters are located in the membranes of intracellular organelles (the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria) and in the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA)1 (also called the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump) shares with a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger the task of transporting Ca2+ out of the cell. The general biochemical properties of the pump have been established on the enzyme in membranes and in the purified state (2.Carafoli E. Stauffer T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cloning of the pump cDNA has revealed an unexpected complexity in the genes encoding the ATPase and their products (3.Carafoli E. Guerini D. Trends. Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pump is encoded by four genes, and the primary transcripts are alternatively spliced at two independent sites (4.Keeton T.P. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2740-2748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Stauffer T. Hilfiker H. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25993-26003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the expression of more than 20 different proteins (3.Carafoli E. Guerini D. Trends. Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The distribution of the four basic gene products and of the spliced isoforms has been extensively studied at the mRNA level and, more recently, at the protein level using isoform-specific antibodies (6.Guerini D. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These studies have indicated that the transcripts for PMCA1 and PMCA4 are ubiquitously present in cells and tissues, whereas those for PMCA2 and PMCA3 have a restricted tissue distribution: i.e. they are expressed at levels comparable to those of PMCA1 and PMCA4 only in neurons (7.Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 8.Filoteo A. Elwess N. Enyedi A. Caride A. Aung H. Penniston J. J.

However, it is known that PMCA2 has the highest calmodulin sensitivity, whereas the truncated variant PMCA4CII 2Isoforms PMCA4CI and PMCA4CII (46.Carafoli E.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7946-7953Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Information on the mechanisms that regulate the expression of the PMCA genes is equally limited, but a role of protein kinase C has been suggested for the case of PMCA1 (11.Kuo T.H. Wang K.K.W. Carlock L. Diglio C. Tsang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2520-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study using primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons has shown that the sustained increase of cytosolic Ca2+ occurring during maturation up-regulated the expression of the PMCA2 and PMCA3 proteins and of a splice variant of the PMCA1 protein (12.Guerini D. Garcia-Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). By contrast, the PMCA4CII isoform, which is the brain-specific splicing variant of PMCA4 (13.Keeton T.P. Shull G.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), behaved differently (12.Guerini D. Garcia-Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To further explore the differences in the brain expression of the PMCA pump isoforms, experiments have been performed on the Ca2+calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, which has recently come to forefront as a modulator of gene transcription in a variety of systems (14.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar, 15.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar). The experiments have shown that the immunosuppressant FK506, which inhibits calcineurin, prevented the depolarization-mediated down-regulation of the PMCA4CII isoform but did not influence the expression of PMCA1, 2, and 3. The down-regulation of PMCA4CII was more rapid than the up-regulation of the other PMCA isoforms but was slower than the up-regulation of immediate early genes such as c-fos. In addition, it was prevented by cycloheximide, indicating the necessity of de novo protein synthesis. Finally, the overexpression of a Ca2+-independent, constitutively active calcineurin down-regulated the expression of the PMCA4 protein in the absence of depolarization-mediated Ca2+ increases. Poly-d-lysine, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide (MTT).N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA), nifedipine, calyculin A, and okadaic acid were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Oligonucleotides were purchased from MGW-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Ampli-Taq Gold polymerase was from Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. All other reagents were of the highest purity grade commercially available. Cyclosporin A and FK506 were a kind gift of Dr. Mauro Zurini (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). Granule cells were dissociated from the cerebella of 7-day old Wistar rats as described (16.Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balázs R. Jörgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hepes modification, Sigma) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 7 μm p-aminobenzoic acid, 100 μg/ml pyruvate, 100 microunits/ml insulin, on poly-d-lysine-treated plates at a density of 2–3 × 105 cells/cm2 in the presence of 5.3, 10, or 25 mm KCl. 10 mm KCl has been used in the experiments with NMDA, to permit a limited penetration of Ca2+ to remove the block by Mg2+ at the inner mouth of the NMDA channel. After 24 h, 10 μmcytosine arabinofuranoside was added to the culture to inhibit mitotic cell growth. Neuronal survival was estimated by measuring the amount of colored formazan in the cells by the reduction of MTT (17.Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 943-946PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of contaminating astrocytes was estimated by immunocytochemistry using a glial fibrillary acidic protein-specific monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunocytochemistry was performed as described earlier (18.Foletti D. Guerini D. Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 670-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended at 5–10 × 106 cells/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 75 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to three cycles of freeze and thaw. The particulate fraction was sedimented at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting protein pellet was resuspended in 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% sucrose and frozen at −70 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (19.Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with affinity-purified isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies against the PMCA pump (7.Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The JA9 monoclonal antibody specific for the PMCA4 isoform was kindly donated by Dr. J. Penniston (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) (8.Filoteo A. Elwess N. Enyedi A. Caride A. Aung H. Penniston J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23741-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. The reaction was stopped after 5 min for the affinity-purified serum against PMCA1, after 10 min for the affinity-purified antibodies specific for PMCA2 and PMCA3 and for the monoclonal 5F10 antibody that recognizes all isoforms, and after 15–25 min for antibody JA9 or the rat4N polyclonal antibody specific for the rat PMCA4. When the blots were incubated with CDP-Stara (Tropix, Bedford, MA), they were exposed to a chemiluminescence-sensitive photographic film. If needed, Western blots were scanned with Adobe PhotoShop software and quantified with the help of National Institutes of Health Image 1.59. Total RNA was prepared from granule cells according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (20.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1897; 162: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63169) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized using a random octamer primer (First Strand cDNA synthesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using the oligonucleotides described by Guerini et al. (12.Guerini D. Garcia-Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) for alternative splicing site C. The oligonucleotide specific for the PMCA4CII isoform was 5′ GAG GAG GTG TAA CGG CAG AAG (rat PMCA4CII, 3622–3647) (13.Keeton T.P. Shull G.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The conditions for the PCRs were as those suggested by Perkin-Elmer for theTaq Gold polymerase. The identity of the PCR-generated fragments was verified by Southern blotting and by sequencing. Northern blotting was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PMCA4CI-specific fragment was 3456–3727 (4.Keeton T.P. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2740-2748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Keeton T.P. Shull G.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and that of G3PDH was 371–1015 (22.Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The Northern and Southern blots were scanned with Adobe PhotoShop and quantified with the help of the National Institutes of Health Image 1.59 software package. A cDNA fragment encompassing the first 98 amino acids (Pro-4 to Leu-102) of rat PMCA4 was amplified from total RNA of granule cells. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-ATGACGGATCCATCAGGACATAAC-3′ (nucleotides 168–194; the mutated sequences resulting in the generation of a novelBamHI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-GTGTGAATTC CTACAGGGCTTCCCACA-3′ (nucleotides 453–483; the inserted EcoRI site is underlined, and the inserted stop codon is in boldface). The numbering of the oligonucleotides is according to Keeton and Shull (13.Keeton T.P. Shull G.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The amplified cDNA was verified by sequencing and inserted in pRESET B vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). The peptide was expressed inEscherichia coli JM109 and purified according to the procedure recommended by the provider (InVitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The peptide was then used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (7.Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The antibodies (named rat 4N) were affinity-purified from the serum as described earlier (7.Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Because the serum also reacted weakly with the human PMCA4, the isoform specificity was verified on full-length human isoforms expressed in insect cells, as described earlier (7.Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The rat 4N serum showed a strong reaction for PMCA4, a very weak cross-reactivity with human PMCA1, and almost no reactivity with PMCA2 and PMCA3. cDNAs for the wild type and truncated rat calcineurin A were amplified by PCR from rat granule cell total RNA. The oligonucleotides were derived from the rat αCnA (23.Ito A. Hashimoto T. Hirai M. Takeda T. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and were as follows: CnA forward, AAGAATTCCCAAGGCGATGATCCCAAG (nucleotides 208–237; the EcoRI restriction site is underlined); CnA reverse, AACTCGAGTGAACGAGAAGTGGTCACTG (nucleotides 1372–1399; theXhoI restriction site is underlined); ΔCnA reverse, AACTCGAGACCTCCTACCGGGCTGCAGC (nucleotides 1768–1795; the XhoI restriction site is underlined, and the stop codon is in boldface). The oligonucleotide for ΔCnA inserted a stop codon at the position corresponding to Lys-392, located at the beginning of the calmodulin binding domain. The ΔCnA lacked all the sequences downstream of the calmodulin binding domain and hence was Ca2+-independent (24.Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The PCR fragments were purified and subcloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega). The clones that contained the desired sequences were digested with EcoRI and withXhoI, which released the full-length CnA and ΔCnA cDNAs and inserted them in the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pTM3 vector. The pTM3 vector, a kind gift of Dr. Moss (25.Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar), allows the generation of recombinant vaccinia viruses by homologous recombination. Recombinant vaccinia viruses were prepared according to the method of Boyle and Coupar (26.Boyle D.B. Coupar B.E. Gene. 1988; 65: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of pTM3-CnA or pTM3-ΔCnA were used to transfect COS cells that were previously incubated for 120 min (at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01) with wild type vaccinia virus. After 8–12 incubation, fresh medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 50 μg of gentamicin) supplemented with 2.5 μl/ml mycophenolic acid, 250 μg/ml xanthine and 1:50 HAT, was added to the cells. Three days after the start of the infection, the virus was released from the cells by three cycles of freeze and thaw. The crude virus was plated on COS cells in the presence of mycophenolic acid and plaque-purified. The recombinant viruses were further purified on thymidine kinase-deficient cells in the presence of bromo-uridine (27.Drillien R. Spehner D. Virology. 1983; 131: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were plated at a density of 104 cells/cm2 and infected for 30 min at 37 °C with the recombinant T7 polymerase helper virus (25.Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) and the CnA or ΔCnA recombinant viruses (10–20 viruses per cell). After 12–16 h of infection, the cells were labeled with 150 μCi/ml [35S]Met for 1 h. Granule cells were infected as indicated for HeLa cells. In some cases, different ratios of virus/cell were used (see Figure legends). The infected neurons were processed normally 2–3 days after infection. The survival of the granule cells was estimated by the MTT method. Previous studies had indicated that very low amounts of PMCA4 were present in granule cells matured in the presence of depolarizing concentrations of KCl (25 mm), which increases their long term survival (12.Guerini D. Garcia-Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This was at variance with the brain-specific isoforms 2 and 3 and isoform 1CII, which were poorly represented at plating time but became strongly up-regulated during the maturation process (Fig. 1 A). The behavior of the PMCA4 isoform was similar to that of PMCA1CI, which did not change significantly during the maturation of the neurons. A further decrease in the already low concentration of PMCA4 was even observed in some cases, after longer times of culturing in high KCl (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). In sharp contrast to this, if the cells were cultured for a few days in the presence of low (i.e.nondepolarizing) concentrations of KCl (5–10 mm), higher amounts of the PMCA4 isoform became expressed (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the isoform was down-regulated by treatments that induced a chronic increase of intracellular Ca2+ (12.Guerini D. Garcia-Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar),e.g. in addition to depolarization, the exposure of the cells to the glutamate agonist NMDA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and4). Consistent with this, l-type Ca2+ channel inhibitors prevented the down-regulation (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 5). The l-channel blocker nifedipine prevented the opening of NMDA channels because it prevented the penetration of small amounts of Ca2+ (throughl-type Ca2+-channels) to remove the Mg2+ block of the NMDA channel. The down-regulation was also prevented by the NMDA-specific inhibitors MK801 (not shown). PMCA2 and PMCA3 (Fig. 1 B, panels 2N and 3N) showed an opposite behavior, i.e. they were up-regulated by the treatments that induced the sustained increased of intracellular Ca2+. One of the effects of the increase of intracellular Ca2+ is to activate the Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, which is crucial to the regulation of the expression at several genes (28.Guerini D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To test whether the phosphatase also played a role in the expression of PMCA pump isoforms, granule cells were cultured under depolarizing conditions in the presence of the immunosuppressant FK506, an inhibitor of calcineurin (29.Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3615) Google Scholar), or of the inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, calyculin A, and okadaic acid (30.Ishihara H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). FK506 prevented the down-regulation of the expression of PMCA4 (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). Calyculin A and okadaic acid turned out to be very toxic to the neurons and could not be further investigated: measurements of the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases with MTT (17.Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 943-946PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that more than 90% of the cells died after 6–8 h incubation with concentrations of okadaic acid calyculin A as low as 20 and 2 nm, respectively (not shown). Attempts were made to inhibit calmodulin kinases to verify their involvement in the down-regulation of PMCA4CII or other pump isoforms. Unfortunately, the commonly used inhibitors KN-92 and KN-93 proved toxic to the granule cells: only 10–20% of them survived after a 6–8 h incubation period, a time that was too short to permit measurements of specific effects on PMCA4CII. The results in Fig. 1, A–C, were obtained with the monoclonal antibody JA9, which generated rather weak signals in rat granule cell membranes. Stronger signals were obtained with an antiserum prepared using a recombinant peptide encompassing the N-terminal portion of the rat PMCA4 pump. The antiserum confirmed the observations made with the monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1 D), in particular that FK506 prevented the depolarization-mediated down-regulation of the PMCA4. The lack of effect by rapamycin, an immunosuppressant that binds to the FK506-binding protein but fails to inhibit the activity of calcineurin, supported the conclusion that the down-regulation of PMCA4 required the activation of calcineurin. The effect of FK506 was partially reversed by high concentrations of rapamycin (a 300-fold excess was required (Fig. 1 D, lane 5,see also Fig. 1 E), indicating that binding to the FK506-binding immunophilin was necessary for the effects on PMCA4 expression. As indicated in Fig. 1 E, the effect of FK506 was observed down to a concentration of 3 nm. Culturing the cells for 5–6 days in the presence of up to 1 μm FK506 and in the presence of 1 μm rapamycin had no effects on cells survival estimated using MTT tests (results not shown). A summary of the results obtained in 5–9 different experiments is shown in Fig.1 E. The down-regulation of the PMCA4 isoform was also studied at the transcriptional level. A Northern blot with total RNA isolated from cells cultured for 5 days in 25 mm KCl showed higher amounts of PMCA4 mRNA when FK506 was present in the culturing medium (Fig. 2 A). To further analyze the effect, RT-PCR was performed using oligonucleotides specific for PMCA4 (Fig. 2 B). The intensity of the PMCA4-specific bands was decreased by the depolarizing treatment (Fig.2 B, lane 2), the effect being prevented by low concentrations of FK506 (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) but not by rapamycin (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). If rapamycin was present in the culturing medium in a 300-fold molar excess to FK506, it competed with it (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). FK506 and rapamycin did not seem to affect the expression of PMCA4 in the presence of nondepolarizing concentration of KCl (not shown). No effects of FK506 were observed on the mRNAs for the PMCA1, 2, and 3 isoforms (Fig. 2 C). In the case of PMCA4, oligonucleotides specific for both splice site A and C were used (Fig. 2 B, top panel). Two bands were amplified for site C (Fig. 2 B, middle panel). Whereas that of higher molecular mass (420 bp, 4CII) had a strong sensitivity to depolarization and was protected by FK506, the lower band (270 bp, 4CI) was almost insensitive to these treatments. This band, which corresponds to the CI splice variant of isoform 4, is likely to be contributed mostly by the PMCA4 isoform of the glia cells contaminating the neuronal culture. Even if glia cells represented less the 5% of the total cell population in the culture, they contain large amounts of PMCA4CI mRNA (31.Fresu G. Dehpour A. Genazzani A.A. Carafoli E. Guerini D. Glia. 1999; 28: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is much better amplified than that of the PMCA4CII isoform. 3Guerini, D., unpublished observations. The down-regulation of the PMCA4 mRNA by depolarization became evident 2–4 h after the initiation of the treatment (Fig.3) and was thus slower than the up-regulation of the c-fos mRNA (15–20 min (32.Thompson M.A. Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4224-4235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), not shown). It was, however, much faster than the up-regulation of the PMCA1, 2, and 3 isoforms (12.Guerini D. Garcia-Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To establish whether de novoprotein synthesis was required for the down-regulation of PMCA4, cells were incubated in the presence of cycloheximide, a classical inhibitor of protein synthesis. Cycloheximide prevented the decrease of the PMCA4 mRNA occurring when cell cultures were switched from 5.3 to 25 mm KCl (Fig. 3). Under the same conditions, cycloheximide failed to block the up-regulation of c-fos (not shown), in line with the observation that the up-regulation of c-fos, like that of all other immediate early genes, does not require de novo protein synthesis. To establish whether the down-regulation of PMCA4 could be induced by calcineurin even in the absence of the depolarizing treatment, i.e. in the absence of cellular Ca2+ increases, experiments were performed using a truncated, Ca2+-independent calcineurin catalytic subunit (ΔCnA) (33.Clipstone N.A. Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26431-26437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To detect effects on the down-regulation of the PMCA4 in granule cells, it would have been necessary to achieve an efficiency of transfection of recombinant calcineurin approaching 80–90%. Because this is unrealistic in neurons, which are normally very difficult to transfect, it was decided to use a viral expression system. Preliminary experiments had shown that the t7 polymerase-based vaccinia virus system (25.Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) was able to drive the expression of recombinant proteins in more than 85–90% of the granule cells in the culture, as detected by immunocytochemistry (not shown). Recombinant viruses for CnA and ΔCnA were generated by homologous recombination in COS cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” When co-transfected with the t7 polymerase, these viruses were able to drive high level of expression of the CnA and ΔCnA proteins in HeLa cells (Fig. 4 A). Strong signals were visible at 59 (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) and 42 kDa (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), corresponding to the molecular masses of CnA and ΔCnA, respectively, when HeLa cel"

The cytotoxicity of Stx2d is increased (activated) 10–1000-fold for Vero cells when the toxin is incubated with mucus obtained from the small intestine of mice. In this study we isolated an Stx2d activator and identified it as a mouse elastase with strong homology to human elastase IIIB. Moreover, commercially available porcine pancreatic elastase preparations also activated Stx2d cytotoxicity although with a lower specific activity than isolated mouse elastase. Elastase directly nicked the Stx2d A subunit to A1 and A2, an event that did not correlate with activation. However, elastase also reduced the size and changed the isoelectric point of the A2 peptide, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by Western immunoblot analysis. This elastase-mediated size and charge shift in the A2 peptide of Stx2d occurred concurrently with activation of the toxin. Both the reduction in size of the Stx2d A2 peptide by incubation with elastase as well as the associated activation of Stx2d cytotoxicity were fully inhibited by elastatinal, an elastase-specific inhibitor.

Shiga toxin(s) Shiga toxin-producing E. coli ion exchange chromatography hydrophobic interaction chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis expressed sequence tag The Shiga toxins (Stx)1expressed by Stx-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) andShigella dysenteriae are a family of potent cytotoxins that are comprised of a single A subunit associated with a pentamer of B subunits (see Ref. 1.Kaper J.B. O'Brien A.D. Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Other Shiga Toxin-Producing E. coli Strains. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998Google Scholar for a comprehensive review of STEC). The A subunit of Stx has N-glycosidase activity that cleaves an adenine residue from the 28 S ribosomal RNA within the 60S ribosome, an event that halts protein synthesis and leads to the death of the affected cell. The A subunit of Stx is susceptible to trypsin cleavage near its C terminus. Such cleavage results in the formation of an A1subunit of 28 kDa that has the N-glycosidase activity and an A2 peptide of 4 kDa that remains associated with A1 through a single disulfide bond. The A2 peptide links A1 to the B pentamer (2.Fraser M.E. Chernaia M.M. Kozlov Y.K. James M.N.G. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The B pentamer of most Stx family members binds preferentially to globotriaosylceramide on eukaryotic cells (3.Kongmuang U.T. Honda T. Miwatani T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 56: 105-108Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 4.Jacewicz M. Clausen H. Nudelman E. Donohue-Rolfe A. Keusch G.T. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).We have previously reported (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Melton-Celsa, A. R., and O'Brien, A. D. (1998) in Bacterial Protein Toxins: Zent. Bl. Bakteriol. (Hacker, J., et al., eds) Suppl. 29, pp. 192–199, Gustav Fischer, Jena, GermanyGoogle Scholar) that when a variant of Stx2, called Stx2d (formerly named SLT-IIvh) is incubated with crude mucus isolated from the small intestine or colon of mice or the colon of humans, the cytotoxicity of the mucus-treated Stx2d increases 10–1000-fold for Vero cells. We call this enhancement of cytotoxicity “activation.” STEC strains that produce Stx2d are exquisitely virulent in a streptomycin-treated mouse oral challenge model (7.Wadolkowski E.A. Sung L.M. Burris J.A. Samuel J.E. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3959-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this mouse model, pathogenicity of STEC is due primarily to toxin production, as demonstrated by the finding that mice are protected by passive immunization with anti-Stx2 antibodies (7.Wadolkowski E.A. Sung L.M. Burris J.A. Samuel J.E. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3959-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The low LD50 of certain STEC strains correlates with the capacity of these strains to express the activable Stx2d (6.Melton-Celsa, A. R., and O'Brien, A. D. (1998) in Bacterial Protein Toxins: Zent. Bl. Bakteriol. (Hacker, J., et al., eds) Suppl. 29, pp. 192–199, Gustav Fischer, Jena, GermanyGoogle Scholar). For example, one virulent strain, B2F1, that has an oral LD50 of <10 colony forming units (8.Lindgren S.W. Melton A.R. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3832-3842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), produces two activable toxins named Stx2d1 (formerly SLT-IIvha) and Stx2d2 (formerly SLT-IIvhb) (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to distinguish them from one another. By contrast, STEC O157:H− strain E32511/HSC that replicates as well as B2F1 in mouse small intestinal mucus but produces nonactivable Stx2c has an oral LD50 of 1010colony forming units (8.Lindgren S.W. Melton A.R. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3832-3842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Amino acid sequence comparison of the activable Stx2d and nonactivable Stx2c reveal very few sequence differences (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the B subunit of Stx2d2 and Stx2c are identical, an observation that suggests that the key to the activable phenotype lies within the A subunit. There are only two amino acid differences between the A subunits of Stx2d2 and Stx2c, and both of these amino acids are located in the A2peptide (9.Ito H. Terai A. Kurazono H. Takeda Y. Nishibuchi M. Microb. Pathog. 1990; 8: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), a fact suggesting that the effect crude intestinal mucus has on Stx2d involves the A2 peptide.The general nature of the alterations to Stx2d that occur after incubation with mucus were examined in a previous report (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that there is no apparent modification to the A1 subunit of activated Stx2d based on electrophoretic mobility; changes to the A2 subunit could not be discerned at the time of the initial report (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because the polyclonal serum used in the Western immunoblot analysis did not detect the A2peptide. We also showed that isolated intestinal mucus nicks the A subunit of Stx2d and Stx2 to A1 and A2 in a manner similar to trypsin treatment, but only mucus and not trypsin activates Stx2d. In support of this, we found that trypsin-nicked Stx2d that is not activated can subsequently be activated by isolated mucus (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From these data we concluded that nicking of the Stx2d A subunit to the A1 and A2 peptides is not equivalent to activation. In this study, we sought to isolate and identify the factor(s) from mouse crude small intestinal mucus that activates Stx2d and to further address the effect of this activating factor on Stx2d.DISCUSSIONWe have identified an Stx2d-cytotoxicity enhancing factor from mouse crude small intestinal mucus as an elastase. Although elastases have not previously been associated with activation or enhancement of toxic activity of bacterial toxins, a number of such toxins are expressed as inactive protoxins that require activation by proteolytic digestion to become toxic. This type of activation can occur either extracellularly (e.g. Clostridium septicum α toxin (26.Ballard J. Sokolov Y. Yuan W.-L. Kagan B.L. Tweten R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) or intracellularly (e.g. Pseudomonasexotoxin (27.Ogata M. Fryling C.M. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25396-25401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anthrax toxin protective antigen (28.Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Henderson M.A. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 82-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and others (29.Gordon V.M. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). A second kind of toxin activation is more unusual and involves enhancement of toxicity of an already active toxin by exogenous proteases (e.g. Clostridium perfringensenterotoxin (30.Granum P.E. Whitaker J.R. Skjelkvale R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 668: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31.Granum P.E. Richardson M. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 445-453Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32.Kokai-Kun J.F. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Stx2d appears to fall into both of these categories. To become fully cytotoxic (33.Lea N. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), Stx2d is nicked by proteases in or near a loop containing two Cys residues to separate the A subunit into the A1 and A2 peptides (2.Fraser M.E. Chernaia M.M. Kozlov Y.K. James M.N.G. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 29.Gordon V.M. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and then, as we report here, this fully cytotoxic Stx2d appears to undergo an additional proteolytic cleavage event that enhances its cytotoxicity. The proteases that activate many toxins are often trypsin or chymotrypsin, in the case of extracellular activation (26.Ballard J. Sokolov Y. Yuan W.-L. Kagan B.L. Tweten R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30.Granum P.E. Whitaker J.R. Skjelkvale R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 668: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31.Granum P.E. Richardson M. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 445-453Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), or furin, in the case of some intracellular activation (28.Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Henderson M.A. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 82-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is the first report of which we are aware that links elastase to toxin activation.Protein sequencing based on mass spectrometry yielded five peptide sequences for the isolated activator. Three of these peptide sequences matched the predicted amino acid sequence of a translated mouse gene identified in the nonredundant data base of GenBankTM mouse EST entries (Fig. 3). This mouse gene is similar to the human elastase IIIB gene (22.Tani T. Ohsumi J. Mita K. Takiguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1231-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other two peptides had homology to mouse trypsin (24.Louie M. de Azavedo J. Clarke R. Borczyk A. Lior H. Richter M. Brunton J. Epidemiol. Infect. 1994; 112: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and E. coli outer membrane protein 1 (24.Louie M. de Azavedo J. Clarke R. Borczyk A. Lior H. Richter M. Brunton J. Epidemiol. Infect. 1994; 112: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), respectively. Possible explanations for the presence of these two peptides in the sequencing reaction include: (i) the peptides were artifacts of mass spectrometry-based sequencing; (ii) one or both of these peptides originated from proteins that co-purified with the mouse elastase, e.g. mouse trypsin has a similar molecular weight and isoelectric point to mouse elastase (23.Stevenson B.J. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); and (iii) one or both of these peptides may actually be part of the mouse elastase IIIB protein. The translated amino acid sequence for the mouse elastase IIIB gene (as presented in GenBankTM) appears to be shorter than would be predicted from comparison with the human elastase IIIB protein sequence (Fig. 3). Therefore, the two unidentified peptides may have originated from the putative missing C-terminal amino acid sequence of this mouse elastase.Elastatinal is a peptide derived from Actinomyces species that specifically inhibits elastase activity (25.Umezawa H. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This peptide completely inhibited the cytotoxicity-enhancing activity in both HIC peak fractions (Fig. 4) and the isolated 32-kDa protein in Rotofor fractions (Figs. 4 and 6). Higher concentrations of elastatinal also inhibited most, if not all, of the Stx2d cytotoxicity-enhancing activity of crude intestinal mucus (Figs. 4 and 6). These results are consistent with our conclusion that the 32-kDa protein is a mouse elastase with Stx2d cytotoxicity-enhancing activity.Examination of Table II reveals some differences between the effect of various protease inhibitors on the cytotoxicity-enhancing activity of mouse crude small intestinal mucus versus partially purified Stx2d activating factor. Notably, although aprotinin, antipain, chymostatin andN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone did not have any effect on the cytotoxicity-enhancing activity of crude mucus when these inhibitors were used at the maximum recommended concentration (see Table II for concentrations), these protease inhibitors blocked some of the cytotoxicity-enhancing activity of the partially purified activator. Two possible explanations for these apparently contradictory observations are as follows. First, the possibility exists that there are proteases other than elastase in intestinal mucus that can enhance the cytotoxicity of Stx2d, and these proteases are not inhibited by any of these four protease inhibitors. Second, and an explanation we consider more likely, is that the maximum recommended concentration for these protease inhibitors is insufficient to block the cytotoxicity-enhancing activity of elastase in crude mucus because elastase is only one of many serine proteases found in intestinal mucus. The many serine proteases in crude mucus may compete for inhibitors that are not specific or as efficient for elastase and overwhelm their capacity to block elastase-mediated enhancement of Stx2d. This theory is supported by examination of the inhibition activities of elastatinal and 3,4-dichloroisocourmarin. Elastatinal is an elastase-specific inhibitor and almost completely blocked the cytotoxicity-enhancing activity of crude mucus (Fig. 4), and 3,4-dichloroisocourmarin is described by the manufacturer as “inhibiting serine proteases like elastase” and completely blocked the cytotoxicity-enhancing activity of crude mucus (Table II).Although commercially available porcine pancreatic elastase preparations activated Stx2d cytotoxicity, the specific activity of these preparations was significantly lower than that of isolated mouse elastase (see text). Although Tani et al. (22.Tani T. Ohsumi J. Mita K. Takiguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1231-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a human elastase IIIA (an elastase very similar to human elastase IIIB) cDNA probe hybridizes to RNA prepared form porcine pancreas, it is possible that this elastase type is not found in commercial porcine pancreatic elastase preparations. This possibility may explain the lower specific activity of the porcine pancreatic elastase preparations.Human pancreatic elastase IIIB is similar (22.Tani T. Ohsumi J. Mita K. Takiguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1231-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to another human elastase, cholesterol-binding pancreatic protease (34.Sziegoleit A. Linder D. Schlüter M. Ogawa M. Nishibe S. Fujimoto K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (also called human pancreatic elastase I (35.Largman C. Brodrick J.W. Geokas M.C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2491-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)). The preferred sites for cholesterol-binding pancreatic protease cleavage have been determined to be the peptide bonds at the carboxyl ends of Ala, Val, Leu, Ser, His, and Thr (34.Sziegoleit A. Linder D. Schlüter M. Ogawa M. Nishibe S. Fujimoto K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This observation is relevant to our studies because one of the two differences between the A2 subunit of activatable Stx2d2 and nonactivatable Stx2c is a Ser at position 291 in Stx2d2 in the place of a Phe in Stx2c (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Ser in Stx2d2 lies on the N-terminal side of a Leu found in both activatable and nonactivatable variants of Stx. We speculate that perhaps this leucine-serine bond is the site of the elastase cleavage that results in the activation of Stx2d2. Consistent with this speculation, the Stx2d A2 peptide demonstrates a slight increase in electrophoretic mobility following elastase treatment (Fig. 6). Elastase treatment of Stx2d also increased the isoelectric point of the A2 peptide, a finding that is consistent with the removal of a negatively charged amino acid like the glutamate at the C terminus of the Stx2d A2 (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of the precise site at which the Stx2d A2 is clipped by elastase and how this effect serves to increase the cytotoxicity of Stx2d is the subject of a separate ongoing study. 2A. R. Melton-Celsa, J. F. Kokai-Kun, and A. D. O'Brien, manuscript in preparation. Elastase cleaved Stx2d at two sites: between the A1 and A2 peptides (Fig. 5) and within the A2 peptide (Figs. 6 and 7). We were unable to determine whether the nicking of Stx2d at the first site (either by elastase or another protease) was required prior to enhancement of cytotoxicity by elastase. We were also unable to define the precise location at which the Stx2d A was clipped to the A1 and A2 peptides by elastase, which left open the possibility that this site is different from that of the trypsin cleavage site. That such a putative alternate nicking site might directly cause the activated phenotype of elastase-treated Stx2d seems unlikely for the following reasons. First, mouse crude small intestinal mucus nicks both the Stx2d and the Stx2 A subunits to the A1 and A2 peptides but only activates Stx2d (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), even though the amino acid sequence between the Cys residues (amino acids 241–260 of Stx2d, the probable elastase clipping region) are identical for Stx2d and Stx2. Second, the second nicking event that occurred in the A2 of activable Stx2d after elastase treatment (Figs. 6 and 7) that was not seen in similarly treated Stx2 (data not shown) correlated with activation (Figs. 6 and 7). Third, Stx2d was nicked (Fig. 5) to the A1 subunit and A2 peptide by concentrations of elastase that are too low to significantly enhance Stx2d cytotoxicity (Fig. 4 B). Fourth, although soybean trypsin inhibitor blocked enhancement of Stx2d cytotoxicity by both crude mucus and isolated elastase (Table II), this protease inhibitor did not inhibit nicking by elastase (Fig. 5). This latter observation suggests that the elastase may act at amino acids residues at two different locations in Stx2d: one at the putative nick site between the two Cys residues (2.Fraser M.E. Chernaia M.M. Kozlov Y.K. James M.N.G. Struct.

The amino acid residue at the nick site may be susceptible to elastase even in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor, whereas the amino acid residue at the activation site may not.In this study we showed that the cytotoxic activity of Stx2d is increased by various elastases of mouse and porcine origin. These proteolytic enzymes are found in the intestinal mucus content of many species including humans (21.Shotton, D. M. (1970) Methods Enzymol. 113–140Google Scholar, 22.Tani T. Ohsumi J. Mita K.

We have shown that strains of E. coli that express activable Stx2d are exquisitely virulent in a streptomycin-treated mouse oral challenge model (8.Lindgren S.W. Melton A.R. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3832-3842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we now hypothesize that in that model mouse pancreatic elastase can activate Stx2d in vivo and increase the virulence of the infecting strain (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Melton-Celsa, A. R., and O'Brien, A. D. (1998) in Bacterial Protein Toxins: Zent. Bl. Bakteriol.

Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and it may be possible to decrease the virulence of strains of STEC that express Stx2d through the use of orally administered elastatinal. The Shiga toxins (Stx)1expressed by Stx-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) andShigella dysenteriae are a family of potent cytotoxins that are comprised of a single A subunit associated with a pentamer of B subunits (see Ref. 1.Kaper J.B. O'Brien A.D. Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Other Shiga Toxin-Producing E. coli Strains. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998Google Scholar for a comprehensive review of STEC). The A subunit of Stx has N-glycosidase activity that cleaves an adenine residue from the 28 S ribosomal RNA within the 60S ribosome, an event that halts protein synthesis and leads to the death of the affected cell. The A subunit of Stx is susceptible to trypsin cleavage near its C terminus. Such cleavage results in the formation of an A1subunit of 28 kDa that has the N-glycosidase activity and an A2 peptide of 4 kDa that remains associated with A1 through a single disulfide bond. The A2 peptide links A1 to the B pentamer (2.Fraser M.E. Chernaia M.M. Kozlov Y.K. James M.N.G. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The B pentamer of most Stx family members binds preferentially to globotriaosylceramide on eukaryotic cells (3.Kongmuang U.T. Honda T. Miwatani T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 56: 105-108Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 4.Jacewicz M. Clausen H. Nudelman E. Donohue-Rolfe A. Keusch G.T. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We have previously reported (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Melton-Celsa, A. R., and O'Brien, A. D. (1998) in Bacterial Protein Toxins: Zent. Bl. Bakteriol. (Hacker, J., et al., eds) Suppl. 29, pp. 192–199, Gustav Fischer, Jena, GermanyGoogle Scholar) that when a variant of Stx2, called Stx2d (formerly named SLT-IIvh) is incubated with crude mucus isolated from the small intestine or colon of mice or the colon of humans, the cytotoxicity of the mucus-treated Stx2d increases 10–1000-fold for Vero cells. We call this enhancement of cytotoxicity “activation.” STEC strains that produce Stx2d are exquisitely virulent in a streptomycin-treated mouse oral challenge model (7.Wadolkowski E.A. Sung L.M. Burris J.A. Samuel J.E. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3959-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this mouse model, pathogenicity of STEC is due primarily to toxin production, as demonstrated by the finding that mice are protected by passive immunization with anti-Stx2 antibodies (7.Wadolkowski E.A. Sung L.M. Burris J.A. Samuel J.E. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3959-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The low LD50 of certain STEC strains correlates with the capacity of these strains to express the activable Stx2d (6.Melton-Celsa, A. R., and O'Brien, A. D. (1998) in Bacterial Protein Toxins: Zent. Bl. Bakteriol. (Hacker, J., et al., eds) Suppl. 29, pp. 192–199, Gustav Fischer, Jena, GermanyGoogle Scholar). For example, one virulent strain, B2F1, that has an oral LD50 of <10 colony forming units (8.Lindgren S.W. Melton A.R. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3832-3842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), produces two activable toxins named Stx2d1 (formerly SLT-IIvha) and Stx2d2 (formerly SLT-IIvhb) (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to distinguish them from one another. By contrast, STEC O157:H− strain E32511/HSC that replicates as well as B2F1 in mouse small intestinal mucus but produces nonactivable Stx2c has an oral LD50 of 1010colony forming units (8.Lindgren S.W. Melton A.R. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3832-3842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparison of the activable Stx2d and nonactivable Stx2c reveal very few sequence differences (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the B subunit of Stx2d2 and Stx2c are identical, an observation that suggests that the key to the activable phenotype lies within the A subunit. There are only two amino acid differences between the A subunits of Stx2d2 and Stx2c, and both of these amino acids are located in the A2peptide (9.Ito H. Terai A. Kurazono H. Takeda Y. Nishibuchi M. Microb. Pathog. 1990; 8: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), a fact suggesting that the effect crude intestinal mucus has on Stx2d involves the A2 peptide. The general nature of the alterations to Stx2d that occur after incubation with mucus were examined in a previous report (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that there is no apparent modification to the A1 subunit of activated Stx2d based on electrophoretic mobility; changes to the A2 subunit could not be discerned at the time of the initial report (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because the polyclonal serum used in the Western immunoblot analysis did not detect the A2peptide. We also showed that isolated intestinal mucus nicks the A subunit of Stx2d and Stx2 to A1 and A2 in a manner similar to trypsin treatment, but only mucus and not trypsin activates Stx2d. In support of this, we found that trypsin-nicked Stx2d that is not activated can subsequently be activated by isolated mucus (5.Melton-Celsa A.R. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From these data we concluded that nicking of the Stx2d A subunit to the A1 and A2 peptides is not equivalent to activation. In this study, we sought to isolate and identify the factor(s) from mouse crude small intestinal mucus that activates Stx2d and to further address the effect of this activating factor on Stx2d. DISCUSSIONWe have identified an Stx2d-cytotoxicity enhancing factor from mouse crude small intestinal mucus as an elastase. Although elastases have not previously been associated with activation or enhancement of toxic activity of bacterial toxins, a number of such toxins are expressed as inactive protoxins that require activation by proteolytic digestion to become toxic. This type of activation can occur either extracellularly (e.g. Clostridium septicum α toxin (26.Ballard J. Sokolov Y. Yuan W.-L. Kagan B.L. Tweten R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) or intracellularly (e.g. Pseudomonasexotoxin (27.Ogata M. Fryling C.M. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25396-25401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anthrax toxin protective antigen (28.Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Henderson M.A. Leppla S.H. Infect.

A second kind of toxin activation is more unusual and involves enhancement of toxicity of an already active toxin by exogenous proteases (e.g. Clostri"

Proteins that assemble on DNA in order to initiate replication and transcription must overcome two major obstacles. First, the size and sequence complexity of the genomes of higher organisms presents a significant challenge to correct start site selection by initiators, as nonspecific sites are in vast excess over specific sites. Recognition by the initiators of replication and transcription has been studied extensively. In many cases, these have limited sequence specificity, and targeting is achieved through cooperative binding mechanisms. The second obstacle arises from the double-stranded nature of DNA. In order to allow copying of the DNA, it must first undergo local denaturation or melting to allow access of enzymes and accessory factors. Subsequently, the DNA must then be unwound processively by a helicase as the DNA or RNA polymerase leaves the entry point (1.Kodadek T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 79-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The protein factors involved in targeting, DNA melting, and processive unwinding may be distinct and form part of a multiprotein complex. Alternatively, a single protein may possess more than one of these activities. DNA melting and unwinding reactions are poorly understood. In this respect, the initiators of DNA replication in eucaryotic DNA tumor viruses are an important class of protein. These have all the activities required for initiation, including origin recognition and melting, and also act as DNA helicases (2.Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Bullock P.A. Hurwitz J. Cell. 1990; 60: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 3.Parson R. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Seo Y.-S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5086-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). They also provide a fascinating example of how a single protein can undergo a transition in activities that, paradoxically, appear to be incompatible. For example, site-specific DNA binding and helical motor activity could be considered to be mutually exclusive properties. The initiator protein E1 of the bovine papillomavirus BPV-11 is also unique in another respect. The ability of E1 to initiate replicationin vivo is absolutely dependent on the viral transcription factor E2, which appears to act as a loading factor for the viral helicase (6.Lusky M. Hurwitz J. Seo Y.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8895-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7.Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). E1 and E2 are the only viral proteins required for initiation of BPV-1 replication in vivo, and binding sites for both, as well as an A/T-rich region, are found in the replicator. Although absolutely required, there is flexibility in terms of the positioning of the E2 site relative to the E1-binding site. In general, as the spacing between the two sites is increased, higher affinity or multiple E2-binding sites are required (8.Ustav M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 9.Ustav E. Ustav M. Szymanski P. Stenlund A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have extensively characterized a replicator with proximal E1- and E2-binding sites (E2 BS12) separated by 3 base pairs (7.Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10.Sedman J. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6218-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11.Sedman J. Stenlund A.

Virol. 1998; 72: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On this origin, E2 stimulates formation of an E1-ori complex active for ori melting in at least two steps. First, a highly sequence-specific E1E2-oricomplex forms, and then additional E1 molecules are recruited and E2 is displaced. The second step is ATP-dependent, resulting in deposition of a complex with low sequence specificity at a specific site (7.Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained by others (6.Lusky M. Hurwitz J. Seo Y.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8895-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the viral genome, a second E2-binding site distal to the E1-binding site (BS11) may have a role in formation of an active replication complex (14.Gillette T.G. Lusky M. Borowiec J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15.Gillette T.G. Borowiec J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5735-5744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activity has also been observed for the cellular transcription factor AP-1, which interacts directly with polyomavirus large T, stimulates its binding to ori, and activates replication (16.Ito K. Asano M. Hughes P. Kohzaki H. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kerppola T. Curran T. Murakami Y. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5636-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we have extended our studies on the role of E2 in BPV-1 initiator complex assembly. The origin melting complex, in which the DNA is denatured immediately upstream and downstream of the E1-binding site, forms through a number of intermediates. In the first E1 complex that forms on the origin, six E1 molecules contact the DNA, the DNA lies on a protein surface, and the protein wraps extensively around the DNA. This complex is the immediate product of the E2 loading cycle from proximal E2 BS12 and forms the core or nucleus of the higher order origin melting complex. E2 bound to distal binding sites can recruit additional E1 molecules to this precursor complex, preferentially melting the origin DNA nearest the E2 site. Thus, the origin melting complex is composed of two functional subunits that form through a common precursor. The results are discussed in terms of other known proteins that melt and unwind DNA. Production of E1 and E2 and the anti-E2 antibody have been described previously (7.Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12.Sedman T. Sedman J. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2887-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Origin templates were based on a 110-base pair BPV-1 sequence (nucleotides 7894 to 57, centered about the E1-binding site) cloned between theXbaI and HindIII sites of pUC19. This sequence encompasses the two native BPV-1 E2-binding sites BS11, 33 bp upstream of the E1-binding site, and BS12 immediately downstream (3-bp separation) of the E1 site. The A/T-rich region (A/T) is between BS11 and the E1-binding site. In some constructs, an E2-binding site was placed 33 bp downstream of the E1-binding site, a symmetrical transposition of upstream BS11. The sequence of the E2 sites in various constructs was changed to alter the affinity of the E2 protein. The nomenclature used is based on the prototype wild type template 11/12/X, where 11 indicates upstream BS11, 12 is the site immediately adjacent to the E1-binding site, and X indicates no site engineered at the distal downstream position. Substitutions of upstream BS11 were AACCATCACCGTTTT (BS12) orCCAGAACACTGG to mutate BS11 (site X). The sequence GTCATACCCACT was substituted for BS12 at the native position to mutate this site. For constructs with E2 sites downstream, the 12-bp BPV sequence from nucleotides 46 to 57 was substituted forACCGAAACCGGT (BS11),AACCTAAACGGT (BS16), orGTCATCCACACT (mutant site X). In construct 12/X/16, 13 base pairs of the pUC19 polylinker were deleted by cleavage with EcoRI and BamHI and religation after Klenow treatment. For some hydroxyl radical footprinting (Fig. 6), the E2 site of E2 BS12 was modified toACCATGGCCGTT, generating aHaeIII restriction site. For hydroxyl radical footprinting of E2 bound to BS9, the template comprised BPV nucleotides 7894 to 27 with E2 BS12 substituted for ACCGTTGCCGGT(BS9). The affinity of E2 for the various binding sites in the BPV-1 genome has been described in detail (17.Li R. Knight J. Bream G. Stenlund A. Botchan M.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 3: 510-526Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). BS9 is a high affinity site, with a relative affinity approximately 5-fold greater than BS11, 10-fold greater than BS16, and 50-fold greater than BS12.Figure 6Hydroxyl radical footprinting of origin complexes. A, footprinting origin complexes immobilized on streptavidin beads. Note, free probe is released from the beads by cleavage at the MseI site, which is otherwise protected in protein-DNA complexes. Where E2 stimulates E1-ori formation, the E1E2-ori complex is selectively dissociated with EtBr.B, solution footprints of E2. High affinity E2 site BS9 was used since low affinity E2 BS12 proved difficult to footprint.Lanes 1–5, bottom strand; lanes 6–10, top strand. Lanes 1 and 10are G ladders. Lanes 2 and 3 and 6 and7 show the DNase I footprint of an E2 dimer bound to DNA (800 nm E2). Within each DNase I footprint (hatched boxes) there are 3 sets of hydroxyl radical protections,I–III, black boxes. C, hydroxyl radical footprints of E1E2-ori and E1-origin complexes immobilized on streptavidin- agarose. E1E2-ori (lanes 3, 4, 14, 15, and20), 3 nm E1 and 3.5 nm E2; E1-ori (lanes 5, 16, and 24), 7.5 nm E1 and 0.75 nm E2; *E1*-ori(lanes 6, 11, and 17), 60 nm E1. The probe used was X/12/X except lanes 8–11 where probe 11/X/X was used, and lanes 20 and 21 which show the E1E2-ori complex formed on a probe with high affinity E2 BS9. The footprints of E1E2-ori were similar regardless of the presence of ATP/Mg2+ (compare lanes 3 and4 and 14 and 15) or the E2-binding site sequence (lane 21, E2 BS9). Periodic sets of protections were observed for E1E2-ori and E1-ori; stronger protections are shown as black boxes and weaker protections as hatched boxes(right). A single very weak set of protections (0) is also observed on the bottom strand only, downstream of the E2 site and protection 1 in E1E2-ori and E1-ori. It is sequence-independent and appears to be unrelated to the other periodic protections. *E1*-ori gave rise to a large block protection with weaker protections tapering at the flanks (lanes 6, 11, and 17). In lanes 8–11 the probe was 11/12/X. Lane 8 is free probe.Lane 9 shows a weak E2 footprint on BS11 (1250 nm E2). In lane 10, E1 complex formation was stimulated by E2 (7.5 nm E1 and 0.75 nm E2). The region adjacent to the E2-binding site is completely protected, but the protections downstream of the E1-binding site resemble those of E1-ori (lane 5). The strong band in the center of the E1-binding site in lanes 3–5 corresponds to the restriction enzyme (MseI) cleavage product. To obtain details in this region, complexes were also formed and footprinted on a probe with a HaeIII restriction site in the nonconserved core sequence of the E2 BS12-binding site. Results for this probe are shown for the bottom strand (lanes 12–18) and are compared with the regular probe, lanes 23 and 24. D, location of hydroxyl radical protections. The size of eachcircle (E2 protections) or square (E1 protection) is an estimate of the degree of protection determined from analysis of several autoradiographs. The E2 footprint is clearly recognizable in the E1E2-ori complex. The protections in E1-orican be interpreted as the binding of six molecules of E1 to the DNA. In *E1*-ori, more than 70 bases are protected on each strand, with weaker protections at the flanks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction using one 32P-end-labeled primer from the pUC19 polylinker (upstream 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT and downstream 5′-GGATAACAATTTCACACAGG). For biotinylated probes, one primer was labeled at the 5′ end with biotin. Binding buffer was 20 mmNaPO4 (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 125 pg/μl poly(dA-dT)n, and 5 mm ATP/MgCl2(unless otherwise stated). The probe concentration was 0.025 to 0.1 nm as indicated, and reactions were incubated for 50 min at 20–22 °C. Complexes were cross-linked with 0.08% glutaraldehyde, and the reaction was quenched with Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) added to 80 mm after 5 min. When complexes were analyzed in the presence of EtBr it was added to 25 μg/ml for cross-linked complexes and 4 μg/ml without cross-linking. The short competitor oligonucleotides were BS9 5′-ACAAGTACCGTTGCCGGTCGGGGTC and the corresponding mutant 5′-ACAAGTCACGTTGCCGTGCGGGGTC. The sequence of BS10 was 5′-CTTAAACCGTCTTCGGTGCAAACCGTCTTCGGTGCGGT, and the mutant, 5′-CTTAAGGCGTCTTCACTGCAAGGCGTCTTCACTGCGGT. After electrophoresis, binding reactions were quantified using phosphorimaging technology (Fuji Bas 1000). Each probe was at 0.025 nm. If the concentration of Mg2+ (or other divalent ions) is increased during KMnO4modification, the extent of modification at high E1 concentrations increases such that 80% or more of the input template can be modified at at least one position. 2C.

For maximum reactivity (as in Fig. 5), reactions (200–400 μl) were treated with an equal volume of 55 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 12 mmKMnO4 for 2 min before quenching. KMnO4 was added to the solution immediately before use. Otherwise, the concentration of MgCl2 in the 2× solution was 25 mm. Reactions were processed as described previously, and products were analyzed on 8% urea-acrylamide gels (7.Sanders C.M. Stenlund A.

When biotinylated probes were used, digestion was terminated with 20 mm EDTA, and the products of nuclease cleavage were selectively recovered by binding to streptavidin-agarose (Sigma; 20 μl for 1.5 ml of solution) for 1 h. Beads were washed 4 times (∼5 min) with 1 ml of wash buffer (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS). DNA was eluted by heating to 97 °C in 100% formamide (2 × 75 μl) for 10 min, mixed with an equal volume of 600 mmNH4Ac, 0.05% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated with ethanol. Scission products were analyzed as above. The general guidelines of Dixon et al. (18.Dixon W.J. Hayes J.J. Levin J.R. Weidner M.F. Dombroski B.A. Tullius T.D.

The hydroxyl radical was generated by addition of 1 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.075% (w/v) H2O2, 4 mm[(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O], 8 mm EDTA for 2 min. Reactions were quenched with 0.5 volume of 200 mm thiourea, 25% v/v glycerol, 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 0.15 μg/μl carrier DNA. Cleavage products were recovered and analyzed as described above. For footprinting of complexes immobilized on streptavidin-agarose, biotinylated probe was bound to beads (0.5- or 1-ml reactions, 10- or 20-μl beads) for 40 min after complex formation. Beads were recovered by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed to leave 100 μl of the binding reaction. 5 μl of 100 mm MgCl2and 100–200 units of restriction enzyme (MseI orHaeIII) were added, and the DNA was digested for 8 min at room temperature. For footprinting all complexes other than E1E2-ori, EtBr was added to 4 μg/ml halfway through the incubation with enzyme. After digestion, beads were recovered, washed rapidly in binding buffer without glycerol (twice), and resuspended in binding buffer (0.4× the original reaction volume). The hydroxyl radical cleavage reaction was performed as above. Beads were washed four times in 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 25% glycerol, and the DNA eluted from the beads into 100% formamide as described above. At low E1 concentration in the presence of E2, an E1E2-ori complex forms with high sequence specificity and affinity and is a precursor for formation of a multimeric E1-ori complex. As a targeting and assembly factor, E2 lowers the concentration of E1 required for E1-ori formationin vitro. However, the in vitro origin melting activity of the E1-ori complex that formed from E1E2-ori was low, compared with an E1-origin complex formed at higher E1 concentrations without E2 (7.Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have further examined E1-ori complex formation and activity, including the action of a second E2 site, E2 BS11, found 33 bases upstream of the E1-binding site in the viral DNA. We investigated E1-ori complex formation in vitro, with and without E2, on origins with both proximal E2 BS12 and distal BS11. Complexes formed in the presence of ATP/Mg2+ were analyzed by gel shift assay after glutaraldehyde cross-linking (Fig.1 A). The binding site configuration of each probe is shown next to each autoradiograph, as in all subsequent figures. Here, the E1-binding site is represented by thearrows. For the origin with both E2 sites, ori11/12/X (see the note on probe nomenclature under “Viral Proteins and Origin Templates” under “Materials and Methods”), E2 stimulated E1-ori complex formation at low E1 concentration (Fig.1 A, lane 3 compared with lanes 4–7). The resulting complex co-migrates with the E1-ori complex formed at high E1 concentration (lane 2), and binding of E2 alone could not be detected (lane 8). An E2-binding site oligonucleotide (BS9), but not a mutant sequence (MUT), inhibited complex formation (lanes 9 and10), demonstrating the need for E2 binding. The template lacking BS11 (X/12/X) behaved similarly, but at the same E1 concentration complex formation was reduced (panel immediately below). Most of the products of reaction 7 (lane 7) with probe 11/12/X could be supershifted with anti-E2 antibody (lane 13, top panel). In contrast, E2 is displaced from E1-ori during loading from proximal E2 BS12 (lane 13, panel immediately below). In lanes 16–18 the products of reaction 7 were challenged with either E2 BS9 oligo, mutant E2 oligo competitor or buffer, and incubated for a further 30 min before cross-linking. Addition of anti-E2 antibody revealed that E2 is free to dissociate from the complex that forms onori 11/12/X, whereas E1-ori per se is stable (lane 16). Almost identical result were obtained on the origin with only distal E2 BS11 (ori 11/X/X), indicating minimal cooperation between the two E2-binding sites (3rd panel fromtop). All E2 sites tested functioned from the distal position, including low affinity E2 BS12 (12/X/X, bottom panel). This analysis also revealed that E2 dissociates from E1-ori at a rate proportional to the affinity of the E2-binding site (compare lanes 16–18, bottom two panels and data not shown), indicating that E2 DNA binding is a component of the interactions that stabilize its association with E1-ori. All origins replicated in vivo (not shown). Thus, E2 stimulates E1-ori formation in vitro from proximal or distal E2 sites, but active displacement of E2 occurs only from proximal BS12. We have termed origins with an E2-binding site proximal to the E1-binding site (as BS12) type I origins and any with a distal site type II origins. In E1-ori, E1 molecules encircle the DNA, but in E1E2-ori the proteins are bound to one face of the DNA helix (11.Sedman J. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5085-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cross-linked E1-ori complex, but not the E1E2-ori complex, is stable in the presence of the intercalator ethidium bromide (EtBr, 25 μg/ml), which disrupts protein-DNA but not protein-protein interactions. We suggested that in the E1-ori complex the DNA is inaccessible to EtBr compared with E1E2-ori. (7.Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have now observed the same sensitivity of the complexes to EtBr, regardless of prior glutaraldehyde cross-linking. In Fig. 1 B, binding reactions with probe X/12/X were assembled (with ATP/Mg2+) to generate the E1E2-ori complex (lane 5), the E1-oricomplex at low and high E1 concentrations independently of E2 (lanes 3 and 6 respectively), and at low E1 concentration in the presence of E2 (lane 4). When treated with EtBr before cross-linking (lanes 7–12), the E1-ori complex was largely insensitive to the intercalator (lanes 9, 10, and 12), but the E1E2-ori complex dissociated completely (lane 11), even though the time elapsed before cross-linking (5 min) was less than the half-life of the E1E2-ori complex (∼35 min). The expected result was observed when complexes were treated with EtBr after cross-linking (lanes 13–18). Addition of EtBr before the proteins abolished most complex formation at all but the highest concentration of E1 (lane 24). Therefore, accessibility of DNA-binding sites appears to be a good explanation to account for the relative sensitivities of the origin complexes to EtBr. The probes analyzed for E1 binding in Fig. 1 Awere also tested for DNA melting over a range of E1 concentrations, with or without E2. A sample of each reaction was treated with KMnO4 which reacts with T residues in single-stranded or distorted DNA (19.Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 147-169Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig.2, for ori 11/12/X (left) and X/12/X (right). A measure of relativeori melting (Rel.Dist.) was obtained by comparing the extent of KMnO4 reactive products in each reaction to those generated at the highest concentration of E1 where practically all the probe was bound, and melting was maximal (reactions 2 and 16,lanes 2 and 16). Gel shift analysis was used to determine site occupancy (Bound %). Gel shift and DNase I footprinting give identical results for site occupancy over the full range of E1 concentrations and binding extents (data not shown). Thus, each assay is likely to give an accurate measure of this parameter. Without E2 the extent of E1-ori complex formation andori melting activity are the same for all the probes (compare % bound and Rel.Dist. for reactions 2–4, probe 11/12/X (lanes 2–4), with the corresponding reactions in lanes 16–18, probe X/12/X, Fig. 2). In addition, the ori melting activity of the E1-oricomplex that forms independently of E2 at low E1 concentrations is low. For example, compare % bound and Rel.Dist. in reactions lane 10 (probe 11/12/X) and lane 24(probe X/12/X); 14 and 12% of the probe was bound in each case, but ori melting was practically undetectable. Finally, E2 stimulates formation of an E1-ori complex on both probes, but E2 from distal E2 BS11 is more efficient in stimulatingori melting. For example, in reaction 11, where E2 stimulated E1-ori formation on probe 11/12/X, 95% of the probe was bound, and melting was 82% relative to the reference. At the same E1 concentration in reaction 25, where E1 was loaded from E2 BS12, 49% of the probe was bound, but only 4% of templates were melted, relative to the reference. This translates into a significant difference in specific activity, greater than 10-fold. E2 at a distal site fails to generate a complex with high ori melting activity on type II origins only when E1 can be considered to be limiting, compare lanes 2 and 13. Complex formation is similar in each case but, where E2 stimulated E1-ori formation at very low E1 concentration (reaction 13)ori melting (Rel.Dist.) is lower. Therefore, formation of a melting complex is proportional to the E1 concentration, and two types of E1-ori complex can form. A complex with low or no melting activity forms at low E1 concentration and is also the immediate product of the E2 loading cycle from proximal E2 BS12 (type I ori). A complex with high orimelting activity forms at high E1 concentration or at low E1 concentration in the presence of E2 on origins with a distal E2-binding site (type II ori). A distribution of differently sized E1 complexes with different numbers of E1 molecules could account for these observations. Only when the protein concentration is high, and the vast majority of the probe is bound, are all the E1 molecules required for melting activity bound in the E1-ori complex. The notion that a minimal core E1-ori complex (inactive forori melting) appears at low E1 concentration is supported by our observations that glutaraldehyde cross-linking may stabilize only a subset of E1 molecules bound to ori and that different DNase I footprints are generated at high and low E1 concentrations (7.Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).2 These ideas are summarized in the model shown in Fig.3. Close examination of Fig. 2revealed that on type II origins in the presence of E2, KMnO4 reactivity is biased toward the region adjacent to the E2-binding site. For example, the scission products in the A/T-rich region and at residue 20 in reactions with E1 only (lanes 2-4, 6, and 8 and so on) decrease proportionally as protein concentration and complex formation decrease. This is also seen on ori X/12/X, regardless of whether complex formation is stimulated by E2 (lanes 16–27). However, when E2 stimulated complex formation at low E1 concentrations on probe 11/12/X (lane 13), residue 20 is less reactive than those in the A/T-rich region compared with reaction 2 (lane 2), where the extent of complex formation was similar. This was investigated further by comparing an origin with E2 BS11 symmetrically transposed to a position downstream of the E1-binding site (ori X/X/11) with ori 11/X/X. Binding reactions were assembled and analyzed as in Fig. 2. Fig. 4, lanes 2–6, and8, 10, 12, and 14 (left) and18–22, and 24, 26, 28, and 30 (right) show KMnO4 reactivity (bottom strand labeled) with decreasing E1 for origins 11/X/X and X/X/11, respectively. As above, KMnO4 reactivity on either side of the E1-binding site decreases proportionally with complex formation (Bound %) on both probes. In contrast, where E2 stimulates E1-oriformation at low E1 concentrations (lanes 7, 9, 11, 13, and15, probe 11/X/X left, and 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, probe X/X/11 right), ori melting is asymmetric, preferentially occurring adjacent to the E2 site. For example, in reaction 9 (lane 9), where E1-ori was formed with E2, the A/T-rich region is hyper-reactive and the downstream region (around residue 19) hyporeactive, compared with lane 3 where the E1-ori complex was formed at high E1 concentration. Importantly, when the E2-binding site is moved downstream of the E1-binding site (ori X/X/11), the region downstream of the E1-binding site is now preferentially reactive. Comparelanes 19 and 23 where the fraction of probe bound was similar. KMnO4 reactivity is barely detectable over the A/T-rich region in the products generated by E2 (lane 23), but similar reactivity is observed in the region adjacent to the E2-binding site. These results imply that"

Both basal and cAMP-mediated regulation of CFTR transcription involved a consensus inverted CCAAT (Y-box) element (15.Pittman N. Shue G. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28848-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in tandem with a weak CRE nucleotide consensus downstream (16.Matthews R.P. McKnight G.S. J. Biol.

However, no sequences that might account for tissue specificity have yet been found, and regulatory elements conferring tissue-specific and temporal regulation are thought to lie mainly outside the promoter region. Analyses of the CFTR gene chromatin structure have identified in all cell types a number of DNase I-hypersensitive sites at −20.5 kb and −79.5 kb relative to the translational start codon (17.Smith A.N. Wardle C.J. Harris A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An additional cis-acting element has been characterized by DNase I analyses in the first intron of the humanCFTR gene at 181+10 kb (18.Smith A.N. Barth M.L. McDowell T.L. Moulin D.S. Nuthall H.N. Hollingsworth M.A. Harris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9947-9954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In vitro analysis by electrophoresis mobility shift, DNase I footprinting, and transient expression assays showed that this putative regulatory element in the first intron has a positive effect on the activity of theCFTR promoter in cells that express endogenous CFTR. A recent study demonstrated that transcription factor ATF-1 and human histone acetyltransferase GCN5, directing the structural modification of chromatin, stimulated CFTR transcription through the intact inverted CCAAT (Y-box) element (19.Li S. Moy L. Pittman N. Shue G. Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7803-7815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, the authors showed that inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by trichostatin A potentiated CFTR transcription through the Y-box element. It was suggested that activities competing for the association with the Y-box element regulate the level of histone acetylation in chromatin surrounding the transcription start sites, leading to either activation or repression of gene transcription. However, although significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that underlie the strict cellular control of CFTR expression, the genetic elements and transcription factors that regulate it, including those controlling tissue specificity, are not yet well defined. Another means of obtaining insights into the mechanisms governing the expression of the CFTR gene is to identify naturally occurring disease-causing mutations or sequence variations affectingCFTR regulation. So far, only three laboratories have screened the 5′-upstream region of the CFTR gene in affected patients for sequence alterations, mostly by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis/sequencing assays. Bienvenu et al. (20.Bienvenu T. Lacronique V. Raymondjean M. Cazeneuve C. Hubert D. Kaplan J.C. Beldjord C. Hum. Genet. 1995; 95: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have investigated a segment extending from nucleotides −531 to −1000 relative to the Cap site and identified two polymorphisms (−895T>G and −816C>T) and one putative disease-associated mutation (−741T>G). More recently, Verlingue et al. (21.Verlingue C. Vuillaumier S. Mercier B. Le Gac M. Elion J. Ferec C. Denamur E. J. Med.

Lecointre G. Lehn P. Denamur E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1997; 14: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Their analysis resulted in the detection of one polymorphism only (−966T>G). We have identified a novel complex allele (102(T>A)+S549R(T>G)) containing a previously described CF-causing mutation (S549R(T>G)) in exon 11 and a sequence alteration in the minimal CFTR promoter region (−102T>A) (24.Romey M.-C. Guittard C. Carles S. Ramsay M. Demaille J. Claustres M. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 36: 263-264PubMed Google Scholar). S549R(T>G) was initially considered as a “severe” mutation on the basis of clinical features presented by patients who carry it, particularly pancreatic insufficiency. We discovered recently, through a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis, that this mutation, when occurring in cis with the sequence change (−102T>A), is associated with milder forms of CF than (S549R(T>G)) alone (25.Romey M.-C. Guittard C. Chazalette J.-P. Frossard P. Dawson K.P. Patton M.A. Casals T. Bazarbachi T. Girodon E. Rault G. Bozon D. Seguret F. Demaille J. Claustres M. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that the (−102T>A) naturally occurring nucleotide variation may, at least partially, compensate for the severity of the (S549R(T>G)) mutation by CFTR overexpression. The objective of this study was to determine further whether the (−102T>A) sequence alteration is a relevant regulatory mutation. We have investigated its effects on transcription using reporter gene assays and conducted analysis of cis-acting elements byin vitro DNA-protein interactions. In this report, we demonstrate that this first naturally occurring sequence variation in the minimal CFTR promoter creates a YY1 transcription factor binding site and has a substantial impact on the basal rate of transcription of the CFTR gene in vitro. A 362-base pair fragment spanning the minimal CFTR promoter region and extending from positions −227 to +135 relative to the major transcription initiation site (11.Chou J.L. Rozmahel R. Tsui L.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24471-24476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of an individual with CF previously found to be heterozygous for the T>A sequence variation at −102 (24.Romey M.-C. Guittard C. Carles S. Ramsay M. Demaille J. Claustres M. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 36: 263-264PubMed Google Scholar). Primers designed to amplify and clone the minimal CFTR promoter sequence were flanked at the 5′-ends either by a synthetic XhoI or NcoI restriction site (underlined): Luc1 5′-GGCTCGAGGCTGGGAGTCGG-3′ and Luc2 5′-TTCCATGGTCTCTCGGGCGCTGGGGT-3′. Briefly, DNA amplification was performed by using a Gene-Amp AmpliTaq polymerase chain reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer) in a total volume of 100 μl containing 500 ng of total genomic DNA, a 200 pmconcentration of each primer, and a 0.2 mm concentration of each dNTP. The polymerase chain reaction products were restricted withXhoI and NcoI endonucleases and then ligated into a pGL3-Basic vector (Promega Corp.). This vector contains a modified firefly luciferase coding sequence upstream of the SV40 late poly(A) signal and no eukaryotic promoter or enhancer sequences. The integrity and accuracy of the wild-type (102T-pGL3 or WT-pGL3) or mutated (102A-pGL3) constructs were checked by direct DNA sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 377 automated sequencer. Cervix carcinoma (HeLa) cells were kindly provided by Professor Boulanger, Laboratoire de Virologie, Montpellier, France. Ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma (CF-PAC1) cells harboring the ΔF508 mutation within the CFTR gene were purchased from European Collection of Cell Cultures. Lung adenocarcinoma (Calu-3) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. CF-PAC1 and Calu-3 cell lines were selected because they express endogenous CFTR. Cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Eurobio), penicillin G sodium (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 units/ml), and amphotericin B as Fungizone (25 μg/ml) in 0.85% saline (Antibiotic-Antimycotic, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell cultures were maintained in 6.5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Plasmids used for transfection were purified using AX100 cartridges of Nucleobond AX system (Macherey-Nagel). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/35-mm (diameter) culture dish 24 h prior to transient transfections. When cells reached 50–70% confluence, they were cotransfected with 1.8 μg of plasmid reporter and 0.2 μg of internal control pRL-SV40 containing Renillaluciferase (Promega Corp.) driven by an SV40 promoter to normalize transfection efficiency. The pGL3-Basic vector lacking both eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences was used as a negative control. The WT-pGL3 and 102A-pGL3 constructs were transfected into HeLa cells using Transfectam (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The reagent FuGENETM6 (Roche Diagnosis) was used to transfect Calu-3 and CF-PAC1 cells because we found that transfection efficiency in these cells was lower with Transfectam. Cells were grown for an additional 48 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 200 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp.), and centrifuged briefly to remove cell debris. 20 μl of cleared lysate was assayed sequentially for firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Luminescence measurements were performed on a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (EG & G Berthold, Wilbad, Germany) with a 2-s premeasurement delay and a 10-s measurement period. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renillaluciferase activity. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and each set of transfections was repeated at least twice with independently purified plasmid DNA preparations. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons were made with analysis of variance, followed by the Welch's alternate t test, a modification of the unpaired t test. A value ofp < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistics were performed using the Instat Program (Graph Pad Software). Crude nuclear extracts from HeLa, Calu-3, and CF-PAC1 cell lines were prepared as described previously (26.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, actively growing cells were collected by scraping in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation, and washed once in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The cell pellet was homogenized in Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40 in the same buffer above) with approximately 100 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a B-type pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman F2402 rotor (4 °C) and the nuclear fraction extracted with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA with freshly added protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C (GS-15 centrifuge, Beckman) before overnight dialysis at 4 °C against 100 volumes buffer containing 20% glycerol and 0.14m NaCl by using DispoDialyzer systems, Spectra/Por quality (Spectrum). The nuclear extracts were flash frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides for radiolabeled probes and competitor DNAs were synthesized on an Oligo 1000 DNA synthesizer (Beckman). The sequences of the sense strand of each of the probes used in this study are shown in TableI. Appropriate sense and antisense strand pairs were annealed by heating at 85 °C for 2 min in 40 μl of annealing buffer (67 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 13 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm EDTA, 1.3 mm spermidine, and 6.7 mm dithiothreitol) and cooling in two steps at 65 °C for 15 min then 37 °C for 1 h. Double-stranded oligomeric probes were 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Diagnostic) according to the manufacturer's instructions and separated from free nucleotides by QIAquick Nucleotide Removal kit (Qiagen). To reduce nonspecific protein binding in the assay, 10 μg of nuclear proteins were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 25 μl of buffer containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 8), 60 mm KCl, 60 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.125 mm EDTA, 5 mm spermidine, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. The labeled probes (20,000 cpm, about 0.2 ng) were then added, and the incubation was continued for 15 min at room temperature. Protein-bound probe and free probe were separated by electrophoresis through a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (1 × TBE is 89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 1 h at 25 mA; the gel was then dried and autoradiographed with an intensifying screen. The specificities of protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by competition experiments, in which different molar excesses of homologous or nonhomologous unlabeled competitor DNA were used. Consensus Sp1 double-stranded oligonucleotide (Promega Corp.) was included as nonspecific DNA probe.Table IOligonucleotides used in EMSA analysisOligonucleotideSequence (5′ to 3′; sense strand)WTaThis is the human minimal CFTR promoter region, sequence from −121 to −83 relative to A of the translation codon at +1 (11).−121GAA AGC CGC TAG AGC AAA TTT GGG GCC GGA CCA GGC AGC−83102A−121GAA AGC CGC TAG AGC AAA TaT GGG GCC GGA CCA GGC AGC−83CArGbConsensus CArG box, CC(A/T-rich)6GG.−121GAA AGC CGC TAG A c C AAA TTT GGG GCC GGA CCA GGC−86iCCAATcConsensus inverted CCAAT box with consensus flanking sequences.−121GAA AGC CGC TAG AG t A cg aTT GG t ta C GGA CCA GGC−86YY1sadConsensus YY1, which matches well with the skeletal α-actin muscle regulatory element (28).−121GAA AGC CGC TAG AGC AAA TAT GG c GCC GGA CCA GGC AGC−83mYY1eMutated YY1 box.−121GAA AGC CGC TAG AGC tta cta ccc GCC GGA CCA GGC AGC−83c-fos fc-fos consensus SRE (28).AGG ATG TCC ATA TTA GGA CAT CTGBold and italicized lowercase type indicates mutated sequence.

The proteins that bind the same probe from different cell lines were compared by limited proteolytic cleavage using a modified proteolytic clipping band shift assay (27.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, a predetermined amount of a specific protease (trypsin) was added to the relevant binding reaction tube and the same amount of water to the no-protease control tube. The binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for a further 10 min. To identify nuclear factors that bind to DNA probes, 1 μg of specific antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-YY1, sc-281; mouse polyclonal anti-YY1, sc-7341; or rabbit polyclonal anti-SRF, sc-335; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with nuclear extracts 20 min prior toin vitro DNA binding. Rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IgG2b (kindly provided by Dr. Devaux, Laboratoire Infections rétrovirales et signalisation cellulaire, Montpellier, France) was included as a negative control. To explore specifically the effects of the −102T>A sequence variation on CFTR expression, we generated two luciferase reporter constructs driven by the minimal CFTR promoter, which differed only by the presence of either a thymine or an adenine at the −102 position (Fig.1 left panel). Multiple plasmid preparations were made from each reporter construct and transiently transfected into the Calu-3 and CF-PAC1 cells, which express endogenous CFTR, and into HeLa cells, which do not express endogenous CFTR. All experiments included parallel transfections of a promoterless negative control (pGL3-Basic). The relative luciferase activity of the mutant construct (102A-pGL3) was increased by ∼60% (p < 0.005), ∼66% (p = 0.0033), or ∼45% (p = 0.0001) in Calu-3, CF-PAC1, or HeLa cells, respectively, compared with the activity of the wild-type construct (Fig. 1, right panel). These results suggest that the −102 nucleotide change occurred in an activator element. To determine which nuclear proteins are bound to the DNA sequence at the −102 site, we performedin vitro gel band shift experiments. Interestingly, a previous sequence comparison with known transcription factor binding sites indicated that this promoter substitution occurred in a region highly conserved throughout many species. 2S. Vuillaumier and E. Denamur, personal communication. As shown in Fig. 2 A, this region contains two overlapping binding sites: a CArG-like motif, similar to the consensus CC(A/T-rich)6GG (CarG element) and an inverted CCAAT-like motif. Remarkably, the sequence alteration (−102T>A) creates a core element for the multifunctional transcription factor YY1 in reverse orientation. Various oligonucleotides harboring one of the cis-acting consensus elements (Table I) were assayed for binding activity with nuclear extracts from Calu-3, CF-PAC1, and HeLa cells. Nucleoprotein complexes with identical electrophoretic mobility were detected with WT and CArG probes in all cell types examined (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3, 4, 8, 9, 13, and14). As shown in Fig. 2 B (lanes 5,10, and 15), the complex formed with the inverted CCAAT probe resulted in a pattern slightly different from those observed with the WT and CArG probes in all cell lines. These results suggest that the minimal CFTR promoter encompassing the −102 site might interact with a SRF-like protein. In the presence of the 102A probe, an additional band, indicated byarrowheads, was generated in all cell types (Fig.2 B, lanes 2, 7, and 12). This finding, together with DNA sequence data, led us to postulate that this additional allele-specific binding protein might be YY1. However, the band shift patterns observed with different nuclear extracts indicate that another trans-acting factor can bind to this site, depending on the cell type. We next examined the specificity of the DNA-protein interactions by competitive gel band shift assays. As seen in Fig.3 A, the −102A allele-specific binding protein was inhibited by unlabeled 102A oligonucleotide, whereas the complex formation was not altered by the addition of unlabeled nonspecific oligonucleotide (Sp1). Similarly, because the −102A allele is located in the potential composite element (Fig.2 A) and generates a YY1 consensus element (AANATGGNC/G), competition experiments were performed with various oligonucleotides containing either consensus or mutated motifs (sequences listed in Table I). As shown in Fig. 3 B (lanes 9 and10), effective competition was obtained with either the YY1sa oligonucleotide, which contains a skeletal α-actin muscle regulatory element-like motif, or the c-fos SRE oligonucleotide (28.Gualberto A. LePage D. Pons G. Mader S.L. Park K. Atchison M.L. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The latter contains a core YY1 element in direct orientation (CCAT) and differs from other oligonucleotides both in the AT-rich core element and flanking sequences outside the conserved CC and GG nucleotides. The c-fos SRE oligonucleotide, which does not contain any sequence similar to CFTR, was chosen to evaluate the fine specificity of the interaction and contribution of surrounding nucleotides. In contrast, oligonucleotides not containing the −102T>A substitution (WT, CarG, inverted CCAAT) or comprising a mutated YY1 motif (mYY1) did not compete for the −102A allele-specific binding protein under the same conditions (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3–6). However, a simultaneous addition of unlabeled CarG and YY1sa oligonucleotides resulted in total inhibition of DNA-protein complex formation (data not shown). These observations suggest that a SRF-like protein and YY1 factor could simultaneously occupy the region containing the (−102T>A) sequence variation. To examine further the nature of factors specifically binding the −102A allele in different nuclear extracts from cells that either do or do not express endogenous CFTR (indicated by arrowheadsin Fig. 2 B), we performed band shift assays after proteolytic clipping of DNA-protein complexes. Proteolytic clipping was carried out with defined amounts of trypsin (determined by serial dilution of the protease; data not shown). When the 102A probe was used, the resulting clipping pattern was very similar to the pattern obtained with the YY1sa probe (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4and 8). Moreover, a similar pattern of partial complexes, indicated by arrowheads (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10), was observed with cells that express endogenous CFTR (CF-PAC1) and with those that do not (HeLa). These findings suggest that the nuclear factor that specifically binds to the −102A allele in the minimal CFTRpromoter is very similar to the ubiquitous YY1 transcription factor. To characterize nuclear factors in the protein-DNA complexes, we performed an extensive immunological analysis with specific antibodies against transcription factors having the potential to bind YY1 and CArG sites in the composite element shown in Fig. 2 A. As expected, preincubation with the anti-YY1 antibodies specifically prevented the formation of the −102A allele-specific complex. Upper and lower bands were completely inhibited with the rabbit polyclonal anti-YY1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 5, and Fig. 4 B, lane 4), whereas only the upper band formation was abolished with mouse polyclonal anti-YY1 (Fig.4 A, lane 4).

Quantification of PDE activation and of the amount of Gαt-GTPγS bound to PDE indicated that Gt activates PDE maximally when bound in a 1:1 molar ratio. No cooperativity was observed, even at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, under these conditions, the one binding site for Gαt-GTPγS on PDE that stimulates catalysis must be of higher affinity than one or more additional sites which are silent with respect to activation of PDE.

Sitaramayya A. Introductory Signal Transduction. Birkhauser, Boston1999: 29-46Google Scholar) is dominated by protein-protein interactions occurring on the cytoplasmic surfaces of membranes containing heptahelical receptors. G protein subunits convey information between transmembrane receptors and effectors that are also typically either integral or peripheral membrane proteins. Regulators of transduction, such as receptor kinases, arrestin, and its homologues, and GTPase accelerating proteins, are also often localized to the signaling domains of cell membranes. Localization of multiple cascade components may be important for achieving specificity of interactions, and rapid tightly coupled responses. The G protein cascade of vision has served as a useful model system for studying the role of lipid membranes in signal transduction. Both the G protein transducin (Gt)1 and its effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) are normally associated with the surface of disc membranes in rod outer segments, and each contains two covalently attached lipids: farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups on PDEα and PDEβ, respectively (2.Anant J.S.

However, these lipids confer only modest membrane affinity, and both PDE and Gt can be selectively extracted without use of detergents, and purified by chromatography. Interactions between activated forms of the α subunit of the G protein, e.g. Gαt-GTPγS, and PDE can be reconstituted using the purified proteins, and show a strong membrane dependence (9.Fung B.K.-K.

The utility of these reconstitution experiments has been limited by the relatively low efficiency of PDE activation observed in them, as compared with that inferred from the physiology of intact cells where activation occurs on a millisecond time scale with low levels of activated Gt. Reconstitution experiments have typically required micromolar levels of Gαt-GTPγS, even with nanomolar PDE (12, and references cited therein). Detailed analysis of the dependence of PDE activity on added Gαt-GTPγS has suggested that functional heterogeneity of Gt is likely responsible for the low reconstitution efficiency. Conformational heterogeneity involving the membrane-binding domains of Gtseems a likely candidate for this phenomenon, because membrane binding and activation are strongly correlated (12.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14.Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Chock P.B. Huang C.Y. Tsou C.L. Wang J.H. Enzyme Dynamics and Regulation. Springer-Verlag, New York1988: 102-112Crossref Google Scholar). A practical consequence of this Gt heterogeneity and inefficient activation has been difficulty in determining the stoichiometric ratio of subunits in the PDE·Gαt-GTPγS complex. PDE contains two homologous catalytic subunits, PDEα and PDEβ, as well as two inhibitory PDEγ subunits (15.Deterre P. Bigay J. Forquet F. Robert M. Chabre M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), each of which can bind tightly (K d <1 nm) to Gαt-GTPγS (16.Otto-Bruc A. Antonny B. Vuong M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8636-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been widely assumed that there are two binding sites for Gαt-GTPγS on PDE, and some experimental evidence (e.g. Ref. 11.Clerc A. Bennett N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6620-6627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supports this idea, but the high concentrations needed to observe full occupation of these sites has obstructed accurate correlation of PDE activity with site occupation. Indeed, three mutually exclusive models have been proposed: 1) two sites of approximately equal affinity and equal contributions to catalytic activity (17.Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2155-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); 2) one higher affinity site contributing 80–100% of the catalytic activity, with a second, lower affinity site contributing much less (13.Bruckert F. Catty P. Deterre P. Pfister C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12625-12634Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); and 3) a higher affinity site contributing 30% or less of the catalytic activity, with occupation of a second lower affinity site needed for full activation (18.Bennett N. Clerc A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7418-7424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19.Clerc A. Catty P. Bennett N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19948-19953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cooperativity between the two sites has been proposed (20.Whalen M.M. Bitensky M.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and functional differences between the two PDEγ sites in trypsinized PDE have been identified through differential interactions with mutant PDEγ (21.Berger A.L. Cerione R.A. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In order to understand better the role of membrane lipids in Gt signaling, we have reconstituted on synthetic lipid vesicles two different Gtα-containing complexes: Gαβγt-GDP, and PDE-Gαt-GTPγS, and explored the role of vesicle properties in the binding and activity of these complexes. This work was undertaken to answer three key questions: 1) how does lipid composition affect binding of Gt to membranes and membrane-dependent activation of PDE by Gαt-GTPγS? 2) Can a lipid surface be found that enhances binding of Gt and the Gαt-GTPγS·PDE complexes sufficiently for structural analysis by electron crystallography? 3) If PDE activation by Gt is sufficiently enhanced to allow most Gαt-GTPγS to participate in PDE activation, what is the relationship between PDE activity and number of Gαt-GTPγS molecules bound? Frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas were purchased from J. A. Lawson Packing (Lincoln, NE). Rhodamine-dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine was obtained from Molecular Probes, stearylamine from Sigma, and all other lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. PDE assay buffer: 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, with NaCl or KCl added to the indicated concentrations. The ROS buffer was: 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm MgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.4. Low salt 1 buffer consisted of: 5 mm Tris, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4.

DEAE load buffer was: 10 mm MOPS, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0. All buffers were filtered through 0.2-μm pore nitrocellulose. Rod outer segment membranes (ROS) were isolated from frozen bovine retina on sucrose gradients under dim red light according to established methods (22.Papermaster D.S. Dryer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Urea-washed membranes which have had peripheral membrane proteins removed, were prepared by a series of washing steps, including 4m urea as described previously (23.Yamanaka G. Eckstein F. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8094-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Gt and Gαt-GTPγS were purified essentially as described (12.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G.

Briefly, ROS membranes (15–25 μm) were bleached and washed in ROS buffer followed by multiple washes in Low salt 1 buffer. Gt was extracted from the membranes in Low salt 1 buffer + GTP, loaded onto a hexyl-agarose column (Sigma) and purified by step elution with Low salt 2 buffer + NaCl. Hexyl-agarose-purified Gt was ∼95% pure by Coomassie staining on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. For Gαt-GTPγS, either Gt was extracted from ROS with Low salt 1 + GTPγS, or hexyl-agarose-purified Gt was activated with a catalytic amount of urea-washed ROS in the presence of GTPγS and a trace amount of GTP-γ-35S. Gαt-GTPγS was separated from Gβγ by loading onto a Reactive Blue 2-Sepharose CL-6B column (Sigma) and eluted in increasing [KCl]. In some cases, Gt or Gαt-GTPγS were further purified by high performance liquid chromatography anion-exchange, as described (12.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PDE was purified from Low salt 1 extracts of ROS by loading onto a hydroxylapatite column in 30 mm phosphate and 50 mm NaCl (Bio-Rad HTP dry hydroxylapatite (12.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)), followed by step elution in increasing phosphate. In most cases (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7), PDE was further purified by concentrating PDE-containing fractions and exchanging into DEAE load buffer immediately before loading onto a high performance liquid chromatography anion-exchange column. (Waters DEAE-5PW). PDE was eluted with increasing [NaCl]; data in Fig. 3 are from PDE not subjected to this second chromatography step. Purified proteins were concentrated with a Centricon-30 and stored at −20 °C in 40–50% (v/v) glycerol. Recombinant PDEγ was expressed inEscherichia coli as a fusion protein and purified as described (26.Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol.

Gαt-GTPγS dependent activation of PDE was measured on a variety of vesicle surfaces in PDE assay buffer with 50 mm NaCl. PDE (10 nm) was added to vesicles (125 mm total lipid; egg PC, DOPC or 20:80 mol/mol DOTAP:DOPC), mixed, and then Gαt-GTPγS (20 nm) was added. For comparison, Gαβγt-dependent activation of PDE was measured on DOTAP:DOPC vesicles.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3986-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To measure maximal, trypsin-generated PDE activity, PDE was treated with trypsin (0.05–0.1 mg/ml final) in pH assay buffer at the indicated [NaCl] or [KCl], while activity was monitored continuously as described below. For experiments testing PDE-membrane interactions with and without PDE's lipid modified membrane-binding domains, PDE was treated with trypsin in PDE assay buffer (50 mm NaCl) at PDE:trypsin = 100:1 for 8 min at room temperature and then soybean trypsin inhibitor was added at a 10-fold excess over trypsin to stop the reaction. Recombinant PDEγ was added back at a slight excess over the amount required to inhibit trypsinized PDE activity. Gαt was proteolyzed to remove the fatty acylated NH2 terminus involved in membrane binding (27.Mazzoni M.R. Malinski J.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14072-14081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gαt-GTPγS (12.5 μm) was incubated with 333 nm endoproteinase Lys-C (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature and then the reaction was stopped by addition of the proteinase inhibitors, aprotinin and leupeptin (22-fold excess mol/mol). The efficiency of proteolysis was determined using a monoclonal antibody (mAb4A) which recognizes only the myristoylated NH2 terminus of Gt(27.Mazzoni M.R. Malinski J.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14072-14081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2T. G. Wensel and Z. Yang, unpublished observations. A 30-min incubation was sufficient to remove all mAb4A-binding sites; the reaction was 80–90% complete within 5 min. Concentrations of PDE, Gt, and Gαt-GTPγS were routinely determined by the Coomassie Blue binding assay (28.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217507) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard, and assuming a molecular mass of 216,000 daltons for PDE and 40,000 daltons for Gαt. The PDE concentration determined this way was 1.17-fold higher than that determined using the correction factor of Gillespie and Beavo (29.Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) derived from amino acid analysis, and was 1.16-fold lower than that determined from UV absorbance, using a calculated ε280 nm of 211,510m−1 cm−1. When Gαt-GTPγS concentrations determined by this assay were compared with those determined by radioactivity of purified protein prepared using GTP-γ-35S, the ratio was found to be 1.04. Lipids were mixed in organic solvent and dried down under a stream of N2. For large unilamellar vesicle (LUV) preparations, the dried lipids were resuspended in aqueous buffer and subjected to at least 5 freeze/thaw cycles in liquid N2. Lipid suspensions were then extruded 10 times through 0.1-μm polycarbonate filters using either the Extruder (Lipex Biomembranes Inc.) or a Millipore stainless steel filter holder connected to an high performance liquid chromatography pump (12.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of dilute vesicle suspensions (Fig.2 D) confirmed that the extruded vesicles were predominantly unilamellar. For sucrose-loaded LUVs (sl-LUVs), 170 mmsucrose was included in the aqueous resuspension buffer prior to extrusion (30.Rebecchi M.J. Peterson A.A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). After extrusion, the extravesicular [sucrose] was reduced to less than 1 mm by repeated dilution and pelleting in a TLA-100.3 rotor operating at 44,000 rpm. For small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) preparations, dried lipids were resuspended in aqueous buffer and sonicated for 10 cycles of 30 s at 4 °C in an ice bath. SUVs (20–40 nm diameter) were isolated by gel-filtration on a Sepharose CL-4B column (Ref. 31.Plager D.A. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7005-7013Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar and references cited therein). Gt was loaded with [α-32P]GTP by mixing with a catalytic amount of urea-washed ROS (Gt:R* molar ratio = 10:1). After GTP hydrolysis and the re-association of Gαt with Gβγt, the membranes were pelleted and the Gt-[32P]GDP containing supernatant was collected and concentrated. For the vesicle-binding assay, Gt-[32P]GDP (100 nm) was mixed with sl-LUVs for 10 min at room temperature and pelleted in a TLA-100.3 rotor (Beckman) operating at 20 °C and 44,000 rpm. Total counts were measured in both the supernatant and the pellet. In some experiments, rhodamine-dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Molecular Probes) was included at 0.1 mol % of the total lipid (with the remainder made up of PC with or without PS or cationic lipids) in the sl-LUVs, and vesicle pelleting efficiency was found, by fluorescence, to be greater than 95%. When PDE was incubated with sl-LUVs, the pelleting assay was similar to that used for Gt except the assays were performed in PDE assay buffer, or Low salt 3 buffer supplemented as indicated with NaCl, and the amount of PDE pelleted was determined by measuring trypsin-generated PDE activity. For PDE binding to other vesicle types, PDE-membrane complexes were pelleted in an airfuge operating at 28 p.s.i. at room temperature (12.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PDE activity was monitored by the pH assay (32.Liebman P.A. Evancczuk T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) which detects the accumulation of protons following cGMP hydrolysis. Assays were conducted in pH assay buffer or Low salt 3 buffer supplemented with NaCl (50 mm unless indicated otherwise) and an initial cGMP concentration of 2 mm. Assays were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates maintained at 23 °C and monitored with either MI-410 or MI-415 microelectrodes (Microelectrodes Inc.) as described previously (12.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At the conclusion of each assay, maximal PDE activation was determined through trypsin digestion of the inhibitory PDEγ subunit. All of the plotted Gt membrane binding data have been fit to the Hill equation with the program PSI-Plot (version 5.02c for Windows) which implements the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for multiparameter least-squares fitting. For each fit, in the equation, Gt,bound=Gt,max×[L] n/(K′+[L] n)Equation 1 was solved for the Hill coefficient (n), withK′ = ([L] at 0.5 × Gt,max) n = ([L]0.5) n, where [L] refers to total accessible lipid concentration in experiments where lipid was varied, and to Gt concentration in experiments where Gt was varied. “Accessible lipid” represents half of the total lipid, an approximation of the amount of lipid in the outer, exposed leaflet of the bilayer of LUVs, based on the determination here and in previous work (12.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) of their size distribution and predominantly unilamellar character. For SUVs, the difference between the areas of the interior and exterior leaflets was taken into account. Gt,max = maximum Gt bound, expressed as percent of total where total Gt was constant, and in terms of concentration, when Gt was varied. The best fits, as determined by standard least squares criteria, are plotted as continuous curves. Data for Gαt-GTPγS-PDE activation by liposomes were fit to the hyperbolic binding curve, PDE=(PDEmax×[lipid])/(nKd+[lipid])Equation 2 where PDE = % PDE activity at a particular concentration of accessible lipid ([lipid]), PDEmax = maximal PDE activity, and nK d = (dissociation constant × number of lipids involved in the binding site). Titrations of liposome-bound PDE with Gαt-GTPγS were analyzed as described (12.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33.Malinski J.A. Zera E.Z. Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12919-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for the “tight binding” case where the apparent dissociation constant is comparable to or much less than the concentrations of both proteins. Ordered arrays of Gt were grown using the lipid-layer technique for two-dimensional crystallography (34.Uzgiris E.E. Kornberg R.D. Nature. 1983; 301: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, various lipid mixtures (0–100% DSTAP or DOTAP or 0–40% stearoylamine, with dioleoyl-PS, dioleoyl-PE, egg PE, DOPC, egg PC, or diphytanoyl-PC as filler) in 1:1 chloroform:hexane were floated over Gt (0.2 mg/ml) in Teflon wells. Buffer composition and crystallization conditions were varied to test a range of pH 5–11, ionic strength (0–50 mm NaCl), buffer (MOPS and Tris), temperature (0, 4, and 20 °C), and time (30 min to several days). Samples were screened by electron microscopy and ordered arrays were discovered only on 20:80 (mol/mol) DSTAP:diphytanoyl-PC or 20:80 (mol/mol) DOTAP:diphytanoyl-PC monolayers in Low salt 2 buffer. Arrays formed in 1–2 h at 4 °C. For cryo-EM of vesicle preparations, samples were applied to electron microscope grids covered with a holey-carbon film (35.Fukami A. Adachi K. J. Electron Microsc. 1965; 14: 112-118PubMed Google Scholar). Excess solution was wicked off and the grid was rapidly plunged into liquid ethane. Samples were then kept at or below liquid N2 temperatures. The vesicles were imaged in a JEOL 1200 EX operating at 100 kV on a Gatan cryo-stage maintained at < −162 °C (36.Avila-Sakar A.J. Chiu W. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 57-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Images were taken at a magnification of ×30,000 and digitized on a Zeiss (model SCAI) microdensitometer with a 14-μm step size. For negatively stained planar arrays, monolayers were transferred from the air-water interface to carbon-coated continuous nitrocellulose electron microscope grids, washed with 1% uranyl acetate and imaged in a JEOL 100 CX operating at 80 kV. Images were taken at ×33,000 magnification and digitized with a 7-μm step size. When Gt was incubated with neutral PC vesicles at moderate ionic strength (Fig.1), the accessible lipid concentration required for half-maximal binding ([L]0.5) was about 170 μm, and was fairly insensitive to a reduction in ionic strength; the [L]0.5 value increased only to 400 μm. Surprisingly, given the net negative electrostatic charge on Gt, binding to anionic PS-containing vesicles was about 3-fold stronger, with an [L]0.5 value of 53 μm. The presence of the divalent cation Mg2+ in all of our buffers may be responsible for enhancing interactions between these two anionic species (37.Seitz H.R. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Alt T. Pellaud J. Seelig A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7950-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Lowering the ionic strength reduced the affinity for negatively charged vesicles about 2-fold to an [L]0.5 value of 110 μm. An interesting feature of Gt binding to both neutral and anionic vesicles is that the maximum amount bound amounts to only about half of the total Gt added, and increasing the vesicle concentration up to 2 mm accessible lipid does not induce binding of the remaining Gt. The simplest explanation for this result is that the purified Gt, while homogeneous in its chromatographic and electrophoretic behavior, is heterogeneous with regard to its ability to bind these membranes. To test whether the unbound Gt in these experiments was competent to bind vesicles, we incubated the unbound Gt in a supernatant from a PC sl-LUV binding assay with a fresh aliquot of PC vesicles in moderate salt (ROS) buffer. Less than 10% (8.6% ± 2.6%) of this protein bound the vesicles when incubated at a lipid:protein ratio of 1.4 × 104 (1.4 mm accessible lipid). Incorporation of positive charges into membranes lead to the highest affinity interactions, so that in moderate salt, [L]0.5 is about 26 μm with PC vesicles containing 20 mol % DSTAP. Lowering ionic strength has little effect. The most striking difference between the positively charged vesicles and the others is that they seem to allow nearly all (>89%) of the added Gt to bind at concentrations of less than 500 μm accessible lipid. A feature of Gt binding to cationic vesicles that is not immediately obvious from the plot in Fig. 1 is its apparent cooperativity (see values of Hill coefficients in Fig. 1, legend). This cooperativity is more clearly seen at low lipid concentrations as shown in Fig.2, A and B, where the Hill coefficients calculated varied from 1.3 to 4.3. This cooperativity was observed in both low and moderate salt, and with various kinds of positively charged lipids. The least pronounced cooperativity (n = 1.3) was observed with DSTAP; however, this apparently lower Hill coefficient may simply reflect the fact that this lipid mixture displays the highest affinity binding, obscuring cooperativity in the concentration range tested. Cooperativity of this sort requires contributions to binding by more than one vesicle simultaneously, and a simple explanation for this sort of behavior could be cross-linking of vesicles. Electron microscopy of the Gt-vesicle complexes (Fig. 2, C andD) revealed that Gt is indeed able to bridge cationic vesicles. When DOTAP:diphytanoyl-PC vesicles were prepared in the absence of protein (Fig. 2 D), individual spherical vesicles were observed. However, when these vesicles were incubated with Gt, th"

PrRP rapidly and transiently activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) in both types of cells. Both pertussis toxin, which inactivates Gi/Go proteins, and exogenous expression of a peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase I, which specifically blocks signaling mediated by the βγ subunits of G proteins, completely blocked the PrRP-induced ERK activation, suggesting the involvement of Gi/Goproteins in the PrRP-induced ERK activation. Down-regulation of cellular protein kinase C did not significantly inhibit the PrRP-induced ERK activation, suggesting that a protein kinase C-independent pathway is mainly involved. PrRP-induced ERK activation was not dependent on either extracellular Ca2+ or intracellular Ca2+. However, the ERK cascade was not the only route by which PrRP communicated with the nucleus. JNK was also shown to be significantly activated in response to PrRP. JNK activation in response to PrRP was slower than ERK activation. Moreover, to determine whether a MAPK family cascade regulates rat prolactin (rPRL) promoter activity, we transfected the intact rPRL promoter ligated to the firefly luciferase reporter gene into GH3 cells. PrRP activated the rPRL promoter activity in a time-dependent manner. Co-transfection with a catalytically inactive form of a MAPK construct or a dominant negative JNK, partially but significantly inhibited the induction of the rPRL promoter by PrRP. Furthermore, co-transfection with a dominant negative Ets completely abolished the response of the rPRL promoter to PrRP.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1978; 298: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a physiological regulator of pituitary cell function that stimulates prolactin synthesis and secretion (2.Dannies P.S. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Nature. 1976; 261: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, a new peptide which is a ligand of the “orphan” receptor hGR3 expressed specifically in the human pituitary was identified in the hypothalamus as a potent prolactin-releasing factor for rat anterior pituitary cells (3.Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). This peptide was named “prolactin-releasing peptide” (PrRP). The receptor of PrRP, hGR3, is referred to as a seven-transmembrane domain receptor or a G protein-coupled receptor (4.Marchese A. Heiber M. Nguyen T. Heng H.H. Saldivia V.R. Cheng R. Mupphy P.M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although it was reported that PrRP induced arachidonic acid metabolite release as well as PRL secretion (3.Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), the signal transduction pathway in PrRP-induced PRL secretion or synthesis has remained unknown. The effects of TRH are presumably mediated by activation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-phospholipase C, leading to the production of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol (6.Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14816-14822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Rebecchi M.J. Koleshick R.N. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, many of the downstream effects of TRH are believed to be dependent on mobilization of intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Although G protein-coupled receptors are thought to be linked primarily to second messenger systems, protein tyrosine phosphorylation can occur soon after receptor occupancy in some cases (8.Simonson M.S. Herman W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9347-9357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Lutz M.P. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11119-11124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular transmission of extracellular signals is mediated in large part by several groups of sequentially activated protein kinases, which are collectively known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. In growth factor signaling, the key elucidated MAPK cascade is that involving the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Recent evidence indicates that some G protein-coupled receptors can activate the ERK cascade (10.Ohmichi M. Sawada T. Kanda Y. Koike K. Hirota K. Miyake A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3783-3788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Ohmichi M. Koike K. Nohara A. Kanda Y. Sakamoto Y. Zhang Z.X. Hirota K. Miyake A.

Miyake A. Murata Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138 (3111): 3130Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The signals transmitted through the ERK cascade lead to activation of a set of regulatory molecules that ultimately initiate cellular responses such as growth and differentiation (13.Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 14.Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Recently we have shown that TRH is capable of activating ERK in pituitary organ culture (16.Ohmichi M. Koike K. Nohara A. Kanda Y. Sakamoto T. Zhang Z.X. Hirota K. Miyake A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and in GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells (10.Ohmichi M. Sawada T. Kanda Y. Koike K. Hirota K. Miyake A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1447-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the ERK cascade is not the only link between membrane receptors and their intracellular targets, and several other ERK-like cascades have been identified (18.Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). One of the most studied of these cascades is the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK: also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) (19.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A.

It has been shown that Raf, ERK, and Ets are crucial components of the downstream transmission of the Ras signal in the regulation of the PRL promoter activity (27.Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E.

The Ets family of transcription factors, which comprises a number of phosphoproteins with a conserved DNA-binding motif named the Ets domain (29.Macleod K. Leprince D. Sthelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have been demonstrated to be phosphorylated and activated by ERK (30.Hill C. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Several Ets-binding sites have been identified in the proximal PRL promoter. Taken together, these facts led us to examine whether PrRP stimulates the activity of ERK or JNK, and whether each of these cascades plays a role in the transcriptional activation of the rat PRL (rPRL) gene in GH3 cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and myelin basic protein were purchased from Sigma. PrRP was a gift from Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. (Japan). ECL Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc. Erk1 rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK antiserum and monoclonal antibody 9E10 to the Myc epitope were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PD98059 and the SAPK/JNK assay kit, including the NH2-terminal c-Jun fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and a phospho-specific c-Jun antibody (Ser63), were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). GH3 cells were cultured at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The preparation of cultured pituitary cells was described previously (31.Ohmichi M. Hirota K. Koike K. Kadowaki K. Yamaguchi M. Miyake A. Tanizawa O. Neuroendocrinology. 1990; 52: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, female Wistar rats (200–250 g) were decapitated and their anterior pituitary glands were quickly removed and placed in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The anterior lobes were cut into 1-mm3 pieces with a scalpel. The tissue fragments were exposed to 20 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma, type 3) for 25 min at 37 °C and centrifuged (200 ×g, 5 min). Then they were exposed to 2.5 μg/ml pancreatin (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) for 15 min at 37 °C, centrifuged (200 × g, 5 min) and resuspended in DMEM. The tissue blocks were disrupted by pipetting them in plastic pipettes with tapering tips until a single-cell suspension was obtained. Then the cells were centrifuged and washed to remove extracellular trypsin and pancreatin. They were then suspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, seeded into 100-mm dishes, and incubated for 4 days in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C to allow them to become attached to the dishes. Myc-tagged p42 mapk expression plasmid (pEXV-Erk2-tag) was obtained from Dr. C. J. Marshal (Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom) (32.Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S.

Boulukos (Center de Biochimie, Faculté des Sciences, Nice, France). pAPr-etsZ, encoding the consensus DNA-binding domain of Ets-2, was a kind gift from Dr. M. Ostrowski (Ohio State University, Columbus) (39.Langer S.J. Bortner D.M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding the dominant negative c-Jun (dnJun), pLHCc-Jun (S63A, S73A) (40.Potapova O. Fakrai H. Baird S. Mercola D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2800-2806Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Dr. D. Mercola (University of California, San Diego). The plasmid encoding the dominant negative SAPK/JNK (pcDL-SRα-SAPK-VPF) was a kind gift from Dr. E. Nishida (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) (41.Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated overnight in the absence of serum and then treated with various substances. They were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (42.Ohmichi M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1143-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and the protein content of the supernatants was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Erk1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was bound to protein A-Sepharose beads, and 300 μg of protein from the lysate samples was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitated products were washed once in HNTG buffer, twice in 0.5 mLiCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and once in kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2–7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and samples were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 10 μg of myelin basic protein and 40 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) as described previously (23.Sundaresan S. Colin I.M. Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 5 min and stopped by the addition of Laemmli SDS sample buffer (43.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Reaction products were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. GH3 cells cultured in 100-mm dishes were transfected with Myc-tagged p42 mapk expression plasmid (1 μg of pEXV-Erk2-tag) in combination with 9 μg of pRK or pRK-βARK1 using LipofectAMINE as described previously (12.Ohmichi M. Koike K. Kimura A. Masuhara K. Ikegami H. Ikebuchi Y. Kanzaki T. Touhara K. Sakaue M. Kobayashi Y. Akabane M. Miyake A. Murata Y.

At 72 h after transfection, serum-deprived cells were incubated with 1 μm PrRP for 5 min, and expressed Myc-tagged p42 mapk was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of antibody 9E10. The ERK activity in the immunoprecipitate was measured as described above. The transfection efficiency of each experiment was 8–10% as assessed by β-galactosidase staining after transfection of a β-galactosidase-containing expression plasmid. JNK activity was precipitated from 250 μg of whole cell lysates by incubation with 2 μg of GST-cJun (1–89) fusion protein/GSH-Sepharose beads for 18 h at 4 °C (New England BioLabs) (20.Derijard B.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar). c-Jun (1–89) contains a high-affinity binding site for JNK close to the NH2-terminal: this site contains two phosphorylation sites at Ser63 and Ser73. The beads were washed and resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C as described (45.Kimura A. Ohmichi M. Kurachi H. Ikegami H. Hayakawa J. Tasaka K. Kanda Y. Jikihara H. Matsuura N. Murata Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5133-5142PubMed Google Scholar). The solid-phase kinase reaction was terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and phosphorylation of GST-cJun on Ser63 was examined after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-phospho(Ser63) c-Jun antibody. GH3 cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with pA3–425PRLluc and CMV-β-galactosidase plasmid (to normalize for cell viability and transfection efficiency) in combination with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE. At 48 h after transfection, serum-deprived cells were incubated with 1 μm PrRP for the indicated times. In some of the experiments, cells were treated with 20 μm PD98059 for 15 min before the addition of 1 μm PrRP. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells with three sequential freeze-thaw cycles in a buffer containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Vigorous vortexing was used to enhance cell lysis. Unlysed cells and insoluble material were pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant volume was measured, and aliquots of the supernatant were used in the subsequent luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Luciferase was assayed as described previously (34.Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1279-1286PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the luciferase assay mixture contained 100 mm KPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3.7 mmMgSO4, 530 μm ATP, and 470 μmluciferin plus 20 μl of cell extract in a final volume of 100 μl. Luciferin was added just before measuring light units, which were measured in duplicate during the first 40 s of the reaction at 25 °C in a Luminometer (46.de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase was assayed as described previously (34.Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1279-1286PubMed Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase buffer contained 60 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.80 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-δ-galactopyranoside, and 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A standard curve containing 100 microunits to 2 milliunits of β-galactosidase was made with each assay. A 30-μl aliquot of cell extract was incubated with assay buffer until color developed (30–120 min), and the reaction was then stopped by adding Na2CO3 to a final concentration of 625 mm. Absorbance was then read at 405 nm. Luciferase light units were normalized relative to the activity of β-galactosidase. The control value was then set at 1 and the data expressed as fold-stimulation relative to control. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by Student'st test, and p < 0.01 was considered significant. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Recently we reported that the activity of ERK is stimulated by TRH in GH3 cells (10.Ohmichi M. Sawada T. Kanda Y. Koike K. Hirota K. Miyake A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3783-3788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TRH is a potent factor that is known to be capable of promoting both PRL secretion and synthesis (2.Dannies P.S. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Nature. 1976; 261: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PrRP was comparable to TRH in its potency (3.Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). PrRP acts through a specific receptor, which is referred to as a seven-transmembrane domain receptor or G protein-coupled receptor (4.Marchese A. Heiber M. Nguyen T. Heng H.H. Saldivia V.R. Cheng R. Mupphy P.M. Tsui L-C. Shi X. Gregor P. George S.R. O'Downd B.F. Docherty J.M. Genomics. 1995; 29: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,5.Welch S.K. O'Hara B.F. Kilduff T.S. Heller H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether PrRP might induce the activation of ERK. GH3 cells were treated with 1 μm PrRP for the indicated times. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK antibody and examined for ERK activity by assaying the incorporation of32P into MBP, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1 A). PrRP produced an increase in this kinase activity within 2.5 min, with a maximum at 5 min and a decline thereafter. The dose dependence of PrRP-induced ERK activation was also evaluated (Fig. 1 B). The GH3 cells were treated with various concentrations of PrRP for 5 min. Activation of ERK was clearly detected with 10−8m PrRP and was maximal at 10−6m (Fig. 1 B). The doses of PrRP that stimulated ERK activity were similar to those which stimulate the release of PRL (3.Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the receptors for both TRH (6.Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14816-14822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Rebecchi M.J. Koleshick R.N. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PrRP (4.Marchese A. Heiber M. Nguyen T. Heng H.H. Saldivia V.R. Cheng R. Mupphy P.M. Tsui L-C. Shi X. Gregor P. George S.R. O'Downd B.F. Docherty J.M. Genomics. 1995; 29: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 5.Welch S.K. O'Hara B.F. Kilduff T.S. Heller H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. We compared the mechanisms of ERK activation induced by each TRH and PrRP. To determine what type of G protein is coupled to each receptor, we pretreated GH3 cells (Fig. 2 A, left panel) or primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells (Fig.2 A, right panel) with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) for 4 h in order to inactivate Gi and Goproteins, and then treated the cells with 1 μm PrRP or TRH for 5 min. Although PTX at 100 ng/ml almost completely blocked the PrRP-induced ERK activation (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), PTX did not have an apparent effect on TRH-induced ERK activation (Fig. 2 A, lane 6) in both types of cells. Thus, the effect of PrRP on ERK activity involves PTX-sensitive G proteins such as Gi or Go, whereas that of TRH does not involve PTX-sensitive G proteins. It has been reported that the carboxyl terminus of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase, containing its Gβγ-binding domain, is a cellular Gβγ antagonist capable of specifically distinguishing Gα- and Gβγ-mediated processes (33.Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the Gβγ subunit-sequestrant βARKct peptide on PrRP-induced exogenous ERK activity, a Myc-tagged p42 mapk expression plasmid was used to distinguish exogenous ERK from endogenous ERK. We transfected cells with pRK or pRK-βARK1 together with a Myc-tagged p42 mapk expression plasmid (pEXV-Erk2-tag) and after 72 h stimulated them with 1 μm PrRP for 5 min (Fig. 2 B). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to the Myc epitope and examined for the exogenous ERK activity by assaying the incorporation of 32P into MBP, and the level of phosphorylation was normalized relative to the amount of Myc-tagged p42 mapk. Transfection with pRK-βARK1 completely abolished the PrRP-induced ERK activation in GH3 cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). These results suggest that ERK activation by PrRP is mediated by Gβγ in GH3 cells. Many G protein-linked receptors can mediate stimulation of ERK activity via the phospholipase C-dependent activation of PKC (47.Pang L. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 48.Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK by TRH requires PKC in GH3 cells (10.Ohmichi M. Sawada T. Kanda Y. Koike K. Hirota K. Miyake A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3783-3788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of PKC in PrRP-induced ERK activation was examined (Fig.3). Exposure of GH3 cells to PMA caused a stimulation of ERK activity (Fig. 3, lane 6). However, the ability of PMA to induce the activation of ERK does not necessarily mean that the PKC pathway is involved in PrRP-induced ERK activation, as in the case of norepinephrine-induced ERK activation in both adipocytes (49.Shimizu Y. Tanishita T. Minokoshi Y. Shimazu T. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and GT-1 GnRH neuronal cell lines (50.Sawada T. Ohmichi M. Koike K. Kanda Y.

https://openalex.org/W2072566106,"Amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) is a member of a protein family related to the amyloid precursor protein, which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Little is known about the physiological function of this protein family. The adenovirus E3/19K protein binds to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing their transport to the cell surface. In cells coexpressing E3/19K and the MHC Kd molecule, Kd is associated with E3/19K and two cellular protein species with masses of 100 and 110 kDa, termed p100/110. Interestingly, p100/110 are released from the complex upon the addition of Kd-binding peptides, suggesting a role for these proteins in peptide transfer to MHC molecules. Here we demonstrate by microsequencing, reactivity with APLP2-specific antibodies, and comparison of biochemical parameters that p100/110 is identical to human APLP2. We further show that the APLP2/Kdassociation does not require the physical presence of E3/19K. Thus, APLP2 exhibits an intrinsic affinity for the MHC Kdmolecule. Similar to the binding of MHC molecules to the transporter associated with antigen processing, complex formation between APLP2 and Kd strictly depends upon the presence of β2-microglobulin. Conditions that prolong the residency of Kd in the endoplasmic reticulum lead to a profound increase of the association and a drastic reduction of APLP2 transport. Therefore, this unexpected interplay between these unrelated molecules may have implications for both MHC antigen and APLP2 function.

Yang Y. Cuzin F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4647-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). APLP2 is ubiquitously expressed. Alternative splicing of APLP2 pre-mRNA generates at least four transcripts, two of which encode a Kunitz protease inhibitor domain (KPI) (3.Wasco W. Gurubhagavatula S. d. Paradis M. Romano D.M. Sisodia S.S. Hyman B.T. Neve R.L. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 11.Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14227-14234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many structural features of APLP2 are reminiscent of a cell surface receptor. It is a large type I transmembrane protein whose sequence predicts a number of distinct domains; an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain exhibiting zinc, copper, and heparin binding activity (12.Bush A.I. Pettingell W.J. de Paradis M. Tanzi R.E. Wasco W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26618-26621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is followed by a very acidic region and, depending on the isoform, the KPI domain. All of these domains have their respective counterparts in APP. A very high degree of similarity between APLP2 and APP is found in the region following the KPI domain while the similarity decreases drastically in the ∼100 amino acids (aa) preceding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, which again exhibit a high sequence identity (3.Wasco W.

Biosynthesis and trafficking seems to follow initially the constitutive secretory pathway; upon synthesis and translocation into the ER,N-linked carbohydrates are added. Transport through the Golgi apparatus results in O-glycosylation and, depending on the splice variant, the addition of a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (14.Pangalos M.N. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15.Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

The ectodomain can be cleaved in a post-Golgi compartment or at the plasma membrane and is then secreted (15.Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16522-16525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16.Lo A.C.Y. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12641-12645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A similar pathway is followed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which bind peptides in the ER for presentation on the cell surface to cytotoxic T cells (17.Townsend A. Bodmer H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 601-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Completely assembled MHC I molecules consist of three subunits: an MHC encoded polymorphic transmembrane glycoprotein (heavy chain; HC) with an apparent molecular mass of ∼45 kDa is noncovalently associated with a soluble light chain of 12 kDa, called β2-microglobulin (β2m), and an 8–10-aa-long peptide. Assembly of MHC I molecules occurs in the ER and is assisted by a number of chaperones (18.Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 19.Lehner P.J. Trowsdale J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 605-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.van Endert P.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Initially, the free HC associates with the ER-resident chaperone calnexin, an integral membrane protein of ∼90 kDa. In human cells, binding of β2m to the HC triggers the dissociation from calnexin. The labile HC/β2m heterodimer is stabilized and further folded by other chaperones of the ER quality control machinery, such as calreticulin and ERp57, before being loaded with peptides (21.Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 22.Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2186-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The bulk of MHC I antigen-bound peptides arise from protein degradation within the cytosol. A specialized transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) translocates these peptides into the ER (18.Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 20.van Endert P.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24.Koopmann J.O. Hämmerling G.J. Momburg F. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In general, loading of MHC molecules with optimal peptides requires a physical association with TAP, which is mediated by tapasin, a 48-kDa protein encoded in the MHC (25.Grandea A.G. Androlewicz M.J. Athwal R.S. Geraghty D.E. Spies T. Science. 1995; 270: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26.Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampé R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). However, most of the accessory proteins are not absolutely essential for efficient cell surface expression of MHC I molecules, and different alleles differ in their requirement to interact with tapasin and TAP (27.Neisig A. Wubbolts R. Zang X.S. Melief C. Neefjes J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3196-3206PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Upon loading with peptide, class I heterotrimers dissociate from TAP and are efficiently exported to the cell surface (18.Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Additional molecules like gp96 (29.Srivastava P.K. Udono H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), p100/110 (30.Feuerbach D. Burgert H.-G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), p100 (31.Marusina K. Reid G. Gabathuler R. Jefferies W. Monaco J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), or p62 may participate in the assembly process of MHC I molecules with peptides (22.Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 32.Solheim J.C. Harris M.R. Kindle C.S. Hansen T.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2236-2241PubMed Google Scholar). However, their precise role and their temporal order of action are poorly defined. Subversion of the MHC I assembly and antigen presentation pathway seems to be a common strategy employed by persistent viruses to escape immunosurveillance by their host (reviewed in Refs. 33.Burgert H.-G. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 107-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34.Hengel H. Koszinowski U.H. Curr. Opin.

For example, the human adenovirus (Ad) early region 3 (E3) glycoprotein E3/19K binds to MHC I molecules in the ER and inhibits transport of MHC I molecules to the cell surface (36.Burgert H.-G. Kvist S. Cell. 1985; 41: 987-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 37.Andersson M. Paäbo S. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Consequently, MHC-restricted cytotoxic T cell lysis is severely suppressed (Refs. 33.Burgert H.-G. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 107-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38.Burgert H.-G. Maryanski J.L. Kvist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1996; 70: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The function of the E3/19K protein is based on two activities; an HLA binding activity is combined with the ability to localize to the ER. This latter feature appears to require an ER retrieval motif in the cytoplasmic tail (40.Gabathuler R. Kvist S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1803-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 41.Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 42.Cox J.H. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Exp.

Proteins containing these dilysine motifs can reach the cis-Golgi, where they are bound by specific cytosolic coat proteins that mediate retrograde transport to the ER (43.Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 44.Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Complex formation between MHC molecules and E3/19K is primarily mediated by their luminal domains (33.Burgert H.-G. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 107-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 45.Pääbo S. Weber F. Nilsson T. Schaffner W. Peterson P.A.

Binding of MHC molecules to E3/19K is determined by their polymorphic α1 and α2 domains comprising the peptide binding pocket (46.Burgert H.-G. Kvist S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2019-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 48.Feuerbach D. Etteldorf S. Ebenau-Jehle C. Abastado J.P. Madden D. Burgert H.-G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1626-1636PubMed Google Scholar), while the HLA binding capacity of the Ad2 E3/19K protein is critically dependent on two intramolecular disulfide bonds within its luminal domain (47.Sester M. Burgert H.-G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5423-5432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Deryckere F. Burgert H.-G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2832-2841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At exactly which stage of the MHC assembly E3/19K associates with MHC molecules is unknown. In cells expressing the murine MHC Kd allele and E3/19K, the Kd-E3/19K complex is associated with two additional cellular transmembrane proteins of 100 and 110 kDa, termed p100/110. Interestingly, Kd-binding peptides can displace p100/110 from the MHC-E3/19K complex, suggesting a role of these proteins in peptide transfer to MHC I molecules (30.Feuerbach D. Burgert H.-G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have now identified p100/110 as the APLP2 protein. Microsequencing of purified p100/110 revealed peptide sequences identical to APLP2, and antibodies raised against APLP2 recognize proteins with identical biochemical properties to p100/110. Furthermore, we show that APLP2 exhibits an intrinsic affinity for murine MHC Kd molecules that is markedly increased in the presence of the Ad2 E3/19K molecule. E3/19K promotes complex formation between APLP2 and Kd by retaining Kd in the ER. In doing so, the viral protein also impairs trafficking of APLP2. The potential implications of this unexpected finding for both MHC I and APLP2 function are discussed. Transfection of 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) with the Ad2 EcoRI-D and EcoRV-C fragment led to the establishment of 293.12 and 293E3–45 cell lines, respectively, constitutively expressing E3/19K (36.Burgert H.-G.

A. 1992; 89: 11857-11861Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 293Kd2 and 293.12Kd8 were generated by transfection of 293 and 293.12 cells, respectively, with the murine H-2Kd gene (38.Burgert H.-G. Maryanski J.L. Kvist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The murine embryonic fibroblast cell line B7 was established from BALB/c mice by transformation with SV40 (51.Del Val M. Hengel H. Hacker H. Hartlaub U. Ruppert T. Lucin P. Koszinowski U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by H. Hengel (Max von Pettenkofer-Institut Munich, Germany). B7E3–28 cells were derived from B7 by transfection with the Ad2 EcoRV-C fragment. The human melanoma cell line FO-1 (kindly provided by S. Ferrone, Medical College of New York) does not express β2m (52.D'Urso C.M. Wang Z.G. Cao Y. Tatake R. Zeff R.A. Ferrone S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). For generating FO-1Kd and FO-1Kdβ cells, FO-1 cells were transfected with the Kd gene and both the Kd and human β2m genes, respectively. Clones were selected upon cotransfection of the neomycin resistance gene and subsequent culture in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany). Cell line 293APP was generated by transfection of 293 cells with the expression vector hAPP770CMV5, a kind gift of K. Beyreuther (ZMBH, University of Heidelberg, Germany). This plasmid contains the coding region for human APP770 under the control of the cytomegalovirus early promoter (53.Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). The KdE3 construct encodes a chimeric molecule comprising the luminal and transmembrane part of H-2Kd fused to the cytoplasmic tail of Ad2 E3/19K. The cDNA (54.Lapham C.K. Bacik I. Yewdell J.W. Kane K.P. Bennink J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), kindly provided by J. R. Bennink (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), was subcloned into the expression vector pCMV5 (55.Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using restriction enzymes SalI andSmaI. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. For routine culture of 293 transfectants, the medium was supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418. Medium for double transfectants of 293 cells contained in addition 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem). The following monoclonal antibodies were used in this study: W6/32 (ATCC HB95; anti-HLA-A, -B, and -C; Tw1.3, anti-E3/19K (42.Cox J.H. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); 34-1-2 (ATCC HB79) (directed to the α1/α2 domain of H-2Kd, Dd); and SF1–1.1.1 (ATCC HB 159) reacting with the α3 domain of H-2Kd. Polyclonal rabbit antisera AP tail and Kc were generated by immunization with the peptides CYENPTYKYLEQMQI and CKVMVHDPHSLA, corresponding to the C terminus of APLP2 and Kd, respectively. Peptides CTKIIGSVSKEEEEE and CADMDQFTASISET, representing amino acids 206–219 and 570–582 of APLP2, respectively, were used to raise antisera AP 206 and AP 570. The N-terminal cysteine was added for directed coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or bovine serum albumin. Coupling and immunization was done essentially as described (47.Sester M. Burgert H.-G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5423-5432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody APP tail raised against the 20 C-terminal amino acids of human APP (56.Popp G.M. Graebert K.S. Pietrzik C.U. Rosentreter S.M. Lemansky P. Herzog V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of V. Herzog (University of Bonn, Germany). The source for large scale purification of p100/110 was 293.12Kd8 cells, which were grown on 510-cm2 dishes, trypsinized, and centrifuged at 300 × g. The pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until use. Approximately 9 × 109cells were used for purification. The protocol below is outlined for 2 × 109 cells. Cells were lysed in 100 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4). The cleared lysate was incubated with 1 mg of mAb 34-1-2 bound to 1 ml of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for 3 h. Thereafter, the protein A pellet was washed three times with washing buffer B (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.15m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), twice with buffer C (0.2% Nonidet P-40; 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6; 0.5 mNaCl; 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and once with 10 mmTris, pH 8.0. Bound antigens were eluted two times with 1.5 ml of 10 mm octyl glucoside, 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 2.7. The supernatants were immediately neutralized, combined, and incubated with protein A beads for 1 h to adsorb most of the antibodies. Upon centrifugation, the supernatant was concentrated using a Centricon 100 device (Amicon). After the addition of 2 ml of 10 mm octyl glucoside, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, the material was concentrated again and stored at −70 °C. Proteins contained in the eluate, including p100/110, antibody, E3/19K, Kd, and β2m, were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel was briefly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and washed several times in water. The two bands, approximately 15 μg each, were precisely excised, and gel slices were cut in pieces (about 1 × 1 mm2) and incubated for 16 h in water with frequent changes. The washed gel pieces were then immersed in 200 μl of 100 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate (pH 8.5) containing trypsin at an enzyme/protein mass ratio of approximately 1:5. Following incubation at 37 °C for 8 h, the protein fragments produced were eluted from the gel by shaking the pieces twice for 3 h in an equal volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Residual water was extracted from the gel matrix by treatment with acetonitrile. The concentrated eluates were extracted twice with isoamyl alcohol/heptane (1:4) to remove traces of SDS. Separation of the tryptic peptides was performed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac 218TP5 column (1.6 × 250 mm). Two peaks were selected from each elution diagram, and the material was subjected to gas phase sequence analysis. Labeling of cells with [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany), tunicamycin treatment, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE were done essentially as described (36.Burgert H.-G. Kvist S. Cell. 1985; 41: 987-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 46.Burgert H.-G. Kvist S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2019-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of immunoprecipitates was carried out using a phosphor imager (Fujix Bas 1000; Fuji, Japan). Microsomes were prepared as described previously (30.Feuerbach D. Burgert H.-G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For sequential immunoprecipitation, the lysate was incubated for 30 min with the first antibody. Protein A-Sepharose was added, and the incubation continued for 45 min. This first immunoprecipitation was repeated, and the lysate was cleared from residual antibody by two sequential incubations with protein A-Sepharose for 45 min. Subsequently, a second specific antibody was added, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described before. Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment was initiated 3 h before starvation of cells by replacing the medium with medium supplemented with 2.5 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). This concentration was kept throughout the starving and labeling period. Endoglycosidase F treatment was carried out as described (30.Feuerbach D. Burgert H.-G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) except that 8 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) was included during the incubation. Immunoblotting was carried out as described (47.Sester M. Burgert H.-G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5423-5432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57.Elsing A. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the MHC Kd molecule from cells expressing the adenovirus protein E3/19K reveals not only MHC class I heavy chain (Kd), E3/19K, and β2m but also two additional protein species with apparent molecular masses of ∼100 and 110 kDa, termed p100/110 (Fig.1 A, lane 1; Ref.30.Feuerbach D. Burgert H.-G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular nature of p100/110 by microsequencing, these proteins were large scale purified from 293.12Kd8 cells, constitutively expressing both Kd and E3/19K upon transfection of 293 cells (38.Burgert H.-G. Maryanski J.L. Kvist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Detergent extracts of approximately 9 × 109 293.12Kd8 cells were incubated with mAb 34-1-2 directed to MHC Kd molecules. Immunoprecipitated material containing coimmunoprecipitated p100/110 was eluted from the protein A-beads by low pH treatment, concentrated, and separated by preparative SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 A (lanes 2 and 3) shows the typical protein pattern obtained following this purification scheme. Apart from p100/110, KdHC, and E3/19K, Coomassie staining reveals two prominent bands above the Kd HC and E3/19K, corresponding to the heavy and light chain of the mAb, respectively (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 4). Additional protein bands below the p100/110 bands are also detected. Bands corresponding to p100 and p110, respectively, were excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel and separately digested with trypsin. Fragments were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and from each digest two prominent peptide peaks were analyzed by microsequencing. Data base searches revealed a 100% identity of all four peptides to the human APLP2. Fig. 1 B shows the putative amino acid sequence of the APLP2 protein (3.Wasco W. Gurubhagavatula S. d. Paradis M.

Peptide 4 was derived from p100, peptide 3 was derived from p110, and peptide 1/2 was obtained twice, once from p100 and once from the p110 digest. Since the p100/110 preparation still contained minor contaminants, we could not exclude the possibility that these are the source of the sequenced peptides. Therefore, we tried to obtain independent evidence for the identity of APLP2 with p100/110. Polyclonal antisera were raised against three different peptides of human APLP2 (Fig. 1 B, thick underline). Antiserum AP tail is directed to the 14 C-terminal amino acids of the APLP2 cytoplasmic tail. This peptide was chosen, since antibodies against cytoplasmic portions of pr"

We report the isolation and functional characterization of a novel bHLH factor, termed OUT. OUT, structurally related to capsulin/epicardin/Pod-1 and ABF-1/musculin/MyoR, is expressed mainly in the adult mouse reproductive organs, such as the ovary, uterus, and testis, and is barely detectable in tissues of developing embryos. Physical association of OUT with the E protein was predicted from the primary structure of OUT and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. However, unlike other bHLH factors, this novel protein failed to bind E-box or N-box DNA sequences and inhibited DNA binding of homo- and heterodimers consisting of E12 and MyoD in gel mobility shift assays. In luciferase assays, OUT inhibited the induction of E-box-dependent transactivation by MyoD-E12 heterodimers. Deletion studies identified the domain responsible for the inhibitory action of OUT in its bHLH and C-terminal regions. Moreover, terminal differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts was inhibited by exogenous introduction of OUT. These inhibitory functions of OUT closely resemble those of the helix-loop-helix inhibitor Id proteins. Based on these findings, we propose that this novel protein functions as a negative regulator of bHLH factors through the formation of a functionally inactive heterodimeric complex.

The bHLH motif consists of a short region rich in basic amino acids and two amphipathic helices separated by an intervening loop region (12.Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The bHLH proteins form homo- or heterodimers through the helix-loop-helix (HLH) domains, enabling the basic regions to form a bipartite DNA-binding motif that recognizes so-called E-box sequences, CANNTG, commonly found in the promoter or enhancer regions of numerous developmentally regulated genes (12.Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Typically, tissue-specific class B bHLH factors, such as MyoD and neurogenin, dimerize with ubiquitously expressed class A bHLH factors and promote cell fate determination and differentiation into specific lineages (12.Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Class A bHLH factors are exemplified by so-called E proteins, such as E2A gene products E12 and E47. Cell differentiation is a complex and well organized process in which cells respond to stimuli from the environment by carrying out a genetic program. It has been shown that bHLH factors directly or indirectly regulate expression in a gene activation network. The best studied system is skeletal muscle development. Four myogenic bHLH factors, MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4, participate in the development of mammalian skeletal muscles (1.Olson E.N. Klein W.H.

MRF4 functions during the differentiation process of myoblasts, together with MyoD, as well as in the terminal stage (25.Zhang W. Behringer R.R. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Combinatorial orchestration of growth factors and other transcription factors such as MEF2 is also involved in this gene activation network, leading ultimately to muscle development (1.Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar,26.Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Similar cascades of bHLH factors have been also demonstrated in neurogenesis (9.Lee J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In addition to these genetic networks of “positive” bHLH factors, “negative” HLH or bHLH factors enable the proper execution of the cell differentiation control through functional modulation of bHLH factors (11.Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 28.Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 58-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Id proteins, inhibitors of DNA binding/differentiation, are negative regulators of bHLH factors (28.Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 58-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29.Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). They possess HLH domains and heterodimerize with bHLH factors, but, due to a lack of the basic region, the resultant heterodimers have no DNA binding activity. As a consequence, cell differentiation is inhibited. Four Id proteins, Id1–Id4, are expressed in a wide range of embryonic tissues and are believed to be involved in the expansion of immature cell populations (28.Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 58-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H.

The HES proteins are repressive bHLH factors mainly expressed in the developing nervous system (11.Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 33.Akazawa C. Sasai Y. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). A homodimer of HES binds to the E-box-related N-box sequence and actively represses transcription by recruiting a co-repressor through the WRPW domain present in the C terminus (11.Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 35.Dawson S.R. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Parkhurst S.M. Mol. Cell.

HES, like Id, also sequesters bHLH factors (34.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar).

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which is expressed in activated B lymphocytes and muscle precursors, binds to the E-box sequence but does not activate transcription. Instead, it represses E-box-mediated transactivation by competing for binding sites with positive bHLH factors and through a transcriptional repressive domain. Mist1 (41.Lemercier C. To R.Q. Carrasco R.A. Konieczny S.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1412-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), Twist (42.Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and Stra13 (43.Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) are also repressive bHLH factors with multiple inhibitory mechanisms. Among them, Stra13 is an exception, because it possesses no DNA binding activity. The importance of the negative regulation of bHLH factors in cell differentiation has been emphasized by loss-of-function mutants inDrosophila and mice. For example, Drosophilamutants defective in orthologues of Id and HES,emc (44.Botas J. Moscoso del Prado J. Garcia Bellido A. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and hairy (45.Nusslein-Volhard C. Wieschaus E. Nature. 1980; 287: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar), respectively, show developmental defects in the formation of sensory hairs. Mice lackingId2 show loss of lymph node and Peyer's patch development and a defect in development of natural killer cells (46.Yokota Y. Mansouri A. Mori S. Sugawara S. Adachi S. Nishikawa S. Gruss P. Nature. 1999; 397: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar).HES-1-deficient mice demonstrate a defect in neural tube closure and microphthalmia due to premature differentiation of neurons (47.Ishibashi M.

Moreover, inactivation of twist results in defective dorso-ventral patterning due to disturbed gastrulation inDrosophila (49.Ip Y.T. Maggert K. Levine M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5826-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 50.Simpson P. Genetics. 1983; 105: 615-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and defects in cranial neural tube closure and mesodermal derivatives in mice (51.Chen Z.F. Behringer R.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 686-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a novel bHLH factor, OUT, using PCR with degenerate primers. OUT is expressed mainly in the adult mouse reproductive organs and is barely detectable in the developing mouse embryo. In gel shift and oligonucleotide selection assays, OUT failed to bind DNA. In the presence of OUT, E12 and MyoD were prevented from homo- and heterodimer formation and failed to induce E-box-mediated transactivation. By deletion analyses, the bHLH and C-terminal regions were identified as important domains for the inhibitory action of the OUT protein. Furthermore, introduction of OUT in C2C12 myoblasts hampered their terminal differentiation. These functional characteristics indicated that OUT possesses an inhibitory activity similar to that of Id. Total RNA was extracted from organs of ICR mice using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction procedure (52.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using oligo(dT) latex (OligotexTM-dT30(SUPER), Takara, Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The putative bHLH domain of a novel HLH factor was obtained by the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) method using the following two degenerate primers: MESO-S CCAA(C/T)GC(A/C/G/T)CGIGA(A/G)CG(A/C/G/T)(A/G) A(C/T)(A/C)G and MESO-AS CCAG(A/G)TGIG(A/C)(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TA(A/G)CT (A/C/G/T) GA(A/C/G/T)GC, corresponding to target amino acid sequences of NARER(D/N) and ASSYIAHL, respectively (53.Burgess R.

Olson E.N. Development. 1995; 121: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One μg of total RNA of mouse mammary glands at 14 days post-coitus (d.p.c.) was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 20 μl. One μl of the product was subjected to PCR with an Ex-Taq kit (TaKaRa) in a thermal cycler (Takara). The PCR product was subcloned into XcmI-digested pKRX (55.Schutte B.C. Ranade K. Pruessner J. Dracopoli N. BioTechniques. 1997; 22 (44): 40-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and sequenced. Among 35 clones analyzed, 2 encoded an identical novel bHLH protein. An oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library was constructed from 3 μg of poly(A)+ mouse ovary RNA using a TimeSaverTMcDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lambda ZAP II (Stratagene) was used as the vector. Plaque hybridization using the fragment obtained above as a probe was performed at high stringency, and two positive clones were identified from one million independent phage clones. The phage clones were converted to plasmids by the in vivo excision system. The longer clone, pBS-mOUT, was used in this study. The nucleotide sequence of the clone was determined on both strands using an ABI 377 autosequencer (Perkin-Elmer). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed with the 5′-RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification was performed using a nested primer set, TGAGGCTGTAGGCCCTAGAGCAGGGACACAGTACCC and TGCCTCTGTGGCCTCCTGTGACATGCCGCTATCATG (corresponding to cDNA nucleotides (nt) 50–85 and 91–126, respectively). The 5′-RACE product was subcloned into XcmI-digested pKRX, and the sequences of 6 clones were analyzed using an ABI 377 autosequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Twenty μg of poly(A)+ RNA of adult mouse organs was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred onto filters, and cross-linked in a UV chamber. A radioactive DNA probe for OUT was prepared by random-primed labeling of a 1.4-kbPstI-XbaI fragment of the OUT cDNA (nt 398–1791). Hybridization and washing were performed under high stringency conditions as described previously (56.Mori S. Sugawara S. Kikuchi T. Tanji M. Narumi O. Stoykova A. Nishikawa S.I. Yokota Y. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The full-length glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was adopted as a probe for an internal loading control. X-ray films were exposed with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 72 h for OUT and for 12 h for GAPDH. For RT-PCR analyses, 5 μg of total RNA from various adult mouse organs was reverse-transcribed with random hexamer (Takara) in a total volume of 20 μl using a standard protocol. One μl of the product was subjected to PCR amplification using the following two primers: GCCACAAGCTACATTGCCCACCTC and TCATTTGTTACCAAAAGCTGGAGA (corresponding to cDNA nt 460–483 and 709–732, respectively). For an internal control, two primers corresponding to the β-actin gene were utilized. In situ hybridization was performed with paraffin-embedded sections of the uterus and ovary at 7 d.p.c. essentially as described previously (56.Mori S. Sugawara S. Kikuchi T. Tanji M. Narumi O. Stoykova A. Nishikawa S.I. Yokota Y. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled antisense and sense riboprobes were prepared byin vitro transcription with suitable RNA polymerases following linearization of pCMV-OUT (see below) with appropriate restriction enzymes. The probe spanned nt 103–732 of theOUT cDNA. The samples were hybridized and washed at high stringency and autoradiographed with the emulsion of NTB2 (Eastman Kodak Co.). For protein expression, a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven vector, pCMV (a gift from Eiji Hara, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Manchester, UK), was used. The coding region of OUT together with 20 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated sequence was amplified by PCR with pBS-mOUT as a template. The resultant PCR product containing a BamHI site at the 5′ end was subcloned into XcmI-digested pKRX. After confirming the sequence, the BamHI-EcoRI fragment was subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pCMV to generate pCMV-OUT. Other expression vectors of human E47 (pCMV/SV2-E47; a gift from Ryoichiro Kageyama, Kyoto University), E12 (pSP64-E12; a gift from Eiji Hara), mouse Id2 (pRcCMV-Id2) (57.Neuman T. Keen A. Zuber M.X.

Brain Res. 1999; 64: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were constructed by subcloning the cDNA from each plasmid into pCMV with appropriate restriction enzymes, generating pCMV-E47, pCMV-E12, pCMV-Id2, pCMV-MyoD, pCMV-myogenin, pCMV-Mash2, and pCMV-TAL2, respectively. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, expression vectors tagged with 6 repeats of Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLNE) were constructed using pCMV-6Myc(N), which was generated with theBamHI-XbaI fragment from pCS2+MT (a gift from Kunihiro Tsuchida, Tokushima University) containing the 6Myc epitope sequence inserted into a BamHI-XbaI-treated pCMV vector. The PCR-amplified OUT coding region (corresponding to OUT cDNA nt 103–729) bearing a KpnI site at the 5′ end and a BamHI site at the 3′ end was ligated in-frame into KpnI-BamHI-treated pCMV-6Myc(N), generating pCMV-OUT/6Myc. For the expression of the bHLH-deleted mutant of OUT, two PCR-amplified fragments corresponding to OUTcDNA nt 103–321 and nt 493–729 carryingKpnI-SphI sites andSphI-BamHI sites, respectively, were ligated together into KpnI-BamHI-treated pCMV-6Myc(N), generating pCMV-OUTΔbHLH/6Myc. pCMV-Id2/6Myc and pCMV-Id2ΔHLH/6Myc (corresponding to Id-2 cDNA nt 62–178 and nt 305–478) were similarly constructed. For CASTing assays, the OUT expression vector tagged with the FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDDK) was generated by subcloning the coding region of OUT (nt 103–732) downstream of the FLAG epitope sequence in pCMV-FLAG-2 vector (Sigma). For use in in vitro translation experiments, the FLAG-OUT fragment was transferred to pBluescript using the SacI-BamHI site, generating pBS-FLAG/OUT. Similarly, pBS-FLAG/MyoD was generated from pCMV-FLAG-2 MyoD (a gift from Shosei Yoshida). To generate deletion mutants of OUT, fragments corresponding to amino acid sequences indicated in Fig. 7 A were obtained by PCR. The sense and antisense primers contained KpnI andXbaI sites in their 5′ ends, respectively. For deletion of the N-terminal portion, the sequence spanning nt 283–306 was included in respective sense primers to equalize the translation efficiency. For deletion of the C-terminal portion, a stop codon was included in antisense primers. Amplified fragments were digested withKpnI and XbaI and inserted into theKpnI-XbaI site of the pCMV vector. For GAL4 binding assays, various PCR-amplified OUT fragments corresponding to the amino acid sequences indicated in Fig.7 B were ligated in-frame downstream of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD, amino acids 1–147) in pEF-GAL4-DBD (a GAL4 DBD expression vector driven by the human elongation factor 1α promoter (58.Kanno T. Kanno Y. Chen L.F. Ogawa E. Kim W.Y. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (2254): 2444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) using appropriate restriction sites. As positive controls, we utilized pEF-BOS bsr/GAL4 KRAZ1 and pEF-BOS bsr/GAL4 KOX1 (59.Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The authenticity of plasmids constructed by PCR was verified by sequencing. NIH3T3 fibroblast and C2C12 myoblast cell lines were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection and provided by Shosei Yoshida (Kyoto University), respectively. They were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Dishes coated with type I collagen (IWAKI GLASS, Japan) were used to culture C2C12 cells. For the transient transfections, NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells were plated at densities of 5 × 104 cells/25-mm well and 5 × 104 cells/35-mm well, respectively, in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS 24 h before transfection. Transfections were performed by the lipofection method using TransIT-LT1™ (Pan Vera Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of DNA added to cells was adjusted to 1.2 μg/25-mm well and 2.0 μg/35-mm well by addition of appropriate empty vector. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed essentially as described previously (60.Hara E. Hall M. Peters G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).

RNA polymerase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 is a multisubunit enzyme consisting of the catalytic core (α2ββ′) and ς subunit. The β and β′ subunits contain several regions (from A to H in β′ and from A to I in β subunit) conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAPs (1.Allison L.A. Moyle M. Shales M. Ingles C.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2.Jokerst R.S. Weeks J.R. Zehring W.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This conservation permits a universal role for the homologous regions of the subunits in transcription. Initiation of transcription by RNAP is a complex process including several steps (3.Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4.Roe J.H. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A critical step is formation of an “open” binary complex between RNAP and promoter accompanied by “melting” of promoter DNA around the transcription start site (3.Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 5.deHaseth P.L. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The open complex is competent to initiate transcription upon the addition of nucleotide substrates. The driving forces and mechanism of the promoter melting are poorly understood. Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that regions 2.3 and 2.4 of the ς subunit participate in recognition of promoter consensus sequence 5′-TATAAT-3′ (−10 consensus) and promoter melting (6.Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 7.Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol.

Recently, the locations of the ς subunit conservative regions over the promoter DNA were mapped using cystein-tethered chemical nuclease (p-bromoacetamidobenzyl)-EDTA·Fe (10.Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is evident that the β and β′ subunits cooperate with ς in the process of open complex formation (11.Gragerov A.I. Kocherginskaya S.A. Larionov O.A. Kalyaeva E.S. Nikiforov V.G. Mol. Gen.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14572-14583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); however, which regions of β and β′ subunits are directly involved in this process is not shown. The available data indicate that the β′ subunit is involved in interactions of RNAP with DNA. Using UV-induced cross-links, it has been shown that the evolutionarily conservative region A of β′ containing the zinc finger participates in DNA binding and stabilization of the RNAP ternary complexes (15.Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1996; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Region C of the β′ subunit shows some homology with the DNA-binding domain of DNA polymerase I (1.Allison L.A. Moyle M. Shales M. Ingles C.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and exhibits nonspecific DNA binding capacity (16.Kontermann R.E. Kobor M. Bautz E.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cross-linking techniques are very effective tools for the identification of RNAP domains interacting with or positioned close to DNA in transcription complexes. Thus, the ς70 subunit interactions with the bases of the promoter DNA in open promoter complex were determined using photochemical cross-linking techniques (17.Simpson R.B. Cell. 1979; 18: 277-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18.Buckle M. Geiselmann J. Kolb A. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde cross-linking links atoms at the 2 Å distance (“one atom” cross-linking) and permits analysis of a different set of DNA-protein contacts than “zero-length” UV cross-linking (19.Kunkel G.R. Mehrabian M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cel. Biochem. 1981; 34: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde is widely used now for the in vivo studies of protein-DNA interactions in chromatin (20.Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated the possibility of using this technique for the mapping of the protein and DNA entities located in close contact in the RNAP-promoter complex. It was shown previously that two subunits of RNA polymerase could be cross-linked by formaldehyde to the nontemplate DNA strand of thelacUV5 promoter melted region in the open complex (21.Brodolin K.L. Studitsky V.M. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5748-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have identified these subunits as β′ and ς. The ς subunit regions involved in the interactions with promoter DNA were extensively studied, whereas the corresponding regions of the catalytic RNAP subunits are not defined. Therefore, we have attempted to map the region of the β′ subunit cross-linked to promoter DNA and have developed a new approach for mapping the DNA bases involved in formaldehyde cross-links using hydroxyl radicals. The methodology that we developed can be applied in studies of protein regions that interact with single-stranded DNA in different protein-DNA complexes. E. coli RNAP containing a His6 tag in the β′ subunit was isolated as described in Refs. 15.Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1996; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar and 22.Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar. RNAPs containing His6 tags in either the β′, β, or α subunit were assembled from individual subunits (23.Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recombinant RNAP containing a split β′ subunit was prepared as described previously (24.Severinov K. Mustaev A. Kukarin A. Muzzin O. Bass I. Darst SA. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27969-27974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid pET15ς, which expresses ς70 bearing an N-terminal His6 tag, was constructed by first destroying (by site-directed mutagenesis) the natural NdeI and XhoI sites in the clonedrpoD gene. The mutations did not change the protein sequence due to degeneracy of the genetic code. The rpoD gene was then amplified with primers containing artificial NdeI (5′ primer) and XhoI (3′ primer) sites and cloned in the appropriately treated pET15b (Novagene) plasmid. His6-tagged ς70 was expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells and purified from inclusion bodies by renaturation from 6m guanidine-HCl, followed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and MonoQ chromatography. The specific activity (measured as the ability to support promoter-dependent transcription) of the tagged protein did not differ from that of control, untagged protein. The 123- and 167-base pair lacUV5 promoter fragments were isolated from pGEM1 plasmid as described in Ref. 21.Brodolin K.L. Studitsky V.M. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5748-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar. DNA was 3′ end labeled by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, digested with HaeIII, and purified by gel electrophoresis. RNA polymerase (final concentration, 200 nm) and the lacUV5 promoter DNA fragment (final concentration, 25 nm) were mixed in 20 μl of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol (XLB)) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Formaldehyde (prepared from 37% stock (Aldrich)) was added to a concentration of 20 mm. The cross-linking reaction was carried out for 30 s and stopped by the addition of equal volume of the stop buffer (2% SDS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). If the cross-linking was followed by fractionation on Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen), the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 volumes of 10 m urea. 10 μl of Ni2+-NTA agarose was added and incubated for 40 min at 25 °C with gentle agitation. The resin was washed three times with 150 μl of XLB containing 7m urea. Bound cross-linking complexes were eluted in stop buffer and loaded on SDS-PAGE gels. Exonuclease mapping of protein-DNA cross-links was done as described (21.Brodolin K.L. Studitsky V.M. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5748-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) except that digestion was performed with 0.05–5 units of phage λ exonuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15 min at 30 °C. DNA was eluted and loaded onto 6% sequencing gels. Formaldehyde cross-linked complexes of β′ or ς subunits and 3′ end labeled lacUV5 promoter DNA were obtained after the cross-linking of 6 μg of RNAP. For the cleavage at Cys residues the His-tagged β′-DNA cross-linked complexes were purified on Ni2+-NTA agarose and then treated with NTCBA (25.Markovtsov V. Mustaev A. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) directly on the resin. Cleavage at Met residues with CNBr was performed as described (26.Grachev M.A. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. Abdukajumov M.N. Rabinov I.V. Richter V.I. Skoblov Yu.S. Chistyakov P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The cross-linked complexes were separated by 5% SDS-PAGE, and gel slices containing radioactive bands were cut out and placed in Eppendorf tubes. The gel slices were washed with 1 ml of distilled water three times, and the cross-linked complexes were eluted from the gel for 1.5 h in 0.5% SDS and precipitated with 4 volumes of cold acetone. The pellet was then dissolved in 1% SDS, 50 mmHCOOH-NaOH buffer, pH 4.0. Then, CNBr was added to 50 mmand incubated for 5–10 min at 23 °C. The products of all cleavage reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 6 μg of RNAP was cross-linked with lacUV5 promoter in 40 μl of XLB, and then SDS was added to 0.5% to terminate the reaction. The samples were passed through a Chromo-Spin 30 column (CLONTECH), and the reaction volume was adjusted to 50 μl with 0.5% SDS. Then, 6 μl each of 1 mm Fe-EDTA, 20 mm ascorbate, and 0.6% H2O2(27.Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) were added and incubated 4 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of glycerol to 10% and stop buffer, and the solution was immediately loaded on SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were autoradiographed, and the cross-linked complexes were cut off the gel. DNA was eluted and analyzed on an 8% sequencing gel. RNAP promoter complexes formed in 10 μl of XLB were incubated at the desired temperature and treated with 5 mm KMnO4for 30 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.5m potassium acetate and 1 mβ-mercaptoethanol. DNA was ethanol-precipitated, treated with 0.5m piperidine, and analyzed on 6% sequencing gel. Treatment of RNAP-lacUV5 promoter open complex at 37 °C with formaldehyde results in appearance of several protein-DNA cross-linked complexes having different electrophoretic mobilities. In a previous work (21.Brodolin K.L. Studitsky V.M. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5748-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), cross-linking was performed for a long time (10 min at 37 °C) at 33 mm formaldehyde. This resulted in “multiple-hit” conditions and, as a consequence, formation of several cross-linking sites per molecule and multiprotein cross-linked complexes. In order to avoid these events in the current work, we reduced the time of cross-linking to 30 s at a 20 mm concentration of formaldehyde. Under these conditions, only two protein-DNA complexes, containing one cross-linked subunit per DNA fragment, were formed (Fig. 1). Identification of the cross-linked species was performed by using Ni2+-NTA agarose purification. The complexes obtained after cross-linking of RNAP containing His6 tag in the β, β′, or α subunit were denatured and fractionated on the Ni2+-NTA agarose in the presence of 7 m urea (Fig. 1). Only cross-linked protein-DNA complexes with slow mobility formed by RNAP containing the His6 tag in β′ subunit were effectively retained on the resin. Small amounts of the cross-linked DNA were retained on the resin when His6 tag was located in other subunits of RNAP core. This can be attributed to nonspecific binding of denatured proteins to the resin. The result obtained shows directly that the slow mobility complex contains only the β′ subunit cross-linked to DNA, whereas the β and α subunits were not cross-linked. Identification of the ς subunit was performed by using holoenzyme reconstituted from the His-tagged core (His6 tag in β′ subunit) and the ς70 subunit containing an N-terminal His6 tag (Fig. 1). As a control, we used the His-tagged core reconstituted with the ς70 subunit without His6 tag. Fractionation of the complexes obtained after the cross-linking of the reconstituted holoenzyme containing His-tagged ς has shown that both β′ and ς cross-linked complexes were retained on the resin, whereas only β′ complex was retained on the resin if the ς subunit without His6 tag was used for holoenzyme reconstitution. This gave direct proof that the faster mobility complex is formed by the ς70 subunit cross-linked to DNA. To map the linear arrangement of cross-links on the DNA, we used phage λ exonuclease, which degrades DNA in the 5′ → 3′ direction and ceases the hydrolysis when it encounters a cross-linked protein (21.Brodolin K.L. Studitsky V.M. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5748-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cross-linked complexes of the β′ or ς subunit and end-labeled promoter DNA were separated by SDS-PAGE, excised from the gel, and treated with λ exonuclease. Subsequently, cross-links were reversed by heating, and the DNA fragments were analyzed on a sequencing gel (Fig. 2). In the case of the β′ subunit, the major exonuclease stops appeared at positions −8, −7, −6, and −5 of the nontemplate DNA strand, as was reported previously (21.Brodolin K.L. Studitsky V.M. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5748-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the case of the ς subunit, exonuclease terminates at positions −9, −8, and −7, which leads to a prediction that cross-linking sites may be located between positions −7 and −3. Moreover, we have observed exonuclease stops between positions −7 and +15 on the template DNA strand for both subunits (Fig. 2 c). Because these stops were dispersed over a wide region and were not observed previously, we doubt that they reflect cross-links with the template DNA strand. To test this, we performed titration of cross-linked complexes with different amounts of exonuclease (Fig. 2,b and c). The exonuclease stops at positions −8 to −5 of the nontemplate strand accumulated and finally were the only ones observed. Some minor exonuclease stops (for example, those observed at positions +6 or −50) have disappeared. In contrast, the exonuclease stops on the template DNA strand progressively disappeared when the amount of exonuclease was increased. Therefore, we concluded that cross-links are localized only on nontemplate DNA strand, and the stopping of exonuclease on template strand was also due to these cross-links. Such behavior can be explained by structure of λ exonuclease, which holds both DNA strands during reaction (28.Kovall R. Matthews B.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). At a high concentration of exonuclease, the partially digested DNA duplexes can be destabilized, and the subsequently released template DNA strand can be completely digested with λ exonuclease, which can degrade single-stranded DNA (29.Sriprakash K.S. Lundh N. Huh M.M.-O. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5438-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion of the nontemplate DNA strand is blocked by cross-linked protein. Therefore, if there are any cross-links with template DNA strand, these cross-links represent a minor fraction. There are also exonuclease stops located close to the DNA fragment ends observed on non-cross-linked DNA, which could be a result of stalling of the exonuclease at the DNA fragment ends. For precise mapping of cross-links, we performed hydroxyl radical footprinting. The cross-linked complexes were treated with Fe-EDTA in the presence of SDS and separated by SDS-PAGE afterward (Fig.3). We expected that DNA retarded in cross-linked complexes would not be cleaved at the site of cross-linking and that these sites could be identified with single base precision. Surprisingly, we observed the extended protection over both DNA strands at the place of the cross-links. The cross-linked β′ subunit protects DNA backbone from position −5 to +2, with maximum protection at positions −3 and +2. The cross-linked ς subunit has a more extended protected region, from −6 to +2, with maximum protection at −5 and −3. Thus, the cross-linked protein is closely positioned to the DNA backbone of both strands near the cross-linked site. We propose that the bases with maximum protection are likely to represent cross-linking sites. Thus, the major site of cross-linking of β′ is −3 thymine, and the second site is probably located at position +2. For the ς subunit, probable sites are −5 and −3 thymines. We have investigated the functional relation of the cross-links formed by formaldehyde. Cross-linking of the RNAP-promoter complexes formed at 0, 14, and 37 °C has shown that cross-links correlate with formation of open complex, as was monitored by potassium permanganate footprinting. No cross-links were observed in closed complex (Fig. 4). Therefore, a complete melting of the −10 region is required for establishing the specific open complex conformation competent for cross-linking. It is known that core RNAP interacts with promoter fragments nonspecifically (30.deHaseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1612-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We have not detected any cross-links between core RNAP and promoter at 37 °C (data not shown). These results confirm our conclusion that formaldehyde cross-links reflect specific interactions of RNAP with promoter in open complex. It was shown that recombinant RNAP containing the β′ subunit reconstituted from the N-terminal (residues 1–875) and C-terminal fragments (residues 850–1407) is functional (24.Severinov K. Mustaev A. Kukarin A. Muzzin O. Bass I. Darst SA. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27969-27974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We used this RNAP to identify which part of the β′ subunit was cross-linked to the promoter. The electrophoretic mobility of the β′-subunit N-terminal fragment in SDS-PAGE is slower than that of the ς subunit, whereas the C-terminal fragment runs faster than the ς subunit. Cross-linking of this recombinant RNAP with promoter results in the appearance of a cross-linked complex (containing the β′ subunit fragment) with mobility faster than that of the full-length β′-DNA complex but slower than that of the ς-DNA complex (Fig.5 a). Therefore, we have concluded that cross-links are located between the N terminus and residue 850 of the β′ subunit. To map the region of the β′ subunit cross-linked to DNA precisely, we employed approaches used previously for the mapping of protein-RNA contacts (25.Markovtsov V. Mustaev A. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26.Grachev M.A. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. Abdukajumov M.N. Rabinov I.V. Richter V.I. Skoblov Yu.S. Chistyakov P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thermolability of formaldehyde cross-linking puts some limitations upon the mapping method. The cross-linked complexes cannot be heated; therefore, denaturation of some protein domains may not be complete, hereby reducing the cleavage efficiency at some sites. Moreover, a 123-base pair DNA fragment cross-linked to a protein adds ∼80 kDa to the mobility of the peptide; therefore, the standard molecular weight markers previously used for the determination of the molecular weight of the cleavage products are not directly applicable. However, the Cys-specific cleavage patterns of the β′ subunit labeled at either the C or the N terminus are well distinguished because of the asymmetric distribution of the Cys residues over the β′ polypeptide (Fig. 5 c). The β′-DNA complexes obtained after cross-linking of the RNAP containing His6 tag in β′ subunit and radiolabeled lacUV5 promoter fragment were purified on Ni2+-NTA agarose and treated with NTCBA under single-hit conditions to obtain the Cys-specific cleavage. As a marker, we used β′ subunit labeled with rifampicin-GpCpT* (31.Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Markovtsov V. Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6641-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) at the C terminus (Fig. 5 b) and treated with NTCBA under the same conditions as cross-linked β′. Identification of the peptides rests on the assumption that molecular mass of cross-linked DNA fragment makes the same contribution to the electrophoretic mobility of all peptides. Therefore, the cleavage pattern of the cross-linked subunit should be the same as the cleavage pattern of the non-cross-linked subunit but shifted upward to a larger molecular weight. Indeed, in the case of cross-linked β′, we observed the same ladder of four bands seen in the control lane, which can be derived only from the cleavages at positions 366, 454, 517, and 608 (Fig. 5 b). However, this pattern could be generated if the cross-link is localized at the C terminus or at the N terminus. We did not observe the C-terminal products of cleavages at Cys814 and Cys869–Cys898 observed in the marker lane, whereas the corresponding N-terminal products migrating close to full-length β′ subunit were visible. Consequently, the peptide with the faster mobility corresponds to the C-terminal product of cleavage at Cys608 or N-terminal product of cleavage at Cys366. Because we had already localized the cross-link at the N-terminal side from position 850, it must be positioned either at the middle of the β′ polypeptide (between Cys608 and Cys814) or between the N terminus and Cys366. The localization of the cross-link in the middle of β′ is unfeasible because this would result in an overlapping of N- and C-terminal patterns, which was not observed in our case. These observations allow to conclude that the cross-link is positioned between the Cys366 and N terminus. In order to strengthen our conclusion, we estimated the molecular mass of the cross-linked complexes (Table I) and of β′ subunit complex (∼240 kDa) on the basis of C-terminal marker ladder (Fig.5 b, lane M). Consequently, we estimate the contribution of DNA fragment as 85 kDa, which is close to expected molecular mass for the 123-base pair double-stranded DNA fragment (77.5 kDa) (Fig. 5 b). Subtraction of the DNA molecular mass from the observed molecular mass of the cross-linked protein-DNA complexes gives the expected molecular mass of cross-linked peptides (Table I). The C-terminal product of the cleavage at Cys608 has a predicted molecular mass of 86 kDa, which is much higher than estimated molecular mass of the shortest cross-linked peptide (∼33 kDa); therefore, this peptide can correspond only to N-terminal product of Cys366 cleavage (42 kDa). This gives the localization of cross-link between Cys366 and the next Cys residue, at position 198.Table IMolecular mass of Cys-cleavage peptidesPosition of Cys residuePredicted mass of C-terminal peptidePredicted mass of N-terminal peptidesObserved mass of cross-linked complexesSubtracted mass of cross-linked peptideskDa36611242118334541035214055517965914560608866916883 Open table in a new tab The location of the cross-links was further narrowed down by single-hit cleavage at Met residues with CNBr. The cleavage was performed under mild conditions at pH 4.0, because the formaldehyde cross-links were not stable at pH 2.0, used for standard cleavage with CNBr. This change in pH does not affect the cleavage efficiency at Met residues in the protein. 2K. Brodolin, unpublished results. The β′-DNA cross-linked complexes were treated with CNBr, and the products of cleavage were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.6). To estimate the molecular mass of the produced peptides, the cross-linked β′-DNA complexes treated with NTCBA were used as molecular mass markers. This method of calculation provides a good approximation of the observed masses. The peptide with the highest mobility has a molecular mass of around 25.7 ± 1.7 kDa and can correspond to the N-terminal peptide produced after cleavage at Met237 (∼27.5 kDa). The next cleavage site, Met192, is located outside the cross-linked region defined by Cys-specific mapping. Therefore, we have concluded that the cross-link is localized between Met237 and Cys198. Available data support the assumption that RNAP is involved in base-specific interactions with the single-stranded DNA of the promoter melted region (7.Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18.Buckle M. Geiselmann J. Kolb A. Buc H.

Formaldehyde cross-linking is an effective method for the study of protein regions involved in these interactions. Formaldehyde reacts with the amino and imino groups of the DNA bases, which can be involved in hydrogen bond contacts with protein (19.Kunkel G.R. Mehrabian M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cel. Biochem. 1981; 34: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34.McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1281-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35.McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The chemistry of formaldehyde predicts that thymine bases that are primary sites of formaldehyde reaction on single-stranded DNA are likely candidates for cross-linking. In the open complex the lacUV5 promoter is melted at positions −11 to +4 (36.Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that β′ and ς subunits cross-link within positions −5 to +2 of nontemplate DNA strand in open complex, whereas no cross-links appeared in closed complex. There are only two thymines in position −5 and −3, which can be involved in cross-linking (Fig. 7). The role of this promoter region, located between the −10 consensus and transcription start, is not defined. It is known that base-specific interactions of RNAP with the nontemplate DNA strand of the −10 consensus are important for open complex formation and stability (33.Roberts C.W. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It was proposed that conservative regions 2.3 and 2.4 of the ς subunit are responsible for these interactions (7.Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8.Aiyar S.E. Juang Y.-L. Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11501-11506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9.Juang Y.-L. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1470-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cross-linking and chemical footprinting studies support this assumption (10.Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18.Buckle M. Geiselmann J. Kolb A. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37.Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, some evidence indicates that there are additional components of holoenzyme and promoter that are responsible for the formation of the heparin resistant open complex. In particular, mutations in region 2.3, which affect the formation of open complex, did not impair the ability of RNAP to form heparin-resistant complex on bubble template (8.Aiyar S.E. Juang Y.-L. Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11501-11506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Laser UV cross-linking detects close contacts between ς subunit and positions −5 and −3 of lacUV5 promoter nontemplate strand (18.Buckle M. Geiselmann J. Kolb A. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our data directly show that not only the ς but also the β′ subunit may be involved in interactions with nontemplate DNA strand of this promoter region. Recently, it was shown that interaction of the core component of holoenzyme with the bases from −7 to +1 of the “fork junction” template DNA strand may be responsible for heparin resistant complex formation (38.Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have not detect any cross-links with the template DNA strand. This can be explained by the difference in structure of the “native” RNAP complex containing complete promoter and of the complex with synthetic fork junction construction. An alternative explanation is the absence of cross-linkable groups in contacting regions of RNAP and DNA. Interestingly, the depurination or prenicking at the positions from −8 to −4 of template DNA strand of prmup-1Δ265 promoter (which can facilitate formation of contacts with the nontemplate strand) strongly stimulates open complex formation (39.Li X.-Y. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23558-23566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Along with these results, our data suggest that specificity of interactions of RNAP with the promoter melted region can be a result of cooperative action of ς and β′ subunits. We have mapped the region of the β′ subunit involved in these interactions to the N-terminal segment (Cys198–Met237), which overlaps with the left edge of the evolutionary conserved region B (residues 233–254) (Fig.7). This region has not been previously implicated in any particular biochemical functions. Analysis of the β′ subunit sequences from different species has shown that this region contains two conserved aromatic residues (Phe227 and Trp236) that may be involved in intercalation or stacking with single-stranded DNA (9.Juang Y.-L. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1470-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,40.Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 41.Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal part of the cross-linked region adjacent to region B is enriched in basic amino acids that form DNA binding surface in single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (40.Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 42.Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). If the cross-linked region is involved in protein-DNA interactions, we would expect that the mutations in this region affect the process of open complex formation or its stability. Consistent with this notion is the finding that a deletion of basic residues 215–220 adjacent to the B region affects isomerization of closed to open complex onrrnB1 promoter (13.Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Previously, using formaldehyde cross-linking, preferential formation of the β′-ς cross-links in the RNAP holoenzyme had been shown (21.Brodolin K.L. Studitsky V.M. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5748-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the cross-linked regions were not identified. The crystal structure of ς70 proteolytic fragment (43.Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) have shown that the melting domain (region 2.3), contacting the −10 consensus, and “core binding” domain (region 2.1 (44.Lesley S.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7728-7734Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)) are located closely in space facing the opposite sides of the structure. Our data have shown that ς subunit is cross-linked near the −10 consensus of the promoter, adjacent to the cross-linking site of β′ subunit; therefore, we predict that the core binding domain of ς is involved in protein-protein interaction with the region adjacent to the conservative region B of β′ subunit. This suggestion is supported by the finding that segment 260–309, adjacent to the cross-linked region of the β′ subunit (residues 198–237), represents the binding site for the ς subunit (45.Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31381-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). Using the chemical nuclease (p-bromoacetamidobenzyl)-EDTA·Fe, the ς subunit region 2 was shown to be proximal to the β′ subunit segment localized between regions B and C (46.Owens J.T. Miyake R. Murakami K. Chmura A.J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6021-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the core binding region 2.1 was located in proximity to positions −4 to +3 of the lacUV5 promoter open complex (10.Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Together with these results, the results of our study predict that the ς subunit can direct the correct positioning of the RNAP catalytic center during open complex formation via the interactions with the β′ subunit.

We found that a PS2 mutant (Del3) with a 20-amino acid deletion was not endoproteolytically processed, while other PS2s with amino acid substitutions and short deletions were cleaved. Overproduction of all the mutant proteins led to a compensatory decrease of endogenous PS1 fragments, but did not affect the amyloid β peptide X-42/Aβ X-40 ratio without the familial Alzheimer's disease mutation. The Del3 mutant did not exhibit significant deficits in γ-secretase activity. The turnover rate of the Del3 holoprotein was the same as that of full-length PS2. These data suggest that the determinants of the PS2 cleavage site reside within a large region and that the pathological function of PS2 is exerted by familial Alzheimer's disease mutations not related to the cleavage of holoproteins. We also found that PS2 with an 18-amino acid deletion at the C-terminal end was not processed. Its overexpression led neither to diminished accumulation of endogenous PS1 fragments nor to increased production of amyloid β peptide X-42.

Therefore, it is proposed that these heterodimers consisting of NTF and CTF are functional units of PSs. Interestingly, PS1ΔE10 has a longer half-life than that of full-length PS1, although it does not undergo endoproteolytic processing because of the lack of the cleavage region. In addition, the overexpression of PS1ΔE10 causes a compensatory decrease of endogenous presenilins and it is incorporated into the high molecular weight complex (17.Borchelt D.R. Thinakaran G.

These data indicate that the processing step of full-length PSs, including the stabilization, endoproteolytic cleavage and the formation of the heterodimer, plays a key role in producing pathological forms, although the possibility cannot be excluded that the cleavage of holoprotein is not essential to form functional PSs. In the present study, we investigated the nature and specificity of the endoproteolytic processing of PS2 and its relation to the pathological function using mutants with amino acid substitutions and deletions around the cleavage site. Our data indicate that the proteolytic cleavage of PS2 at Lys306/Leu307 does not depend on amino acid sequence and that overexpression of any mutant PS2s has no effect on Aβ X-42/Aβ X-40 ratio without the N141I FAD mutation. We also found that the integrity of the C-terminal end of PS2 is a prerequisite for its entry into the processing pathway. The PS2-pCEP4 was constructed by ligation of full-length human PS2 cDNA into thePvuII site of an expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), as reported previously (36.Shirotani K. Takahashi K. Ozawa K. Kunishita T. Tabira T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutations at the cleavage site of PS2 (K306A, K306E, KL/AP, and MAK/3A) were introduced using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The DNA fragments with these mutations were excised with NotI andHindIII, and ligated into theNotI/HindIII-digested PS2-pCEP4. For constructing Del1, 5′ and 3′ regions encompassing amino acid residues 46–303 and 310–384 were separately amplified from PS2 cDNAs by PCR using primer pairs 5′-CAGTGGAGAAGCCAGGAGAAC GAGG-3′/5′-CCGGATCCAACCGTCCACACCATGGCAGATG-3′ for the 5′ region and 5′-CCGGATCCTCTCAGGGTGCCCTCCAGC-3′/5′-TCAGTCCCCGCTGCCCGTGGCAG-3′ for the 3′ region, respectively. The PCR product was subcloned into the SmaI site of pUC18 and sequenced. The DNA fragments corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ regions were excised withNotI/BamHI andBamHI/HindIII, respectively, and were ligated into the NotI/HindIII-digested PS2-pCEP4, resulting in Del1 cDNA lacking residues 304–309. Del2 and Del3 were constructed by similar procedures using the primer pairs 5′- CAGTGG AGAAGCCAGGAGAACGAGG -3′/5′-CCGTCGACCATGGCAGATGAGTATAT CAGGGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCCGGGGCCCTCCAGCTCCCCTACGACCC-3′/5′-TCAGTCCCCGCTGCCCGTGGCAG-3′ for Del2 and 5′-CAGTGGAGAAGCCAGGAGAACGAGG-3′/5′-CCTCGCGATGAGTATATCAGGGAGGGAATAT-3′ and 5′-CCCAGCTGCCCTACGACCCGGAGATGGAAGAA-3′/5′-TCAGTCCCCGCTGCCCGTGGCAG-3′ for Del3, respectively. After subcloning the PCR products into the pUC18 vector, the 5′- and 3′-DNA fragments were excised with eitherNotI/HincII andSmaI/HindIII or NotI/Nru I and PvuII/HindIII, and ligated into theNotI/HindIII-digested PS2-pCEP4, resulting in Del2 and Del3 lacking residues 300–312 and 297–316, respectively. PS2HA was constructed as follows; a BglII site was engineered into the 3′ end of a coding region of PS2 by PCR amplification of CTF (307–488) using the primer pair 5′-GGGACTAGTGACCATGATTACGAATTCGAGCTC-3′/5′-CCCAGATCTGATGTAGAGCTGATGGGAGGCCA-3′ from PS2CTF-pUC18. After cloning of the PCR product into pUC18 (pCTF-BglII), a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-GATCTTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTTAATCT AGAGG-3′/5′-CCTCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAA-3′) encoding the hemagglutinin epitope sequence (YPYDVPDYA) was ligated into theBglII/HincII-digested pCTF-BglII. The resulting PS2CTFHA-pUC18 was excised withHindIII/XbaI and subcloned into theHindIII/XhoI-digested PS2-pCEP4, resulting in PS2HA-pCEP4. PS2–430 cDNA was prepared by amplification of the CTF encompassing residues 307–430 using the primer pair 5′-CAGGGCTATGCTGGACCCCTCCTCTCAGG-3′/5′-TCACGTGGAGAAGTAAAAGATGAGCC-3′. The cDNA was subcloned into pUC18, excised withHindIII, and ligated into the HindIII-fragment of PS2-pCEP4, resulting in PS2–430 cDNA encoding residues 1–430. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell lines were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable cell lines were obtained by transfection of corresponding cDNAs into SH-SY5Y cells using the calcium phosphate method and selection with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (36.Shirotani K. Takahashi K.

The rabbit polyclonal antibodies Ab111 and Ab333 were raised against glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins encompassing residues 271–407 of PS1 and 277–387 of PS2, respectively, and have been characterized previously (36.Shirotani K.

PS1N62 and PS2N53 were mouse monoclonal antibodies against glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins encompassing residues 1–70 of PS1 and 1–71 of PS2, and showed similar reactivity to that of previously characterized Ab444 and Ab555C antibodies, respectively (36.Shirotani K.

Cells were lysed in solution A (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was subjected to Western blot analysis (36.Shirotani K. Takahashi K. Ozawa K. Kunishita T. Tabira T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 6 cm-dishes and incubated in methionine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After 20 min, cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 1 h and chased for appropriate time in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Lysates were prepared as described above and precleared with protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of PS2N53 antibody and protein G-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in a solution A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and heated at 60 °C for 10 min in a sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and analyzed with a BioImaging BAS5000 analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were plated on 12-well plates and incubated in DMEM/F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Culture medium was collected and subjected to BNT77/BA27 and BNT77/BC05 sandwich ELISAs to quantify Aβ X-40 and Aβ X-42, respectively (39.Suzuki N. Tobun T. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To determine the nature and specificity of endoproteolytic cleavage, we constructed two series of PS2 cDNAs with mutations around the cleavage site (Fig.1). The first series (K306A, K306E, KL/AP, and MAK/3A) had substitutions with either an alanine, a glutamic acid or a proline residue for a lysine residue and its neighbors, since the lysine is suggestive of a possible trypsin-like specificity. The second mutants had deletions (6, 13, and 20 amino acid residues) around the native cleavage site. Expression and cleavage of mutant PS2 proteins were determined in stable cell lines transfected with these cDNAs using antibodies specific for PS2NTF and PS2CTF (PS2N53 and Ab333, respectively). We also monitored levels of NTF and CTF of endogenous PS1 using antibodies of PS1N62 and Ab111 to evaluate the ability of mutant proteins for entry into the processing pathway. In cells transfected with PS2WT and PS2N141I (referred to as PS2WT and PS2N141I cells), PS2 polypeptides were detected as a 55-kDa band for the full-length protein, a 35-kDa band for PS2NTF, and a 23-kDa band for PS2CTF (Fig. 2 A,top and bottom panels,lanes 2–4). Amounts of these bands increased in PS2WT and PS2N141I cells, as compared with cells transfected with the pCEP4 vector alone (referred to as pCEP4 cells; Fig. 2 A,lane 1), while overproduction of exogenous PS2 diminished the levels of endogenous PS1NTF and CTF (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2–4), as described previously (34.Shirotani K. Takahashi K. Tabira T. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 262: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Similarly, stable cells transfected with the first series of mutant cDNAs (K306A, K306E, KL/AP, and MAK/3A cells) showed increased amounts of the full-length polypeptides, NTF and CTF (Fig.2 A, top and bottom panels,lanes 5–12), and decreased levels of endogenous PS1NTF and CTF (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5–12). The sizes of the PS2 fragments were indistinguishable from native fragments, indicating that these mutant PS2s were endoproteolytically cleaved at or near the original cleavage site. Thus, the MAKL sequence around the cleavage site is not a critical determinant for the proteolytic processing. In stable cells expressing the second mutants (Del1-Del3 cells, Fig.2 C, top panel, lanes 3–16), increased amounts of full-length proteins, which migrated slightly faster than full-length PS2 (Fig. 2 C,top panel, lane 2), and decreased levels of endogenous PS1 fragments (Fig. 2 D) were also observed. The level of endogenous PS2CTF (23 kDa) was decreased in Del2 and Del3 cells (Fig. 2 C, bottom panel, lanes 7–16), indicating that processing of endogenous PS2 was diminished. However, amounts and sizes of processed NTFs and CTFs varied among different mutant cells (Fig.2 C, top and bottom panels,lanes 3–16). In the cases of Del3 cell lines, no band corresponding to PS2CTF was found. In contrast, several faint bands with sizes ranging from 35 to 38 kDa were detected by an antibody specific for PS2NTF in three cell lines that expressed full-length proteins more abundantly (Fig. 2 C, lanes 12–14). The 38-kDa band may represent a cleaved product by the caspase family, because its level was induced after treatment with staurosporine (not shown), an activator of caspases (41.Kim T.-W. Pettingel W.H. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 42.Grunberg J. Walter J. Loetscher H. Deuschle U. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2263-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Other bands are likely to be degrading intermediates by proteasome, since amounts of those bands greatly increased by treatment with lactacystin (data not shown), which is a potent inhibitor of proteasome. Thus, Del3 protein, similar to PS1ΔE10, does not undergo endoproteolytic processing despite its ability to compete with endogenous PS1 and PS2 for the cellular factor(s), which is predicted to be involved in the stabilization and the endoproteolytic cleavage of presenilin holoprotein (24.Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PS2CTFs in Del1 were detected mainly as doublet bands at 22.5 and 23 kDa, and PS2CTF in Del2 cells was observed as a band with 21.5 kDa, while the sizes of NTFs were not apparently changed. The decreases of molecular weight for Del1 and Del2 CTFs (loss of 0.5 and 1.5 kDa) were roughly consistent with the size of the deletions (6 and 13 amino acids, respectively). It is also noted that similar results were obtained for mutant PS2s with the N141I FAD mutation, indicating that the introduction of the FAD mutation did not affect levels or sizes of NTF and CTF. We investigated whether amino acid substitutions or deletions would affect the pathological generation of Aβ42. Fig.3 (A and B) shows the ratio of amyloid β species (Aβ X-42/Aβ X-40) in media from stable cell lines. As described previously (34.Shirotani K. Takahashi K. Tabira T. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 262: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the ratio in PS2N141I cells was 8–9 times higher than those in pCEP4 or PS2WT cells (Fig.3 A). This Aβ42-promoting activity was not observed for all mutants with amino acid substitutions or deletions around the cleavage site, unless they harbored the N141I mutation. In contrast, in cases of PS2s with the N141I mutation, levels of Aβ X-42 promotion varied significantly. K306A, K306E, KL/AP, and MAK/3A mutants with the N141I mutation could increase the Aβ X-42/Aβ X-40 ratio as effectively as PS2N141I (Fig. 3 A), while Del1, Del2, and Del3 with the FAD mutation showed decreased Aβ42-promoting activity with increasing sizes of deletion (Fig. 3 B). As compared with PS2N141I cells, the average of Aβ X-42/Aβ X-40 ratio was 72% for Del1N141I, 46% for Del2N141I, and 36% for Del3N141I. The different Aβ42-promoting activity among PS2 mutants was not due to the expression level of the PS2 holoprotein, since the highest amount of full-length form was detected in"

Results indicate that two regions, one central region between residues 515 and 842 and the other COOH-terminal proximal region downstream from residue 1141, are involved in binding the α2β complex; and the NH2-terminal proximal region between residues 201 and 345 plays a major role in binding the ς70 subunit. However, both α2β binding sites have weak activity of the ς70 subunit; likewise, the ς70 subunit-contact surface has weak binding activity of the α2β complex. The sites involved in the catalytic function of RNA polymerization are all located within two spacer regions sandwiched between these three subunit-subunit contact surfaces. polymerase chain reaction nitrilotriacetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The RNA polymerase holoenzyme of Escherichia coli is composed of the core enzyme with the subunit composition of α2ββ′ and one of seven different species of the ς subunit (for review, see Ref. 1.Ishihama A. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Vol. 11. Mechanism of Transcription. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 53-70Google Scholar). The core enzyme carries the catalytic activities for RNA polymerization, but the ς subunit is required for promoter recognition and transcription initiation from the promoters. The core enzyme is assembled sequentially both in vitro andin vivo under the order: 2α → α2 → α2β → α2ββ′ (premature core) → E (active core) (for review, see Ref. 2.Ishihama A. Adv. Biophys. 1981; 14: 1-35PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies indicated that the subunit-subunit contact sites on α including the sites for α dimerization and the contact sites with the β and β′ subunits are all located within the amino (NH2)-terminal domain down to residue 235 (3.Hayward R.S.

Fujita N. Ishihama A. Kyogoku Y. Science. 1995; 270: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); the structure of the α NH2-terminal domain was determined by x-ray crystallography (9.Zhang G. Darst S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the two domains are connected by a long flexible linker (10.Jeon Y.H. Yamazaki T. Otomo T. Ishihama A. Kyogoku Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Detailed mapping of the α-α, α-β, and α-β′ contact sites on the α subunit have been carried out by making a number of contact-defective α mutants with deletion, insertion, and Ala substitution mutations (11.Kimura M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12.Kimura M. Ishihama A. J. Mol.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or by mapping the cleavage sites in α by a chemical protease conjugated at various positions of the α subunit (15.Miyake R. Murakami K. Owens J.T. Greiner D.P. Ozoline O.N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1344-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the contrary, relatively little is known on the subunit-subunit contact sites on the two large subunits, β and β′. The mapping of α subunit contact sites on the β subunit was carried out using two approaches: analysis of the proteolytic cleavage pattern of the unassembled free β subunit and the intermediate subassembly α2β complex (16.Wang Y. Severinov K. Loizos N. Fenyö D. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 648-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17.Nomura T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and analysis of complex formation between various β fragments and the hexahistidine (His6)-tagged α subunit or between various His6-tagged β fragments and the intact α subunit (17.Nomura T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The results altogether indicate that the primary and tight contact site of the α subunit is located in the central portion of the β polypeptide (16.Wang Y. Severinov K. Loizos N. Fenyö D. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 648-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17.Nomura T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); but in addition, the COOH-terminal proximal region is needed as the secondary and probable regulatory site for either efficient binding of the α subunit or stabilization of α-β contact (17.Nomura T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All of the β fragment-α binary complexes isolated were able to bind the β′ subunit, leading to formation of pseudo-core complexes, suggesting that the β′ subunit contact site(s) on the β subunit is(are) located near the α contact sites. In addition to contact with two core subunits, α and β′, the β subunit seems to interact with the ς subunit at its COOH-terminal proximal region (18.Glass R.E. Honda A. Ishihama A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 203: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At present, our knowledge of the location of subunit-subunit contact sites on the β′ subunit is limited. The isolated β′ subunit is able to form binary complexes with the ς70 subunit (19.Fukuda R. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 87: 523-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The contact site of the ς70 subunit on β′ has been analyzed using different methods. (i) The assay of ς70 subunit binding to pseudo-core enzymes containing various β′ fragments indicates that the deletion mutant β′ lacking amino acid residues 201–477 is unable to bind to the ς70 subunit (20.Luo J. Sharif K.A. Jin R. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Krakow J.S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). (ii) A short β′ fragment containing residues 260–309 forms complexes with ς70, as measured by co-immobilization assay using His6-tagged β′ fragments (21.Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31381-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). (iii) Essentially the same NH2-terminal proximal region of β′ is cleaved by a chemical protease conjugated to ς70 (22.Owens J.T. Miyake R. Murakami K. Chmura A.J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6021-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The isolated β and β′ subunits do not form stable binary complexes under isolated states (19.Fukuda R. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 87: 523-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but these two subunits contact each other in the assembled RNA polymerase, suggesting that the α subunit plays a role in supporting the contact between the β and β′ subunits. In the assembled core enzyme, one α subunit contacts the β subunit while the other α makes direct contact with the β′ subunit (23.Ishihama A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1250-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we tried to map the subunit-subunit contact sites on the β′ subunit with not only the ς70 subunit but also the α2β complex using two approaches. First, limited proteolysis by trypsin was carried out to generate β′ fragments for analysis of protease-sensitive sites exposed on the unassembled free β′ subunit. To identify the subunit-subunit contact sites on β′, the tryptic fragments were tested for complex formation with preformed α2β complex or purified ς70 subunit. For detailed mapping, various β′ fragments with or without the His6 tag were expressed, purified, and analyzed for complex formation with the α2β complex and the ς70 subunit. Results indicate that the NH2-terminal proximal region between residues 201 and 345 is central for binding of the ς70 subunit, and at least two regions between 515 and 842, and 1141 and 1407 are involved in binding of the α2β complex. Plasmid pGETC for expression of the intact β′ subunit was constructed in two steps. First, pGETBC containing both the β and β′ subunit genes (rpoBC) was treated with NheI and MluI to remove the entire β subunit coding sequence and a short NH2-terminal proximal sequence of the β′ subunit. The missing region of rpoC was prepared by PCR1 using pGETBC as template and two primers, 5′-AGCGGATTGTGCTAGCTCCGGCTCGAGTTTGTCC-3′ and 5′-GCCTTCGATAACCACATAGG-3′, and ligated, after treatment withNheI and MluI, with the pGETBC fragment carrying the sequence for NH2-terminal truncated rpoC.The resulting plasmid pGETC(+N) produced the β′ subunit with an additional peptide of MASSDGSKS sequence at the NH2terminus because of the presence of ATG codon on the vector (as a part of the NdeI site) near the junction with the rpoCinsert (note that the original initiation codon for the β′ subunit is GTG (24.Ovchinnikov Y.A. Monastyrskaya G.S. Gubanov V.V. Guryev S.O. Salomatia I.S. Shuvaeva T.M. Lipkin V.M. Sverdlov E.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 4035-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). To remove this NH2-terminal extra sequence, an additionalNdeI site was introduced at the initiation codon ofrpoC by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of pGETC(+N). The resulting plasmid was digested with NdeI to isolate three fragments, two of which are religated to prepare plasmid pGETC encoding the intact β′ subunit without the extra sequence. For construction of expression plasmids for various β′ fragments, we first constructed a modified expression vector pGET1 from pGET by removing one of two NdeI sites, located upstream of the f1 replication origin. The intact rpoC gene was inserted into this plasmid between XbaI and HindIII to construct pGET1C (Fig. 1). Various kinds of rpoC fragment were synthesized by PCR using a set of 5′ (C501–508) and 3′ (C301–313) primers (for the location of the primer sequences, see Fig. 1). The PCR-amplified CP fragments (PCR fragments of rpo C ) (for the location of each CP fragment along the rpoC gene, see Fig. 1) were treated with various restriction enzymes as shown in Table I, and the resulting CF fragments (fragments of rpo C ) were cloned into pGET1C or its shorter derivative between the respective restriction sites (for the location of each CF fragment along therpoC gene, see Fig. 1).Table IConstruction of expression plasmids for β′ fragmentsPlasmid constructedVector usedRestriction sitesaThe vectors used were treated with the indicated restriction enzymes; the DNA fragments for expression of β′ fragments carried the indicated restriction enzyme sites at termini.Primers usedFragments insertedpGETC(1–842)pGET1CKpnI-BamHIC502 /C304CF03pGETC(1–345)pGET1CNruI-BamHIC502 /C303CF05pGETC(1–150)pGET1CNdeI-BamHIC502 /C308CF06pGETC(151–345)pGET1CNdeI-BamHIC507 /C303CF08pGETC(201–515)pGETC(346–515)NdeI-EcoRVC508 /C306CF10pGETC(201–345)pGET1CNdeI-BamHIC508 /C303CF12pGETC(346–842)pGET1C(1–842)NdeI-AgeICF21pGETC(346–515)pGET1CNdeI-BamHIC503 /C306CF16pGETC(515–842)pGETC(1–842)NdeI-SphIC504 /C304CF17pGETC(842–1407)pGET1CNdeI-BalIC501 /C302CF18pGETC(842–1140)pGETC(842–1407)MluI-BamHIC502 /C305CF01pGETC(1141–1407)pGET1CNdeI-Bst1107IC505 /C301CF19pGETC-CH6pGET1CSacII-BamHIC505 /C301CF20pGETC(1–842)-CH6pGET1CKpnI-BamHIC503 /C310CF15pGETC(1–345)-CH6pGET1CNruI-BamHIC506 /C312CF13pGETC(1–150)-CH6pGET1CNdeI-BamHIC502 /C311CF07pGETC(151–345)-CH6pGET1CNdeI-BamHIC507 /C313CF09pGETC(201–515)-CH6pGETC(346–515)-CH6NdeI-EcoRVC506 /C309CF11pGETC(201–345)-CH6pGET1CNdeI-BamHIC506 /C313CF14pGETC(346–842)-CH6pGETC(346–842)KpnI-BamHIC503 /C310CF15pGETC(346–515)-CH6pGETC(346–515)EcoRV-BamHIC502 /C309CF04pGETC(515–842)-CH6pGETC(515–842)KpnI-BamHIC503 /C310CF15pGETC(842–1407)-CH6pGETC-CH6NdeI-Bst1107ICF22pGETC(842–1140)-CH6pGETC(842–1407)-CH6MluI-BamHIC502 /C307CF02pGETC(1141–1407)-CH6pGETC-CH6NdeI-Bst1107IC505 /C301CF19a The vectors used were treated with the indicated restriction enzymes; the DNA fragments for expression of β′ fragments carried the indicated restriction enzyme sites at termini. Open table in a new tab For construction of the expression plasmid pGEMDCH of the ς70 subunit with a His6 tag at the COOH terminus, a PCR product was prepared using pGEMD (5.Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) as template and a pair of primers, 5′-GCAACCTGGTGGATCCGTCAG-3′ and 5′- CCCGGAATTCAAGCTTTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGATCGTCCAGGAAGC-3′, treated withBamHI and HindIII, and substituted for the corresponding segment of pGEMD. For construction of plasmid pGET21-αC-His6 for high level expression of the α subunit with His6 tag at the COOH terminus, a XbaI-BamHI fragment of plasmid pLAW2-H6, which was constructed for moderate expression of the His6-tagged α subunit (14.Kimura M. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was substituted for the corresponding segment of pET21a (Novagen). RNA polymerase subunits and their fragments were all expressed in E. coli using the respective expression plasmids. The following plasmids were used: pGEMAX185 for α (5.Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), pET21-αC-His6 for αC-His6, pGETB for β (17.Nomura T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), pGETC for β′, pGEMD for ς70,and pGEMDCH for ς70C-His6 (see above). For expression of wild-type β′ and β′ fragments, plasmids were transformed intoE. coli strain JM109(DE3). For expression of other subunits, plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Overexpression and purification of α, β, β′, and ς70 subunits and nontagged β′ fragments were performed according to Fujita and Ishihama (25.Fujita N. Ishihama A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 121-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of the His6-tagged α subunit was carried out according to Kimura and Ishihama (14.Kimura M. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For preparation of the His6-tagged ς70 subunit and His6-tagged β′ fragments, a batch procedure of Ni2+-NTA affinity purification was employed. In the case of His6-tagged β′ fragments, the proteins in precipitate fractions of expressed cell lysates were solubilized with a dissociation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 0.2 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 6 m urea) (25.Fujita N. Ishihama A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 121-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto Ni2+-NTA agarose (QIAGEN) previously equilibrated with buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol) plus 5 mm imidazole and 6 m urea and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immobilized proteins were washed with buffer D plus 5 mm imidazole and 6 m urea and eluted with buffer D plus 200 mm imidazole and 6 murea. In the case of ς70C-His6, the renatured ς70C-His6 in TGED buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol) was fractionated by chromatography on a DEAE-TOYOPEARL 650M (TOSOH, Japan) column prior to affinity purification with Ni2+-NTA agarose. After incubation for 1.5 h on ice in buffer D plus 5 mmimidazole, immobilized proteins were eluted with buffer D plus 200 mm imidazole. Limited proteolysis by trypsin was performed according to Negishi et al. (26.Negishi T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief, the isolated β′(+N) subunit (0.27–0.30 μg/μl) containing an extra sequence at the NH2 terminus was preincubated in a cleavage buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 40 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol) at 20 °C for 5 min and then subjected to trypsin cleavage at an input trypsin:substrate ratio of 1:500 (w/w). After incubation for 30–90 min at 20 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 5 mm. NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the tryptic fragments of β′(+N) subunit were determined as described by Negishi et al. (26.Negishi T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins in gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride supports (Nippon Genetics, Japan), and the membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Stained protein bands were cut out from the membranes and subjected directly to Edman degradation analysis using an Applied Biosystems model 491 protein sequencer. Reconstitution of the α2β and α2ββ′ complexes was carried out as described by Fujita and Ishihama (25.Fujita N. Ishihama A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 121-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mixtures of isolated α and β (α:β molar ratio, 2.2:1) or isolated His6-tagged α, β, and β′ (or β′ fragments) (α:β:β ′ molar ratio, 2.2:1:1–4) in the dissociation buffer were dialyzed to remove urea against the standard reconstitution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 0.3 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). In the case of the α2β complex, the dialyzed sample was subjected to Protein Pak G-DEAE (Waters) column chromatography on a high performance liquid chromatography system and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.7 m NaCl in TGED buffer to separate the α2β complex from the free subunits. Reconstitution of the core complex was carried out using 1.87 nmol of His6-tagged α subunit, 0.85 nmol of the intact β subunit, and various combinations of two β′ subunit fragments, one at a fixed concentration (3.40 nmol) and the other at various concentrations. The reconstituted core complexes were purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 10% uniform gels. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the band intensity was measured with an LAS-1000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Japan). Reconstitution of the core enzyme was carried out using 2.01 nmol of the His6-tagged α subunit and 0.914 nmol each of the intact β and β′ subunits in the presence of various amounts of different β′ fragments. The reconstituted core complexes were purified and analyzed as above. Batch mode Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography was carried out as described by Tang et al. (27.Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged β′ subunit or His6-tagged β′ fragments were used for isolation of both core complexes (α2ββ′ or α2ββ′(fragment)) and β′ς70 complexes (β′ς70 or β′(fragment)ς70). In brief, 1.08 nmol of isolated His6-tagged β′ subunit or His6-tagged β′ fragments in 1 ml of the standard dissociation buffer (25.Fujita N. Ishihama A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 121-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol was mixed with 160 μl of Ni2+-NTA agarose equilibrated with the same dissociation buffer. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, agarose beads were washed six times with 1 ml each of the reconstitution buffer to remove urea. The agarose-bound β′ subunit or β′ fragments were mixed with 1.08 nmol of the α2β subcomplex or 2.16 nmol of ς70 subunits in 1 ml of the reconstitution buffer. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the agarose beads were washed once with 1 ml of the reconstitution buffer, six times with 1 ml each of buffer D plus 25 mm imidazole, and then the proteins were eluted with 160 μl of buffer D plus 400 mm imidazole. Each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 5–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad Ready Gels J) or on 7.5, 10, and 12.5% uniform gels. The core complex formation was also analyzed using the His6-tagged α subunit. In this case, 2.60 nmol of His6-tagged α subunit, 1.18 nmol of β, and 1.18 nmol of untagged β′ subunit or β′ fragments were mixed together in the dissociation buffer and then subjected to the reconstitution according to Fujita and Ishihama (25.Fujita N. Ishihama A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 121-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To the reconstituted subunit mixture, 160 μl of Ni2+-NTA agarose previously equilibrated in reconstitution buffer was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed with 1 ml of the reconstitution buffer and then three times with buffer D plus 5 mm imidazole, and finally the Ni2+-NTA agarose-bound proteins were eluted with 160 μl of buffer D plus 400 mm imidazole. The β′ subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase consists of 1407 amino acid residues and contains a total of 186 potential cleavage sites by trypsin. Limited digestion of the isolated β′(+N) subunit with a short extra sequence of MASSDGSKS at its NH2terminus was carried out at various trypsin concentrations and for various times. Fig. 2 A shows the time-dependent cleavage pattern at a trypsin:substrate ratio of 1:500 (w/w), as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Essentially the same cleavage patterns were obtained for the intact β′ subunit without the extra NH2-terminal sequence (data not shown). The tryptic fragments in the gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and each visible band was subjected to analysis of its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence (Fig. 2 B). The sites of tryptic cleavage were determined for all major cleavage products, and the COOH termini of these fragments were estimated from the fragment sizes estimated from the migration distance on SDS-PAGE and the location of potential cleavage sites along β′ by trypsin. During the initial stage of trypsin digestion for less than 30 min, three NH2-terminal fragments, bpn105,bpn90, and bpn88(NH2-terminal fragments ofbeta-prime are designated as bpn), were the major cleavage products (Fig. 2 A). In addition, five COOH-terminal fragments, bpc73, bpc70,bpc61, bpc57, and bpc55(COOH-terminal fragments ofbeta-prime are designated as bpc) could be identified. Upon further incubation, however, these COOH-terminal fragments were all degraded within 90 min of the incubation, whereas the three NH2-terminal fragments remained at least until 180 min of the trypsin treatment. Fig. 2 B shows the location of all of these cleavage fragments along the β′ polypeptide. Fragments bpn105,bpn90, and bpn88 consist of the NH2-terminal proximal two-thirds of β′, and include the conserved regions A to G or F. Fragments bpc73,bpc70, bpc61, bpc57, andbpc55 consist of the COOH-terminal one-third of β′ and include the conserved regions G and H and a dispensable region between region G and H. From the location of the major tryptic fragments, shown in Fig. 2 B, it was predicted that the initial trypsin cleavage took place at arginine positions 798, 799, 838, 842, 905, 933, and 943 between the regions F and G (Fig. 2 B). After prolonged incubation in the presence of trypsin, the high molecular mass cleavage products disappeared, and concomitantly a number of low molecular mass fragments smaller than 50 kDa were identified, which might be generated after secondary cleavage of the primary products. All of the visible bands, as indicated in Fig.2 A, were subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing, and the results indicated that some bands contained more than two different fragments of similar sizes (Fig. 2 A). Three fragments, bpn42, bpn41, and bpn39, were found to retain the original NH2-terminal sequence, indicating that these came from the initial NH2-terminal fragments (for the location along the β′ polypeptide, see Fig. 2 B). Two fragments, bpm50 and bpm47, carried the NH2-terminal sequence starting from residues 346 and 353, respectively, indicating that they contained the sequences corresponding to the central part of the β′ subunit (fragments derived from the middle part of thebeta-prime subunit are designated asbpm) (Fig. 2 B). Fragments bpc55,bpc50, bpc47, bpc42, and bpc39 all carried the NH2-terminal sequence starting from residue Thr-934 or Ala-944. Taking all of the sequence data together, the secondary cleavage sites could be identified as follows. (i) The initial NH2-terminal fragments were cleaved at residue Lys-345 or Arg-352 between the conserved regions B and C, leading to generation of the NH2-terminal proximal fragments (bpn42,bpn41, and bpn39) including the regions A and B, and the middle fragments (bpm50 and bpm47) including the regions C, D, and E. (ii) The initial COOH-terminal fragments were processed from both NH2 and COOH termini,i.e. at residues Arg-933 or Arg-943 from NH2terminus and at residues approximately downstream from residue 1300 (see Fig. 2 B). To identify the contact site(s) of the β′ subunit with α and β subunits, the core enzyme reconstitution experiment was carried out using a His6-tagged α,β subunit and mixtures of trypsin-treated β′ subunit fragments. The addition of the His6 tag at the COOH terminus of wild-type α subunit does not interfere with the assembly of core enzyme (however, some α mutants become inactive in the assembly by the addition of His6 tag (14.Kimura M. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). Subunits were mixed in the dissociation buffer; after dialysis against the reconstitution buffer to remove urea, the subunit mixtures were subjected to Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. Almost all major β′ subunit fragments, including those not overlapping each other, were recovered in the complex fractions, which were eluted only in the presence of high concentrations of imidazole (data not shown). These β′ subunit fragments did not bind to the Ni2+-NTA agarose in the absence of His6-tagged α and β subunits. The binding of nonoverlapping β′ fragments with the α2β complex indicates the presence of multiple contact sites on the β′ subunit with α and/or β subunits. However, it is not excluded yet that some β′ fragments bind to either α or β subunits in a nonspecific manner. To confirm the results obtained above, we next carried out the core enzyme reconstitution experiment using α subunit, β subunit, and His6-tagged β′ fragments and analyzed the proteins associated with each β′ fragment. For this purpose, a series of expression plasmids was constructed, which overexpressed a total of 13 species of the β′ subunit fragment, each with a His6tag at the COOH terminus. All of these His6-tagged β′ fragments were purified to apparent homogeneity under denatured conditions in the presence of urea from inclusion bodies of the expressed cell extracts using Ni2+-NTA agarose (data not shown). Isolated β′ fragments were bound to Ni2+-NTA agarose and, after washing with the reconstitution buffer, mixed with the α2β complex for reconstitution. The core complexes were eluted using buffer D containing imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The elution patterns are shown in Fig.3. Almost all of the β′ fragments, except for β′(346–515)C-His6 and β′(842–1140)C-His6, formed core complexes with the α2β binary complex. Because β′(346–515)C-His6 and β′(842–1140)C-His6 fragments did not form the core enzyme, the contact sites on the β′ subunit involved in core enzyme assembly could be mapped in three regions: the NH2-terminal region (residues 1–345), the middle region (residues 515–842), and the"
https://openalex.org/W1582092181,"Dharnidharka and colleagues raise an important point. Co-stimulation blockade using anti-CD154 and CTLA4-Ig, albeit remarkably effective in many models, has not proven universally successful in producing permanent engraftment in allograft models. Although the cited work of Larsen and Pearson4 showed universal survival of skin allografts for 50 days, after further observation, only 50% of the recipients in that study experienced permanent engraftment (C. Larsen, personal communication). In skin graft models, subtle differences in the precise source of the skin graft, the source of CTLA4-Ig and differences in the C3H/He substrains are potentially very important in determining outcome. In fact, Larsen and Pearson have just shown in another strain combination that asialo GM1+ CD8+ T cells are essential in co-stimulation blockade-resistant mouse skin allograft rejection7. Several other groups have noted that CD8+ T cells are responsible for co-stimulation blockade resistant rejection in intestinal8 and skin9 allograft models. And our own unpublished observations show that co-stimulation blockade is ineffective in blocking islet allograft rejection in a CD8+ T-cell receptor transgenic model. We know of several other groups that have noted CD8+ T-cell-dependent, co-stimulation blockade resistant allograft rejection. Recall that the expression of the co-stimulatory proteins differs from CD4+ to CD8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2006282544,"Abstract Mice in which the erythroid Kruppel-like Factor (EKLF) gene is inactivated die in fetal life due to down-regulation of the β-globin gene. Results have suggested that EKLF functions through the proximal CACC motif of the β-globin promoter. For example, natural mutations of this element that fail to bind EKLF give reduced gene expression and the ability of EKLF to activate reporter genes in co-transfection assays is dependent on an intact CACC. Here, removal of the CACC motif and upstream promoter sequences from the β-globin gene resulted in reduced expression in transgenic mice. However, breeding onto an EKLF−/− background demonstrated that a CACC-less β-globin transgene remains highly dependent on EKLF. Hence, although the β-globin gene partly depends on the proximal CACC motif for expression, it is unlikely that the major mechanism of gene activation by EKLF is through this element. We also show that a lacZ reporter gene linked to the β-globin promoter, with or without the CACC box present, is actually expressed higher in EKLF−/− fetuses than in wild type animals, suggesting that EKLF may be able to act as an inhibitor of transcription with certain transgene configurations."
https://openalex.org/W1575311659,"Diltiazem was shown to slow down photoreceptor degeneration in the rd mouse, an animal model for retinitis pigmentosa1. Rod cell numbers were quantified after cell labeling with the rho-4D2 antibody directed against rhodopsin. This quantification was possible because the antibody labeled surviving rod cell bodies. Given their own experience with a rhodopsin antibody that failed to label rod cell bodies2, Edward and Tso suggest that these labeled cells were perhaps degenerating photoreceptors."
