We find that the EGFR kinase domain can be activated by increasing its local concentration or by mutating a leucine (L834R) in the activation loop, the phosphorylation of which is not required for activation. This suggests that the kinase domain is intrinsically autoinhibited, and an intermolecular interaction promotes its activation. Using further mutational analysis and crystallography we demonstrate that the autoinhibited conformation of the EGFR kinase domain resembles that of Src and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). EGFR activation results from the formation of an asymmetric dimer in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase domain plays a role analogous to that of cyclin in activated CDK/cyclin complexes. The CDK/cyclin-like complex formed by two kinase domains thus explains the activation of EGFR-family receptors by homo- or heterodimerization.

Members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1, ErbB2/HER2, ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/HER4) are transmembrane tyrosine kinases that are activated by ligand-induced dimerization (Figure 1A) (Schreiber et al., 1983Schreiber A.B.

These receptors play critical roles in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, and their abnormal activation is associated with a variety of human cancers (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001Yarden Y.

Dimerization results in the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the C-terminal tail segments, which serve as docking sites for signaling molecules that contain SH2 or PTB domains and are responsible for onward transmission of the signal (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Untangling the ErbB signalling network.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5264) Google Scholar). EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4 contain catalytically competent kinase domains and can form heterodimeric pairs with each other. ErbB3 contains an inactive kinase domain, but it can pair with and activate the other members of the family (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Untangling the ErbB signalling network.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5264) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of EGFR is stimulated by ligand engagement in a manner that depends on intermolecular interactions (Yarden and Schlessinger, 1987Yarden Y. Schlessinger J.

The purified intracellular region of EGFR is activated by aggregation induced by a variety of agents (Mohammadi et al., 1993Mohammadi M. Honegger A. Sorokin A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hurwitz D.R.

This activation is not simply due to trans-phosphorylation of the activation loop because, in contrast to most kinases, phosphorylation of the EGFR activation loop is not critical to its activation (Burke and Stern, 1998Burke C.L.

In one (crystal form A) the kinase domain is unphosphorylated but adopts an active conformation, either in a ligand-free form or in complex with the cancer drug Erlotinib (Tarceva) (Stamos et al., 2002Stamos J.

An activating heterozygous mutation in the activation loop of the kinase domain of EGFR, L834R (also identified as Leu858 in an alternative numbering of the human EGFR sequence), has been found frequently in lung cancer patients (accounting for 41% of EGFR mutations in these cancers) (Jiang et al., 2005Jiang J.

An adjacent leucine residue (Leu837) is mutated to glutamine in some lung cancer patients (Shigematsu et al., 2005Shigematsu H. Lin L. Takahashi T. Nomura M. Suzuki M. Wistuba I.I. Fong K.M. Lee H.

Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). These residues are either partially (Leu834) or completely (Leu837) surface exposed and do not play an obvious structural role in the active conformation (Figure 1B). In contrast, the importance of these two residues is obvious upon consideration of the Src/CDK-like inactive conformation because both residues pack against hydrophobic sidechains in the interior of the kinase domain while buttressing a displaced orientation of a catalytically critical helix in the N-lobe, helix αC (Figure 1C). Replacement of either leucine by a polar sidechain is likely to destabilize the Src-like inactive conformation and thereby activate the kinase domain. Interestingly, Erlotinib is incompatible with the Src/CDK-like inactive conformation, which may explain why activating mutations potentiate the effectiveness of the closely related drug Gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004Lynch T.J.

In this paper we show that the isolated kinase domain of EGFR has low basal activity, and that its activity is increased substantially upon replacing Leu834 by arginine. This demonstrates that the wild-type kinase domain on its own is indeed in an autoinhibited state, and we wondered why the original crystal structure of the EGFR kinase domain (Stamos et al., 2002Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. Structure of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase domain alone and in complex with a 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) as well as two new structures we have determined (see below) are in the active conformation. One possibility is that the high protein concentrations used in crystallization (∼200 μM) might mimic the high local concentration of kinase domains that is induced by receptor dimerization, leading to the formation of an activated dimer in the crystal lattice. The only available inactive structure of the EGFR kinase domain (crystal form B) is likely to be trapped by the bound kinase inhibitor Lapatinib, which is incompatible with the active structure seen in crystal form A. Examination of the crystal lattice of the active form of the kinase domain reveals two potentially important crystallographic dimers. One is symmetric, with two kinase domains interacting in a head-to-tail fashion though a primarily electrostatic interface, as discussed before (Landau et al., 2004Landau M. Fleishman S.J. Ben-Tal N. A putative mechanism for downregulation of the catalytic activity of the EGF receptor via direct contact between its kinase and C-terminal domains.Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 2265-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The second one is an asymmetric dimer in which one kinase domain interacts with another in a manner analogous to that of a cyclin with an activated cyclin-dependent kinase (Jeffrey et al., 1995Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Mechanism of CDK activation revealed by the structure of a cyclinA-CDK2 complex.Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). We present a mutational analysis that demonstrates the importance of the CDK/cyclin-like dimer for the activation of the EGFR kinase domain. We also show that the symmetric electrostatic dimer seen in crystal form A (Landau et al., 2004Landau M. Fleishman S.J. Ben-Tal N. A putative mechanism for downregulation of the catalytic activity of the EGF receptor via direct contact between its kinase and C-terminal domains.Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 2265-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is unlikely to be relevant for EGFR activation. One compelling aspect of the CDK/cyclin-like model is its ability to explain the interactions of the catalytically dead ErbB3 receptor with other EGFR family members, which we have tested by cotransfecting mammalian cells with active and inactive forms of EGFR. In addition, we have crystallized an EGFR kinase domain variant bearing a mutation (V924R) at the CDK/cyclin-like interface. Strikingly, the mutant EGFR kinase domain crystallizes in a new crystal lattice and adopts an inactive Src/CDK-like conformation. We expressed and purified the L834R mutant form of the kinase domain (residues 672–998 with an N-terminal His-tag) and measured its kinase activity toward a peptide substrate. The value of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) for the L834R mutant is ∼20-fold higher than that for the wild-type kinase domain, indicating that the wild-type kinase domain is autoinhibited (Figure 2A). The EGFR kinase domain is monomeric in solution at concentrations up to 50 μM (Figure S1). The local concentration of kinase domains in a dimeric receptor is estimated to be in the millimolar range. In order to increase the local concentration in a controlled fashion we added a hexa-histidine tag to the kinase domain and localized it to the surface of small unilamellar vesicles containing lipids with a nickel-nitrilotriacetate head group (1, 2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-{[N(5-Amino-1-Carboxypentyl)iminodiAcetic Acid]Succinyl} Nickel salt, DOGS-NTA-Ni) (Dorn et al., 1998Dorn I.T. Neumaier K.R. Tampe R. Molecular recognition of histidine-tagged molecules by metal-chelating lipids monitored by fluorescence energy transfer and correlation spectroscopy.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 2753-2763Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The density of the kinase domain on individual vesicles was controlled by varying the mole ratio of the DOGS-NTA-Ni lipids and the 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine (DOPC) lipids that constitute the vesicles. A similar method has been used to study the activation of the CheA histidine kinase by the aspartate receptor from E. coli (Shrout et al., 2003Shrout A.L. Montefusco D.J. Weis R.M. Template-directed assembly of receptor signaling complexes.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13379-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The density of DOGS-NTA-Ni lipids in the vesicles is varied from 0.5 to 5.0 mole percent. The dissociation constant for attachment of the His-tagged kinase domain to the vesicle is estimated to be ∼2 μM and the total concentration of DOGS-NTA-Ni lipid is maintained at 12.5 μM in these experiments to ensure localization of the His-tagged protein to the vesicles. The effective local concentration of kinase domains is approximately in the range of ∼0.4 mM (for 100 nm vesicles containing 0.5 mole % DOGS-NTA-Ni) to ∼4 mM (for 5 mole % DOGS-NTA-Ni) (see Table S1). The wild-type kinase domain attached to vesicles displays a significantly increased catalytic activity relative to that of the kinase domain in solution (up to ∼15-fold increase in the value of kcat/KM) (Figure 2). The specific activity increases when the density of the kinase molecules on individual vesicles is increased, while keeping the overall concentrations of the His-tagged kinase domain and DOGS-NTA-Ni constant (Figure 2B). This suggests that an intermolecular interaction is involved in the activation of the kinase domain. Vesicles containing no DOGS-NTA-Ni lipids do not stimulate the level of kinase activity (Figure 2B). Conversely, removal of the His-tag by proteolytic cleavage does not result in an increase in catalytic activity in the presence of the DOGS-NTA-Ni-containing vesicles; the basal activity in solution is unchanged by the proteolytic treatment (Figure 2A). These experiments rule out the possibility that the activation of the vesicle-linked kinase domain is due to nonspecific interactions between the lipids and the protein. One simple explanation for the concentration dependence of the activation of the vesicle-linked kinase domain is that it is a consequence of increased trans-phosphorylation of the kinase domain on Tyr845 in the activation loop, which corresponds to the site of activating phosphorylation in many kinases (Huse and Kuriyan, 2002Huse M. Kuriyan J. The conformational plasticity of protein kinases.Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). This is ruled out by experiments on a mutant form of the EGFR kinase domain with this tyrosine residue replaced by phenylalanine (Y845F). Y845F is activated upon attachment to vesicles to a similar extent as the wild-type EGFR kinase domain (Figure 2A). We screened extensively for conditions that yield crystals of the wild-type EGFR kinase domain but succeeded only in obtaining crystals with the same lattice as described previously (Stamos et al., 2002Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. Structure of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase domain alone and in complex with a 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), although under very different conditions. We obtained crystals of the apo-EGFR kinase domain in 25% PEG4K, 6% isopropanol, 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Two different ATP analog-peptide conjugates were used for crystallization with the EGFR kinase domain. In one the peptide segment corresponds to 12 residues spanning Tyr1173 in the C-terminal tail of EGFR, but cocrystallization trials yielded crystals in 1 M NaMalonate, 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 that do not appear to contain the substrate analog. Crystals of the kinase domain in complex with another ATP analog-peptide conjugate (corresponding to a c-Src substrate; Levinson et al., 2006Levinson N.M. Kuchment O. Shen K. Young M.A. Koldobskiy M. Karplus M. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. A Src-like inactive conformation in the Abl tyrosine kinase domain.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e144https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040144Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) were grown in 18% PEG3350, 0.2 M LiCitrate, 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. The unit cell parameters for these crystals are very similar to those for the original form A crystals, which were obtained under different conditions (1 M Na/K tartrate, 100 mM MES, pH 7.0) (Stamos et al., 2002Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. Structure of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase domain alone and in complex with a 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The structure of the kinase domain complexed with the ATP analog-peptide conjugate (Figures 1B and 3A) shows that all the catalytic residues are positioned appropriately for catalysis, as judged by comparison with the structures of insulin receptor kinase-substrate complexes (Parang et al., 2001Parang K. Till J.H. Ablooglu A.J. Kohanski R.A. Hubbard S.R. Cole P.A. Mechanism-based design of a protein kinase inhibitor.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Given the persistent formation of crystal form A under a wide variety of crystallization conditions, we wondered whether an intrinsic tendency of the kinase domain to dimerize at high concentrations may promote the formation of a specific crystal lattice that stabilizes the active conformation. Previous analysis of crystal form A had focused attention on a symmetric crystallographic dimer held together primarily by electrostatic interactions (Landau et al., 2004Landau M. Fleishman S.J. Ben-Tal N.

Crystal form A also contains an extensive hydrophobic interface between two kinase domains that results from a 3-fold screw rotation (Figures 4A and 4B) (i.e., one kinase domain in a pair is rotated by 120° about an axis relative to the other one and is also translated along that axis by 42 Å; see Figure S3A for the precise transformation). This asymmetric dimer juxtaposes the C-lobe of one kinase domain (monomer B) against the N-lobe (with extensive interactions spanning helix αC) of the other kinase domain (monomer A) (Figures 4A and 4B).Figure 4The Asymmetric CDK/Cyclin-like Crystallographic Dimer of the EGFR Kinase DomainShow full caption(A) Overview of the asymmetric dimer, and comparison with the structure of the CDK2/cyclinA complex (PDB ID: 1HCL).(B) Detailed view of the asymmetric dimer interface.

Hydrophobic interfacial residues from monomer B are highlighted. In the second exploded view monomer B (the cyclin-like kinase) is shown in surface representation, and hydrophobic interfacial residues from monomer A are highlighted. A striking aspect of the asymmetric interaction between the two EGFR kinase domains in the second dimer is its resemblance to the interaction between activated CDK2 and cyclinA (Figure 4A), with the C-lobe of monomer B in the EGFR kinase dimer taking a position relative to monomer A that is analogous to that of cyclinA in the active CDK/cyclin complex (Jeffrey et al., 1995Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Mechanism of CDK activation revealed by the structure of a cyclinA-CDK2 complex.Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Although the structure of the C-lobe of the kinase domain is unrelated to that of the cyclins, key elements of the interaction, particularly the engagement of helix αC of monomer A, are similar in general terms. An insightful earlier study had proposed several potential models for dimerization of the EGFR kinase domain in the absence of direct structural information and had speculated that the base of the C-lobe of the kinase domain might engage helix αC of another kinase domain through hydrophobic interactions (Groenen et al., 1997Groenen L.C. Walker F. Burgess A.W. Treutlein H.R. A model for the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase: involvement of an asymmetric dimer?.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3826-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have measured the effect on EGFR activation of mutations at the symmetric dimer interface (Figure 5A) by using a cell transfection assay in which the levels of phosphorylation at three sites in the C-terminal tail of the full-length receptor (Tyr1045, Tyr1068, and Tyr1173) are monitored. Four of these mutant receptors (I942E, K946E, R938E, and a double mutant R938/I942E) show a robust response to EGF stimulation (Figure 5B). Given the central location of these residues within the symmetric dimer interface, these results argue against the importance of this dimer in the activation process (see Supplemental Data for more information). Further evidence that the symmetric dimer is not involved in the activation process is provided by the vesicle-linked assay for the activity of the kinase domain. The C-terminal tail segment is a central element of the symmetric dimer, but a variant of the kinase domain in which the majority of the C-terminal tail segment is removed (containing a deletion spanning residues 965–998) is activated upon attachment to vesicles to a much higher level than seen for the kinase domain with the intact C-terminal fragment (Figure 2A). These results indicate that the C-terminal tail segment suppresses the catalytic activity of EGFR kinase domain, consistent with previous studies (Chang et al., 1995Chang C.M. Shu H.K. Ravi L. Pelley R.J. Shu H. Kung H.J. A minor tyrosine phosphorylation site located within the CAIN domain plays a critical role in regulating tissue-specific transformation by erbB kinase.J.

Examples of specific mRNAs undergoing microRNA-mediated repression are numerous, but whether the repression is a reversible process remains largely unknown. Here we show that cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1) mRNA and reporters bearing its 3′UTR can be relieved from the microRNA miR-122-induced inhibition in human hepatocarcinoma cells subjected to different stress conditions. The derepression of CAT-1 mRNA is accompanied by its release from cytoplasmic processing bodies and its recruitment to polysomes. The derepression requires binding of HuR, an AU-rich-element binding protein, to the 3′UTR of CAT-1 mRNA. We propose that proteins interacting with the 3′UTR will generally act as modifiers altering the potential of miRNAs to repress gene expression."

Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive and motor functions, is caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat encoding glutamine in the N terminus of huntingtin (htt). Polyglutamine expansion results in selective loss of GABAergic medium spiny striatal neurons as well as glutamatergic cortical neurons that project to the striatum (Albin et al., 1990Albin R.L.

In addition, while several studies have shown that translocation of htt to the nucleus is associated with increased toxicity in vitro and neuropathology in vivo (Wheeler et al., 2000Wheeler V.C.

In the YAC128 model, which expresses full-length mhtt, nuclear localization of htt fragments occurs earliest and to the greatest extent in the striatum, the region most affected in HD (Van Raamsdonk et al., 2005aVan Raamsdonk J.M.

In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of all five caspase cleavage sites in mhtt blocks cytotoxicity in vitro (Wellington et al., 2000Wellington C.L. Singaraja R. Ellerby L. Savill J. Roy S.

These observations raise the questions of whether the caspase-specific htt fragments are important in the pathogenesis of HD and whether inhibiting caspase cleavage of mhtt may be protective in vivo. We have previously developed a YAC model for HD that displays age- and CAG-dependent phenotypes that recapitulate many features of the human disease. Specifically, enhanced susceptibility to excitotoxic stress, cleavage and nuclear localization of htt, and cognitive dysfunction are followed by motor deficits and selective striatal degeneration (Slow et al., 2003Slow E.J. van Raamsdonk J.

Dis. 2005; 21: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), recapitulating many aspects of human HD. To determine whether caspase cleavage of mhtt represents a primary event in the pathogenesis of HD in vivo, we generated YAC mice expressing expanded htt containing selective mutations of the caspase-3 and caspase-6 cleavage sites. Here we report that cleavage at the 586 amino acid (aa) caspase-6 site in mhtt is required for the development of the characteristic behavioral and neuropathological features of HD. Selective elimination of the caspase-6, but not caspase-3, cleavage site in mhtt is sufficient to provide protection from neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration in vivo. These data suggest that specific mhtt fragments are required to initiate a toxic cycle that leads to neuronal dysfunction and the neuropathological abnormalities in HD. Our results are consistent with in vivo proteolytic cleavage of mhtt at the caspase-6 cleavage site being a crucial and rate-limiting event in the pathogenesis of HD and suggest that preventing caspase-6 cleavage of htt may be of therapeutic interest. The caspase sites in the human HD gene are located in exons 12 and 13. Exon 12 encodes htt aa 470 to 583 and contains two active caspase-3 sites at positions 513 (510DSVD513) and 552 (549DLND552), as well as one silent caspase-3 site at position 530 (527DEED530) (Wellington et al., 1998Wellington C.L. Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Margolis R.L. Trifiro M.A. Singaraja R. McCutcheon K. Salvesen G.S. Propp S.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9158-9167Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Exon 13 encodes htt aa 584 to 624 and contains the active caspase-6 site at position 586 (583IVLD586) as well as another silent caspase-3 site at position 589 (586DGTD589) (Wellington et al., 2000Wellington C.L. Singaraja R. Ellerby L. Savill J. Roy S. Leavitt B. Cattaneo E. Hackam A. Sharp A. Thornberry N. et al.Inhibiting caspase cleavage of huntingtin reduces toxicity and aggregate formation in neuronal and nonneuronal cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19831-19838Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Specific mutations of the P1 aspartate at positions 513 and 552 would be expected to generate C3R htt, and a mutation at residue 586 would be expected to generate C6R htt. To ensure that the silent caspase-3 sites would be unable to be cryptically activated in vivo, we also mutagenized their P1 aspartate residues. The mutagenized exons were introduced by homologous recombination in yeast into YAC353G6 (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) and verified by Southern blot and PCR (data not shown). Verified caspase-resistant (CR) YACs were purified and microinjected into FVB/N pronuclei (Hodgson et al., 1999Hodgson J.G. Agopyan N. Gutekunst C.A. Leavitt B.R. LePiane F. Singaraja R. Smith D.J. Bissada N. McCutcheon K.

Founders were confirmed by a five-point PCR screen (Figure S2) and by sequencing (data not shown). Using this strategy, we generated two independent mouse lines expressing human mhtt resistant to both caspase-3 and -6 known as caspase quint resistant (CQR) lines 24 (CQR24) and 26 (CQR26). We also developed two independent lines selectively resistant to caspase-3 (C3R8 and C3R9) and two resistant to caspase-6 (C6R7 and C6R13). The phenotype of HD in YAC128 mice is influenced by levels of expression of mhtt (Graham et al., 2005Graham R.K. Slow E.J. Deng Y. Bissada N. Lu G. Pearson J. Shehadeh J. Leavitt B.R. Raymond L.A. Hayden M.R. Levels of mutant huntingtin influence the phenotypic severity of Huntington disease in YAC128 mouse models.Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 21: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); therefore, it is essential to control not only for CAG size but also for levels of transgene expression. PCR-mediated CAG sizing was used to ensure equivalent CAG sizes among caspase-cleavable and CR lines (Figure 1A). Lines HD53, HD54, CQR24, C3R8, and C3R9 all contain 120 CAG repeats. Lines C6R7 and C6R13 each have 133 CAGs, and CQR26 contains two CAG sizes of 120 and 83. Thus, all of the CR lines have CAG sizes at least as large as the control YAC lines. Quantitative mRNA and Western blotting was then used to match transgene expression in each CR murine brain tissue to the most appropriate YAC128 line (n = 3, age matched). htt expression levels in CQR24 and CQR26 (upper allele) were found to be equivalent to HD54 (Figures 1B and 1C). The CQR26 mice display two distinct protein sizes on Western blots (Figure 1C), which was accounted for by a spontaneous contraction of the glutamine tract in one copy of the YAC in CQR26 animals. htt expression analysis in C3R8 and C3R9 demonstrates that both of these lines also express human mhtt at levels equivalent to HD54 (Figures 1B and 1C), whereas mhtt levels in C6R7 and C6R13 mice are similar to the previously described HD53 mice and higher than HD55 (Figures 1B and 1C). The different forms of mhtt are expressed similarly in different regions of CR and caspase-cleavable (YAC128) murine brain (Figure S3). Western blotting shows that caspase-3 and -6 do not cleave htt in CQR24 or CQR26 brain lysates (Figure 2A), verifying that the mutations introduced into CQR mhtt block cleavage of mhtt by caspases-3 and -6. In contrast, HD54 brain lysates give rise to the expected htt caspase fragments (70 kDa for endogenous and 98 kDa for mhtt) (Figure 2A). Western blotting demonstrates that caspase-3 cleaves only endogenous htt in brain lysates prepared from C3R8 and C3R9 mice (Figure 2B). In contrast, caspase-3 treatment of lysates prepared from HD54 brain generated the expected 70 kDa and 98 kDa htt fragments representing the endogenous and mhtt protein. Incubation of C3R lysates with caspase-6 results in the expected fragments from endogenous and mhtt, demonstrating that C3R mhtt is only resistant to cleavage by caspase-3 (Figure 2D). Conversely, treatment of brain lysates from HD53 with caspase-6 generated the expected caspase-6 fragments from transgenic (115 kDa) and endogenous htt (90 kDa) (Figure 2C). As expected, only endogenous htt is cleaved by caspase-6 in brain lysates from C6R7 and C6R13 mice (Figure 2C). This caspase-6 mhtt fragment is detected in vivo in HD53, HD54, and C3R brain lysates, while it is absent in C6R brain lysates (C6R7 and C6R13, Figure 2E). Assessment of the toxicity of the 586 aa N-terminal mhtt fragment in vitro demonstrates that it is more toxic than the caspase-3 513 aa or 552 aa mhtt fragments in transfected N2A cells exposed to staurosporine (n = 3, ANOVA p = 0.0015; Figure S4). Incubation of C6R brain lysates with caspase-3 results in caspase-3 endogenous and mhtt fragments, demonstrating that C6R mhtt is selectively resistant to cleavage by caspase-6 (Figure 2F). This is further substantiated in vivo using the caspase-3 neo-epitope antibody (htt552) (Wellington et al., 2002Wellington C.L. Ellerby L.M. Gutekunst C.A. Rogers D. Warby S. Graham R.K. Loubser O. van Raamsdonk J. Singaraja R. Yang Y.Z. et al.Caspase cleavage of mutant huntingtin precedes neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7862-7872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). htt552 immunostaining of brain slices from wild-type (wt), HD53, and C6R mice demonstrates the presence of htt cleaved at aa 552 predominantly in the cytoplasm and processes of a subset of striatal neurons in all mice irrespective of genotype (Figure 2G). Transgenic htt expressed from a YAC rescues the embryonic lethality of htt-deficient animals (Hodgson et al., 1996Hodgson J.G. Smith D.J. McCutcheon K. Koide H.B. Nishiyama K. Dinulos M.B. Stevens M.E. Bissada N. Nasir J. Kanazawa I. et al.Human huntingtin derived from YAC transgenes compensates for loss of murine huntingtin by rescue of the embryonic lethal phenotype.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We observe rescue of embryonic lethality of htt-knockout mice with a similar efficiency in CR YAC lines and YAC mice expressing caspase-cleavable htt, demonstrating that mutagenesis of the caspase sites in mhtt does not impair htt function in vivo during development (Table S1). In YAC mice expressing low levels of mhtt (HD54 and C3R9), only partial rescue is observed, consistent with observations that developmental viability requires a threshold level of htt expression (Auerbach et al., 2001Auerbach W. Hurlbert M.S. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wadghiri Y.Z. Wheeler V.C. Cohen S.I. Joyner A.L. MacDonald M.E. Turnbull D.H. The HD mutation causes progressive lethal neurological disease in mice expressing reduced levels of huntingtin.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Significant brain atrophy and loss of striatal volume have previously been reported in HD53 mice by 9 months (Slow et al., 2003Slow E.J. van Raamsdonk J. Rogers D. Coleman S.H. Graham R.K. Deng Y. Oh R. Bissada N. Hossain S.M. Yang Y.Z. et al.Selective striatal neuronal loss in a YAC128 mouse model of Huntington disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1555-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), in HD55 by 12 months, and in the lower-expressing HD54 line by 18 months (Graham et al., 2005Graham R.K. Slow E.J. Deng Y. Bissada N. Lu G. Pearson J. Shehadeh J. Leavitt B.R. Raymond L.A. Hayden M.R. Levels of mutant huntingtin influence the phenotypic severity of Huntington disease in YAC128 mouse models.Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 21: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). First, we measured brain weights and striatal volumes in CQR and HD54 mice at 18 months (n = 8). No reduction in brain weight is observed for either the CQR24 or the CQR26 line compared to wt mice (CQR (pooled) = 0.39 ± 0.01 g, wt = 0.40 ± 0.02 g, p = 0.14; Figure 3A). As expected, HD54 brain weights are significantly lower than wt controls at 18 months (HD54 = 0.37 ± 0.01 g, p = 0.02). Similarly, striatal volume is reduced by 9% in HD54 mice relative to wt controls (HD54 = 11.9 ± 0.65 mm3, wt = 13.2 ± 0.96 mm3, p = 0.03; Figure 3A). By contrast, CQR24 and CQR26 mice do not exhibit any significant reduction in striatal volume at 18 months compared to wt mice (CQR (pooled) = 12.6 ± 0.74 mm3, p = 0.22). These observations suggest that caspase cleavage of mhtt is required for striatal volume loss. To distinguish whether caspase-3 or -6 cleavage of mhtt, or both, is critical for mediating striatal atrophy, we next evaluated brain weights and striatal volumes in the C3R lines relative to the appropriate control line HD54 and wt mice (n = 8). At 18 months, brain weight and striatal volumes in the C3R lines (pooled) are indistinguishable from HD54 (brain weight C3R = 0.37 ± 0.02 g, HD54 = 0.37 ± 0.01 g, p = 0.75; striatal volume C3R = 11.8 ± 0.90 mm3, HD54 = 11.9 ± 0.65 mm3, p = 0.84; Figure 3B) and significantly less than wt controls (brain weight wt = 0.40 ± 0.02 g, p = 0.002; striatal volume wt = 13.2 ± 0.96 mm3, p = 0.003). These findings demonstrate that preventing caspase-3 cleavage of mhtt provides no protection from striatal atrophy in vivo. Notably, mice expressing C3R mhtt still generate caspase-6 fragments of mhtt (Figures 2D and 2E). We next evaluated whether caspase-6 cleavage of mhtt influences brain weight and striatal volume in vivo. As expected (Graham et al., 2005Graham R.K. Slow E.J. Deng Y. Bissada N. Lu G. Pearson J. Shehadeh J. Leavitt B.R. Raymond L.A. Hayden M.R. Levels of mutant huntingtin influence the phenotypic severity of Huntington disease in YAC128 mouse models.Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 21: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), HD53 brain weight and striatal volume are reduced compared to wt controls at 18 months (n = 8, brain weight HD53 = 0.35 ± 0.01 g, wt = 0.38 ± 0.02 g, p = 0.04; striatal volume HD53 = 10.9 ± 0.40 mm3, wt = 12.9 ± 0.42 mm3, p < 0.0001; Figure 3C). By contrast, brain weight and striatal volume from C6R7 and C6R13 lines (pooled) are indistinguishable from wt controls (n = 8, brain weight C6R = 0.38 ± 0.03 g, C6R versus wt: p = 0.61; striatal volume C6R = 12.3 ± 0.83 mm3, C6R versus wt: p = 0.10), and striatal volume is significantly increased relative to HD53 (p < 0.01, ANOVA p = 0.0004; Figure 3C). These data demonstrate that selective mutation of the caspase-6 site in mhtt is sufficient to protect mice from the neurotoxic effects of polyglutamine expansion and striatal volume loss in vivo. We then assessed striatal volume and neuronal counts in C6R mice compared to HD53 animals at 12 months (n = 7). As expected (Slow et al., 2003Slow E.J. van Raamsdonk J. Rogers D. Coleman S.H.

Genet. 2003; 12: 1555-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), HD53 mice demonstrate significant striatal volume and neuronal loss at 12 months (striatal volume HD53 = 11.0 ± 0.74 mm3, wt = 12.6 ± 0.84 mm3, p < 0.001; neuronal counts HD53 = [12.4 ± 0.89] × 105, wt = [13.7 ± 1.31] × 105, p < 0.05; Figure 3D). C6R mice exhibit preserved striatal volume and no neuronal loss at 12 months and are significantly different from HD53 mice (striatal volume C6R = 12.4 ± 0.46 mm3, C6R versus wt: p = 0.57, C6R versus HD53: p < 0.001, ANOVA p = 0.0002; neuronal counts C6R = [13.9 ± 1.25] × 105, C6R versus wt: p = 0.74, C6R versus HD53: p = 0.02; Figure 3D). Mice expressing C6R mhtt still generate a caspase-3 fragment of mhtt (Figures 2F and 2G), which clearly has no neurotoxicity in vivo. These observations suggest that selective cleavage of mhtt by caspase-6, but not caspase-3, is a critical step in development of striatal atrophy. HD53 and HD55 mice develop cognitive and motor abnormalities that recapitulate many clinical features of HD (Van Raamsdonk et al., 2005bVan Raamsdonk J.M. Pearson J. Slow E.J. Hossain S.M. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Cognitive dysfunction precedes neuropathology and motor abnormalities in the YAC128 mouse model of Huntington's disease.J.

Hayden M.R. Levels of mutant huntingtin influence the phenotypic severity of Huntington disease in YAC128 mouse models.Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 21: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To investigate motor dysfunction, wt, HD53, and C6R mice (sex and weight matched, n = 9) were assessed using an accelerating rotarod. HD53 mice show a significant deficit on the rotarod at 2 months (p < 0.01; Figure 4A). By contrast, C6R mice perform as well as wt animals up to and including 10 months and perform better than HD53 mice at 2 (p < 0.05), 6 (p < 0.05), and 8 (p < 0.05) months (ANOVA p < 0.0001; Figure 4A). As the HD53 mice showed a deficit at the start of the behavior trial, an additional cohort was assessed at 1 month to determine whether baseline rotarod performance is similar between genotypes. At 1 month, all mice perform similarly (Figure S5). The HD53 mice demonstrate a progressive hypokinetic phenotype commencing at 4 months compared to wt during a 30 min open-field trial (p < 0.01; Figure 4B). In contrast to the HD53 mice, the C6R mice display activity levels indistinguishable from wt at all times tested. Furthermore, the C6R mice perform better than HD53 mice at 6 (p < 0.05), 8 (p < 0.01), and 10 (p < 0.01) months (ANOVA p < 0.0001; Figure 4B). These results demonstrate that preventing the generation of the caspase-6 cleavage fragment of mhtt is sufficient to prevent the motor dysfunction observed in the YAC model. Nuclear translocation of htt and formation of inclusions are neuropathological hallmarks of HD (Davies et al., 1997Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E.

USA. 2005; 102: 11402-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To investigate whether inhibiting caspase-6 cleavage of mhtt alters nuclear translocation of htt, brain sections from wt, CR, and YAC128 mice were immunostained with EM48, an antibody that recognizes N-terminal htt fragments and is highly specific for inclusions (Gutekunst et al., 1999Gutekunst C.A.

However, diffuse nuclear htt is observed at 3 months in the striatum of HD53 mice (Figure 5A). Nuclear htt increases with age, and by 12 months, the majority of striatal neurons demonstrate extensive EM48 staining (Figure 5C). In contrast, nuclear localization of mhtt is delayed in the C6R lines, with just detectable levels in the striatum at 9 months (Figure 5B), similar to HD53 striatum at 2 months (Van Raamsdonk et al., 2005aVan Raamsdonk J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2063465748,"High-level immune activation and T cell apoptosis represent a hallmark of HIV-1 infection that is absent from nonpathogenic SIV infections in natural primate hosts. The mechanisms causing these varying levels of immune activation are not understood. Here, we report that nef alleles from the great majority of primate lentiviruses, including HIV-2, downmodulate TCR-CD3 from infected T cells, thereby blocking their responsiveness to activation. In contrast, nef alleles from HIV-1 and a subset of closely related SIVs fail to downregulate TCR-CD3 and to inhibit cell death. Thus, Nef-mediated suppression of T cell activation is a fundamental property of primate lentiviruses that likely evolved to maintain viral persistence in the context of an intact host immune system. This function was lost during viral evolution in a lineage that gave rise to HIV-1 and may have predisposed the simian precursor of HIV-1 for greater pathogenicity in humans."

We propose the existence of a stress-dependent pathway in which SIR-2.1 and 14-3-3 act in parallel to the insulin-like pathway to activate DAF-16 and extend life span. C. elegans life span is controlled by an insulin/IGF signaling pathway, which includes the DAF-2 transmembrane receptor, a series of intracellular kinases, and the DAF-16 forkhead-family transcription factor (Guarente and Kenyon, 2000Guarente L.

This insulin/IGF pathway regulates the generation of dauer larvae, which are long-lived developmental variants that arise from second-stage (L2) larvae when conditions are harsh (Larsen et al., 1995Larsen P.L.

The forkhead family of transcription factors includes mammalian FOXO1, 3, and 4.

Transgenic worms with extra copies of sir-2.1 live longer than the wild-type. Because this longevity requires daf-16, it was proposed that sir-2.1 works by downregulating insulin signaling (Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Increased dosage of a sir-2 gene extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). This genetic inference was bolstered by the finding that transgenes overexpressing SIR-2.1 conferred no further extension in life span to daf-2 mutants (Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Increased dosage of a sir-2 gene extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanistic link between sir-2.1, the insulin/IGF pathway, and its target daf-16 is unknown. The proteins encoded by yeast SIR2 and its orthologs are NAD-dependent deacetylases (Blander and Guarente, 2004Blander G. Guarente L. The Sir2 family of protein deacetylases.Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1997; 268: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); the effect of the loss of ftt-2 function has not been described. In this report, we show that SIR-2.1 acts with 14-3-3 proteins to affect DAF-16 activity and life span. Our findings suggest that SIR-2.1 and 14-3-3 may act in parallel to the insulin-like pathway to regulate DAF-16 and extend life span. To identify SIR-2.1-interacting proteins in C. elegans, we raised a polyclonal antibody that recognizes worm SIR-2.1. Immunofluorescence studies using this antibody showed nuclear staining in wild-type animals (Figure 1A, left), consistent with the reported nuclear localization of the mammalian homolog Sirt1 (Langley et al., 2002Langley E. Pearson M. Faretta M. Bauer U.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Kouzarides T. Human SIR2 deacetylates p53 and antagonizes PML/p53-induced cellular senescence.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). No staining was seen in sir-2.1(ok434) mutants, which are deleted for the sir-2.1 gene (Figure 1A, right), indicating that this antibody is specific to SIR-2.1. We isolated SIR-2.1 protein complexes by coprecipitation with the anti-SIR-2.1 antibody and analyzed the complexes by mass spectrometry. We assayed lysates of three different strains: the wild-type (N2), sir-2.1(ok434Δ) (which does not produce full-length SIR-2.1 protein), and a transgenic sir-2.1 overexpressor (O/E). We detected SIR-2.1 and one additional protein in the sir-2.1(O/E) lysate (Figure 1B). This protein was subjected to mass spectrometry, which revealed that it contained both C. elegans 14-3-3-like proteins, PAR-5 and FTT-2, and no other proteins (Figure 1C). PAR-5 and FTT-2 share 88% sequence identity and are 78% (PAR-5) and 82% (FTT-2) identical to human 14-3-3ζ. To address whether SIR-2.1/14-3-3 interaction also occurs in wild-type animals with endogenous levels of SIR-2.1, we repeated the anti-SIR-2.1 immunoprecipitations and analyzed the precipitates by Western blotting using antibody raised against mouse 14-3-3 recognizing both C. elegans 14-3-3 proteins (Figure 1D). We detected 14-3-3 immunoreactivity in SIR-2.1 precipitates isolated from both the wild-type and the sir-2.1-overexpressing strain. The precipitation of another C. elegans deacetylase protein, HDA-1, from wild-type worm lysates did not contain 14-3-3, indicating that the interaction is specific to SIR-2.1 (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). 14-3-3 proteins in C. elegans are mostly localized to the cytoplasm (Wang and Shakes, 1997Wang W. Shakes D.C. Expression patterns and transcript processing of ftt-1 and ftt-2, two C. elegans 14–3–3 homologues.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In mammals, 14-3-3 proteins are known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Brunet et al., 2002Brunet A. Kanai F. Stehn J. Xu J. Sarbassova D. Frangioni J.V. Dalal S.N. DeCaprio J.A.

The ins and outs of FoxO shuttling: mechanisms of FoxO translocation and transcriptional regulation.Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). To see whether 14-3-3 proteins are present in C. elegans nuclei, we performed cell fractionation experiments. While we detected SIR-2.1 protein in the nuclear fraction but not in the cytosolic fraction, 14-3-3 proteins were present in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions (Figure 1E). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the interaction between SIR-2.1 and 14-3-3 proteins occurs in the nucleus. Since mammalian 14-3-3 proteins bind phosphorylated FOXO proteins (the homologs of DAF-16) and control their subcellular localization (Brunet et al., 1999Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

We used RNA-mediated gene interference (RNAi) to reduce the expression of the 14-3-3 genes. Progeny of animals fed with bacteria expressing par-5 RNAi expressed a maternal-effect lethal phenotype similar to that previously described for par-5 loss-of-function (lf) mutants (Morton et al., 2002Morton D.G. Shakes D.C. Nugent S. Dichoso D. Wang W. Golden A. Kemphues K.J. The Caenorhabditis elegans par-5 gene encodes a 14–3–3 protein required for cellular asymmetry in the early embryo.Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The progeny of animals fed with ftt-2 RNAi frequently retained eggs and died of internally hatched progeny, a phenotype similar to that of ftt-2(lf) mutants (see below). Feeding par-5 or ftt-2 RNAi did not cause any apparent abnormalities in animals that were transferred to RNAi plates as L4 larvae or as adults. At the protein level, par-5(RNAi) had a minimal effect on the level of total 14-3-3 proteins (data not shown), whereas ftt-2(RNAi) caused substantial reduction in 14-3-3 protein level (see below). It is important to note that the two C. elegans 14-3-3 genes are very similar, so it is possible that RNAi of one gene would result in reduction of function of the other. Nevertheless, we believe that at least some of the RNAi effects are gene specific since par-5(RNAi) but not ftt-2(RNAi) resulted in a maternal-effect lethal phenotype similar to that caused by mutation in par-5, and ftt-2(RNAi) but not par-5(RNAi) resulted in a lower level of 14-3-3 proteins. First, we examined DAF-16 localization in animals expressing lower levels of 14-3-3 using a functional DAF-16::GFP (Lee et al., 2001Lee R.Y. Hench J. Ruvkun G. Regulation of C. elegans DAF-16 and its human ortholog FKHRL1 by the daf-2 insulin-like signaling pathway.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1950-1957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we used four nonoverlapping RNAi clones, two targeting each of the two 14-3-3 genes, par-5 and ftt-2 (see Experimental Procedures). Under normal conditions, DAF-16::GFP has a diffuse, mostly cytoplasmic localization. Reducing the expression of par-5 or ftt-2 or both by RNAi caused a pronounced nuclear accumulation of DAF-16::GFP (Figure 2A). Nuclear DAF-16::GFP localization was most prominent in the intestinal cells but was also apparent in muscle and hypodermis (we scored animals as positive for nuclear DAF-16::GFP if most or all intestinal cells showed nuclear GFP). We did not see GFP accumulation in neuronal nuclei, perhaps because of the previously described insensitivity of this tissue to RNAi (Timmons et al., 2001Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Ingestion of bacterially expressed dsRNAs can produce specific and potent genetic interference in Caenorhabditis elegans.Gene. 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). RNAi targeting of ftt-2 led to nuclear DAF-16::GFP in 68% or 100% of animals, depending on the RNAi clone used, while par-5 RNAi caused nuclear DAF-16::GFP in about 50% of animals (Table 1). The par-5 RNAi result suggests that this biological assay of DAF-16::GFP localization is likely more sensitive than Western blots, in which we could not detect a significant reduction in 14-3-3 level following par-5(RNAi) feeding. In addition to altering the localization of DAF-16::GFP, ftt-2(RNAi) but not par-5(RNAi) caused arrest at the L2–L3 larval stages of the progeny of daf-16::gfp animals. Larval arrest was not observed when wild-type animals were subjected to ftt-2(RNAi) and may have been a consequence of the increased nuclear localization of overexpressed DAF-16::GFP.Table 1Reducing par-5 and ftt-2 by RNAi Results in Nuclear Accumulation of DAF-16::GFP% Nuclear DAF-16::GFP% Arrested LarvaeL3 Larvae (n)Adults (n)RNAi vector0 (123)0 (>200)0par-5 RNAi (N-terminal)18 (82)50 (80)0ftt-2 RNAi (N-terminal)100 (91)NA100par-5+ftt-2 RNAi (N-terminal)100 (66)NA96par-5 RNAi (C-terminal)ND48 (219)0ftt-2 RNAi (C-terminal)68 (520)NA80GFP localization was scored using fluorescence microscopy to observe the progeny of young adults fed the indicated RNAi bacteria.

All animals with any cells containing nuclear GFP were scored as positive for nuclear DAF-16::GFP. n = total number of animals examined, ND = not determined, NA = nonapplicable because of larval arrest. To confirm that loss of ftt-2 function can alter DAF-16 localization, we generated an ftt-2 mutant strain by screening a library of chemically mutagenized animals using PCR (Jansen et al., 1997Jansen G. Hazendonk E. Thijssen K.L. Plasterk R.H. Reverse genetics by chemical mutagenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nat.

Hardiman G. et al.High-throughput isolation of Caenorhabditis elegans deletion mutants.Genome Res. 1999; 9: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). ftt-2(n4426Δ) worms bear a 668 bp deletion that removes part of the promoter and the start codon of the predicted ftt-2 gene and therefore is a good candidate for being a null allele of ftt-2. These mutants develop normally but die in early adulthood because of bursting at the vulva or internal hatching of progeny (data not shown). We introduced the daf-16::gfp transgene into the ftt-2(n4426Δ) strain. Larvae homozygous for ftt-2(Δ) had nuclear DAF-16::GFP, similar to animals treated with ftt-2(RNAi) (Figure 2B), indicating that ftt-2 function may be required for the proper subcellular localization of DAF-16. These experiments suggest that, as proposed for the homologous proteins in mammals, C. elegans 14-3-3 proteins can act to retain the forkhead protein DAF-16 in the cytoplasm. We next asked whether SIR-2.1 levels could also affect the cellular localization of DAF-16. We crossed the daf-16::gfp transgene into two different long-lived strains that overexpress SIR-2.1, geIn3 and pkIs1642. The DAF-16::GFP localization in these strains was cytoplasmic, as in the control strain with wild-type levels of SIR-2.1 (data not shown). We conclude that, under normal conditions, SIR-2.1 overexpression does not affect DAF-16 localization. As FTT-2 and PAR-5 interac"

Previous compositional analyses have focused only on individual sphingolipid classes because of the widely differing polarities of plant sphingolipids. Consequently, the total content of sphingolipid classes in plants has yet to be quantified. In addition, the major polar sphingolipid class in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has not been previously determined. In this report, we describe the separation and quantification of sphingolipid classes from A. thaliana leaves using hydrolysis of sphingolipids and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of o-phthaldialdehyde derivatives of the released long-chain bases to monitor the separation steps. An extraction solvent that contained substantial proportions of water was used to solubilized >95% of the sphingolipids from leaves. Neutral and charged sphingolipids were then partitioned by anion exchange solid phase extraction. HPLC analysis of the charged lipid fraction from A. thaliana revealed only one major anionic sphingolipid class, which was identified by mass spectrometry as hexose-hexuronic-inositolphosphoceramide. The neutral sphingolipids were predominantly composed of monohexosylceramide with lesser amounts of ceramides. Extraction and separation of sphingolipids from soybean and tomato showed that, like A. thaliana, the neutral sphingolipids consisted of ceramide and monohexosylceramides; however, the major polar sphingolipid was found to be N-acetyl-hexosamine-hexuronic-inositolphosphoceramide. In extracts from A. thaliana leaves, hexosehexuronic-inositolphosphoceramides, monohexosylceramides, and ceramides accounted for approximately 64, 34, and 2% of the total sphingolipids, respectively, suggesting an important role for the anionic sphingolipids in plant membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2091328421,"Eukaryotic translation termination is triggered by peptide release factors eRF1 and eRF3. Whereas eRF1 recognizes all three termination codons and induces hydrolysis of peptidyl tRNA, eRF3's function remains obscure. Here, we reconstituted all steps of eukaryotic translation in vitro using purified ribosomal subunits; initiation, elongation, and termination factors; and aminoacyl tRNAs. This allowed us to investigate termination using pretermination complexes assembled on mRNA encoding a tetrapeptide and to propose a model for translation termination that accounts for the cooperative action of eRF1 and eRF3 in ensuring fast release of nascent polypeptide. In this model, binding of eRF1, eRF3, and GTP to pretermination complexes first induces a structural rearrangement that is manifested as a 2 nucleotide forward shift of the toeprint attributed to pretermination complexes that leads to GTP hydrolysis followed by rapid hydrolysis of peptidyl tRNA. Cooperativity between eRF1 and eRF3 required the eRF3 binding C-terminal domain of eRF1."

We demonstrate that NMD in yeast targets premature termination codon (PTC)-containing mRNA to P-bodies. Upf1p is sufficient for targeting mRNAs to P-bodies, whereas Upf2p and Upf3p act, at least in part, downstream of P-body targeting to trigger decapping. The ATPase activity of Upf1p is required for NMD after the targeting of mRNAs to P-bodies. Moreover, Upf1p can target normal mRNAs to P-bodies but not promote their degradation. These observations lead us to propose a new model for NMD wherein two successive steps are used to distinguish normal and aberrant mRNAs."

The proliferation of stem cells is orchestrated, in part, by neighboring cells, forming the stem cell niche (Fuchs et al., 2004Fuchs E. Tumbar T. Guasch G.

This prompted us to analyze whether ephrins and Eph receptors, in addition to their role in directing cell migration, may participate in the control of proliferative homeostasis in the intestinal stem cell niche. We find by gain- and loss-of-function experiments that B subclass ephrins and Eph receptors, independently of their influence on cell positioning, promote proliferation in the crypts of the small intestine and colon and account for about 50% of the mitogenic activity. EphB2 and EphB3 kinase-dependent signaling promote cell-cycle reentry of intestinal progenitor cells. These data establish that ephrins and Eph receptors are key coordinators of migration and proliferation in the intestinal stem cell niche. Progenitor cells in the colon express EphB2 and EphB3, whereas differentiating cells express ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 (Figures 1A and S1) (Batlle et al., 2002Batlle E. Henderson J.T.

As stem cells cannot confidently be identified in the intestine we refer to stem and progenitor cells collectively as progenitor cells. We analyzed mice with null mutations in EphB2 and EphB3 (EphB2−/−; EphB3−/−) as well as mice that lack EphB3 and have a kinase-inactive (ki) form of EphB2 in which the intracellular domain is replaced by β-galactosidase (EphB2ki/ki; EphB3−/−) (Henkemeyer et al., 1996Henkemeyer M.

Progenitor cells in the colon reside at the bottom of epithelial invaginations known as the crypts of Lieberkühn (Marshman et al., 2002Marshman E. Booth C. Potten C.S.

They give rise to absorptive enterocytes, the main cell type of the epithelium, mucus-producing goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells. In both double mutant combinations, we observed an approximately 50% decrease in the number of cells that were immunoreactive for PCNA or Ki-67, markers of proliferating cells, or that incorporated BrdU in colon crypts (Figures 1B and 1D–1F). There was no increase in the number of dying cells that could explain the reduction in proliferating cells (Figure 1C). These data establish EphB receptors as positive regulators of proliferation in colon crypts. In addition to the cell types produced in the colon, another differentiated cell type, the Paneth cell, is generated in the small intestine. Paneth cells are terminally differentiated cells that have antimicrobial functions and are localized at the bottom of the crypt (Ayabe et al., 2004Ayabe T. Ashida T. Kohgo Y. Kono T. The role of Paneth cells and their antimicrobial peptides in innate host defense.Trends Microbiol. 2004; 12: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Progenitor cells in the small intestine reside just above the Paneth cell compartment (Marshman et al., 2002Marshman E. Booth C. Potten C.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Paneth cells express mainly EphB3, which is required for their positioning, and the progenitor cells above them in the crypt express mainly EphB2, although there is an overlap in the expression domains of EphB2 and EphB3 (Figures 2A and 2B) (Batlle et al., 2002Batlle E. Henderson J.T. Beghtel H. van den Born M.M.W. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. Robertson J. van de Wetering M. Pawson T.

Ephrin-B1 is expressed in a countergradient in wild-type mice (Figures 2A and 2B), whereas ephrin-B1-immunoreactive cells are scattered throughout the crypt in EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice (Figure 2C) (Batlle et al., 2002Batlle E. Henderson J.T. Beghtel H. van den Born M.M.W. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. Robertson J. van de Wetering M. Pawson T.

Analysis of the small intestine of adult EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice did not reveal any significant difference in the total number of dividing cells, but a redistribution of proliferating cells within the crypt was observed (Figures 2D–2G). The postmitotic Paneth cells are displaced from the bottom of the crypts in the absence of EphB signaling (Batlle et al., 2002Batlle E. Henderson J.T. Beghtel H. van den Born M.M.W. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. Robertson J. van de Wetering M. Pawson T.

This is reminiscent of the situation in mice lacking Paneth cells, in which proliferation in the crypt is increased (Garabedian et al., 1997Garabedian E.M. Roberts L.J. McNevin M.S. Gordon J.I. Examining the role of Paneth cells in the small intestine by lineage ablation in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23729-23740Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, Stappenbeck et al., 2003Stappenbeck T.S. Mills J.C. Gordon J.I. Molecular features of adult mouse small intestinal epithelial progenitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, analysis of cell proliferation in the side of the crypt, where the majority of proliferating progenitor cells normally are located, revealed a significant reduction in cell proliferation in this compartment in EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice relative to wild-type mice (gray bars in Figure 2G). Thus, the mislocation of postmitotic Paneth cells allows proliferation at the bottom of the crypt, whereas proliferation in the normal progenitor niche is reduced, thus resulting in similar total numbers of proliferating cells in the crypts of EphB2; EphB3 mutant and wild-type mice. This finding suggested that the loss of postmitotic Paneth cells from the bottom of the crypt, allowing progenitor cells to occupy this niche, might mask an effect of EphB receptors on proliferation in the progenitor compartment in the side of the crypt in small intestine. To address this possibility, we compared proliferation in the different compartments of the crypt in EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice to that in transgenic mice expressing the diphtheria toxin A subunit under the Paneth cell-specific cryptidin-2 promoter (CR2-tox176 mice) (Garabedian et al., 1997Garabedian E.M. Roberts L.J. McNevin M.S. Gordon J.I. Examining the role of Paneth cells in the small intestine by lineage ablation in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23729-23740Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, Stappenbeck et al., 2003Stappenbeck T.S. Mills J.C. Gordon J.I. Molecular features of adult mouse small intestinal epithelial progenitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). CR2-tox176 mice lack Paneth cells but are otherwise normal and thus allow the examination of the effect of cell mislocation within the crypt on proliferation, without perturbing EphB signaling. In both EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice and CR2-tox176 mice, there was an increase in the number of proliferating cells in the crypt bottom compared to wild-type mice due to the loss of postmitotic Paneth cells from this compartment (Figure 2H). The relative increase in the number of proliferating cells was larger in this compartment in CR2-tox176 mice (approximately 5-fold) than in EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice (approximately 3-fold), compared to their respective wild-type controls. Most importantly, whereas there was a significant reduction in proliferation in the normal progenitor domain in the side of the crypt in the EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice, there was no decrease in proliferation in this compartment in CR2-tox176 mice (Figure 2I). The absence of Paneth cells from the crypts in CR2-tox176 mice, but not in EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice, is accompanied by increased total proliferation (Garabedian et al., 1997Garabedian E.M. Roberts L.J. McNevin M.S. Gordon J.I. Examining the role of Paneth cells in the small intestine by lineage ablation in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23729-23740Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, the redistribution of proliferative cells in the crypts of EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice, due to the loss of postmitotic Paneth cells from the bottom of the crypts, masks an effect on proliferation of EphB receptors in the small intestine (illustrated in Figure 2J). This is in contrast to the colon, which lacks Paneth cells, and where there is an approximately 50% reduction in the number of proliferative cells in the crypts in EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice (Figure 1). Analysis of either EphB2 or EphB3 single mutant mice did not reveal significant alterations in cell proliferation in any crypt compartment, indicating that these receptors have, at least partly, redundant function in the regulation of proliferation. Furthermore, cell death in small intestine crypts was not significantly affected by abolished EphB signaling (1.1 ± 0.2 in wild-type, 0.6 ± 0.1 in EphB2−/−; EphB3−/−, and 0.7 ± 0.2 TUNEL+ cells/crypt and section in EphB2ki/ki; EphB3−/− mice, mean ± SEM, p > 0.05). Proliferation was reduced by a similar magnitude in EphB2−/−; EphB3−/− and EphB2ki/ki; EphB3−/− mice in both the colon and in the side compartment in small intestine crypts (Figures 1B and 2G), establishing that the effect on proliferation is mediated by kinase-dependent signaling. The analyses of mutant mice demonstrate a role for EphB2 and EphB3 in regulating proliferation in the intestine, but it remains difficult to dissociate the effect on migration from an effect on proliferation, especially in the small intestine. Moreover, it is not possible from the analyses of mutant mice to exclude the possibility that EphB receptors may regulate an earlier developmental step and that the intestinal progenitor cells at later time points are intrinsically different and less proliferative. We therefore sought to acutely modulate EphB signaling in wild-type mice to analyze the role of EphB signaling on progenitor proliferation independent of cell positioning. Ephrins have to be clustered in a cell membrane or artificially with, for example, antibodies to efficiently activate Eph receptors (Davis et al., 1994Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D.

Eph receptors discriminate specific ligand oligomers to determine alternative signaling complexes, attachment, and assembly responses.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Unclustered soluble monomeric or dimeric ephrins bind Eph receptors but are often weak agonists or antagonists (Vearing and Lackmann, 2005Vearing C.J. Lackmann M. Eph receptor signalling; dimerisation just isn't enough.Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We administered unclustered monomeric ephrin-B2 ectodomains (ephrin-B2), ephrin-B2-Fc, antibody-clustered ephrin-B2-Fc, EphB2-Fc, control Fc protein, or vehicle (PBS) systemically by intravenous injection to modulate EphB signaling acutely in vivo in wild-type mice. The serum concentrations of injected proteins were sufficiently high to maintain significant systemic levels for several days (Figure 3A). Visualization of injected proteins in sections of the intestine revealed prominent ephrin-B2-Fc binding specifically in the crypts of the intestine but did not reveal any bound protein in animals receiving the control Fc protein (Figures 3B–3E). Visualization of injected ephrin-B2-Fc and endogenous EphB2 showed a close overlap indicating that ephrin-B2-Fc specifically binds to EphB receptors in the intestine (Figure 3E). We were unable to detect antibody-clustered ephrin-B2-Fc complexes in the intestine (data not shown), suggesting that they may be too large to exit the vasculature. One day after the injection of recombinant proteins, the distribution of EphB2-expressing progenitor cells was unaffected and no Paneth cells were seen outside their normal domain at the bottom of the crypt (Figures 3F and 3G). However, in animals analyzed 3 days after the injection, a few displaced Paneth cells started to appear, phenocopying the EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice, indicating that EphB signaling was inhibited (Figures 3H and 3I). We next asked whether EphB receptor phosphorylation was affected by the injection of ephrin-B2, ephrin-B2-Fc, or EphB2-Fc. We found significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of EphB2 in the colon of ephrin-B2, ephrin-B2-Fc, and EphB-Fc injected mice compared to control Fc or vehicle-injected mice (Figures 3J and 3K), establishing these reagents as antagonists of EphB signaling in this context. Analysis of cell proliferation revealed that reduction in EphB2 phosphorylation (Figure 3) was accompanied by a significant decrease in the total number of proliferating cells in crypts of the small intestine as soon as 1 day after the injection of ephrin-B2, ephrin-B2-Fc, or EphB2-Fc compared to the control Fc protein (Figures 4A–4E). Quantification of cell proliferation in the different compartments of the crypt revealed that proliferation was unaffected or mildly reduced in the Paneth cell compartment at the bottom of the crypt but reduced to 45%–64% of that seen in control Fc-injected animals in the progenitor domain in the side of the crypt 1 day after the injection of ephrin-B2, ephrin-B2-Fc, or EphB2-Fc (all p < 0.0005, Figure 4E). The reduced proliferation upon acute inhibition of EphB signaling was accompanied by a reduction in the length of the villi in the small intestine after 3 days (Figure 4F). This was in contrast to what was observed in EphB2; EphB3 mutant mice, where total proliferation (Figure 2) and villi length were similar to that seen in wild-type mice (Figure 4F). A reduction in the number of BrdU-incorporating cells to 48%–54% of that in Fc-injected animals was also seen in the colon after injection of ephrin-B2, ephrin-B2-Fc, or EphB2-Fc (all p < 0.001, Figure 4G), mimicking the effect of EphB2 and EphB3 deletion (Figure 1). Apoptotic cell death in crypts was not significantly affected by the inhibition of EphB signaling (0.53 ± 0.03 and 0.42 ± 0.08 TUNEL+ cells/crypt and section in ephrin-B2-Fc and Fc-injected animals, respectively, mean ± SEM, p > 0.05). Since cell positioning was unaffected 1 day after the ephrin-B2-Fc or EphB2-Fc injections, and only mildly affected after 3 days, this experiment dissociates the role of EphB signaling on cell migration and proliferation. The strong reduction in proliferation establishes a major role for EphB receptors in regulating intestinal progenitor proliferation, independent of their function in cell positioning. To further examine the potential role of EphB signaling on intestinal progenitor cell proliferation, we devised two gain-of-function strategies to examine the effect of increased EphB signaling. In the first approach, we overexpressed the ligand ephrin-B2 in the intestinal epithelium by electroporation in explant culture. The ephrin-B2 expression construct contained an IRES followed by GFP, allowing us to visualize ephrin-B2-overexpressing cells and to quantify the proliferation of adjacent cells (Figures 5A–5D). Overexpression of ephrin-B2 resulted in a statistically significant 44% increase in proliferation compared to the GFP control construct (Figure 5E). Since these experiments are performed in explant culture where the blood circulation is disrupted, they argue against the effects of EphB signaling on proliferation in the intestinal epithelium as secondary to altered EphB function in the vasculature. In a second gain-of-function approach, we generated a point mutation in the mouse EphB2 ge"

Defined, sequence-specific pause sites have been identified biochemically. Single-molecule studies have also shown that bacterial RNAP pauses frequently during transcriptional elongation, but the relationship of these ""ubiquitous"" pauses to the underlying DNA sequence has been uncertain. We employed an ultrastable optical-trapping assay to follow the motion of individual molecules of RNAP transcribing templates engineered with repeated sequences carrying imbedded, sequence-specific pause sites of known regulatory function. Both the known and ubiquitous pauses appeared at reproducible locations, identified with base-pair accuracy. Ubiquitous pauses were associated with DNA sequences that show similarities to regulatory pause sequences. Data obtained for the lifetimes and efficiencies of pauses support a model where the transition to pausing branches off of the normal elongation pathway and is mediated by a common elemental state, which corresponds to the ubiquitous pause."
https://openalex.org/W2157485672,"Transcription regulatory networks consist of physical and functional interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes. The systematic mapping of TF-target gene interactions has been pioneered in unicellular systems, using “TF-centered” methods (e.g., chromatin immunoprecipitation). However, metazoan systems are less amenable to such methods. Here, we used “gene-centered” high-throughput yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays to identify 283 interactions between 72 C. elegans digestive tract gene promoters and 117 proteins. The resulting protein-DNA interaction (PDI) network is highly connected and enriched for TFs that are expressed in the digestive tract. We provide functional annotations for ∼10% of all worm TFs, many of which were previously uncharacterized, and find ten novel putative TFs, illustrating the power of a gene-centered approach. We provide additional in vivo evidence for multiple PDIs and illustrate how the PDI network provides insights into metazoan differential gene expression at a systems level."
https://openalex.org/W1972587297,"Regulation of transcription initiation is generally attributable to activator/repressor proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences.

Binding of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP; subunit composition α2ββ'ωσ) to promoter DNA has been characterized extensively using genetic, biochemical, and structural methods (see Helmann and deHaseth, 1999Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L.

Landick R. The structure of bacterial RNA polymerase.in: Higgins N.P. The Bacterial Chromosome. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2005: 283-296Google Scholar for reviews). The σ70 subunit interacts with the core promoter (including the −10, extended −10, and −35 elements), and the α subunit binds to the UP element (the DNA upstream of the −35 element). However, the molecular interactions and conformational changes that determine the rates of individual steps in transcription initiation and the paths of the separated DNA strands in the complex are not well understood. Transcription initiation is a multistep process (Helmann and deHaseth, 1999Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Protein-nucleic acid interactions during open complex formation investigated by systematic alteration of the protein and DNA binding partners.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5959-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). RNAP first associates with the promoter to form a closed complex (RPc) that isomerizes through at least one intermediate (RPi) to form an open complex (RPo) in which the DNA strands surrounding the start site are separated. RNAP then binds the initiating NTP and ultimately forms a processive transcription elongation complex (TEC). The kinetic constants used to describe steps on the pathway to RPo formation (illustrated in the scheme below) are often referred to as ka, the overall association rate constant; kd, the composite dissociation rate constant; KB, the initial equilibrium constant; and ki, the composite isomerization rate constant. Detailed kinetic studies indicate that different promoters have rate constants that are promoter-specific (e.g., Saecker et al., 2002Saecker R.M. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax Jr., P.E. Capp M.W. Record Jr., M.T.

RPo (or a competitor-resistant precursor complex in rapid equilibrium with RPo) is very long-lived at most E. coli promoters under standard assay conditions. However, rRNA and many tRNA promoters are unusual in that their competitor-resistant complex is very short-lived. Previous work led to the proposal that this kinetic property sensitizes rRNA promoters to regulation in vivo by small molecules and factors that do not bind DNA (Gourse, 1988Gourse R.L.

The concentrations of two small molecule effectors, ppGpp and the initiating NTP (iNTP), change at different times in growth. ppGpp concentrations change dramatically during nutritional shifts (including the starvation response referred to as “stringent control”) and with changes in steady-state growth rate, whereas NTP concentations change dramatically with growth phase (Murray et al., 2003Murray H.D.

However, the features that determine the short lifetime are not understood. rrn P1 core promoters have sequences in common that could contribute to their distinctive halflives (Figure 1A). These include a nonconsensus −35 element, a shortened −10/−35 spacer element (16 versus 17 bp), the absence of an extended −10 element, and the presence of a G+C-rich region downstream of the −10 element referred to as the “discriminator” (Travers, 1980Travers A.A. Promoter sequence for stringent control of bacterial ribonucleic acid synthesis.J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 973-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the discriminator have focused on its high G+C content and thus on its potential as an impediment to strand-separation (e.g., Lamond and Travers, 1985Lamond A.I. Travers A.A.

Here we utilize a large library of rRNA promoter mutants to investigate features that contribute to the lifetime of the promoter complex. These studies not only reveal a strong correlation between the lifetime of the complex and regulation of rRNA transcription, but they identify a previously unknown sequence-specific promoter interaction with a highly conserved region of the RNAP σ subunit. This interaction is disfavored in rRNA promoter complexes. The kinetic consequence of this nonoptimal interaction is a short-lived complex that is regulated by transcription factors that bind to RNAP rather than to DNA. In contrast to the case for most promoters, at rrn P1 promoters the RPc ↔ RPo equilibrium is shifted far to the left in the absence of NTPs, and when challenged with a competitor, open complexes are almost undetectable because they decay so rapidly (Gourse, 1988Gourse R.L.

To identify interactions that might account for rRNA regulation, we identified rrnB P1 promoter mutations that affected the lifetime of the complex with RNAP. The lifetimes of rrnB P1 promoter complexes containing an UP element (wild-type, −88 to +1) or lacking an UP element (rrnB P1 ΔUP) were essentially the same (Table 1A), consistent with our previous conclusion that αCTD-DNA interactions do not affect the longevity of other promoter complexes (Ross and Gourse, 2005Ross W.

The halflife of the wild-type promoter complex was ∼12 min in the 60 mM NaCl buffer and ∼5 min in the 75 mM NaCl buffer. To determine the sequences responsible for the characteristic halflife of the rrnB P1 complex, we selected promoters that formed longer-lived complexes in vitro from a library of all possible single and double substitutions between −38 and +7 (created by “doped DNA synthesis”). After multiple rounds of RNAP binding, heparin challenge, separation of complexes from free DNA on gels, amplification, and cloning (see Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Data), 168 individual promoters were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Thirty-eight promoters with single substitutions were identified, representing eight different alleles (Figure 1B). Thirty-six of the 38 had a mutation in the discriminator region (−8 to −1), of which 31 were at a single position, −7, two bp downstream of the −10 hexamer. Previously, it was suggested that effects of G+C content on strand separation accounted for conservation of the discriminator sequence in rRNA promoters. However, 22 of the 31 mutations at −7 were C to G substitutions (C −7G), suggesting that the identity of the −7 base, not just its G+C content, accounted for its identification in our selection. Other single discriminator mutations were A or T substitutions at −7, −6, −4, or −1 (Figure 1B), suggesting that G+C content also affects discriminator function (see below and Lamond and Travers, 1985Lamond A.I. Travers A.A. Stringent control of bacterial transcription.Cell. 1985; 41: 6-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, Josaitis et al., 1995Josaitis C.A. Gaal T. Gourse R.L.

Commun. 1997; 230: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Two single substitutions were also found in the bp immediately upstream of the −10 hexamer (position −15; see Becker and Hengge-Aronis, 2001Becker G. Hengge-Aronis R. What makes an Escherichia coli promoter σS- dependent? Role of the -13/-14 nucleotide promoter positions and region 2.5 of σS.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the remaining 130 selected promoters, 14 contained single insertions in the −10/−35 spacer, increasing spacer length from 16 bp to the consensus 17 bp for E. coli Eσ70-dependent promoters. The other 116 contained more than one mutation, and one of these mutations was in the discriminator region in all but five cases (data not shown). Thus, the 168 promoter variants can be attributed to a very small number of changes in promoter sequence, the vast majority of which were in the discriminator sequence, and a single substitution, C-7G, dominated the selection. The above results suggested that the specific sequence as well as the G+C content of the discriminator region plays a critical role in determining rrnB P1 complex lifetime. To quantify the effects of C-7G and the other substitutions and to investigate the potential for sequence-specific effects at positions other than −7, we determined decay rates of complexes formed by a variety of rrnB P1 promoter mutants (both selected and site-directed; Figures 1C and 1D; Table 1; Supplemental Data). The fraction of complexes remaining at various times after competitor addition was quantified by transcription and is expressed relative to that of the wild-type complex determined concurrently under the same conditions. C-7G formed a 37-fold longer-lived complex than the wild-type promoter, an even larger effect than substitutions at this position that altered G+C content (C-7A, 22-fold; C-7T, 13-fold) and a larger effect than any other single substitution in the entire promoter. Two other substitutions in the discriminator that altered sequence but not G+C content, C–5G and G–6C, also increased complex lifetime, but much less than C-7G (2 to 3-fold). Substitutions that altered the promoter sequence at other discriminator positions without changing G+C content had little or no effect on halflife (G-8C, C-4G, C-2G, C-1G, A-3G versus A-3C). All single substitutions that decreased discriminator G+C content increased halflife, and rrnB P1 dis, which contains three consecutive G+C to A+T mutations, increased halflife ∼60-fold. We conclude that G+C content, in addition to the identity of specific bases, affects lifetime, consistent with conclusions of previous studies that discriminator G+C content affects stable RNA regulation (e.g., Lamond and Travers, 1985Lamond A.I. Travers A.A. Stringent control of bacterial transcription.Cell. 1985; 41: 6-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, Jung and Lee, 1997Jung Y.H. Lee Y.

Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Changes in other regions of the rrnB P1 core promoter affected lifetime in accord with expectations. Mutations that increased the similarity of the −35 element to the Eσ70 consensus, or created consensus extended −10 elements, or increased the −10/−35 spacer length to 17 bp, increased the lifetime of the promoter complex. A mutation in the −10 element that decreased the similarity to the consensus decreased lifetime. Thus, although the identity of the base at −7 had the largest effect of any single base on halflife, several interactions between the promoter and RNAP contribute to the overall dissociation rate. Substitutions that altered the sequence of the −10/−35 spacer without changing its length or that altered the initial transcribed sequence had relatively small effects on lifetime. The unexpected importance of the bp at −7 on the dissociation rate prompted us to examine whether the C-7G mutation altered the association rate as well. Therefore, we measured the association rate at a series of RNAP concentrations (Figure 1E; Supplemental Data). The calculated kinetic parameters for the mutant and wild-type promoters (ka, ki, KB; illustrated schematically in the Introduction) are provided in Figure 1F. The C-7G mutation increased ka 11-fold relative to the wild-type promoter. All but 2-fold of this increase (5.8-fold) was on ki. Since ki includes contributions from microscopic rate constants both in the forward and reverse directions (see appendix in Barker et al., 2001bBarker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L.

Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar for a mathematical description of the rate constants that contribute to ki), these results are consistent with those in the previous section that the discriminator–RNAP interaction affects step(s) primarily after formation of the closed complex. As reported previously (Gourse, 1988Gourse R.L. Visualization and quantitative analysis of complex formation between E. coli RNA polymerase and an rRNA promoter in vitro.Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9789-9809Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), rrnB P1 made few or no abortive products when all four NTPs were present. This was also the case for the C-7G mutant promoter (data not shown). We next tested effects of the C-7G mutation on regulation of rrnB P1 promoter activity by the small molecule regulator ppGpp and its cofactor DksA in vitro. Under the solution conditions tested, using either multiple-round (Figure 2A) or single-round (Figure 2B) transcription assays, either ppGpp or DksA alone inhibited the wild-type promoter only slightly, but the two together inhibited transcription ∼5- to 15-fold (left panels in Figures 2A and 2B; see also Paul et al., 2004aPaul B.J.

Access to a nutritious blood meal has been gained independently numerous times and in various families and orders during invertebrate evolution (1Ribeiro J.M. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to other successful arthropod bloodsuckers, which feed rapidly, hard ticks feed on their hosts for several days (2Sauer J.R. McSwain J.L. Bowman A.S. Essenberg R.C. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1995; 40: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As a consequence, they have evolved a series of strategies to circumvent host defenses during their prolonged meal. Among them, the shedding of saliva in the sites of bite(s) possesses a critical role (3Ribeiro J.M. Francischetti I.M. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2003; 48: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Tick saliva contains a broad repertoire of potent pharmacologic molecules with vasoactive, antihemostatic, antiinflammatory, and immunomodulatory action (4Wikel S.K. Bergman D. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 383-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A serious side effect of this saliva action in sites of infestation is facilitation of the transmission of tick-borne pathogens (5Gern L. Schaible U.E. Simon M.M. J. Infect.

Large numbers of protease inhibitors were found to be expressed in the tick salivary glands, including a potentially secreted peptide with mature molecular mass of 12.5 kDa containing the conserved cystatin domain. Cystatins are natural tight binding reversible inhibitors of papain-like cysteine proteases that, in turn, have traditionally been considered as mediators of the terminal bulk proteolysis inside the lysosome. As a result, the vertebrate cystatins have been the focus of extensive research as the guardians or regulators that ensure protection of cells and tissues against the undesirable scission of peptide bonds and damage that could be caused when cysteine proteases are released outside their normal compartment. Within the last decade, a series of elegant studies changed the limited housekeeping view about cysteine proteases and showed their much more expanded and specific role in certain aspects of vertebrate biology (7Turk B.

Biophys. 1968; 125: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a body of information has been accumulated for this superfamily of proteins present in vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and protozoa. Cystatins are further subdivided into three individual families, namely 1, 2, and 3. Family 1 members (also known as stefins) are cytosolic molecules with neither disulfide bonds nor carbohydrates. Family 2 contains all of the secreted cystatins that are mainly found in biologic fluids; they form two disulfide bridges, and they do not bear sugars. In contrast to the members of the previous two families, which possess a single cystatin-like domain and display low molecular mass (11-14 kDa), each family 3 cystatin (also known as kininogens) is made of several cystatin modules, thus being relatively larger molecules (60-120 kDa) (18Vray B. Hartmann S. Hoebeke J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Secreted cystatins have been found in various nonvertebrate organisms, with those expressed by nematode parasites already shown to play a role of cardinal importance in evasion of the host defense system and in modulation of the immune response (19Hartmann S. Lucius R. Int. J. Parasitol. 2003; 33: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although members of the cystatin family are present in ectoparasites, too, including ticks, little is known of their specificity or function. A recent study showed that a cystatin is important for the feeding success of the tick Amblyomma americanum, but the target enzymes and the mechanism of action remain still unknown (20Karim S. Miller N.J. Valenzuela J. Sauer J.R. Mather T.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 1336-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here we describe for the first time expression of an active family 2 cystatin found in the saliva of I. scapularis. The sequence divergence of the protein, compared with that of other members of the same family, results in unique and novel target specificity directed among the others against cathepsin L, so that we named the protein sialostatin L. We further show that tick saliva displays an anti-cathepsin L activity that can be attributed to its cystatin component. Finally, we demonstrate that sialostatin L has an antiinflammatory action and reduces the proliferation of CTL. Because this novel inhibitor can be expressed in relatively high amounts in bacteria, many applications of medical importance based on its relatively stringent specificity can be tested in the future. Unless otherwise indicated, the protocols followed standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritish E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and all of the experiments were performed at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). All water used was of 18-megaohm quality, produced by a MilliQ apparatus (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Bioinformatic Tools—BLAST searches (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) were used to identify family 2 cystatin genes in different organisms based on their sequence similarity with previously characterized family members. Multiple sequence alignments were done using the ClustalW (23Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) of the ClustalW Service at the European Bioinformatics Institute (available on the World Wide Web at www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw), and the phylogenetic dendrograms were visualized with the TreeView software (24Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain a list of cystatin sequences, we used three iterations of PSIBLAST with an E value cut-off of 0.01, retrieved all matches from the nonredundant protein data base, and selected only those sequences that started with a Met and had fewer than 220 amino acids (aa) 2The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid(s); CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytes; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. and more than 2 cysteines. Next, this subset was submitted to the SignalP server (25Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5643) Google Scholar), and, when existent, the signal peptide was removed. This final set was used as input to the ClustalX analysis. Expression, Purification, and Sequence Verification of Sialostatin L—PCR was performed on the sialostatin L cDNA (NCBI accession number gi|22164282|) originating from a λTriplEx2 cDNA clone, described in our previous work (6Valenzuela J.G. Francischetti I.M. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Mather T.N. Ribeiro J.M. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 2843-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers (forward, 5′-GCCCATATGACTGGTGTTTTCGGTGGCTACAGCGAGAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCCTCGAGCTATGCGGCTTCACACTCGAAGGGGCTGAC-3′) were designed to remove the signal sequence (see above), insert an ATG codon directly upstream of the first codon of the mature peptide sequence, and insert NdeI and XhoI restriction sites that allowed cloning into the pET17b bacterial expression vector. The expression vector was moved into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for expression. Cultures (1 liter) were inoculated and grown to an OD of 0.6-1.0 and induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h, the cultures were harvested, and inclusion bodies were prepared using previously described methods (26Andersen J.F. Champagne D.E. Weichsel A. Ribeiro J.M. Balfour C.A. Dress V. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4423-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol. Sialostatin L was refolded in a large volume of 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and stirred overnight at 4 °C. The refolded protein was concentrated with a tangential flow filtration device and purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-100 followed by anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose. Dialysis followed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Potential lipopolysaccharide contamination was removed using the END-X®B15 endotoxin affinity resin (Associates of Cape Cod Inc., East Falmouth, MA). Final protein concentration was determined by measuring protein absorbance at 280 nm. Before use, protein integrity was verified by mass spectrometry. Enzymatic Assays—Apparent inhibition constants of sialostatin L for various proteases were obtained as described earlier (27Bjork I. Pol E. Raub-Segall E. Abrahamson M. Rowan A.D. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Pol E. Olsson S.L. Estrada S. Prasthofer T.W. Bjork I. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by measuring the loss of enzymatic activity at increasing concentrations of inhibitor in the presence of a fluorogenic or chromogenic enzyme substrate in large excess. The purified enzymes tested against sialostatin L were as follows: human cathepsin H, S, and L; calpain; recombinant human cathepsin V, X/Z/P, and E; legumain; recombinant mouse cathepsin C (all purchased from Calbiochem); papain; human cathepsin D; G, elastase; bovine cathepsin B; recombinant human caspase 3 (all purchased from Sigma); and bovine trypsin (Roche Applied Science). Calculation of the final molar concentration of the enzymes used during the assays was done as described previously (29Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner Jr., J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2. Academic Press, London1998: 1051-1416Google Scholar). Assay buffers used were as follows: 100 m NaAc, pH 5.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml cysteine, and 0.005% Triton X-100 for cathepsin B, C, H, L, and S and papain; 25 mm NaAc, pH 5.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol for cathepsin V; 25 mm NaAc, pH 4.0, 1 mg/ml cysteine, and 0.01% Triton X-100 for cathepsin X/Z/P; 50 mm NaAc, pH 4.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100 for cathepsin D and E; 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml cysteine, and 0.01% Triton X-100 for calpain; 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, for cathepsin G; 50 mm NaAc, pH 5.0, and 100 mm NaCl for human legumain; 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% CHAPS for caspase 3; and 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.01% Triton X-100 for elastase and trypsin. Substrates, used in a 0.25 mm final concentration, were purchased from Calbiochem: N-carbobenzyloxy-Arg-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin for cathepsin B, L, and papain; H-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin for cathepsin H; and N-succinyl-Leu-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin for calpain. The following were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN): (7-methoxycoumarinyl)-acetyl-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Val-Glu-norvaline-Trp-Arg-Lys(2,4-dinitro-phenyl)-NH2 for cathepsin S; N-carbobenzyloxy-Leu-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin for cathepsin V, L, and C; (7-methoxycoumarinyl)acetyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Ala-Phe-Lys(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-OH for cathepsin X/Z/P; and (7-methoxycoumarinyl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-N-3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl-Ala-Arg-NH2 for cathepsin D and E. The following were from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA): N-carbobenzyloxy-Val-Val-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin for cathepsin S; N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin for caspase 3, and N-carbobenzyloxy-Ala-Ala-Asn-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin for human legumain. The following were from Sigma: N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide for cathepsin G; N-succinyl-Ala-Pro-Ala-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin for elastase; and Na-benzoyl-dl-arginine-4-nitroanilide for trypsin. Production of Polyclonal Sera—DNA vaccination technology was employed for the sialostatin L immunization of Swiss Webster mice as described by Oliveira et al. (30Oliveira F. Kamhawi S. Seitz A.E. Pham V.M. Guigal P.M. Fischer L. Ward J. Valenzuela J.G. Vaccine. 2005; 24: 374-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Tick Saliva Fractionation—Tick saliva was obtained by inducing partially engorged adult female I. scapularis to salivate into capillary tubes using the modified pilocarpine induction method (31Valenzuela J.G. Charlab R. Mather T.N. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18717-18723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Microfractionation of tick saliva by reverse-phase high pressure chromatography was achieved with a 0.3 × 150-mm C8 Magic column (Michrom Bioresources, Inc., Auburn, CA) perfused at 2 or 5 μl/min using an ABI 140D pump and 785A UV detector from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Solution A contained water and 0.1% formic acid, and solution B contained 25% acetonitrile in methanol and 0.1% formic acid. After injecting the sample (previously equilibrated with 10% methanol and containing 0.2% formic acid) into the column, a gradient from 10 to 95% B was imposed for 20 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. After this time, the flow rate was decreased to 2 μl/min. Fractions were collected using the Probot machine from Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) at 1-min intervals on 96-microwell plates containing various solutions as described under “Results.” Cell Cultures—Mouse cell line CTLL-2 (CTL) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The culture medium was RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I and 25 mm Hepes buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cambrex BioScience Walkersville, Inc., Walkersville, MD), 4.5 g/liter filter-sterile glucose (Mallinckrodt Chemical, Paris, KY), and 10% rat T-STIM™ with concanavalin A (rat IL-2 culture supplement; BD Biosciences). Initial inoculation densities were 1-2 × 104 viable cells/ml, and cells were subcultured before reaching 2 × 105 cells/ml. Cell Proliferation Assays—The whole procedure was performed at 37 °C. CTLL-2 cells (2.5 × 103/well) were seeded in 96-well polystyrene tissue culture-treated plates (Corning Glass). Sialostatin L was added to the cultures in various final molar concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μm. As a negative control, cells were cultured in parallel in the presence of 10 μm Anopheles gambiae annexin B9, also overexpressed in bacteria (32Kotsyfakis M. Ehret-Sabatier L. Siden-Kiamos I. Mendoza J. Sinden R.E. Louis C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Kotsyfakis M. Vontas J. Siden-Kiamos I. Louis C. Insect Mol. Biol. 2005; 14: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Prior to their addition to cell cultures, the proteins were preincubated for 3 h with 100 μg/ml polymyxin B (Sigma) to eliminate the possibility that lipopolysaccharide, potentially present in the recombinant protein preparations, could interfere with the final results of the assay, and polymyxin B was added (in the above mentioned concentration) in the cell culture medium too. Cell proliferation assays were performed 3-4 days post-culture inoculation using the CellTiter 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 40 μl of MTS solution was added to each well. MTS solution contains 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium and phenazine methosulfate. It is bioreduced by the cells into a formazan product soluble in tissue culture medium that absorbs at 490 nm. After a 4-h incubation of the cells with MTS, the 490-nm absorbance of the plate was determined using a Versamax microplate reader linked to SOFTmax Pro 3.0 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The absorbance displayed by the cells at the time of seeding in the plate (culture inoculation) was considered as zero absorbance. The difference in cell proliferation was additionally monitored by counting their population under the microscope using a Neubauer hemocytometer. Paw Edema Assay—Female C57BL/6 mice, 6-8 weeks old, were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in the NIAID Animal Care Facility (Twinbrook 3 Building) under pathogen-free conditions in temperature-controlled rooms and receiving water and food ad libitum. All treatments were performed in accordance with Ref. 64National Institutes of Health The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar. The carrageenan-induced hind paw inflammation model was used to investigate the potential antiinflammatory role of sialostatin L. Prior to each injection, the basal footpad thickness of each mouse was recorded using a caliper (Mitutoyo America Corp., Aurora, IL). Subsequently, 50 μl of carrageenan (2% in saline) was administered by intraplantar injection in each footpad in the absence or presence of different concentrations of polymyxin B-treated sialostatin L (see above). Control groups of mice received the same volume of saline (vehicle) in the presence or absence of sialostatin L. As an index of edema formation, paw thickness was then measured at 1, 4, and 24 h postinjection. Myeloperoxidase Activity Assay—Tissue myeloperoxidase activity assay was performed as an index of granulocyte recruitment, as previously described (34Houle S. Papez M.D. Ferazzini M. Hollenberg M.D. Vergnolle N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 146: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, the injected paws were cut at 4 h post injection (the time point at which edema peaks) and weighed prior to their homogenization in 2 ml of 0.5% hexadecyl-trimethylammonium bromide phosphate-buffered solution (pH 6.0). The homogenates were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 3 min. Three aliquots of each supernatant were then transferred into 96-well plates before the addition of a solution containing 3,3′-dimethoxybenzidine and 1% hydrogen peroxide. In parallel, dilutions of pure myeloperoxidase (Sigma) were used for the construction of a standard curve (OD as a function of units of enzyme activity). OD readings at 450 nm were taken at 1 min (time point corresponding to the linear portion of the enzymatic reaction) using a spectrofluorimeter linked to the SOFTmax Pro 3.0 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The myeloperoxidase activity detected in the paws was expressed as units of enzyme/g of tissue. A unit of myeloperoxidase activity was defined as that converting 1 μm of hydrogen peroxide to water in 1 min at 22 °C. Statistical Analysis—The statistical differences among the experimental groups in the quantitative experiments were determined by analysis of variance using the Tukey test for multiple comparisons. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant. The aa sequence of the cystatin (NCBI accession number 22164282) found to be expressed in the salivary glands of I. scapularis (6Valenzuela J.G. Francischetti I.M. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Mather T.N. Ribeiro J.M. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 2843-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) displays all of the characteristics of the family 2 cystatins. In addition to the secretion signal and the conserved QXVXG module, two disulfide bonds are formed in proximity to the carboxyl terminus, typical for all secreted cystatins (18Vray B. Hartmann S. Hoebeke J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). On the other hand, multiple-protein sequence alignment with vertebrate and invertebrate family 2 and plant members shows that all cystatins of tick origin cocluster and are divergent from the already known and extensively studied vertebrate, nematode, and plant homoorthologs (Fig. 1A). An aa sequence comparison of the tick cystatin with vertebrate-secreted cystatins (most of them found in saliva also) and an additional potentially secreted cystatin from the salivary glands of I. scapularis (NCBI accession number 67083499) is shown in Fig. 1B. It uncovers a series of tick-specific aa substitutions (shown with a T above the alignment) and a relative short sialostatin L N terminus. Further, substitution of the PW dipeptide (positions 114-115; shown with dashes above of the alignment) is impressive, because it is present in most of the known (to date) cystatins. Previous work of Alvarez-Fernandez et al. (35Alvarez-Fernandez M. Barrett A.J. Gerhartz B. Dando P.M. Ni J. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19195-19203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) showed that a tripeptide with the sequence SND (or substitutions with chemically similar aa) is conserved in all cystatins that inhibit legumain (cystatins C, E/M, and F). This tripeptide is also absent from sialostatin L (positions 41-44; shown with dots above the alignment). In conclusion, certain aa substitutions revealed in the sialostatin L sequence could potentially account for a novel target repertoire. Since it is known that family 2 cystatins are not subjected to any kind of post-translational modifications, we decided to overexpress sialostatin L in bacteria. Indeed, the recombinant cystatin was active, inhibiting papain, the “archetype” of family C1 of the clan CA cysteine proteases (29Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner Jr., J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2. Academic Press, London1998: 1051-1416Google Scholar). Within the vertebrate members of the family, cathepsins L, V, C, and X were inhibited, whereas only a slight inhibition (30%) of human cathepsin B was achieved at 10 μm final concentration. The effect of sialostatin L presence in the proteolytic activity of the above mentioned enzymes is presented in Fig. 2A. No inhibition could be detected for other members of the papain-like superfamily (cathepsins H and S; see “Note Added in Proof”), although they show high sequence similarity to cathepsin L. The same holds true for cysteine proteases outside the C1 family (human calpain family C2, human legumain family C13, human caspase 3 family C14) or cathepsins that belong to the aspartic protease clan AA and the serine protease clan SA (cathepsins D, E, and G). Table 1 presents the complete repertoire of enzymes tested against tick cystatin and their class. For those inhibited by sialostatin L, we further provide the inhibitor concentration necessary to reduce their ezymatic activity by half (IC50) as well as the enzyme concentration used in the assays.TABLE 1Effect of sialostatin L in the activity of various proteolytic enzymes The enzymatic repertoire tested for inhibition by sialostatin L and the concentration of sialostatin L at which 50% inhibition of the activity of the targeted proteolytic enzymes is achieved (IC50) ± S.E. are presented. The enzyme concentration used in the assays is also given for all the targets of sialostatin L. NI, no inhibition (e.g. inhibition of the enzyme was not observed in the presence of 10 μm sialostatin L). In the case of cathepsin B, 30% inhibition was detected at the above mentioned concentration of inhibitor.EnzymeClassIC50 ± S.E.Enzyme concentrationEnzymeClassIC50nmPapainCysteine protease25.4 ± 0.51 nm1.5Cathepsin DAspartic proteaseNICathepsin LCysteine protease4.68 ± 0.08 nm0.7Cathepsin EAspartic proteaseNICathepsin VCysteine protease57 ± 2.39 nm0.9Cathepsin GSerine proteaseNICathepsin CCysteine protease112 ± 3.58 nm25LegumainCysteine proteaseNICathepsin XCysteine protease937 ± 14.06 nm16CalpainCysteine proteaseNICathepsin BCysteine protease>10 μm0.8Caspase 3Cysteine proteaseNICathepsin HCysteine proteaseNITrypsinSerine proteaseNICathepsin SCysteine proteaseNIaSee “Note Added in Proof”ElastaseSerine proteaseNIa See “Note Added in Proof” Open table in a new tab All cystatins studied to date form tight equimolar complexes with their preferred targets. A main characteristic of such tightly binding inhibitors is that the IC50 is dependent on the concentration of the enzyme, since the commonly used pseudo-first-order kinetics do not hold under those conditions. This is also true for the inhibition of cathepsin L by sialostatin L. When the concentration of the enzyme used in the reaction reaches picomolar levels, an IC50 of subnanomolar range can be achieved. Fig. 2B shows that as the concentration of the enzyme used in the assay decreases, lower inhibitor concentration is necessary for the same percentage of cathepsin L inhibition to be achieved. A concomitant 2-fold reduction in the calculated IC50 from 231 ± 12.29 pm to 122.67 ± 7.77 and 59.53 ± 3.37 pm is observed, proving that sialostatin L is a tight binding inhibitor that additionally binds stoichiometrically to cathepsin L. We further determined that sialostatin L is a fast binding inhibitor, since the initial velocity of the enzymatic reaction is equally reduced, either when cathepsin L is added to a preincubated mix of inhibitor with substrate or when the substrate is added to a preincubated mix of inhibitor with enzyme (data not shown). Since conventional Michaelis-Menten kinetics do not apply to the study of tight binding inhibitors, because it assumes that the free inhibitor concentration is equ"
https://openalex.org/W2070168780,"Up-regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 exacerbates neuronal injury after cerebral ischemia and contributes to neuronal cell death. The present study clarifies the function of cerebral peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor(s) gamma (PPARgamma) in the expression of COX-2 in neurons of the rat brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with reperfusion by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining. In peri-infarct cortical areas the PPARgamma was located in both microglia and neurons, whereas COX-2 was almost exclusively expressed in neurons. PPARgamma immunolabeling reached the peak 12 h after MCAO, whereas the number of COX-2 immunostained cells gradually rose and reached its peak at 48 h. Intracerebroventricular infusion of pioglitazone, an agonist of the PPARgamma, over a 5-day period before and 2 days after MCAO, reduced the infarct size, the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), COX-2, and the number of cells positively stained for COX-1 and COX-2 in the peri-infarct cortical regions. COX-2 induction was also attenuated in the ipsilateral but not in the contralateral hippocampus. In primary cortical neurons expressing the PPARgamma, pioglitazone suppressed COX-2 expression in response to oxidative stress. This protective effect was reversed after cotreatment with GW 9662, a selective antagonist of the PPARgamma, clearly demonstrating a PPARgamma-dependent mechanism. Our data provide evidence that activation of neuronal PPARgamma considerably contributes to neuroprotection by prevention of COX-2 up-regulation in vitro and in peri-infarct brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W1986331600,"MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP K2 or MK2) is one of several kinases directly regulated by p38 MAPK. A role for p38 MAPK in the pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD) has previously been suggested. Here, we provide evidence to suggest that MK2 also plays a role in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative pathology of relevance to AD. MK2 activation and expression were increased in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + interferon γ-stimulated microglial cells, implicating a role for MK2 in eliciting a pro-inflammatory response. Microglia cultured ex vivo from MK2-deficient (MK2–/–) mice demonstrated significant inhibition in release of tumor necrosis factor α, KC (mouse chemokine with highest sequence identity to human GROs and interleukin-8), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α on stimulation with LPS + interferon γ or amyloid-β peptide (1–42) compared with MK2+/+ wild-type microglia. Consistent with an inhibition in pro-inflammatory mediator release, cortical neurons co-cultured with LPS + interferon γ-stimulated or amyloid-β peptide (1–42)-stimulated MK2–/– microglia were protected from microglial-mediated neuronal cell toxicity. In a transgenic mouse model of AD in which amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 harboring familial AD mutations are overexpressed in specific regions of the brain, elevated activation and expression of MK2 correlated with β-amyloid deposition, microglial activation, and up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor α, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, and KC gene expression in the same brain regions. Our data propose a role for MK2 in AD brain pathology, for which neuroinflammation involving cytokines and chemokines and overt neuronal loss have been documented.

MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) is one of several kinases that are regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAPK, and MK2 has therefore been a candidate for an effector role in p38 action in the inflammatory response. Studies using MK2–/– mice support this hypothesis, because mice lacking MK2 are resistant to endotoxic shock, largely due to a reduction in serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels (3Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Furthermore, macrophages and spleen cells taken from MK2-deficient animals show inhibition in the release of a range of pro-inflammatory mediators (3Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 4Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. Biochem. Soc.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects primarily hippocampal and neocortical brain regions resulting in a progressive loss of cognitive and memory function and ultimately dementia. Post-mortem diagnosis of AD is facilitated by the presence of extracellular plaques comprising β-amyloid protein (Aβ), and neuroinflammation is a persistent pathological hallmark. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, are responsible for eliciting such an immune response in the CNS. These immune cells of monocytic lineage are activated by a wide range of stimuli and release pro-inflammatory mediators that, in turn, induce microglial autoactivation, thereby amplifying the inflammatory response. It has been proposed that elevated levels of β-amyloid in AD brain induces microglial activation and consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other potentially neurotoxic substances (5McGeer P.L.

Indeed, activated microglia can cause neuronal cell death in vitro (10Chao C.C. Hu S. Molitor T.W. Shaskan E.G. Peterson P.K. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2736-2741PubMed Google Scholar, 11Flavin M.P.

The neuroinflammatory changes and microglial activation observed in AD pathology are therefore hypothesized to contribute to neuronal cell loss and associated dementia in this disease, as well as neuronal injury and neurodegeneration in other CNS disorders resulting from trauma, ischemia, or inflammation (14Diemel L.T.

Modulation of the inflammatory response may retard the progression of AD through a reduction in neurodegeneration caused by chronic activation of microglia (17McGeer P.L. Schulzer M. McGeer E.G.

Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway has been linked to inflammatory pathology both in AD and in mouse models of the disease (20Hensley K. Floyd R.A. Zheng N.-Y. Nael R. Robinson X.N. Pye Q.N.

In addition, Aβ activates p38 MAPK in cultured microglial cells (24Atzori C. Ghetti B. Piva R. Srinivasan A.N. Zolo P. Delisle M.B. Mirra S.S. Migheli A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because MK2 is an immediate downstream kinase of p38 MAPK, we hypothesized that MK2 itself might play a role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration relevant to AD. Here we have investigated the role of MK2 in microglial cell activation, and the resultant effects on microglial-mediated neuronal cell toxicity. In addition, we have correlated our findings in vitro with a potential role for MK2 in a transgenic mouse model of AD.

In this double transgenic line, both transgenes are under the control of the Thy-1 regulatory cassette, which directs expression to the cerebral cortex, amygdala, dentate gyrus, CA1–CA3, and the cerebellum. Expression of transgenes results in progressive amyloid deposition and pathology in the brain. For ex vivo tissue analyses, animals were humanely sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium (Euthatal, Rhone Merieux, Harlow, UK). MK2–/– mice were generated in the laboratory of Professor Matthias Gaestel (Germany) and provided to GSK on a mixed 129v × C57BL/6 background as described previously (3Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Microglia were cultured ex vivo from wild-type (WT) and MK2–/– mice as described below. Culture of NTW8 Microglial Cells—Mouse microglial NTW8 cells were cultured as previously described (27Chessell I.P. Michel A.D. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells were switched to serum-free medium 2 h prior to cell stimulation with LPS and IFNγ, or Aβ(1–42) peptide. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Lysates prepared either from NTW8 microglial cells or cortical CNS tissues from WT and TASTPM mice were assayed for MK2 activity using the MK2 immunoprecipitation kinase assay kit (Upstate Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, lysates were prepared from NTW8 microglial cells by washing cell monolayers in ice-cold PBS, followed by extraction in the lysis buffer supplied. For mouse cortical tissue, dissected tissue was powdered under liquid nitrogen and protein extracts were prepared as described previously (28Cross D.A.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 124: 147-159PubMed Google Scholar). All lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and MK2 was immunoprecipitated from samples containing 1 mg of total cellular protein. Kinase reactions were performed by incubating immunoprecipitated MK2 at 30 °C for 45 min with 10 ng of recombinant Hsp27 in the kinase assay buffer provided. Phosphorylation of Hsp27 was used as a measure of MK2 activity; phospho-Hsp27 and immunoprecipitated MK2 was resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Blots were developed using ECL and quantified where shown by densitometry. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from CNS tissues from WT and TASTPM mice, rat primary CNS cells, and NTW8 microglial cells using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA syntheses from equal quantities of RNA and aliquoting of the resulting cDNA products for subsequent parallel TaqMan PCR were all performed as described in detail previously (29Ginham R. Harrison D.C. Facci L. Skaper S.D. Philpott K.L. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 302: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additional reactions were performed using genomic DNA to produce a standard curve relating threshold cycle to template copy number. Primer (F and R) and probe (P) sets were designed from mouse or rat sequences in the GenBank™ data base using Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); mouse GAPDH (F) 5′-GAACATCATCCCTGCATCCA-3′, (R) 5′-CCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCA-3′, and (P) 5′-CTTGCCCACAGCCTTGGCAGC-3′; mouse MIP-1α (F) 5′-AGCTGACACCCCGACTGC-3′, (R) 5′-GTCAACGATGAATTGGCGTG-3′, and (P) 5′-TGCTGCTTCTCCTACAGCCGGAAGAT-3′; mouse TNFα (F) 5′-TCCAGGCGGTGCCTATGT-3′, (R) 5′-GAGCGTGGTGGCCCC-3′, and (P) 5′-TCAGCCTCTTCTCATTCCTGCTTGTGG-3′; mouse MK2 (F) 5′-CACCCCTGGATCATGCAATC-3′, (R) 5′-CCTTCAGGACACGGCTGGT-3′, and (P) 5′-CGAAGGTCCCTCAGACTCCACTGCA-3′; rat MK2 (F) 5′-CACCCGTGGATCATGCAA-3′, (R) 5′-TCAGGACGCGGCTGGT-3′, and (P) 5′-CGAAGGTCCCTCAGACTCCACTGCA-3′; mouse KC (F) 5′-GCGCCTATCGCCAATGAG-3′, (R) 5′-CTTGAGGTGAATCCCAGCCAT-3′, and (P) 5′-TGCGCTGTCAGTGCCTGCAGAC-3′. All TaqMan probes contained 6-FAM at the 5′ end and the quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine at the 3′ end. Immunohistochemistry Staining for β-Amyloid Protein and Activated Microglia—Brains from TASTPM mice were hemisected in the sagittal plane and immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 48 h. The brain was then processed into paraffin wax and 7-μm sections were cut and subjected to standard immunohistochemical techniques. Briefly, the sections were de-waxed, re-hydrated through a series of graded alcohols, and washed in distilled water followed by PBS. To enhance antigenicity for phosphotyrosine and Aβ, sections were treated by microwaving in 0.01 m citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (2 × 5 min at 300 watts), followed by immersion in 80% formic acid for 8 min. Sections were then incubated in 0.3% H2O2 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. To enable labeling of both Aβ plaques and microglia, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with both the rabbit polyclonal G30 (3 μg/ml) and the mouse monoclonal to phosphotyrosine (1:1000) diluted in primary layer diluent (0.3% Triton X-100, 0.01% sodium azide, and 2% normal serum in PBS). Immunohistochemistry was completed with appropriate secondary biotinylated antibodies (Vector Laboratories Ltd., Peterborough, UK) diluted 1:500 in secondary layer diluent (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS), followed by avidin-biotin complexation (Vector ABC, Vector Laboratories Ltd., Peterborough, UK) and visualized using diaminobenzidine (for phosphotyrosine) and VIP (for Aβ40) according to the manufacturer's data sheets (Vector Laboratories Ltd.). Isolation of Primary Microglia—Rat microglia were prepared from cerebral cortices of 1–2-day-old rat pups of either sex (strain: CD, Charles River, Margate, UK) (30Rosin C. Bates T.E. Skaper S.D. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1173-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Animals were euthanaized in accordance with the 1986 Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. The final cell pellet from cortex was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 units/ml penicillin + 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and plated in 75-cm2 poly-l-lysine-coated tissue culture flasks (Corning, Corning, NY) at a density of 1.5 brains per flask. Culture medium was changed after 24 h and then twice per week. Microglia were isolated on day 14 by shaking the flasks on an orbital shaker (New Brunswick Scientific) at 200 rpm for 2 h (37 °C). The attached cell monolayers were highly enriched in astrocytes. The culture supernatant was transferred to plastic Petri dishes (Sterilin) and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C (5% CO2, 95% air) to allow differential adhesion of microglia. The adherent microglial cells were maintained in growth medium until harvested for addition to neuronal cell cultures (3–5 days later). Microglial cell cultures from genotypically matched normal and homozygous MK2–/– mice were also prepared. Mouse microglia were isolated from mixed glial cell cultures as described above for rat, except that animals were used at postnatal days 7–8 (to obtain greater cell yields). Harvested mouse microglia were used both for cytokine release assays, and in co-cultures of rat cortical neurons and mouse microglia. Co-cultures utilizing mouse microglia were established in the same manner as microglia derived from rat cortex. Cytokine/Chemokine Release Assays from Primary Mouse Microglia and NTW8 Mouse Microglial Cells—Microglia were plated in wells of a 96-well plate (poly-d-lysine, BD Biosciences) at a density of 100,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were stimulated to release pro-inflammatory mediators in medium containing 100 ng/ml LPS and 20 units/ml mouse IFNγ, or 30 μm Aβ(1–42) peptide. Prior to cell stimulations, Aβ peptide was prepared for this purpose by dissolving the peptide in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol to a concentration of 1 mm. The 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol solvent was then evaporated, and the peptide film was re-dissolved in Me2SO to a concentration of 5 mm. Serum-free medium was pre-warmed to 37 °C and added to dilute the peptide to 100 μm, before adding to cells to give a final concentration of 30 μm. Cell supernatants were harvested after 24 h and cytokine and chemokine release was assayed by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments employing either LPS + IFNγ or Aβ(1–42) treatment, cell viability was measured by MTT or LDH assay, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of Cortical Neurons—Primary cerebral cortical cell cultures were prepared from gestational day 18 fetuses of time-mated CD rats (Charles River) (31Skaper S.D. Facci L. Milani D. Leon A. Toffano G. Conn P.M. Methods in Neurosciences. 2. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 17-33Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, after removal of meninges, cerebral cortices were dissected and dissociated with a papain tissue dissociation kit (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were resuspended in Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 supplements, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 48-well plates, 1 × 105 cells/well in 0.35 ml. Poly-d-lysine-coated culture wells were exposed overnight to medium containing 10% FCS prior to cell seeding. After 2 days, cultures received 0.35 ml/well of plating medium, but containing B27 supplement without antioxidants. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Neuronal cells were used on days 5–6 for experiments. Co-cultures of Microglia and Cortical Neurons—Microglia were collected by mechanically scraping into culture medium. After centrifugation (200 × g for 5 min) cells were resuspended in Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 supplements (without antioxidants), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Co-cultures were prepared by plating a suspension of isolated microglia (rat or mouse) on neurons maintained for 5 days in vitro in a 1:1 ratio. Cells were incubated for 30 min and then washed once with plating medium to remove non-adherent contaminating macroglia and debris, and then refed with fresh plating medium. Injury Induction in LPS + IFNγ-stimulated Co-cultures—Neuron-microglia co-cultures were treated the day following addition of microglia to the neuronal cell monolayers. Culture medium was replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium containing LPS (0.5 μg/ml) and rat or mouse IFNγ (500 units/ml). Analogous treatments were carried out for cultures composed of only cortical neurons or microglia. All cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days, after which time cell viability was determined by LDH release. Neurotoxicity Assay in LPS + IFNγ-stimulated Co-cultures—LDH release into the culture medium was used as a measure of cell death, and has been utilized previously to quantify neuronal cell injury in microglia-neuron co-cultures (12Golde S. Chandran S. Brown G.C. Compston A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Parvathenani L.K. Tertyshnikova S. Greco C.R. Roberts S.B. Robertson B. Posmantur R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13309-13317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). LDH activity in the cell culture supernatants was determined after 72 h, using the CytoTox® non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Values of LDH release are expressed as milliunits/ml, unless indicated otherwise. Microglia and cortical neurons were also independently cultured for 72 h in the presence of stimuli, and LDH release from the microglia alone ± stimuli were subtracted out from the values obtained from the combination of microglia and cortical neurons. Quantitative Analysis of Neuronal Cell Injury by Arrayscan—All incubations were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 10% (w/v) sucrose, and 15 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. The fixative was removed and cells were washed once with 200 μl of PBS. Cells were then blocked in PBS, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 (1 h), followed by incubation for 1 h with anti-βIII-tubulin primary antibody (1:1000 in blocking buffer). Cells were next washed 3 times with blocking buffer and then incubated 1 h with Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibody (1:300 in blocking buffer). Cells were subsequently washed 3 times with PBS prior to imaging. Image acquisition within the 48-well plate and subsequent neurite outgrowth measurements were performed using Cellomics Arrayscan technology (Swallowfield, UK). Ultraviolet light was used to illuminate Hoechst 33342-labeled nuclei, allowing automated focusing upon the cells. A second excitation wavelength of 488 nm was used to obtain pictures of specifically labeled neurons. These images were then analyzed using Cellomics neurite outgrowth software to identify and measure neurites that fit defined criteria. Data are expressed as perimeter squared divided by 4 × π × area (“P2/A”). Exposure times for each wavelength were determined empirically by the user. Injury Induction in Aβ(1–42)-stimulated Cortical Neuron/Microglia Co-cultures—Microglia isolated from the cerebral cortex of normal and MK2–/– mice were added to cell culture inserts (PET membrane, 0.4 μm pore size, BD Biosciences) at 7.5 × 104 cells per insert in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS (0.4 ml/insert), and placed in a 24-well plate (notched for inserts) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS (0.8 ml/well). The following day, inserts were washed once with Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 supplements (without antioxidants), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin, and transferred to a 24-well plate of rat cortical neurons (6 days in vitro, 2 × 105 cells per well). The porous membrane allows free diffusion of molecules. The distance between the neuron monolayer and microglia on the insert membrane is 1 mm, according to the manufacturer's description. Aβ(1–42) was then added to the microglia-containing inserts (15 μm in the above Neurobasal medium); controls received an equal volume of medium with 0.2% Me2SO. The co-cultures were returned to the incubator for another 3 days. Neurotoxicity Assay in Aβ(1–42)-stimulated Co-cultures—At the end of the incubation period, microglia-containing inserts were removed and neuronal cell viability was evaluated by a colorimetric method based upon the conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases to a blue formazan product (30Rosin C.

Statistical analyses to determine group differences were performed either by two-sample equal variance Student's t test, or by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test for comparisons involving more than two data groups. MK2 Expression Is Enriched in Primary Microglial Cells Compared with Primary Astrocytes and Neurons—To investigate the relative expression of MK2 in cell types within the CNS, we compared expression of MK2 in rat primary cultures of cortical neurons, microglia, and astrocytes by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1). GFAP, CD11b, and MAP2 expression as markers of astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, respectively, confirmed culture purity (data not shown). MK2 expression was found to be highly enriched in microglial cells, supporting a role for MK2 function"

Moreover, IN tends to aggregate, and it is unknown whether the polymerization or aggregation of this enzyme on DNA is detrimental or beneficial for activity. We have developed a fluorescence assay based on anisotropy for monitoring release of the terminal dinucleotide product in real-time. Because the initial anisotropy value obtained after DNA binding and before catalysis depends on the fractional saturation of DNA sites and the size of IN·DNA complexes, this approach can be used to study the relationship between activity and binding/multimerization parameters in the same assay. By increasing the IN:DNA ratio, we found that the anisotropy increased but the 3′-processing activity displayed a characteristic bell-shaped behavior. The anisotropy values obtained in the first phase were predictive of subsequent activity and accounted for the number of complexes. Interestingly, activity peaked and then decreased in the second phase, whereas anisotropy continued to increase. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies showed that the most competent form for catalysis corresponds to a dimer bound to one viral DNA end, whereas higher order complexes such as aggregates predominate during the second phase when activity drops off. We conclude that a single IN dimer at each extremity of viral DNA molecules is required for 3′-processing, with a dimer of dimers responsible for the subsequent full integration.

Integrase (IN) is responsible for the two consecutive reactions that constitute the overall integration process. The first of these two reactions is 3′-processing, which involves cleavage of the 3′-terminal GT dinucleotide at each extremity of the viral DNA. The hydroxyl groups of newly recessed 3′-ends are then used in the second reaction, strand transfer, for the covalent joining of viral and target DNAs, resulting in full-site integration. IN is sufficient for catalysis of the 3′-processing reaction in vitro, using short-length oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) that mimic one viral long terminal repeat (LTR) in the presence of the metallic cofactor Mg2+. This reaction generates two products: the viral DNA containing the recessed extremity and the GT dinucleotide. One of the two products, the processed viral DNA, as well as the target DNA serve as substrates for the subsequent joining reaction. IN belongs to the superfamily of polynucleotidyl transferases. Its catalytic core domain contains a triad of acidic residues constituting the D,D-35-E motif, which is strictly required for catalysis. The catalytic core establishes specific contacts with the viral DNA and, together with the C-terminal domain, is involved in DNA binding (1Lutzke R.A. Vink C. Plasterk R.H.

The 3′-processing reaction is highly specific, and the terminal 13 bp of the LTR play a key role for Mg2+-dependent 3′-processing in terms of reaction specificity (4Esposito D. Craigie R.

Reaction specificity seems to depend on the catalytic step, because no significant difference in affinity is observed in vitro for different DNA sequences (2Engelman A. Hickman A.B. Craigie R. J.

The catalytic mechanism of IN has been extensively studied, but the structural determinants of IN activity remain unclear, and controversy remains concerning the multimeric status of active IN. Single- and double-domain crystallographic structures have been produced for IN, alone or complexed with the IN-binding domain of the cellular partner lens epithelium-derived growth factor, and all these structures display a conserved dimeric structure of the catalytic core (7Wang J.Y.

Based on topological considerations concerning the distance separating the active sites of the two protomers, which is more than double the distance separating the two joining sites on the target DNA (separated by 5 bp), a multimeric state of an order higher than dimers, tetramers at least, is required for complete integration. However, it remains unclear whether such a higher order multimeric state is also required for 3′-processing activity and how this activity is modulated by the self-association properties of IN. Moreover, most enzymatic studies are carried out with an excess of IN over DNA substrate. Taking into account the low solubility of IN, we investigated whether high order multimers or aggregated forms of IN favored by high protein concentrations in solution were detrimental or beneficial for activity. We developed an assay for monitoring DNA binding and subsequent 3′-processing in the same sample. This assay makes possible the separation of binding and catalytic parameters and the study of real-time kinetics. It is based on steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (r), which is sensitive to rotational diffusion, and thus suitable for studies aiming to identify structural modifications leading to a significant change in molecular size (12Deprez E.

Using a fluorescent probe covalently linked to the GT dinucleotide, this makes it possible to follow DNA binding and dinucleotide release, because both steps strongly influence molecular size of the fluorescent moiety. The anisotropy-based technique is also highly suitable for studies of the relationship between the overall size of IN·DNA complexes and activity. We found that, for low IN:DNA ratios, the r values obtained after DNA binding and before catalysis were fully predictive of subsequent IN activity, according to the fractional saturation function. For high IN:DNA ratios, anisotropy continued to increase, but 3′-processing activity decreased. Because r depends on both fractional saturation and the molecular size of complexes at saturation of DNA sites, our results show that high order multimers or aggregated states of IN are detrimental to 3′-processing activity. Activity levels were highest for non-aggregative smaller species. A more precise characterization of catalytically competent complexes by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TFA) (16Deprez E.

Our results also highlight that only the IN:DNA ratio but not the IN concentration per se determines the aggregation properties and thus the activity of IN and that DNA binding stimulates the self-organization of IN to give a catalytically competent non-aggregative form. Oligonucleotides and Nomenclature—Unlabeled and fluorescein-labeled single-stranded (ss) ODNs were purchased from Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium) (except for the 2′-aminouridine-containing ODN) and purified by electrophoresis in acrylamide gels. The specific HIV sequence was 5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT-3′ (the bases removed by IN are underlined). This sequence was denoted a, and the complementary nonprocessed strand was denoted b. Fluorescein (F) was attached at the 5′- or the 3′-end of strand a or b, via a 6-carbon linker. As an example, the specific double-stranded (ds) ODN used to monitor activity was called HIV-a3F, indicating that fluorescein was attached to the 3′-end of strand a. HIV-GTGT-a3F was identical except that the four terminal bases at the 3′-end of strand a were GTGT rather than the canonical sequence CAGT. The nonspecific sequence, NS-TTCC, was 5′-ACCTATGCGCCGCTAGATTCC-3′ (strand a). Two other nonspecific ODNs with different 3′-ends of strand a were derived: NS-CACC and NS-CAGT. ds ODNs were obtained by mixing equimolar amounts of complementary strands in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl. The mixture was heated to 85 °C for 5 min, and annealing was allowed by slow cooling to 25 °C. The uridine-containing ODN (corresponding to strand a of the DNA substrate HIV-aUF) contains a fluorescein attached to the 2′-amino group of the 3′-terminal 2′-aminouridine. It was synthesized as follows: the solid support was prepared as previously described (21Kuznetsova L.G. Romanova E.A. Volkov E.M. Tashlitskii V.N. Oretskaia T.S. Krynetskaia N.F. Shabarova Z.A. Bioorg. Khim. 1993; 19: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2′-deoxy-5′-O-4,4′-dimethoxytrityl-2′-O-trifluoracetamidouridine (0.2 mmol) was co-evaporated with pyridine (3 × 5 ml) and dissolved in dry pyridine (2 ml). Succinylated long-chain alkylamine-controlled pore glass (500 Å) (200 mg), 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (0.6 mmol), and 1-methylimidazole (1.2 mmol) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 25°C. The support was then filtered and washed successively with pyridine, CH2Cl2, and ether. Starting from 2′-deoxy-5′-O-4,4′-dimethoxytrityl-2′-O-trifluoracetamidouridine-derivatized long-chain alkylamine-controlled pore glass (500 Å), a 21-mer ODN was assembled on an ABI394B DNA synthesizer, by the phosphoramidite method, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Protected 2′-O-deoxyribonucleoside phosphoramidites and S-ethylthiotetrazole were purchased from Glen Research. Ammonia was used for cleavage from the support and deprotection overnight at 55 °C. The reaction mixture was then analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in ion-pair mode. For fluorescein labeling, 1 mg of fluorescein isothiocyanate dissolved in 20 μl of dimethylformamide was added to a solution of 40 nmol of 2′-amino ODN in 130 μl of sodium carbonate-bicarbonate (1 m, pH 9):water (v/v, 5:8) (22Antsypovich S.I.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6227-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 25 °C in the dark for 18 h and then loaded onto an NAP5-Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in water. The ODN was eluted with water and analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in ion-pair mode. IN Purification and Standard Analysis of the 3′-Processing Reaction—HIV-1 IN (32 kDa) was purified under native conditions, as previously described (24Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Standard IN assay, using 32P-labeled ODN and gel electrophoresis, was carried out as previously described (24Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Gels were analyzed on a STORM 840™ PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with ImageQuaNT™ 4.1 software. The 3′-processing activity was calculated as follows: activity (%) = 19-mer/(21-mer + 19-mer) × 100. Steady-state Fluorescence Anisotropy Assay—Steady-state anisotropy values were recorded on a Beacon 2000 instrument (PanVera, Madison, WI), in a cell thermostatically held at 25 or 37 °C, for the DNA-binding step and 3′-processing reaction, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, we studied the formation of IN·DNA complexes by incubating fluorescein-labeled ds ODNs with IN in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (the sample volume was 200 μl). The fractional saturation function (Y) was calculated as follows,Y=r-rODNrmax-rODN×100(Eq. 1) where rmax and rODN are the anisotropies of IN-bound and free ODN, respectively (no significant concomitant change in fluorescence intensity was observed). After the DNA-binding step, the temperature was raised from 25 to 37 °C for monitoring of the catalytic process. The 3′-processing activity was assessed by quantifying the decrease in r. Two independent methods were used for quantification as follows. (i) In fixed-time experiments, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS (0.25% final), disrupting all the IN·DNA complexes in the sample. In such experiments, the solution contained two fluorescent species: the non-processed ODN and the fluorescein-labeled dinucleotide released by the cleavage reaction. The fraction of dinucleotides released (Fdinu = [GT]/[DNA]total) is given by Equation 2,Fdinu=rNP-rrNP-rdinu(Eq. 2) where rNP and rdinu are the anisotropy values for pure solutions of non-processed ds ODN and dinucleotide, respectively (fluorescence did not change significantly during the reaction). We used the 5′-GT-3′F dinucleotide (Eurogentec) to determine rdinu. (ii) In real-time conditions, an additional fluorescent population corresponding to IN complexed with the unprocessed ds ODN, is present in the sample. In this case, Fdinu was calculated as follows,Fdinu=rt=0-rrmax-rdinu(Eq. 3) where rmax is the characteristic r value obtained for optimal activity, and rt = 0 is the r value obtained at the end of the DNA-binding step (before the start of the reaction). The 3′-processing activity obtained with Equations 2 and 3 is referred to as ActivitySDS and Activityreal-time, respectively. Activityreal-time was not used if rt = 0 was higher than 0.22 (aggregation of IN on DNA not negligible). We analyzed single-turnover kinetics using the Equations 4 and 5,ln(1-Fdinu)=-kobs×t(Eq. 4) withkobs=kchemistry/Kd,app/IN0+1(Eq. 5) where kchemistry is the single-turnover rate constant, and Kd,app is the apparent Kd (25Smolov M. Gottikh M. Tashlitskii V. Korolev S. Demidyuk I. Brochon J.C. Mouscadet J.F. Deprez E. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted in the presence of Mg2+ (not Mn2+) to limit nonspecific hydrolysis products (cleavages at positions −3, −4, etc.), because anisotropy cannot discriminate between these small products (which are minor products with Mg2+ but not with Mn2+) and the specific GT product. The r values for the TAMRA-labeled DNA substrate (λex = 562 nm and λem = 582 nm) were recorded on a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian, Mulgrave, Australia) in polarization mode and were compared with values obtained with the same instrument and HIV-a3F as the substrate. Kd,app as a function of ODN length were determined by competition experiments. Fluorescein-labeled ds ODN HIV-a5F (4 nm) was preincubated with various concentrations of unlabeled ss or ds HIV ODN (from 10- to 45-mers) in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.2) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. IN (150 nm final concentration) was then added, and r values were recorded. Δr (= r–rODN) was plotted against competitor concentration to determine Kd,app (concentration of competitor decreasing the initial Δr value by 50%). Time-resolved Fluorescence Experiments—Time-resolved fluorescence parameters (lifetimes and correlation times) were obtained from the two polarized fluorescence decays I∥(t) and I∥(t), using the time-correlated single photon counting technique. The instrumentation setup was essentially similar to those previously described (16Deprez E. Tauc P. Leh H. Mouscadet J.F. Auclair C. Hawkins M.E. Brochon J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9275-9284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), with modifications: the time scaling was 19.5 ps per channel and 4096 channels were used. The excitation light pulse source was a Ti:sapphire laser (Millennia-pumped Tsunami femtosecond laser, Spectra Physics) (repetition rate: 8 MHz) associated with a second harmonic generator tuned to 490 nm. The emission monochromator (ARC SpectraPro-150) was set to 530 nm (Δλ = 15 nm). The two polarized components were collected alternately over a period of 30 s (total count of I∥: 15,000,000). The reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The correlation time (θ) distributions of free ss or ds ODNs were obtained at ODN concentrations of 10 nm or 0.5 μm. All ODNs (from 10- to 45-mer) mimicked the U5-end of the HIV-1 DNA and were fluorescein-labeled at the 5′-end of strand a. IN·DNA complexes were analyzed using ds HIV-a5F and various IN:DNA ratios, from 40 to 400. We analyzed both decays, I∥(t) and I∥(t), by the maximum entropy method (26Brochon J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 262-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy decay is described by Equations 6 and 7,r(t)=∑i=1nρi×e-t/θi(Eq. 6) with∑i=1nρi=ρ0(Eq. 7) where θi is the individual rotational correlation time, and ρi is the associated amplitude. ρ0 was found to lie between 0.36 and 0.37. Normalization of θ for a given temperature was performed using,θ=ηV/kT(Eq. 8) where η is the viscosity, V is the volume of the rotating unit, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature (K). Monitoring 3′-Processing Activity by Steady-state Fluorescence Anisotropy—Fluorescence anisotropy measurements are based on the principle of photoselective excitation of a fluorophore by a polarized light, providing information about rotational motions of the fluorophore or fluorescently labeled molecule between photon absorption and emission. Some events such as overall rotational diffusion or flexibility are major causes of light depolarization. High levels of anisotropy are generally associated with large molecules or complexes characterized by slow rotational diffusion or low flexibility level. In this study, we used an extrinsic fluorophore covalently linked to DNA to monitor the binding of IN to viral DNA substrate and the subsequent 3′-processing reaction, in the same assay. Both DNA binding and 3′-processing would be expected to have a significant effect on the anisotropy parameter, because each of these steps has a major effect on the molecular size of the fluorescent moiety. The principle underlying the anisotropy-based assay is summarized in Fig. 1. The binding of IN to a ds ODN mimicking one end of the viral DNA increases the steady-state anisotropy value (r), most likely by restricting flexibility, allowing the calculation of fractional saturation function. Following DNA binding, the same sample can be shifted to a permissive temperature for 3′-processing activity. When the fluorophore is linked to the 3′-terminal GT dinucleotide, release of the dinucleotide product should significantly decrease r. The fraction of dinucleotides released can be determined from the real-time decrease in r observed during the reaction (Δrreal-time, corresponding to the difference between IN·DNA complex and free dinucleotide) or after the disruption of all IN·DNA complexes by the addition of SDS (ΔrSDS, corresponding to the difference between unprocessed ds ODN and free dinucleotide). Unlike most standard 3′-processing assays, which are based on quantification of the processed strand (first reaction product), the anisotropy-based assay monitors the released dinucleotide (second reaction product). We tested 21-mer DNA substrates labeled with fluorescein at one end, in all possible combinations (5′- or 3′-extremity of the a or b strand), or labeled on the 2′-amino group of a 3′-terminal 2′-aminouridine (Fig. 2A). The free ds ODNs were characterized by r values of 0.060–0.130 at 25 °C (0.045–0.105 at 37 °C), depending on the location of fluorescein, whereas the fluorescein-labeled dinucleotide was characterized by r = 0.02. DNA binding on the addition of IN was monitored at 25 °C and led to a significant increase in r value (>0.2 in the experimental conditions of Fig. 2). Equilibrium was typically reached after 15 min, as previously reported (12Deprez E. Barbe S. Kolaski M. Leh H. Zouhiri F. Auclair C. Brochon J.C. Le Bret M. Mouscadet J.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Pinskaya M. Romanova E. Volkov E. Deprez E. Leh H. Brochon J.C. Mouscadet J.F. Gottikh M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8735-8743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The processing reaction was started by shifting the sample to a temperature of 37 °C, and the initial r values obtained therefore correspond to rt = 0. In the presence of the divalent cationic cofactor Mg2+, all tested ODNs gave similar rt = 0 values (0.22), indicating that fluorescein position had no effect on DNA binding by IN (Fig. 2B). Experiments carried out in the absence of Mg2+ gave reproducibly larger r values (0.25). This result confirms that DNA-binding activity of IN is not strictly dependent on Mg2+, consistent with other studies (2Engelman A. Hickman A.B. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hazuda D.J. Wolfe A.L. Hastings J.C. Robbins H.L. Graham P.L. LaFemina R.L. Emini E.A. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the larger r value suggests that IN aggregation is favored by an absence of Mg2+, as previously reported (17Deprez E. Tauc P. Leh H. Mouscadet J.F. Auclair C. Brochon J.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9275-9284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The time dependence of r and Δr under real-time conditions at 37 °C is shown in Fig. 2 (B and C): only the DNA substrates HIV-a3F and HIV-aUF, with the fluorescein directly attached to the small GT reaction product, displayed significant decreases in r or Δr, and these decreases were strictly related to the presence of the metallic cofactor. In contrast, HIV-a5F, HIV-b5F, and HIV-b3F displayed no significant decrease in r or Δr value, under either real-time (Fig. 2) or fixed-time conditions (data not shown) (3′-processing activity was normally detected by a gel-electrophoresis method for HIV-b5F and HIV-b3F; HIV-a5F was not tested). The result obtained with these three ODNs indicates that anisotropy is not sensitive enough to differentiate between the DNA substrate (ds ODN 21/21) and the first reaction product (ds ODN 19/21). Furthermore, under real-time conditions, this result suggests that the processed DNA product remains tightly bound to the enzyme after 3′-processing. This tight binding together with the slow catalytic step could be responsible for the observed single-turnover property of IN, even under conditions of excess DNA substrate (25Smolov M. Gottikh M. Tashlitskii V. Korolev S. Demidyuk I. Brochon J.C. Mouscadet J.F. Deprez E. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, the terminal dinucleotide is released normally from IN·DNA complexes after 3′-processing, and our results indicate that the decrease in r is related to the formation of the GT product. Thus, anisotropy is reliable for monitoring the 3′-processing reaction, but only if fluorescein is attached to the GT dinucleotide. The 3′-processing reaction is strongly sequence-dependent, and the endonucleolytic site includes the crucial conserved CA dinucleotide immediately preceding the GT dinucleotide. We assessed sequence specificity, using the anisotropy-based assay and the following ODNs: HIV-a3F corresponds to the wild-type (wt) sequence, whereas HIV-GTGT-a3F is a variant in which the 3′-terminal CAGT sequence is replaced by GTGT. We also tested three nonspecific sequences, NS-TTCC-a3F, NS-CACC-a3F, and NS-CAGT-a3F. We found that the DNA-binding step was not influenced by sequence. Indeed, the final r values obtained after DNA binding were similar for all ODNs, irrespective of sequence context, confirming that in vitro assays primarily reveal the nonspecific DNA binding mode of IN. In contrast, sequence had a major effect on Δr value in catalysis conditions (Fig. 3A). Only HIV-a3F gave a large decrease in Δr. This decrease was abolished by replacement of the 3′-terminal sequence CAGT by GTGT or the use of nonspecific sequences, even with the CAGT sequence at the 3′-end. These results confirm that the CA dinucleotide is strictly required but not sufficient for activity, particularly in the presence of Mg2+, which gives more stringent conditions than Mn2+"

In a previous study, we found that collagen binding by the discoidin domain receptors (DDRs) requires dimerization of their extracellular domains (Leitinger, B. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 16761-16769), indicating that the paradigm of ligand-induced receptor dimerization may not apply to the DDRs. Using chemical cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation of differently tagged DDRs, we now show that the DDRs form ligand-independent dimers in the biosynthetic pathway and on the cell surface. We further show that both the extracellular and the cytoplasmic domains are individually dispensable for DDR1 dimerization. The DDR1 transmembrane domain contains two putative dimerization motifs, a leucine zipper and a GXXXG motif. Mutations disrupting the leucine zipper strongly impaired collagen-induced transmembrane signaling, although the mutant DDR1 proteins were still able to dimerize, whereas mutation of the GXXXG motif had no effect. A bacterial reporter assay (named TOXCAT) showed that the DDR1 transmembrane domain has a strong potential for self-association in a biological membrane and that this interaction occurs via the leucine zipper and not the GXXXG motif. Our results demonstrate that the DDRs exist as stable dimers in the absence of ligand and that receptor activation requires specific interactions made by the transmembrane leucine zipper.

RTK activity normally is under tight control, and dysregulated RTK activation is associated with most cancers, making RTKs important targets for cancer therapy (1Krause D.S. Van Etten R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). RTKs allow the cell to respond to external cues; ligand binding to the extracellular domain (ECD) of RTKs results in transphosphorylation of their cytoplasmic domains, which in turn leads to downstream signaling. The prevailing model of RTK activation states that receptors are monomeric in the absence of ligand but become dimerized upon ligand binding; dimerization brings the cytoplasmic domains in close proximity, favoring transphosphorylation (2Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3502) Google Scholar). However, some studies have found dimerized RTKs in the absence of ligand, suggesting that activation may involve ligand-induced conformational changes within a dimeric receptor (e.g. Refs. 3Moriki T.

The discoidin domain receptor (DDR) family of RTKs consists of two members, DDR1 and DDR2, that are characterized by the presence of an extracellular discoidin homology (DS) domain. Uniquely among RTKs, the DDRs are activated by a major extracellular matrix component, triple-helical collagen (6Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S.

The DDRs are widely expressed in normal and malignant tissues and control developmental processes; DDR1 is essential for mammary gland development in the mouse (9Vogel W.F. Aszodi A. Alves F.

DDR1 and DDR2 share the same domain architecture: an ECD consisting of an N-terminal DS domain followed by a unique sequence of ∼200 amino acids; a single-span transmembrane (TM) domain; an unusually large cytosolic juxtamembrane domain; and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. In a previous study, we found that DDR activation, manifested by receptor autophosphorylation, is a consequence of collagen binding to a specific site within the DDR DS domain (23Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We also observed that collagen binding by the DDRs requires dimerization of their ECDs (23Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but how this observation relates to the oligomeric state of full-length DDRs within the cell membrane and the activation mechanism remained unclear. In the present study, we have analyzed the oligomerization state of full-length DDRs in their natural environment, the mammalian cell membrane. We show that the DDRs form ligand-independent dimers, both in the endoplasmic reticulum and at the cell surface. Neither the ECD nor the cytoplasmic domain of DDR1 is required for this interaction. In contrast, a leucine zipper motif in the DDR1 TM domain mediates strong self-association in a bacterial cell membrane and is essential for DDR1 activation in mammalian cells. Our findings demonstrate that the activation mechanism of DDRs is unlikely to involve ligand-induced receptor dimerization. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured as described (23Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Chemicals and Reagents—Rat tail collagen I (C-7661) was from Sigma (Poole, UK). Bis(sulfonsuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) and sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin were from Pierce. Protein A and protein G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences UK (Chalfont St. Giles, UK). The antibodies and their sources were as follows: rabbit anti-DDR1 (sc-532), goat anti-DDR2 (sc-7554), and rabbit anti-Myc from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-FLAG, M2, from Sigma; rabbit anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) from New England Biolabs (Hitchin UK); anti-phosphotyrosine, clone 4G10, from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-DDR1 Ab 74A, against the ECD, was a kind gift from Dr Michel Faure, SUGEN Inc, San Francisco, CA. Secondary Abs were as follows: sheep anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences); goat anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Ely, UK); rabbit anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). DNA Constructs—Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs or Promega (Southampton, UK). All PCR amplification reactions were performed with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All PCR-derived sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. All constructs for expression in HEK293 cells were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/zeo (Invitrogen). PCR primers used for generating the mutant constructs can be obtained on request. The generation of the DDR1 deletion constructs DS1-1, DS1-2, and ΔDS1 was described previously (23Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The same method was used for the generation of the ΔPG construct, eliminating residues Asn-370-Ala-411. The cytoplasmic DDR1 deletion construct MDN (DDR1b truncated after Arg-525) was a gift from Dr Michel Faure, SUGEN Inc. The cytoplasmic deletion construct ECTM was made by PCR amplification from full-length DDR1b, introducing a STOP codon after Arg-445. The same PCR primers were used to generate the two constructs DS1-2ΔCYT and ΔDS1ΔCYT, but amplification was from the DS1-2 and ΔDS1 constructs, respectively. The TM mutations were constructed by overlap extension PCR using mutagenic primers that introduced the desired point mutations. The TOXCAT constructs were made as follows. The expression vectors pccKAN, pccGpA-wt, and pccGpA-83I and the Escherichia coli malE− strain MM39 (24Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) were a kind gift of Dr. Donald Engelman (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The genes coding for the chimeric proteins with DDR1 TM domains were generated by annealing of custom-designed, complementary oligonucleotides, which were subsequently cloned inframe into a NheI-BamHI digested pccKAN vector. The resulting ToxR′(DDR1-TM)MBP constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and transformed into MM39 cells. Chemical Cross-linking of Surface-expressed Receptors— Cross-linking was carried out for 30 min at room temperature using the homobifunctional reagent BS3. Different concentrations of BS3 in a final volume of 500 μl of PBS were added to confluent cells in 12-well tissue culture plates. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and incubating at room temperature for 15 min followed by cell lysis. Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells at 50% confluency were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation, as described (23Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with plasmid vectors containing DDR-Myc and DDR-FLAG. Single transfections, with either one of the plasmids alone, were also carried out as controls. 48 h later, cells were lysed on ice in 1% Nonidet P40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin. The detergent soluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g, and supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either rabbit anti-Myc or mouse anti-FLAG Abs. Immune complexes were isolated with protein A or protein G conjugated to Sepharose beads, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with either rabbit anti-Myc or mouse anti-FLAG followed by relevant secondary Abs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface biotinylation of HEK293 cells expressing DDR1 constructs was carried out as follows. The cells were incubated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in PBS for 30 min on ice. The reaction was quenched by washing twice with 100 mm glycine in cold PBS. The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (as above), and one aliquot of cell lysate was incubated for 2 h with streptavidin-Sepharose beads to bind biotinylated cell surface receptors. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant was incubated for another 2 h with fresh streptavidin-Sepharose beads to remove any remaining biotinylated cell surface receptors. The beads from the first and second incubation were pooled and washed four times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and then boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer to release bound protein. The supernatant from the second incubation was recovered and incubated with anti-DDR1 Ab to immunoprecipitate the intracellular DDR receptor pool. To analyze the total DDR protein in the sample, another aliquot of starting lysate of equal volume was incubated with anti-DDR1 Ab for DDR immunoprecipitation. As a control for an intracellular protein, ERK2 was chosen. Samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-DDR1 or anti-ERK2 Ab. Collagen-dependent DDR Autophosphorylation—This assay was performed as described (23Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells in 12-well plates were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with the relevant DDR expression vectors. 24 h later, the cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 16 h. Cells were then stimulated with 10 μg/ml collagen for 90 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm NaF. Aliquots of the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs followed by sheep anti-mouse Ig horseradish peroxidase. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To strip the blots, membranes were incubated in either 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 30 min or antibody stripping solution (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) for 10 min at room temperature. The blots were reprobed with rabbit anti-DDR1 or goat anti-DDR2 Abs followed by goat anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase or rabbit anti-goat Ig-horseradish peroxidase. Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) ELISA—To generate cell-free extracts for the CAT ELISA, single colonies of transformed MM39 cells were inoculated into 5 ml of M9 minimal medium containing 0.4% maltose as a unique source of carbon and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking to A600 of 0.6-0.7 and then harvested by pelleting 1 ml of culture at 250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C and finally resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed for 30 min at room temperature, and 75 μl of the resulting cell-free extracts were assayed for CAT concentration using a CAT ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of TOXCAT Proteins—Single colonies of transformed MM39 cells were grown in LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A600 of ∼0.6. Cells were pelleted from 0.5 ml of bacterial culture and resuspended in PBS. Cells were lysed by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with anti-MBP as primary Ab followed by anti-rabbit Abs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Ligand-independent DDR Dimerization—To investigate whether the DDRs exist as preformed oligomers in the absence of collagen, we performed chemical cross-linking experiments. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with human DDR1 (DDR1b isoform) or DDR2 and incubated in the presence or absence of the membrane-impermeable, homobifunctional cross-linker BS3. The DDRs were detected by Western blotting of cell lysates. In the absence of cross-linker, DDR1 is observed to migrate as two species of ∼120 and 125 kDa (Fig. 1A). The lower molecular weight species represents the high mannose, biosynthetic precursor of the receptor, whereas the upper band represents complex glycosylated DDR1 (data not shown and Ref. 25Curat C.A. Eck M. Dervillez X. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45952-45958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the presence of BS3, an ∼240-kDa band, corresponding to the size of a DDR1 dimer, was detected by the anti-DDR1 Ab. Likewise, for DDR2, which migrates as a mixture of three species, with the upper two forms representing complex glycosylated mature forms (data not shown), a band appeared in the presence of BS3, which corresponds to the size of dimeric DDR2. These results indicate that the DDRs, or at least a sizeable fraction of molecules, exist as dimers on the cell surface in the absence of ligand. To confirm the formation of DDR homodimers, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies, using two differently epitope-tagged DDR constructs. Both DDR1 and DDR2 were tagged at the C terminus with either a Myc tag or a FLAG tag. Upon transient transfection into HEK293 cells, these receptor constructs were expressed with the same efficiency as their wild-type counterparts, exhibited the same pattern of protein bands, and showed collagen-dependent autophosphorylation indistinguishable from the wild-type receptors (data not shown). Following transient expression in HEK293 cells, Myc- and FLAG-tagged DDR1 could be immunoprecipitated, respectively, with anti-Myc (Fig. 1B, lane 4) and anti-FLAG Ab (data not shown). The immunoprecipitation was specific since anti-Myc and anti-FLAG Ab did not precipitate, respectively, DDR1-FLAG (Fig. 1B, lane 1) and DDR1-Myc (data not shown). For co-immunoprecipitation assays, DDR1-Myc and DDR1-FLAG were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc Ab, and the precipitated material was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG Ab. Fig. 1B, lane 2, shows that DDR1-FLAG co-precipitated with the anti-Myc Ab, indicating that DDR1-Myc and DDR1-FLAG associate with one another. Importantly, co-precipitation only occurred in lysates from cells co-transfected with both types of tagged DDR1 but not when lysates of singly transfected cells were mixed before immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B, lane 3, asterisk). This indicates that co-precipitation requires the tagged receptors to be expressed on the same cell membrane and rules out nonspecific receptor association after cell lysis. It is notable that both the precursor (high mannose) and the mature forms of DDR1-FLAG co-precipitate with DDR1-Myc expressed in the same cell (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Similar results were obtained with DDR2 (Fig. 1B). We obtained equivalent results when the protocol was reversed, and immunoprecipitation of cells co-expressing the two epitope-tagged forms of the DDRs was performed with the anti-FLAG Ab followed by Western blotting with the anti-Myc Ab (data not shown). From these experiments, we conclude that DDR1 and DDR2 associate to form homodimers and that dimerization already takes place during biosynthesis, preceding the appearance of DDRs on the cell surface. We also investigated whether collagen binding increases the amount of DDR dimers on the cell surface. Cells co-expressing both types of tagged DDRs were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation analysis in the presence or absence of collagen stimulation. For both DDR1 and DDR2, there was no increase in the amount of DDR co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 and data not shown), indicating that collagen binding does not increase DDR dimerization on the cell surface. Neither the Extracellular nor the Cytoplasmic Domain of DDR1 Is Essential for DDR1 Dimerization—We next wished to determine which structural domains in DDR1 are responsible for homodimerization. We made a set of deletion constructs and subjected them to dimerization analysis by both cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation. The extracellular domain of DDR1 is composed of an N-terminal DS domain followed by a domain unique to DDRs. The last ∼40 residues of the DDR1 ECD are rich in Pro and Gly. The cytoplasmic domain is composed of an unusually long juxtamembrane domain (176 amino acids in DDR1b) followed by the tyrosine kinase domain. Notably, neither the cytoplasmic domain nor individual subdomains of the DDR1 ECD were found to be essential for dimerization as none of the deletion constructs was defective in the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3A and data not shown). The cytoplasmic deletion constructs were readily cross-linked by BS3, with prominent bands corresponding to the expected molecular weights of the shortened proteins (Fig. 3B and Supplemental Fig. 1; see the legend for Supplemental Fig. 1 for molecular size determination). The appearance of cross-linked bands corresponding to the expected dimer sizes of these truncated proteins provides strong evidence that the cross-linking assay detects DDR homodimers rather than hetero-oligomers with another unknown protein. Not all of the extracellular deletion mutants could be cross-linked (Fig. 3A and data not shown). We therefore used cell surface biotinylation to establish which of the deletion mutants were localized to the cell surface. There was a strict correlation between the ability of the truncated DDR1 proteins to be cross-linked by BS3 and their surface localization (Fig. 3, A and E), showing that the cross-linking assay indeed detects only surface-localized DDR1. To rule out that DDR1 dimerization is due to multiple interactions along the entire ECD (in which case individual domain deletions within a homodimer might be tolerated), we co-expressed two different ECD deletion mutants that are not expected to be able to interact via their ECD. The DS1-2 construct retains the DDR1 DS domain but places it in an unnatural position close to the TM domain. The co-expressed ΔDS1 construct, on the other hand, is missing the DS domain and retains the rest of the DDR1 ECD. Co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 3C) indicated no impairment in the ability of these proteins to associate, showing that the entire DDR1 ECD is dispensable for DDR1 dimerization. A construct bearing only the DS domain in the ECD with the entire cytoplasmic domain deleted also showed homodimeric interaction in the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3D), indicating that, in the absence of the cytoplasmic domain, the DS domain and the TM domain are sufficient for DDR1 dimerization. The Role of the DDR1 TM Domain in Dimerization and Signaling—As the DDR1 TM domain is common to all of the deletion constructs tested in our dimerization assays, it seemed likely that the TM domain contributes to interactions between the DDR1 monomers. The DDR1 TM domain contains two putative dimerization motifs (Fig. 4A). One is a GXXXG motif (GXXXA in the DDRs) (26Sternberg M.J. Gullick W.J. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), which is the principal component of the dimerization interface of the strongly dimerizing TM domain of glycophorin A (GpA) (28MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). GXXXG motifs are also important for TM interactions of ErbB receptors (29Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition to the GXXXG motif, the DDR1 TM sequence also contains heptad motifs of (iso)leucine residues, which are thought to mediate TM domain dimerization in a similar manner as in leucine zippers (30Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31Gurezka R. Langosch D. J. Biol.

A dimeric leucine zipper is a parallel coiled-coil composed of two α-helices interacting through apolar residues in positions a and d of a 7-residue helical repeat (32Mason J.M. Arndt K.M. Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). To test which (if any) of the potential dimerization motifs are important for DDR1 dimerization or TM signaling, we created three DDR1 TM mutants (Fig. 4A). To disrupt association via the leucine zipper, we introduced Gly-Pro residues (mutants TM1 and TM2), similarly to previous work on E-cadherin (33Huber O. Kemler R. Langosch D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4415-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the erythropoietin receptor (34Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D.

Transport activity is governed by Ca2+, and the primary Ca2+ sensor (CBD1) is located in a large cytoplasmic loop connecting two transmembrane helices. The binding of Ca2+ to the CBD1 sensory domain results in conformational changes that stimulate the exchanger to extrude Ca2+. Here, we present a crystal structure of CBD1 at 2.5Å resolution, which reveals a novel Ca2+ binding site consisting of four Ca2+ ions arranged in a tight planar cluster. This intricate coordination pattern for a Ca2+ binding cluster is indicative of a highly sensitive Ca2+ sensor and may represent a general platform for Ca2+ sensing.

This intricate coordination pattern for a Ca2+ binding cluster is indicative of a highly sensitive Ca2+ sensor and may represent a general platform for Ca2+ sensing. Rapid fluxes of Ca2+ across the sarcolemmal membrane are an important component of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Ca2+ influx mediated by voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels initiates contractions, while Ca2+ efflux is dominated by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (1Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. Kluwer, Boston2001: 133-160Google Scholar). Thus, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is an important component of regulation of cardiac contractility. Under most physiological conditions, the exchanger uses the energy stored in the inwardly directed Na+ gradient to catalyze the extrusion of Ca2+ from the cell with a stoichiometry of 3 Na+ for 1 Ca2+. Activity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is modulated by the binding of Ca2+ to a high affinity regulatory site on an intracellular portion of the protein. Regulatory Ca2+ is not transported but potently activates exchange activity. Recent evidence suggests that Ca2+ may bind to and dissociate from its regulatory site during the rapid Ca2+ fluctuations that occur during a cardiac contraction cycle (2Ottolia M. Philipson K.D. John S. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 899-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger protein is predicted to consist of nine transmembrane segments and a large intracellular loop (3Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Quednau B.D. Reuter H. John S. Qiu Z. Ann.

The transmembrane segments translocate ions across the membrane, and the intracellular loop is largely responsible for regulation of activity. We have previously identified a region of the intracellular loop of the exchanger (amino acids 371–508) that binds Ca2+ with high affinity and mediates activation of exchange activity by Ca2+ (5Matsuoka S.

A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis identified two groups of three aspartate residues within the first Calx-β domain that were associated with the binding of Ca2+ (5Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ to the regulatory site induces substantial conformational changes that presumably mediate regulatory function (2Ottolia M. Philipson K.D. John S. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 899-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A recent major development in the understanding of Ca2+ regulation has been the determination of the structure of the Ca2+ binding region of the large intracellular loop using NMR techniques (9Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Two Ca2+ binding domains (CBD1 and CBD2) were identified that correspond to Calx-β1 and -β2. CBD1 encompasses the same region that we had identified as being responsible for Ca2+ regulation. Binding of Ca2+ to CBD1 induces a substantial conformational change consistent with earlier studies. In the presence of Ca2+, both CBD1 and CBD2 have an immunoglobulin fold. CBD2, in the adjoining Calx-β repeat region, binds Ca2+ with substantially lower affinity and its functional role is unclear. Unlike CBD1, the removal of Ca2+ from CBD2 does not induce protein unfolding. The NMR structure of CBD1 shows a classical immunoglobulin fold with two Ca2+ ions bound in the distal loops (9Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra employed by Hilge and colleagues does not directly visualize the presence of Ca2+ but rather infers positions from Yb3+-induced shifts. Here, we describe the crystal structure of CBD1 using x-ray techniques. Like the NMR structure, we find an immunoglobulin fold, and the two structures superimpose well. Strikingly, the x-ray structure reveals the presence of four Ca2+ ions bound in a unique cluster with important physiological consequences. Expression and Purification of CBD1—A fusion protein encoding residues 370–509 of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) with an N-terminal extension of MRGSHHHHHHGI was expressed using the pQE32 vector (Qiagen) and M15pRep4 Escherichia coli cells (Qiagen). Induced cell pellets were dissolved in buffer B (8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 300 mm NaCl) supplemented with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and EDTA-free complete proteinase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), stirred for 30 min, then sonicated. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 45 min the supernatant was filtered, Triton X-100 (1%), imidazole (10 mm), and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) were added and swirled for 30 min before loading in to a column. The column was washed with buffer B followed by washes with 75% buffer B/25% wash buffer (250 mm Mes, 2The abbreviations used are: Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; CBD, calcium binding domain. pH 6.3, 0.3 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm CaCl2), 50% buffer B/50% wash buffer followed by 25% buffer B/75% wash buffer and finally with 100% wash buffer. Fusion protein was eluted from the column in wash buffer + 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. Fractions containing CBD1 were pooled and concentrated with Centriprep 30 (Amicon) filtered and applied to a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with wash buffer 2 (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2). Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against five changes of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EGTA. Dialyzed protein was concentrated with Centricon 30 (Amicon). Crystal Growth and Structure Determination—Purified CBD1 protein was maintained in a solution of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH = 7.4, + 0.2 mm EGTA at a concentration of 25 mg/ml. This solution was screened against 480 commercially available crystallization conditions with the mosquito crystallization robot (TTP Labtech) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Crystals were obtained at 20 °C in condition number 35 of Hampton Research's Crystal Screen 2 (100 mm HEPES, pH = 7.5, + 70% 2-methylpentane-2,3-diol). These crystals were then optimized by addition of 100 mm guanidine discovered through additive screening using Hampton Research's Additive Screen in conjunction with the Mosquito robot. The resulting crystals diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution (see Table 1 of supplemental material). Data were collected from a cryo-cooled crystal at beamline 8.2.2 of the Advance Light Source (Berkeley, CA). The crystal belongs to the space group P21212 with cell dimensions of a = 59.6 Å, b = 45.5 Å, and c = 57.3 Å. Image data were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The structure of CBD1 was phased by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (11McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the recent NMR structure of CBD1 (PDB accession code 2FWS) were used for the search model. The structure was built using the program COOT (12Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23224) Google Scholar) and refined using CNS (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13853) Google Scholar) with a final R and Rfree of 22.2 and 28.4%, respectively. We sought to uncover the principles underlying Ca2+ regulation of the NCX by resolving the crystal structures of the primary Ca2+ binding domain (CBD1) in the Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free conformations. Initial crystallization trials in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 (Ca2+-bound) and 2 mm EGTA (Ca2+-free) failed. To minimize the impact of these reagents on crystallization, we reduced their concentrations to 0.2 mm. An EGTA-containing sample yielded crystals diffracting to 2.5 Å. The crystal structure had a strong resemblance to the NMR structure (9Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) maintaining the overall immunoglobulin fold. In addition, the positions of four tightly clustered Ca2+ ions were revealed. Further analysis confirmed a contamination of 0.12 mm Ca2+ in condition number 35 of Hampton Research's Crystal Screen 2, which inadvertently led to the Ca2+-bound structure. Structure Overview—The NMR and crystal structures were superimposed with a root mean square difference of 1.8 for 128 Cα atoms (Fig. 1). The overall positional alignment between the two structures coincides well including the notable β-bulge and cis-proline that disrupt the A and G β-strands, respectively. The striking new feature of the crystal structure is the presence of a novel Ca2+ binding site situated in the distal loops of the β-sandwich containing four Ca2+ ions coordinated by an extensive network of amino acids residues. The previously reported NMR structure showed two Ca2+ ions, which approximately represent a positional average of those observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 1). This newly observed Ca2+ binding motif was only revealed by x-ray crystallography and will provide a framework for further biochemical and mutational analysis. There had not previously been any indication that four Ca2+ ions were present in the Ca2+ regulatory domain. Ca2+ binding data had suggested the binding of two Ca2+ ions per regulatory domain (8Levitsky D.O. Fraysse B. Leoty C. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 160–161: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hill coefficients have been variable for binding and functional effects of Ca2+. Values include 0.9 (5Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), 1.4 (15Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and 2.9 (2Ottolia M. Philipson K.D. John S. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 899-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) consistent with the involvement of multiple Ca2+ ions, although the source of the variability is unclear. CBD1 is arranged in a classical immunoglobulin fold, where the β-sandwich motif is formed by two antiparallel β-sheets consisting of strands A-B-E and strands D-C-F-G (Fig. 2a). The presence of a β-bulge in strand A disrupts the antiparallel hydrogen bonding pattern between strands A′ and B. Following the β-bulge, strand A′ associates with strand G′ from the opposing sheet, rather than resuming its interactions with strand B (Fig. 2c). Additionally, there is a cis-proline residue that induces an abrupt loop in the middle of strand G, but unlike strand A, strand G resumes a normal hydrogen bonding pattern with strand F. These geometrical distortions are often observed in external strands A and G of immunoglobulin folds (16Halaby D.M. Poupon A. Mornon J. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) and have been suggested to be protective in preventing aggregation between multiple immunoglobulin domains by disrupting potential intermolecular hydrogen bonding surfaces (18Park S. Saven J.G. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This suggestion seems particularly relevant based on the model presented by Hilge et al. (9Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), predicting that the high affinity Ca2+ sensor (CBD1) and the low affinity Ca2+ sensor (CBD2) form a heterodimer stacked along the A-G interface. The coordinates for CBD1 were compared against other three-dimensional structures using the distance matrix alignment server (Dali) (19Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) revealing a number of structural homologues including fibronectins, cadherins, and integrins. Although there appears to be no apparent sequence identity or functional similarities, members of the immunoglobulin fold family share a common core structure (16Halaby D.M. Poupon A. Mornon J. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which is one of the most prevalent domains encoded by the human genome (20Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. Li P.W. Mural R.J. Sutton G.G. Smith H.O. Yandell M. Evans C.A. Holt R.A. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10570) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Coordination—The striking difference between the crystal and NMR structures is at the Ca2+ binding region. Hilge and colleagues (9Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) were able to assign the positions for two Ca2+ ions by using a three prong approach, which included the recording of pseudo-contact shift data, obtaining spectra from the sample in the presence of Yb3+ ions and utilizing biochemical and mutagenesis data for distance constraints. However, the crystal structure revealed an extensive coordination scheme connecting four Ca2+ ions clustered in the distal loops of the β-sandwich. It appears that the two Ca2+ sites predicted in the NMR structure represent a positional average of those observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 1). The four binding sites are arranged in a parallelogram-like configuration, where the distances between Ca2+ sites 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4 are 4.27, 4.30, and 3.93 Å, respectively (Fig. 2, a and b). These binding sites are primarily coordinated by aspartic and glutamic acid residues forming polydentate interactions, often between two or three Ca2+ ions. The majority of the residues involved in coordinating the Ca2+ ions are located at the C terminus (Asp498, Asp499, Asp500) and in loop E-F (Asp446, Asp447, Ile449, Glu451, Glu454). Additional interactions occur with Glu385 in the A-B loop, Asp421 in the C-D loop, and three water molecules. The overall coordination scheme for each Ca2+ site is summarized in Table 2 of the supplemental material. In short, Ca1 and Ca4 are penta-coordinated, while Ca2 and Ca3 are hexa- and hepta-coordinated, respectively. Glu451, Asp421, and Asp500 coordinate multiple Ca2+ ions and appear to be the key residues in forming a tight binding cluster of four Ca2+ ions. Glu451 is centrally located coordinating Ca1, Ca2, and Ca3. Asp421 coordinates both Ca1 and Ca2, while Asp500 coordinates Ca3 and Ca4. These three residues appear to orient the four Ca2+ ions into a tight binding cluster. Although never previously observed, a similar arrangement of a four Ca2+ ion binding cluster has been predicted for another Ca2+ sensor domain, the C2 domains of synaptotagmin I and phospholipase C (21Ubach J. Zhang X. Shao X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3921-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Two acidic segments, each characterized by three consecutive aspartic acid residues (498–500 and 446–448), were previously suggested to be Ca2+ binding regions (6Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); mutations in residues Asp447, Asp448, Asp498, and Asp500 each result in an apparent 3-fold decrease in Ca2+ affinity (2Ottolia M. Philipson K.D. John S. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 899-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent mutation, E454K, showed an 8-fold decrease in Ca2+ affinity (9Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We directly visualize three residues (Asp446, Ile449, Asp499) and three water molecules that are ligands for Ca2+, which are not part of the Ca2+ binding structure in the NMR study (9Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Conversely, Hilge et al. (9Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) place Asp448 as a Ca2+ ligand, but we find that this residue is not directly involved in the binding of Ca2+. In total, the Ca2+ binding region is tightly regulated through a complex coordination scheme composed mostly of carboxylate moieties. Comparison with Other Ca2+ Binding Proteins—Analysis of sequence and structural data has revealed a number of protein modules that are widespread and repeated throughout nature (22Sadowski I. Stone J.C. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4396-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 23Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These protein modules facilitate the regulation of numerous proteins that vary dramatically in function and impact multiple cellular processes. Analysis of the human genome revealed a number of Ca2+ binding modules (24Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17700) Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ to proteins has a variety of roles. These include enhancing protein stability (25Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L. Science. 2002; 296: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) and inducing conformational changes to facilitate secondary actions as seen with calmodulin (27Adelstein R.S. Cell. 1982; 30: 349-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J.

Science. 2004; 304: 394-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and other Ca2+ sensors (30Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). CBD1 forms a unique binding cluster that may be utilized by other Ca2+ sensor proteins. We note sequence and structural similarities between the CBD1 domain and the larger family of C2 domains. C2 domains are the second most abundant Ca2+ binding module present in nature (24Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17700) Google Scholar). The majority of proteins with C2 domains are involved in signal transduction or membrane trafficking (31Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The two C2 domains that are most extensively studied on a structural level are those of synaptotagmin (32Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 33Dai H. Shin O.H. Machius M. Tomchick D.R. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 844-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and phospholipase C (34Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), both of which form an eight-stranded β-sandwich. The β-sandwich scaffold permits variable loops that are widely separated in the primary sequence to facilitate the binding of multiple Ca2+ ions in a cluster. Similar to CBD1, the binding sites are comprised primarily of aspartic acid residues forming polydentate interactions between two or three Ca2+ ions. Sequence alignments (Fig. 3) between CBD1 and C2 domains show a number of similarities around the first acidic segment. However, the existence of a fourth Ca2+ site, as found in CBD1, would require additional acidic coordinating residues not seen in C2 domain structures. As seen in the current structure, these additional residues are located toward the C terminus in the second acidic segment but there is no structural or sequence similarity for this region in C2 domains. Although functionally diverse, the CBD1 and the C2 domains share a common Ca2+ coordination scheme that may be general for Ca2+ sensing. The crystal structure of CBD1 reveals a new Ca2+ binding motif consisting of four Ca2+ ions arranged in a tight cluster. This coordination scheme utilizes carboxylate moieties from aspartic and glutamic acid residues to form polydendate interactions with multiple Ca2+ ions. This unique cluster facilitates the reversible binding of Ca2+ in an environment where the concentration of free Ca2+ is kept low. Further biochemical and mutational analysis based on the crystal structure and structure determinations of other components of the cytosolic loop will facilitate our understanding of the sensory mechanism of NCX.

https://openalex.org/W1971964553,"SMOC-2 is a novel member of the SPARC family of matricellular proteins. The purpose of this study was to determine whether SMOC-2 can modulate angiogenic growth factor activity and angiogenesis. SMOC-2 was localized in the extracellular periphery of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Ectopically expressed SMOC-2 was also secreted into the tissue culture medium. In microarray profiling experiments, a recombinant SMOC-2 adenovirus induced the expression of transcripts required for cell cycle progression in HUVECs. Consistent with a growth-stimulatory role for SMOC-2, its overexpression stimulated DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpressed SMOC-2 also synergized with vascular endothelial growth factor or with basic fibroblast growth factor to stimulate DNA synthesis. Ectopically expressed SMOC-2 stimulated formation of network-like structures as determined by in vitro matrigel angiogenesis assays. Fetal calf serum enhanced the stimulatory effect of overexpressed SMOC-2 in this assay. Conversely, small interference RNA directed toward SMOC-2 inhibited network formation and proliferation. The angiogenic activity of SMOC-2 was also examined in experimental mice by subdermal implantation of Matrigel® plugs containing SMOC-2 adenovirus. SMOC-2 adenovirus induced a 3-fold increase in the number of cells invading Matrigel® plugs when compared with a control adenoviral vector. Basic fibroblast growth factor and SMOC-2 elicited a synergistic effect on cell invasion. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SMOC-2 is a novel angiogenic factor that potentiates angiogenic effects of growth factors.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries from existing vasculature, is a vital process in development, tumor formation, and in the restoration of the blood supply to ischemic tissues. Numerous factors are involved in the regulation of this process such as growth factors, oxygen levels, proteases, and extracellular matrix components. Over the past decade, matricellular proteins have gained more attention in their role in regulating cellular functions and angiogenesis. Matricellular proteins are extracellular proteins that do not contribute structurally to the extracellular milieu but regulate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (1Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Proteins that have been grouped as matricellular proteins include the thrombospondins, tenascins, osteopontin, and the SPARC 3The abbreviations used are: SPARC, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine/osteonectin/BM-40; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFβR, PDGF β receptor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; SMOC-2, secreted modular calcium-binding protein-2; Ad-SMOC-2, SMOC-2 adenovirus; Ad-Myc-SMOC-2, Myc-tagged SMOC-2; siCTR, non-targeting control siRNA; siSMOC-2-1 and siSMOC-2-2, two siRNA molecules targeted to different regions of human SMOC-2; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGM-2, endothelial cell growth medium-2; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; EBM-2, endothelial basal medium-2; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interference RNA; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine.3The abbreviations used are: SPARC, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine/osteonectin/BM-40; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFβR, PDGF β receptor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; SMOC-2, secreted modular calcium-binding protein-2; Ad-SMOC-2, SMOC-2 adenovirus; Ad-Myc-SMOC-2, Myc-tagged SMOC-2; siCTR, non-targeting control siRNA; siSMOC-2-1 and siSMOC-2-2, two siRNA molecules targeted to different regions of human SMOC-2; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGM-2, endothelial cell growth medium-2; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; EBM-2, endothelial basal medium-2; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interference RNA; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine/osteonectin/BM-40) family of proteins. These proteins are expressed in many cell types and are highly expressed during embryogenesis, wound healing, and other instances where there is extensive tissue remodeling.SPARC is highly expressed during embryogenesis, and its expression becomes more restricted in adult tissues (2Porter P.L. Sage E.H. Lane T.F. Funk S.E. Gown A.M. J Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It is highly expressed in adult bone tissues and during processes involving tissue remodeling such as tumorigenesis and wound repair. Mice that are homozygous-null for SPARC are able to develop a relatively normal phenotype but soon develop cataracts (3Gilmour D.T. Lyon G.J. Carlton M.B. Sanes J.R. Cunningham J.M. Anderson J.R. Hogan B.L. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1860-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), have impaired bone formation (4Delany A.M. Amling M. Priemel M. Howe C. Baron R. Canalis E. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and show severe deficiencies in wound repair (5Basu A. Kligman L.H. Samulewicz S.J. Howe C.C. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Strandjord T.P. Madtes D.K. Weiss D.J. Sage E.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L628-L635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have shown the influence of SPARC on several cell processes. It has been show to inhibit cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and alter cell shape (7Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Lane T.F. Pallero M.A. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). SPARC inhibits cell cycle progression (8Funk S.E. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and it binds to collagens and other extracellular matrix proteins and possibly plays a role in the organization of these components (9Sasaki T. Gohring W. Mann K. Maurer P. Hohenester E. Knauper V. Murphy G. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9237-9243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). SPARC has been shown to bind several growth factors and alter their activity. These include platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (10Raines E.W. Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Ross R. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (11Kupprion C. Motamed K. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29635-29640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). SPARC indirectly influences the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (12Hasselaar P. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and transforming growth factor β (13Francki A. Bradshaw A.D. Bassuk J.A. Howe C.C. Couser W.G. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32145-32152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).There is evidence that SPARC is inhibitory for angiogenesis. This is based on the observation that in SPARC-null mice there is increased cell invasion into implanted sponges compared with wild-type mice (14Bradshaw A.D. Reed M.J. Carbon J.G. Pinney E. Brekken R.A. Sage E.H. Wound Repair Regen. 2001; 9: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This is also suggested by the binding of VEGF by SPARC and reduced VEGF receptor activation in the presence of SPARC (11Kupprion C. Motamed K. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29635-29640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, it has been observed that cleavage of SPARC by matrix metalloproteinases and plasmin releases peptides that are pro-angiogenic (15Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Johnson R.S. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 16Sage E.H. Reed M. Funk S.E. Truong T. Steadele M. Puolakkainen P. Maurice D.H. Bassuk J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37849-37857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These peptides are found within the follistatin-like domain of SPARC (8Funk S.E. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Johnson R.S. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Furthermore, follistatin can induce angiogenesis in rabbit cornea assays, and it can synergize with bFGF in this assay (17Kozian D.H. Ziche M. Augustin H.G. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 267-276PubMed Google Scholar).SPARC-related proteins are characterized by the presence of a follistatin-like domain and a C-terminal extracellular calcium-binding domain with two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs (18Hohenester E. Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Timpl R. Jansonius J.N. Engel J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Hohenester E. Gohring W. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the proteins have highly variable N-terminal regions (20Yan Q. Sage E.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These SPARC-related proteins include SC1/Hevin/QR1 (21Guermah M. Crisanti P. Laugier D. Dezelee P. Bidou L. Pessac B.

Biochem. 1993; 217: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and the recently-described SMOC-2 (secreted modular calcium-binding protein)/SMAP2 (26Nishimoto S. Hamajima Y. Toda Y. Toyoda H. Kitamura K. Komurasaki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1576: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). SMOC-2 is expressed in nearly all tissues, with the highest expression found in the heart, muscle tissue, spleen, and ovary (27Vannahme C. Gosling S. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Hartmann U. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but no function has been assigned to this protein. To date, the only clinically relevant role described for SMOC-2 is in the rat carotid artery of accelerated atherosclerotic lesion formation, which demonstrated an up-regulation of SMOC-2 mRNA in response to injury (26Nishimoto S. Hamajima Y. Toda Y. Toyoda H. Kitamura K. Komurasaki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1576: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).In a microarray screen for transcripts that are differentially regulated by the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene, we identified SMOC-2 as a cell cycle-regulated and benzo-[a]pyrene-suppressed transcript. Previous studies from other laboratories have suggested a role for the SMOC-2-related protein SPARC in regulation of angiogenesis (14Bradshaw A.D. Reed M.J. Carbon J.G. Pinney E. Brekken R.A. Sage E.H. Wound Repair Regen. 2001; 9: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Johnson R.S. Sage E.H. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37849-37857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, in studies presented here we have examined the effect of SMOC-2 on growth factor-induced mitogenesis and angiogenesis of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Myc tag antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling. CD31 antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen. α-Tubulin antibody was purchased from Oncogene (Cambridge, MA). Recombinant human VEGF-165 and bFGF were purchased from R&D Systems. Matrigel® was purchased from Cambrex. Small inhibitor RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. for a control non-targeting sequence (siCTR, cat. # D-001210-01), and two SMOC-2 targeting sequences, siSMOC-2-1 (sense: 5′-GAGAGUGGAUCAAGAUAAAdTdT-3′; antisense: 5′-UUUAUCUUGAUCCACUCUCdTdT-3′) and siSMOC-2-2 (sense: 5′-CAAAUCCAUCUCCGUACAAdTdT-3′; antisense: 5′-UUGUACGGAGAUGGAUUUGdTdT-3′) and used according to the manufacturer's specifications.Adenovirus Construction and Cell Culture—Replication-deficient adenovirus vectors were produced using a method originally established by Becker et al. (28Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Briefly, SMOC-2 cDNA was cloned into the multicloning site of pACCMVpLpA plasmid. pACCMVpLpA-SMOC-2 was co-transfected with pJM17 plasmid into 293 cells to allow for homologous recombination to produce the SMOC-2 adenovirus (Ad-SMOC-2). The Myc-tagged SMOC-2 (Ad-Myc-SMOC-2) was constructed by the same protocol but using a vector that contained a Myc tag upstream from the SMOC-2 insert. Control adenoviruses were used that expressed either green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) or β-galactosidase (Ad-βgal) under the control of a CMV promoter. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures infected for 24 h with Ad-GFP at a multiplicity of infection of 10 achieved 90% transduction efficiency (data not shown).Pooled HUVECs were purchased from BD Bioscience Inc. and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions in endothelial cell growth medium-2 (EGM-2). Cells were used in the fourth to fifth cell passages.Western Blot Analysis—HUVECs grown to 70% confluency on 100-mm dishes were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-Myc-SMOC-2 and incubated for 24 h. Medium was removed and replaced with 3 ml of fresh EGM-2, and cultures were harvested 24 h later. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (29Rocnik E.F. van der Veer E. Cao H. Hegele R.A. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38571-38578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with the designated primary antibody (1:1000 for all antibodies) overnight at 4 °C. Bound primary antibody was reacted with anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG or anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated Fab fragments for 1 h and detected by chemiluminescence, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science). Densitometric analyses were made by using the Scion Image computer program (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD).SMOC-2 Antibody Production and Immunofluorescence— Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (San Francisco, CA) was contacted to produce a SMOC-2 antibody. A synthetic peptide sequence (C-YPTLWTEQVKSRQNK) corresponding to the SMOC-2-specific domain (27Vannahme C. Gosling S. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Hartmann U. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was conjugated to KLH: keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for immunizations.Immunofluorescence was performed by culturing HUVECs in 4-well chamber slides to confluence. Cells were transduced with adenovirus made with an empty vector (Ad-Con) or Ad-Myc-SMOC-2 for 48 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Following incubation with anti-SMOC-2 antibody, bound primary antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. After washing, the slides were DAPI-stained and mounted with Vectashield solution (Vector Laboratories). Slides were imaged and analyzed using a Delta Vision Image Restoration Microscopy System (dv1301421, Applied Precision).Microarray Analysis—HUVECs were transduced with Ad-SMOC-2 or Ad-GFP for 48 h. RNA was purified from the HUVECs using a TRIzol kit (Invitrogen). RNA samples were submitted to the microarray core facility at The Department of Genetics and Genomics, Boston University School of Medicine for labeling, hybridization to Affymetrix chips, and data analysis.Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle distribution of DNA content was determined by flow cytometry as described previously (30Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Serum-starved cells pulsed with 10 mm BrdUrd (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h were harvested with trypsin-EDTA, fixed in 65% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/35% ethanol for 1 h at 4 °C, and resuspended in 1 ml of 2 m HCl for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Pharmingen #33284X) using standard laboratory procedures. The labeled cells were analyzed for propidium iodide and BrdUrd staining on a BD Biosciences flow cytometer using CellQuest software.DNA Synthesis Assays—HUVECs were grown in 6-well plates until cells reached 70-80% confluency. Controls and experimental conditions were done in triplicate. The medium was changed to endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2), and the cells were infected with adenovirus using multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) values of 10 and 50. 24 h later, the medium was changed to fresh EBM-2 and either VEGF or bFGF was added at the indicated doses. After 20 h, the medium was changed to 750 μl of EBM-2 containing 4 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The HUVECs were labeled for 4 h at 37 °C. Following washing and precipitation with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, the cells were dissolved in 500 μl of 0.1 m NaOH overnight at 4 °C. The amount of radioactivity in each sample was counted in duplicate using 100 μl of the dissolved cell sample and Ecolite scintillation fluid (ICN). Data were presented relative to Ad-GFP-transduced cells at an m.o.i. of 10 with no growth factors.Cell Proliferation Studies—HUVECs were plated at 10,000 cells/cm2 on 24-well plates. Culture medium was changed every day during the time course. Cells were allowed to adhere; the medium was changed and then transduced with adenoviruses for 24 h. For experiments involving siRNAs, subconfluent HUVECs were transfected with siRNAs according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cultures were trypsinized and plated at 10,000 cells/cm2 on 24-well plates. This was designated as day 0. A hemocytometer was utilized to count the number of cells per well after adding 100 μl of trypsin-EDTA per well, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion.Migration Assays—Cell migration was assayed using a modified Boyden chamber (ChemoTx® plate, Neuroprobe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HUVECs were infected with adenoviral vectors overnight in EGM-2 and then labeled with Dil-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein (10 μg/ml) for 4 h in EBM-2. Cells were then trypsinized and resuspended in phenol red-free EBM at 10,000 cells/25 μl. VEGF or bFGF in phenol red-free EBM was added into the lower chamber. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and three separate experiments were performed in each experimental group.Cellular migration was also measured using a wounding assay. A grid patter was drawn on the underside of 6-well plates before HUVECs were plated on them to serve as landmarks for the start of the migration period. HUVECs were grown to confluency and allowed to remain so for a further 24 h. Cultures were then infected for 24 h with adenovirus or were transfected with siRNAs according to the manufacturer's instructions for 24 h. A cell scraper was used to wipe away the cell monolayer on one side of the start line that had been drawn on the bottom of the plate. Images were captured with a video graphic system (DEI-750 CE Digital Output Camera, Optronics, Goleta, CA) at 4× magnification, and the same areas were photographed at 24 and 48 h with the assistance of the landmarks drawn on the undersurface of the plate. Several fields of view were captured per well, and experiments were repeated three times. Migration was quantified by measuring the area of the cell migration front as they migrated into the scraped area at each time point. Area was quantified using Scion Image analysis software.In Vitro Cell-network Formation Assay—The formation of network-like structures by HUVECs on Matrigel® (BD Biosciences) was performed as previously described (31Leopold J.A. Walker J. Scribner A.W. Voetsch B. Zhang Y.Y. Loscalzo A.J. Stanton R.C. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32100-32106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The 12-well culture plates were coated with Matrigel® according to the manufacturer's instructions. The adenovirus-transduced or siRNA-transfected HUVECs were seeded on coated plates at 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in EGM containing 0%, 0.5%, or 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C for overnight. Cells were observed using an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Nikon). Images were captured with a video graphic system (DEI-750 CE Digital Output Camera, Optronics, Goleta, CA). The degree of network formation was quantified by capturing five high power field images, and the area of the cells was quantified using Scion Corp. (National Institutes of Health Image) area analysis software.Mouse Angiogenesis Assay—The formation of new vessels in vivo was evaluated by the Matrigel® plug assay (BD Biosciences) employing a modification of the procedures described previously (32Skurk C. Maatz H. Rocnik E. Bialik A. Force T. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Prior to injection, 0.5 ml of Matrigel® was mixed with heparin (10 units/ml) in chilled tubes. bFGF (50 ng/ml, R&D Systems) was added to the indicated tubes. Adenoviral vectors encoding GFP or SMOC-2 were added to a final concentration of 2 × 108 plaque forming units of virus. Tissues were sectioned, and immunohistochemistry was performed with an anti-CD31 antibody (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, 1:100 dilution, BD Pharmingen). Bound primary was detected with biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Vector) and the ABC Elite kit from Vector Laboratories using DAB. The sections were counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin. Images were captured using an Olympus BX41 microscope with color digital video camera, and an angiogenic response was quantified by cell counts of CD31-positive cells from 10 high power fields per section.Statistical Analysis—All data were compared by Student's t test or analysis of variance with the Scheffé post-hoc test using StatView 4.5 (Abacus Software, Burlington, MA). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for the number of independent experiments indicated. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant.RESULTSCellular Localization of Overexpressed SMOC-2 in HUVECs— To analyze the effects of SMOC-2 growth regulation of endothelial cells we constructed adenoviral vectors for expressing SMOC-2 (Ad-SMOC-2) and an Myc-tagged SMOC-2 (Ad-Myc-SMOC-2). HUVECs were transduced with the Ad-Myc-SMOC-2 virus or a control adenoviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP). Lysates from AdGFP and Ad-Myc-SMOC-2-transduced HUVECs were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 1A). Cell extracts from the Ad-Myc-SMOC-2-transduced cells showed an intense anti-c-Myc-reactive band of 56 kDa, which corresponded to the predicted size of SMOC-2 fusion protein (Fig. 1A, lane 2) (27Vannahme C. Gosling S. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Hartmann U. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SMOC-2 fusion protein was also detected in the culture medium, which was expected, because SMOC-2 does contain a signal peptide for secretion (27Vannahme C. Gosling S. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Hartmann U. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Endogenous levels of SMOC-2 transcripts were measured by real-time PCR in serum-deprived HUVECs and HUVECs in complete growth medium. As shown in Fig. 1B, serum deprivation led to an 18-fold increase in SMOC-2 mRNA levels.We also performed immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the subcellular distribution of SMOC-2. HUVECs were infected with a control “empty” vector adenovirus (Ad-Con) or Ad-Myc-SMOC-2. The resulting cells were fixed and stained with a c-Myc monoclonal antibody or with rabbit anti-SMOC-2 antisera. The specificity of the anti-SMOC-2 antibody was tested in Rat1 cells, which express low endogenous SMOC-2. Antibody binding to the adenovirus-encoded protein could be inhibited by addition of excess immunizing peptide (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, the SMOC-2 antisera detected a weak signal in the cellular periphery of Ad-Con-infected HUVECs. In contrast, in Ad-Myc-SMOC-2-infected cells we detected very strong staining in the cell periphery and some diffuse staining within the cells. We also performed costaining experiments in which Ad-Myc-SMOC-2-infected cells were stained with anti-SMOC-2 and anti-c-Myc antisera. As shown in Fig. 2B, the merged images showed good overlap between Myc (red) and SMOC-2 (green) signals indicating that the staining pattern was specific for SMOC-2. Taken together, our immunoblotting and immunofluorescence experiments demonstrate that SMOC-2 is predominantly localized to the cellular periphery and that a fraction is secreted from cells. This expression pattern is similar to that reported by other workers for the SMOC-2-related factor SPARC (33Sage H. Vernon R.B. Funk S.E. Everitt E.A. Angello J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) in that SMOC-2 appears to associate with edges of the cell membrane. This would be consistent with a putative role for SMOC-2 as a regulator of extracellular matrix interactions and/or growth factor receptor signaling.FIGURE 2A, confluent HUVECs transduced with either control Ad-Con or Ad-Myc-SMOC-2 were fixed and immunostained with anti-SMOC-2 antibody. Bound primary was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI. Positive staining was predominantly localized to the extracellular periphery. B, SMOC-2 staining was confirmed by double immunolabeling for SMOC-2 and c-Myc tag. Bound anti-c-Myc antibody was detected with a Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI. Positive staining was again predominantly localized to the extracellular periphery, and co-localization of SMOC-2 and the c-Myc tag is indicated by yellow in the merged image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regulation of Cell Cycle-related Transcript by SMOC-2—Because SMOC-2 has similarity to the angiogenic regulator and growth factor-binding protein SPARC, we performed a microarray screen to identify mRNAs that are differentially expressed in HUVECs transduced with Ad-SMOC-2 and Ad-GFP control virus. HUVECs were serum-starved for 24 h in EBM-2 with 0.5% FBS and then transduced with adenovirus for 24 h. RNA samples from transduced cells were subjected to labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix chips containing arrayed oligonucleotides corresponding to the human “transcriptome.” A partial list of the mRNAs that were differentially expressed in Ad-GFP and Ad-SMOC-2-infected cells is presented in Table 1. From the full list it was apparent that numerous cell cycle-related mRNAs were up-regulated in SMOC-2-expressing cells. These include transcripts encoding MCM4 and MCM10 (DNA replication factors required for “licensing” and “initiation” steps of DNA synthesis, respectively), Aurora B kinase (required for G2/M progression), the centromeric protein CENP-F (required for"
https://openalex.org/W1990378217,"Kainate is a glutamate analog that has been widely used in pharmacological studies of neuronal injury related to ischemic conditions and epilepsy. While altered lipid metabolism has been implicated in kainate action, no study has yet investigated the associated changes in lipid metabolites on a systems scale. Here we describe a mass spectrometry-based approach for profiling of lipid mixtures in a nontargeted fashion. Combined with tandem mass spectrometry, this method aims to identify lipids that are altered between two conditions, the kainate-treated and the control hippocampal tissues. In addition to reductions in major phospholipids with mainly polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains, we find elevated levels of ions that correspond to acylated forms of phosphatidylethanolamines and ceramides. Acylated phosphatidylethanolamines are neuroprotective lipids and precursors for anandamide, which signals via cannabinoid receptors. Quantitative analysis of ceramides shows that many molecular species with different acyl compositions are increased during kainate treatment. This increase is mainly restricted to neurons rather than other brain cells in the hippocampus as revealed by immunohistochemistry of brain slices."
https://openalex.org/W2059787437,"HasA is an extracellular heme binding protein, and HasR is an outer membrane receptor protein from Serratia marcescens. They are the initial partners of a heme internalization system allowing S. marcescens to scavenge heme at very low concentrations due to the very high affinity of HasA for heme (Ka = 5,3 × 1010 m-1). Heme is then transferred to HasR, which has a lower affinity for heme. The mechanism of the heme transfer between HasA and HasR is largely unknown. HasR has been overexpressed and purified in holo and apo forms. It binds one heme molecule with a Ka of 5 × 106 m-1 and shows the characteristic absorbance spectrum of a low spin heme iron. Both holoHasA and apoHasA bind tightly to apoHasR in a 1:1 stoichiometry. In this study we show that heme transfer occurs in vitro in the purified HasA·HasR complex, demonstrating that heme transfer is energy- and TonB complex-independent and driven by a protein-protein interaction. We also show that heme binding to HasR involves two conserved histidine residues.

In this study we show that heme transfer occurs in vitro in the purified HasA·HasR complex, demonstrating that heme transfer is energy- and TonB complex-independent and driven by a protein-protein interaction. We also show that heme binding to HasR involves two conserved histidine residues. Heme is a key component of many biochemical reactions. These range from electron transfer in cytochromes to oxygen binding in hemoglobin. Due to the toxicity of free heme, it is almost always associated with proteins in living cells. Heme is also a major source of iron for pathogenic or commensal bacteria in mammals (1Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Bacteria have developed many strategies for acquiring iron from their surroundings. Gram-negative bacteria rely on specific outer membrane receptors. These are either specific for host heme/iron proteins (heme/hemopexin, hemoglobin, transferrin, lactoferrin) or for very potent iron chelators (siderophores), made in most cases by the bacterium (2Ferguson A.D. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 2004; 116: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The bacteria may also use a secreted heme-binding protein or hemophore, HasA (3Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). This system is found in Serratia marcescens and several other Gram-negative bacteria. It allows a very efficient heme uptake due to the very high affinity of HasA for heme (Ka = 5.3 × 1010 m-1) (4Deniau C. Gilli R. Izadi-Pruneyre N. Létoffé S. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Briand C. Lecroisey A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10627-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the equally strong apparent affinity in vivo of HasA for the HasR receptor (apparent Kd of 5 × 10-9 m) (5Létoffé S. Deniau C. Wolff N. Dassa E. Delepelaire P. Lecroisey A. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HasA protein contains 188 amino acid residues with a unique folding pattern consisting of a strongly twisted β-sheet (seven strands) on one side of the protein and four α-helices on the other (6Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The affinity of HasA for heme is due to two axial heme iron ligands (His-32 and Tyr-75) and a third residue (His-83) stabilizing the Tyr-75-Fe bond (4Deniau C. Gilli R. Izadi-Pruneyre N. Létoffé S. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Briand C. Lecroisey A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10627-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The binding of HasA to the HasR receptor depends on two β strands making independent contact with the receptor (7Létoffé S. Debarbieux L. Izadi N. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The HasR receptor belongs to the TonB-class outer membrane-dependent receptors. The three-dimensional structures of these receptors are organized in a “plug and barrel” motif (2Ferguson A.D. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 2004; 116: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Homology modeling of HasR, based on structural and sequential alignments with receptors of known structure, is consistent with HasR having the same organization (8Létoffé S. Wecker K. Delepierre M. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4637-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Heme receptors have several conserved features; two conserved histidine residues and a so-called FRAP box (9Bracken C.S. Baer M.T. Abdur-Rashid A. Helms W. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6063-6072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HasR has similar features, with two conserved histidine residues that are close to each other, as shown by the model; one at the apex of the “plug” and the other one on an extracellular loop (8Létoffé S. Wecker K. Delepierre M. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4637-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutations of these conserved residues have been shown to be deleterious in the heme receptor HemR in Yersinia enterocolitica (9Bracken C.S. Baer M.T. Abdur-Rashid A. Helms W. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6063-6072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HasR receptor can use different substrates, either free heme up to a concentration of 10-6 m or the heme-HasA complex. The system is more efficient for the heme-HasA complex, allowing growth at a heme concentration 100 times lower than for free heme (10Létoffé S. Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9876-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For both substrates heme transport depends upon turnover of the inner membrane TonB·ExbBD protein complex and the proton motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. Higher concentrations of the TonB complex and greater proton motive force are required for heme uptake involving HasA than for uptake of free heme (11Létoffé S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4067-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The precise cascade of events that includes recognition of the hemophore by the receptor, internalization of heme, and release of the empty hemophore is not precisely known. Our in vivo studies have clearly shown that heme transport is dependent upon the TonB complex and the pmf and that hemophore recycling is also dependent upon the TonB complex and the pmf. However, it is not known whether the TonB complex is required for transfer of the heme from the heme-loaded hemophore to the apo-receptor. We have also shown that recycling of HasA requires heme and a higher TonB complex concentration and pmf than uptake of free heme. In vivo, the HasA·HasR complex is irreversible in the absence of an energy source, the TonB complex, and of heme (5Létoffé S. Deniau C. Wolff N. Dassa E. Delepelaire P. Lecroisey A. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the current study the first steps of heme acquisition, the binding of the receptor to its various partners (heme, apo- and holoHasA) and the transfer of heme from the hemophore to the receptor, have been investigated. We have shown that heme transfer from the holohemophore to the aporeceptor does not require the TonB complex and that protein-protein interactions between HasA and HasR drive the heme transfer. Furthermore, we have shown that heme binding to HasR involves two conserved histidine residues. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Plasmids pFR2, pFR2H1, pFR2H2, and pFR2H1H2 were pBAD24 derivatives used for expressing WT 3The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; rR, resonance Raman; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; ZW3-14, (n-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate). and histidine mutant HasR receptors under arabinose control. HisHasA was produced as described from pQE32 (8Létoffé S. Wecker K. Delepierre M. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4637-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HasA76t and HasA encoded by pAM derivatives were used to transform a strain carrying a compatible plasmid that encoded secretion functions, allowing purification from the supernatant. HasA76t is a HasA derivative bearing a pentapeptide insertion after residue 76 (7Létoffé S. Debarbieux L. Izadi N. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Popc4420 (a OmpF-OmpC-LamB-derivative of MC4100) was provided by R. Benz and was used for receptor expression. PAP105 was used for HisHasA expression, and MC4100 was for HasA production. Popc4420 derivatives were grown at 30 °C in M9 minimal medium containing glycerol (0.4%), casamino acids (0.2%), 50 μm FeSO4, and 50 μm sodium citrate in 16-liter fermentors. When the cells reached an optical density of 0.7 at 600 nm, arabinose (40 mg/liter) was added, and the cultures incubated for 3 h to induce receptor expression. C600ΔhemA and C600ΔhemAexbBD::Tn10 transformed with the various HasR constructs were used for growth tests with exogenous heme-loaded hemophore, heme, and hemoglobin, as previously described (7Létoffé S. Debarbieux L. Izadi N. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); for those experiments, HasA variants were used at a 80% heme charge at 40 and 4 μm, and HasR expression was induced by arabinose (20 mg/liter). Plasmid Construction—PFR2H1 and pFR2H2 were constructed using pFR2 as a template in a mutagenic PCR using the following complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides: Hasrhis1, TTCAAAAGAGCGGCGCTGGCCAACGTAATG; Hasrhis1r, CATTACGTTGGCCAGCGCCGCTCTTTTGAA; Hasrhis2mod, ACCAACGGCAGCGCGGCCAGTTCTTCCACG; Hasrhis2rmod, CGTGGAAGAACTGGCCGCGCTGCCGTTGGT. The mutation was verified by sequencing and reintroduced into an otherwise WT pFR2 plasmid using EcoRI and BsrGI for H1 and BstZ17I and BsiWI for H2. For the construction of the double H1H2 mutant, the EcoRI-BsrGI fragment from pFR2H1 was exchanged for the same fragment from pFR2H2 and yielded pFR2H1H2. Protein Expression and Purification, Biochemical Techniques—HisHasA was purified as previously described (7Létoffé S. Debarbieux L. Izadi N. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. HisHasA from a soluble fraction of a 500-ml culture was loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (10 ml) and eluted with a 0 to 1 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, allowing for separation of heme-loaded from heme-free protein. The heme-free protein-containing fractions were then combined and loaded on Ni-NTA-agarose and eluted with an imidazole gradient. This yielded pure apoHisHasA, which was purified using size exclusion chromatography. ApoHis-HasA could be loaded with heme using the theoretical molar extinction coefficient for His-HasA of 21,350 m-1 cm-1 at 276 nm. ApoHasA WT was purified from cells grown in M9 minimal medium as previously described (12Izadi N. Henry Y. Haladjian J. Goldberg M.E. Wandersman C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7050-7057Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ApoHasA76t and the heme pocket mutants were purified from a culture supernatant of Escherichia coli MC4100 harboring the relevant plasmids (grown in LB at 30 °C) by anion exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. Wild-type and mutant HasR were partially purified from crude membrane preparations obtained after French press treatment; membranes from 50 g of wet cells were resuspended and solubilized in 200 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 1% ZW3-14 (n-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate; Calbiochem), 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science mixture, EDTA free). After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged (50,000 × g for 1 h). The supernatant, which mostly contained inner membrane proteins, was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 2% ZW3-14, 20 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged (50,000 × g for 1 h), and the supernatant was frozen at 77 K in liquid nitrogen. The pellet was resuspended in the same volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 2.5% ZW3-14, 20 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged (50,000 × g for 1 h), and the supernatant was frozen at 77 K in liquid nitrogen. The combined supernatants from the second and third solubilization were loaded at 2 ml/min on a 20-ml Q-Sepharose fast-flow column equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.02% ZW3-14, 20 mm EDTA) and extensively washed with the same buffer. The bound proteins were then eluted with 20 column volumes of a linear gradient of buffer A and buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.02% ZW3-14, 1 m NaCl) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at 15 °C. The fractions (4 ml) were tested for the presence of the receptor. and the most enriched fractions were combined and concentrated on an Amicon centriflow filter (cutoff molecular mass of 100 kDa). A second purification by chromatography under the same conditions (but without EDTA) was carried out, and the concentrated fractions were purified on a size exclusion column (Superdex 200pg 320-ml column 60 × 2.6 or Superose 6 24-ml column 300/10; Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.02% ZW3-14, 150 mm NaCl. The routine yield was about 10 mg of purified HasR from 10 g of cells. For purification of the holo receptor, hemin (10-5 m) was added either to the culture 1 h before harvesting or to the membrane preparation before detergent extraction. HoloHasR eluted at a higher salt concentration than for apoHasR for the anion exchange chromatography (not shown). Complexes of apoHisHasA and apoHasR were purified; an excess of apoHisHasA resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.02% ZW3-14, 150 mm NaCl was mixed with partially purified apoHasR in the same buffer. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the preparation was mixed with Ni-NTA-agarose in the same buffer and incubated for a further hour. Unbound material was washed with the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. Bound material was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. The resulting concentrated imidazole eluate was purified on a size exclusion column (Superose 6, 24 ml, 0.5-ml fractions were collected). Control experiments showed that apoHasR did not bind to the Ni-NTA affinity resin under these same conditions (not shown). Absorption spectra (UV-visible) were recorded on a Beckman DU-800 spectrophotometer with 1 cm optical path cuvettes. Gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) either at room temperature or at 4 °C for the gel used for heme peroxidase revelation by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) (14Vargas C. McEwan A.G. Downie J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); in that last case the gel was transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane before development. Amino acid analysis was performed after 6 n HCl hydrolysis for 24 h at 110 °C by the Laboratoire de Chimie Organique at the Institut Pasteur. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Resonance Raman (rR) spectra were obtained from 10 to 55 μm HasA, HasR, and HasA·HasR samples, which were contained in a 5-mm NMR tube spinning at ∼20 Hz. Raman scattering was excited using either 413.1 nm emission from a Kr+ laser (10 milliwatt). UV-visible absorbance spectra were recorded before and after the rR experiments to ensure that the samples were not irreversibly altered in the laser beam. No spectral artifacts attributable to laser-induced sample damage were observed. Spectra were recorded at ambient temperature using 135° backscattering geometry with the laser beam focused to a line. Scattered light was collected with an f1 lens and filtered with a holographic notch filter to attenuate Rayleigh scattered light. The polarization of the scattered light was then scrambled, and the spot image was f-matched to a 0.63-m spectrograph fitted with a 2400 groove/mm grating and a LN2-cooled CCD camera. The spectrometer was calibrated using the Raman bands of toluene and N,N-dimethylformamide as external frequency standards. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Titrations were performed at 25 °C using a MicroCal MCS titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) (15Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Proteins and hemin were in 20 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7, 0.08% ZW3-14. Samples were thoroughly degassed before use by stirring under vacuum. All injections were carried out at 3-min intervals. Due to heme adsorption, the calorimeter cell and the micro syringe used for injections were extensively washed after each experiment. The heat of dilution of the ligand was measured either by injecting the ligand into the buffer alone or by injecting more ligand into the cell after saturation. The value obtained was subtracted from the heat of reaction to give the effective heat of binding. Because apoHasR contains some contaminants, all of the ITC control titrations were carried out with membrane preparation not expressing HasR and purified in the same manner at the equivalent concentration of contaminant than that present in apoHasR sample, i.e. few 10-6 m. No higher signal than that corresponding to the heat dilution of ligand was observed. For the titration experiments the concentrations of wild-type and mutant receptors ranged between 2 and 10 μm, and the ligand was set to 10-20 times this value. The resulting titration data were analyzed and fitted using the Origin for ITC software package supplied by Microcal to obtain the stoichiometry (n), the dissociation constants (Kd), and the enthalpy (ΔH) changes of binding. For the fit any constraints on the stoichiometry and ΔH were not fixed. ITC titrations of HasR with hemin showed 20% of variation of stoichiometry around 1. This was due to the imprecision in the determination of hemin concentration in the presence of detergent and to the fact that hemin is known to be very dynamic in nature inside micelles (16Maiti N.C. Mazumdar S. Periasamy N. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 10708-10715Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The formation of the complex during the ITC experiment was verified by SDS-PAGE and UV-visible spectroscopy. Analysis of the samples by optical absorbance after the ITC experiments was carried out after removal of excess ligand by filtration using a membrane having a molecular mass cut off of 100 kDa. The same protocol was applied for Raman spectroscopy when needed. Ultrafiltration through a membrane having a molecular mass cut off of 100 kDa passes uncomplexed holo-HasA and free heme, thereby allowing them to be separated from the complex. The HasR Receptor Can Be Isolated in Either the Apo or the Holo Form—The S. marcescens hasR gene encoding HasR has been cloned into plasmid pBAD24 to yield pFR2. Membranes from the popc4420(pFR2) strain grown in minimal medium in the presence of arabinose contain a large amount of HasR receptor (Fig. 1A, lane 3) as compared with control membranes from popc4420(pBAD24) grown under the same conditions (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Large amounts of this receptor can be purified in the presence of detergent (Fig. 1, lane 7) using anion exchange followed by size exclusion chromatography. Purified HasR is essentially in its apo form as evidenced by the absence of heme absorbance features in the UV-visible spectrum (see UV-visible spectrum, Fig. 1C, bottom) The heme-bound receptor is produced by adding a solution of hemin to the culture medium or to the membrane preparation. The resulting heme-bound protein has a characteristic UV-visible spectrum that is very different from that of free heme in detergent. For control membranes not expressing the receptor, no protein-bound heme was found (not shown). The behavior of the heme-bound form, holoHasR, on an anion exchange column is different from that of apoHasR; thus, holoHasR is readily purified by ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1A, lane 8, cf. lane 7). Holo-HasR retains its heme under conditions of SDS-gel electrophoresis. This has been demonstrated by SDS-gel electrophoresis of holoHasR at 4 °C followed by ECL-detected heme peroxidase activity (14Vargas C. McEwan A.G. Downie J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Purified holoHasR exhibits a characteristic UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 1C) having a Soret band at 411 nm and Q bands at 533 and 560 nm. The general appearance of the spectrum is consistent across all preparations. The A278:A411 ratio varies between 2 and 1.5 from preparation to preparation depending on the quantity of heme. Amino acid analysis of holoHasR closely matches the HasR amino acid composition (supplemental Table S1). Heme content was quantified by the pyridine-hemochrome method (17Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), which shows that the heme/HasR mole ratio is essentially 1 (1.06 heme molecule/receptor monomer). The resulting extinction coefficients for holoHasR are 1 × 105 m-1 cm-1 for the Soret band at 411 nm and 1.5 × 105 m-1 cm-1 at 278 nm. Accounting for the contribution from heme absorbance at 280 nm, the experimentally determined value for ϵ278 is in reasonable agreement with that calculated on the basis of amino acid composition (1.4 × 105 m-1 cm-1). Because our apoHasR preparation contains some contaminants, its absorbance in the preparation was estimated to account for ⅔ of the total absorbance at 278 nm. Its concentration in subsequent experiments was estimated using the calculated ϵ278 of 1.4 × 105 m-1 cm-1 and multiplying the result by 2/3. We have previously shown that both holoHasA and apoHasA bind to cells expressing the HasR receptor. These associations occur with similar affinities and are independent of the TonB complex (5Létoffé S. Deniau C. Wolff N. Dassa E. Delepelaire P. Lecroisey A. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Herein we address whether analogous behavior occurs between HasA and the purified receptor. Because HasR is purified in the presence of detergent, all of these experiments were carried out in detergent solution to maintain solubility of HasR. Both ApoHasA and HoloHasA Form a 1:1 Stoichiometric Complex with ApoHasR—Stable complexes form upon mixing of both apo- and holoHasA with apoHasR. These complexes can be isolated chromatographically, but because of impurities in our apoHasR preparations, it was difficult to determine their precise stoichiometries. The impurities, which might account for ⅓ of the absorbance of the apoHasR preparation, do not react with HasA (see ITC section). These impurities cannot, therefore, account for spurious determination of the stoichiometry as we carried it out. A His6 tag HasA (HisHasA), having the same affinity for heme, spectral characteristics, and competence to deliver heme to the receptor as wild-type HasA (8Létoffé S. Wecker K. Delepierre M. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4637-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was prepared. It was purified to homogeneity in both its holo and apo forms by affinity chromatography. In the presence of apoHasR, a stable HisHasA·HasR complex formed and was separated from HisHasA by a single gel filtration step (Fig. 2, A and B). Amino acid analyses of HisHasA and HasR complexes made with both apo- and holo-HisHasA were performed. The compositions of both complexes were consistent with 1:1 stoichiometry (supplemental Table S1). It is reasonable to suggest that a similar complex is formed with the non-tagged version of HasA. UV-Visible Absorbance Spectra of HoloHasR and the Complex Formed between HoloHasA and ApoHasR Are Identical— The absorbance spectrum of the purified complex obtained between holoHisHasA and apoHasR differs markedly from that of holoHasA and is virtually identical to that of holoHasR (Fig. 2C). This shows that heme in the HisHasA·HasR complex has an environment similar to that in holoHasR. To address whether these spectral properties are attributable to the His6 tag on holoHasA, the spectral changes that occurred upon mixing holoHasA and a 1.5 m excess of apoHasR were monitored. After several minutes no further spectral changes were observed, suggesting that the reaction had reached equilibrium (Fig. 3). The spectral changes included a shift of the Soret band from 406 nm (holoHasA in detergent) to 411 nm (characteristic of holoHasR), the disappearance of the 620-nm band in the holoHasA spectrum, and the shift of the Q bands (537 and 567 nm in holoHasA versus 533 and 560 nm in the complex, also characteristic of holoHasR) and increase in intensity. The spectra of both holoHasR and freshly prepared complex between holoHasA and apoHasR are almost indistinguishable after normalization of the Soret bands, showing that heme has similar environments in the WT and His-tagged preparations and that the His tag did not contribute to the spectral shift in the purified complex (Fig. 2). Upon HasA·HasR complex formation, the heme initially bound to HasA changes its environment to one similar to that in holoHasR, consistent with the heme having been transferred from holoHasA to apoHasR. Resonance Raman Spectra of holoHasR and the Complex Formed between HoloHasA and ApoHasR Are Identical and Differ from That of HoloHasA—As a means of further testing our hypothesis that heme is transferred from HasA to HasR, we have used resonance rR spectroscopy to compare and contrast the heme environments in holoHasR, holoHasA, and the HasA·HasR complex. The vibrational signatures of the heme, which are provided by rR, constitute a sensitive probe of heme structure, conformation, and environment in proteins. rR spectra were recorded for holoHasA, holoHasR, and the complex formed between holo-HasA and apoHasR (Fig. 4). Oxidation state, spin state, and ligation state marker bands for heme proteins are observed in the high frequency region of their rR spectra. Two ν3 bands (1476 and 1503 cm-1) are observed for holoHasA, consistent with the protein existing in both 6-coordinate high spin and 6-coordinate low spin forms as reported previously (18Caillet-Saguy C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Bertini I. Piccioli M. Turano P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of excess apo-HasR, the ν3 band attributed to 6-coordinate low spin heme shifts from 1503 to 1501 cm-1, where it appears in the spectrum of holoHasR. The rR spectrum of this complex is characteristic of ferric 6-coordinate bishistidine complexes. Accordingly, the oxidation state/porphyrin π* marker band, ν4, for holoHasA, holoHasR, and the HasA·HasR complex is observed at 1372 cm-1, typical of ferric hemes. A small band at about 1476 cm-1 persists after the transfer reaction has reached equilibrium. The spectrum in Fig. 4 is that of a 1:2 mixture of holoHasA and apoHasR. The spectrum of a 1:3 mixture exhibits the same small band. This band persists even after the complex is washed with an excess of buffer via ultra filtration. Hence, the ν3 band at 1476-cm-1 is intrinsic to the complex and corresponds to neither uncomplexed holoHasA nor free heme. The bending modes observed for the peripheral heme propionate δ(CβCcCd) and vinyl δ(CβCaCb) groups in holoHasR have been tentatively assigned to the bands at 376 and 417 cm-1 by comparison with rR assignments for bisimidazole heme model complexes and proteins (19Hurst J.K. Loehr T.M. Curnutte J.T. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1627-1634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Choi S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3683-3692Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover, the low frequency rR spectra of holoHasR and the HasA·HasR complex are indistinguishable. Thus, the propionate and vinyl substituents of the hemes in authentic holoHasR and in the HasA·HasR complex are in comparable environments. Given that (a) the heme in holo-HasA exists as an equilibrium mixture of high and low spin states and (b) the heme in authentic holoHasR is completely low spin, there are two possible explanations for the features in the rR spectrum of the HasA·HasR complex. One is that the heme remains associated with HasA when it complexes with apoHasR, and it is the protein-protein interaction that drives the spin state change to convert all the heme to a low spin form. The second explanation is that the heme is transferred from holoHasA to HasR upon protein-protein complexation. The latter is supported by the identity between the rR signatures of holoHasR and the HasA·H"

Adaptation to loading is achieved through an elevation in disc osmolarity mediated by the numerous charged glycosoaminoglycan side chains of the aggrecan molecule. The goal of this investigation was to determine the functional role of the osmo-regulatory protein, TonEBP, in cells of the nucleus pulposus. We found that TonEBP and its downstream target genes were robustly expressed in the tissues of the disc. Above 330 mosmol/kg, cultured nucleus pulposus cells up-regulated target genes TauT, BGT-1, and SMIT; above 450 mosmol/kg, there was raised expression of HSP-70. In hypertonic media there was activation of TauT and heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) reporter activity and increased binding of TonEBP to the TonE motif. When cells were transfected with the dominant-negative form of TonEBP (DN-TonEBP) there was suppression of TauT and HSP-70 reporter gene expression; pTonEBP enhanced reporter gene expression. Moreover, in hypertonic media, forced expression of DN-TonEBP induced apoptosis. We suppressed TonEBP using small interfering RNA technique and noted a decrease in TauT reporter activity in isotonic as well as hyperosmolar media. Finally, we report that the aggrecan promoter contains two conserved TonE motifs. To evaluate the importance of these motifs, we overexpressed DN-TonEBP and partially silenced TonEBP using small interfering RNA. Both approaches resulted in suppression of aggrecan promoter activity. It is concluded that TonEBP permits the disc cells to adapt to the hyperosmotic milieu while autoregulating the expression of molecules that generate the unique extracellular environment.

The intervertebral disc is a specialized biomechanical structure that permits movement between vertebrae and protects the vertebral bone from mechanical forces. It consists of an outer ligament, the annulus fibrosus that encloses a gel-like tissue, the nucleus pulposus. While sparse, cells in the nucleus pulposus secrete a complex extracellular matrix that contains fibrillar collagens and the proteoglycan, aggrecan. The numerous glycosaminoglycan side chains of the aggrecan molecule bind cations thereby raising the osmolarity of the disc tissues (1Maroudas A. Muir H. Wingham J. Biochim. Biophys.

While the hydration properties of the nucleus pulposus permits dynamic loading and unloading, the mechanism by which these cells adapt to elevated osmotic forces is poorly understood.In a number of tissues, cellular adaptation to hyperosmotic stress is mediated by the tonicity enhancer-binding protein (TonEBP), 2The abbreviations used are: TonEBP, tonicity enhancer-binding protein; DN-TonEBP, dominant-negative form of TonEBP; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Wt, wild type; Mt, mutant; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; siRNA, small interfering RNA.2The abbreviations used are: TonEBP, tonicity enhancer-binding protein; DN-TonEBP, dominant-negative form of TonEBP; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Wt, wild type; Mt, mutant; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; siRNA, small interfering RNA. also called OREBP (5Miyakawa H.

Since TonEBP is expressed by a number of cell types, it is reasonable to assume that it serves a variety of physiologic functions, especially those that impact on tissue hydration and the osmotic environment (20Maouyo D. Kim J.Y. Lee S.D. Wu Y. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F802-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The goal of the present study is to examine the role of TonEBP in cells of the postnatal intervertebral disc. We show that TonEBP, and its downstream target genes, are expressed in the nucleus pulposus and the annulus fibrosus. Importantly, our data indicate that TonEBP binds to a TonE motif in the aggrecan promoter and regulates its transcriptional activity. This finding lends credence to the view that TonEBP regulates the hydration status of the disc thereby enhancing cell function in the hyperosmotic environment.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Nucleus Pulposus Cells—Rat nucleus pulposus cells were isolated using method reported earlier by Risbud et al. (21Risbud M.V. Guttapalli A. Stokes D.G. Hawkins D. Danielson K.G. Schaer T.P. Albert T.J. Shapiro I.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 98: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, male Wistar rats (250 g) were euthanized with CO2, and lumbar intervertebral discs were removed from the spinal column. The gel-like nucleus pulposus was separated from the annulus fibrosus, using a dissecting microscope, and treated with 0.1% collagenase and 10 units/ml hyaluronidase for 4–6 h. The partially digested tissue was maintained as an explant in Dulbeccos modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with antibiotics. Nucleus pulposus cells migrated out of the explant after 1 week. When confluent, the cells were lifted using a trypsin (0.25%) EDTA (1 mm) solution and subcultured in 10-cm dishes.RT-PCR Analysis—RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II RT enzyme (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers. PCR reactions were performed using cDNA samples (1 μl) with Superscript DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Primers for rat genes were custom designed and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The PCR product was run on a 1.2% agarose gel and the amplicon visualized on a Kodak 440 imaging station.Immunohistological Studies—Freshly isolated discs were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then embedded in paraffin. Transverse and coronal sections, 6–8 μm in thickness, were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated through graded ethanol, and stained with Alcian blue, and with eosin and propidium iodide. For localizing TonEBP, sections were incubated with the anti-TonEBP antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS at a dilution of 1:100 at 4 °C overnight. After thoroughly washing the sections, the bound primary antibody was incubated with biotinylated universal secondary antibody, at a dilution of 1:20 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were incubated with a streptavidin/peroxidase complex for 5 min and washed with PBS, and color was developed using 3′-3-diaminobenzidine (Vecta Stain Universal Quick Kit, Vector Laboratories).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were plated in flat bottom 96-well plates and maintained in isotonic or hypertonic medium for 24 h. After incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, blocked with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum, and incubated with anti-TonEBP antibody (1:200) (Abcam) at 4 °C overnight. As a negative control, cells were reacted with mouse isotype IgG under similar conditions. After washing, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, St. Louis, MO) at a dilution of 1:50 and 10 μm propidium iodide for 1 h at room temperature. Quantitative image analysis was performed using nine random fields of cells per experimental group. The 36-bit color images were recorded by confocal microscopy using the green and red channel for TonEBP and propidium iodide (nuclear), respectively. Image Pro-plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) was used to calculate the threshold for all cells in the field. The mean density of TonEBP was then plotted as a histogram. Caspase-3 activation was evaluated by visualizing cleavage of the PhiPhiLux-G1D2 substrate (OncoImmune Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview, Tokyo, Japan), and images were analyzed as described above.Nuclear Extracts and Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar) using the CellLytic NuCLEAR extraction kit (Sigma). After culture in isotonic or hypertonic medium, cells were immediately placed on ice. Cells were treated with a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Igeapal CA-630 was added to a final concentration of 0.6% and the mixture was vortexed vigorously for 10 s. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 30 s at 4 °C and extracted by gentle shaking in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgC12, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was then centrifuged for 15 min at 25,000 × g, and the supernatant was snapfrozen at –70 °C. All buffers contained a protease inhibitor mixture.Nuclear extracts were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 3% nonfat dry milk in TBST with the anti-TonEBP antibody (Abcam) at a dilution of 1:500. Immunolabeling was detected using the ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Reporter Plasmids—PCR amplification of a 2.5 kb fragment of the upstream mouse aggrecan promoter spanning –2204 to +290 was performed using LA Taq polymerase (Takara Mirus Bio) using the following primers: forward, 5′-GAGGAGCTCCAGCACAATATCGATGCTCCAGCTAGTGTGCGAAAT-3′, SacI site underlined; reverse, 5′-GGTAGATCTGCAGGGTCGATGAAGGGAAGGGACACAGAAAGGTG-3′, BglII site underlined. The resulting DNA fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), isolated by restriction digestion with SacI and BglII, and ligated into the luciferase basic expression vector, pGL3 (Promega). As an internal transfection control, vector pRL-TK (Promega) containing Renilla reniformis luciferase genes was used. The amount of transfected plasmid, the pretransfection period after seeding, and the post-transfection period before harvesting were optimized for rat nucleus pulposus cells using pSV β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega). Reporter plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Takashi Ito, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan (taurine transporter (TauT) (Wt), TauT (Mt); Ref. 11Ito T. Fujio Y. Hirata M. Takatani T. Matsuda T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48048-48054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Transfections and Dual Luciferase Assay—Nucleus pulposus cells were transferred to 24-well plates at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well 1 day before transfection. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used as a transfection reagent. For each transfection, 330–500 ng of reporter gene plasmid, and 330–500 ng of control plasmid pRL-TK, and where applicable, 330 ng of either DN-TonEBP or FLAG-TonEBP or FLAG-CMV2 (empty vector) expression plasmid, were premixed with the transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the osmolarity of the medium was increased to 400 or 500 mosmol/kg by addition of NaCl. The next day, the cells were harvested and a Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega) was used for sequential measurements of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Quantification of luciferase activities and calculation of relative ratios were carried out using a luminometer (TD-20/20, Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). At least three independent transfections were performed, and all analyses were carried out in triplicate.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electromobility shift assays were performed as previously described with minor modifications (21Risbud M.V. Guttapalli A. Stokes D.G. Hawkins D. Danielson K.G. Schaer T.P. Albert T.J. Shapiro I.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 98: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, the binding reaction was carried out in 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50–100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 1–2 μg poly(dI-dC), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, using 50 fmol of biotin end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (top strand sequence 5′-CAAGCTGGTATTTTTCCACCCAGCA-3′ for TauT and 5′-TGAGAGATTCGGGAGATTTCCACTACACTGCCTGA-3′ for aggrecan) and 10–15 μg of nuclear protein. Following incubation for 45 min at room temperature, extracts were loaded onto 5% acrylamide, 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA gels, electrophoresed at 130 V for 1 h, and transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (HybondTM-N+, Pierce) in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 100 V for 45 min. Transferred DNAs were cross-linked to the membrane at 120 mJ/cm2 and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin according to the manufacturer's instructions (LightShift™ Chemiluminescent EMSA kit, Pierce).Silencing of TonEBP by siRNA—The motif chosen corresponded to the second codon initiating site for the rat TonEBP/NFAT5 gene (23Na K.Y. Woo S.K. Lee S.D. Kwon H.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As a negative control, the inverse cDNA sequence of the second motif was utilized (23Na K.Y. Woo S.K. Lee S.D. Kwon H.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The annealed oligonucleotides were ligated into an expression vector (pSuppressorNeo, Imgenex, San Diego, CA). The plasmid DNA was then linearized with ScaI at a site in the 8-bp loop region and sequenced in both directions as suggested by Ducat et al. (24Ducat D.C. Herrera F.J. Triezenberg S.J. BioTechniques. 2003; 34: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Primary rat nucleus pulposus cells were transfected with circular plasmid DNA containing siRNA sequences using the Trans-Fast transfection reagent (Promega), and clones were selected by culturing in medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml) for 7 days. Following expansion of the clones, total RNA was isolated using RNAeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RT-PCR was used to determine which clones were partially silenced.Measurement of Cell Viability—To measure cell viability, the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was carried out as described previously (25Risbud M.V. Fertala J. Vresilovic E.J. Albert T.J. Shapiro I.M. Spine. 2005; 30: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment, MTT diluted in PBS was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. At the end of the incubation period (2–4 h at 37 °C), the medium was removed, and the precipitated formazan crystals were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide. Product formation was measured by reading the absorbance at 560 nm using a microplate reader (Spectra Flour Plus, Tecan, Durham, NC).Statistical Analysis—All measurements were performed in triplicate, data are presented as mean ± S.D. Differences between groups were analyzed by the Student's t test; *, p < 0.05.RESULTSFig. 1A shows that intervertebral disc tissue of the adult rat robustly express TonEBP mRNA. Cartilage, another aggrecanrich skeletal tissue, also expresses TonEBP mRNA; however, the level of expression is lower than the disc. As might be expected, TonEBP mRNA expression in the kidney is the highest of all the tissues analyzed. The expression of the TauT, HSP-70, and betaine-γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter-1 (BGT-1) is elevated in the disc tissue. However, the level of expression of sodium myo-inositol transporter (SMIT) is lower than that of heart, kidney, or liver. The level of expression of TauT, HSP-70, SMIT, and BGT-1 in the disc is higher than that of cartilage. Immunohistological analysis of neonatal as well as adult rat disc reveals that TonEBP is expressed in neonatal and mature nucleus pulposus cells (Fig. 1, B and D). In both cases, much of the staining is nuclear. However, some staining is seen in the cytosol of the nucleus pulposus cells of the mature discs (Fig. 1D). There is also a prominent expression of TonEBP protein in the annulus fibrosus cells of the mature rat disc (Fig. 1F), which are localized in a narrow zone of Alcian blue-positive matrix (Fig. 1G).Fig. 2A shows that when rat nucleus pulposus cells are cultured in hyperosmotic media (400 mosmol/kg) there is induction of TonEBP mRNA. However, no further increases in mRNA levels are evident when the medium osmolarity is raised to 550 mosmol/kg. A similar pattern of expression is observed for TauT, SMIT, and BGT-1. In contrast, an increase in HSP-70 mRNA expression is seen when the osmolarity is raised to 450 mosmol/kg. Fig. 2B shows that TonEBP protein is robustly expressed under hyperosmotic culture conditions. In accord with the immunohistochemical observations (see Fig. 1), most of the protein is localized to the cell nucleus.FIGURE 2A, influence of osmolarity on expression of TonEBP and its target genes by rat nucleus pulposus cells. Following isolation from the disc, nucleus pulposus cells were maintained in culture in hyperosmolar media (400–550 mosmol/kg). The expression of TonEBP and target genes was evaluated by RT-PCR. An increase in medium osmolarity from isotonic to 400 mosmol/kg results in an elevation in TonEBP, TauT, SMIT, BGT-1, and HSP-70 mRNA levels. Except for HSP-70, further increases in medium osmolarity did not elevate any of the expressed genes. B, Western blot analysis of the expression of TonEBP protein by nucleus pulposus cells at 330–500 mosmol/kg. Most of the TonEBP protein is present in the nuclear fraction of the nucleus pulposus cells. An increase in medium osmolarity from isotonic to 400 and 500 mosmol/kg results in a robust increase in TonEBP protein in the nuclear fraction. Under hypertonic conditions (400 mosmol/kg), there is also a small increase in the cytosolic level of TonEBP, while at 500 mosmol/kg all the protein is localized to the nucleus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3, A and B, shows TauT and HSP-70 reporter activities under hypertonic conditions. When the medium osmolarity is raised, a significant induction in TauT reporter activity is seen. Thus, at 400 mosmol/kg there is 5–6-fold increase in reporter activity. A further increase in medium osmolarity to 500 mosmol/kg causes an additional doubling of the activity. HSP-70 reporter activity is marginally induced at 400 mosmol/kg; however, when the medium osmolarity is raised to 500 mosmol/kg there is a 5–6-fold increase in activity. To further examine the functional interaction of TonEBP protein with the TauT promoter, a gel mobility shift assay was performed. Fig. 3C shows that when the medium is isotonic (330 mosmol/kg) or hypertonic (400–500 mosmol/kg), there is binding of TonEBP to the oligonuclotide probe containing the TonE site of the TauT promoter. The gel shift assay shows that binding of the TonEBP to the TonE probe is increased with raised medium osmolarity. To examine the specificity of this interaction, we used a probe containing mutation in the TonE site; in addition a competition analysis was performed. As expected, there was no/or extremely low binding to the mutant probe. Likewise, excess mutant probe could not compete the binding of TonEBP to wild type TonE.FIGURE 3A and B, evaluation of TonEBP responsive promoter activity in nucleus pulposus cells cultured in hypertonic medium. TauT (A) or HSP-70 (B) reporter plasmids containing a Wt or a Mt TonE, driving firefly luciferase, were transfected into rat nucleus pulposus cells along with pRL-TK vector. Cells were cultured in isotonic (330 mosmol/kg) or hypertonic (400 or 500 mosmol/kg) media for 24 h, and luciferase reporter activity was measured. When the medium osmolarity is raised to 400 mosmol/kg there is a 5-fold increase in TauT reporter activity. At 500 mosmol/kg there is a further doubling of activity. HSP-70 reporter activity does not change until the osmolarity of the medium is increased to 500 mosmol/kg, it then increases 5–6-fold. Cells transfected with mutant TauT (A) or HSP-70 plasmids (Mt) (B) display a very low luciferase activity. Values shown are mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments; *, p < 0.05. C, electromobility shift assay to examine the functional binding of TonEBP protein to TonE. Nuclear protein was isolated from rat nucleus pulposus cells cultured under isotonic or hypertonic conditions. 10 μg of nuclear protein was incubated with 50 fmol of biotin end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing the TonE motif in the TauT promoter. Binding was resolved on a polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a Nylon membrane, and detected using chemiluminescence. Under hypertonic conditions, there is more pronounced binding of TonEBP protein to the DNA probe. When a probe containing the mutant TonE site was used in the binding reaction, there is no or very little binding. Furthermore, the mutant competitor probe did not compete with the binding of TonEBP to labeled wild type TonE probe, confirming the specificity of the interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that TonEBP is required for the induction of TauT and HSP-70 promoter activity, nucleus pulposus cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding DN-TonEBP and full-length TonEBP. Fig. 4 shows that forced expression of DN-TonEBP significantly suppresses TauT (A) and HSP-70 (C) promoter activity. When the medium is hypertonic, the level of expression in cells transfected with DN-TonEBP is lower than expression under isotonic condition. A significant inhibitory effect of DN-TonEBP expression on TauT reporter activity is seen at a dose of 50 ng, which is further enhanced when the concentration of the DN plasmid is increased to 100 ng. Despite further increases in the DN plasmid dose, the reporter activity is not decreased. On the other hand, overexpression of TonEBP under isotonic conditions, using pFLAG-TonEBP vector, results in a significant increase in both TauT (Fig. 4B) and HSP-70 (Fig. 4D) promoter activities. To ensure that the FLAG fusion protein is expressed in nucleus pulposus cells, Western blot and immunofluorescnce analysis was performed (Fig. 4E). As expected, using both the techniques, anti-FLAG antibody detects FLAG-DN-TonEBP in transfected cells only. Moreover, DN-TonEBP does not alter the level of native TonEBP expression in transfected cells.FIGURE 4A–D, TonEBP regulation of TauT and HSP-70 reporter activity in nucleus pulposus cells. Rat nucleus pulposus cells were co-transfected with TauT (Wt) or HSP-70 (Wt) reporter plasmids along with either pFLAG-DN-TonEBP or pFLAG-TonEBP or pFLAG-CMV2 (empty vector). The cells were cultured in isotonicor hypertonic (500 mosmol/kg) medium for 24 h, and reporter activity was measured. Under hypertonic conditions, cells receiving"

Both cytosolic (TR1 and Trx1) and mitochondrial (TR3 and Trx2) enzymes are essential in mammals, but the function of the mitochondrial system is less understood. In this study, we characterized subcellular localization of three TR3 forms that are generated by alternative first exon splicing and that differ in their N-terminal sequences. Only one of these forms resides in mitochondria, whereas the two other isoforms are cytosolic. Consistent with this finding, TR3 did not have catalytic preferences for mitochondrial Trx2 versus cytosolic Trx1, both of which could serve as TR3 substrates. Similarly, TR1 was equally active with Trx1, Trx2, or a bacterial Trx. We generated recombinant selenoprotein forms of TR1 and TR3 and found that these enzymes were inhibited by zinc, but not by calcium or cobalt ions. We further developed a proteomic method for identification of targets of TRs in mammalian cells utilizing affinity columns containing recombinant TR3 forms differing in C-terminal sequences. Using this procedure, we found that Trx1 was the major target of TR3 in both rat and mouse liver cytosol. The truncated form of TR3 lacking selenocysteine was particularly efficient in binding Trx1, consistent with the previously observed role of truncated TR1 in apoptosis. Overall, these data establish that the function of TR3 is not limited to its role in Trx2 reduction.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together with the glutathione system, it controls the redox state of Cys residues in proteins and has numerous other roles in redox regulation of cellular processes. The Trx system is composed of thioredoxin reductase (TR) and Trx. TR is an FAD-containing pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase. It transfers electrons from NADPH to Trx, which in turn reduces thioredoxin peroxidase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, ribonucleotide reductase, and other redox proteins (2Arnér E.S. Holmgren A.

Two Trx systems have been described previously in organisms from yeast to mammals. One is present in the cytosol and is composed of TR1 (also called TXNRD1 or TrxR1) and Trx1 (4Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 379: 5-9Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The second is a mitochondrial system that consists of TR3 (also called TXNRD2 or TrxR2) and Trx2 (5Gasdaska P.Y. Berggeren M.M. Berry M.J. Powis G.

In addition to the reduction of thioredoxins, TRs are capable of reducing a variety of cellular proteins and compounds (7Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Biochim. Biophys.

Trx systems are present in all living organisms and are often required for viability. Cytosolic as well as mitochondrial Trx systems are essential for embryogenesis in mice, as deletion of any of their components (e.g. TR1, TR3, Trx1, or Trx2) has been reported to lead to embryonic lethality (9Jakupoglu C.

There are at least six alternative TR1 forms that differ in their N-terminal residues, including one that contains an additional N-terminal glutaredoxin domain (14Rundlof A.K. Janard M.

In this study, we describe the characterization of intracellular location of three alternative forms of TR3, two of which are extramitochondrial. Further characterization of kinetic parameters revealed that TR3 does not have a substrate preference for Trx2. Instead, we found that TR3 could efficiently interact with Trx1 and that Trx1 is a major TR3 substrate in the cytosol. Thus, the function of TR3 is not limited to its role in mitochondria. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and antibiotic/antimicotic mixture were from Invitrogen. EDTA, NADPH, sodium selenite, sodium phosphate, insulin, glycerol, Tris-HCl, HEPES, sucrose, NaCl, and Escherichia coli Trx were from Sigma. EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science. LB medium and LB-agar medium powder were from Qbiogene, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies and ECL detection reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-human Trx1 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen, and anti-His tag antibodies from Invitrogen. Unless specified otherwise, all other reagents were from Sigma. Construction of Mouse TR3, TR3a, TR3b, and TR3c Expression Vectors—Mouse (m) TR3 cDNA lacking sequences coding for the mitochondrial signal peptide was used as a cloning template, and mTR3a, mTR3b, and mTR3c cDNAs were amplified from it using Pfu Ultra polymerase (Stratagene) and the primers shown in the supplemental material. To prepare different mTR3-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion constructs, primer pairs 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (forward)/2 (reverse) were used to generate mTR3a-EGFP; primer pair 7/2 to generate mTR3b-EGFP; primer pairs 8/2 and 9/2 to generate mTR3c-EGFP; and primer pair 10/2 to generate mTR3 without EGFP (without the mitochondrial signal). The PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI and ApaI sites of pEGFP-N2 (Clontech). In all mTR3 constructs, the selenocysteine (Sec) codon (UGA) was mutated to a Cys codon (UGC). To generate constructs for overexpression of different mutant mTR3 proteins, the primers that are shown in the supplemental material were used. To prepare the mTR3 CU construct, primers 11/12 and 13 were used to generate an E. coli fdhH selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element downstream of the open reading frame. Primers 11/14 and 13 were used to prepare the mTR3 SU construct, which also contained the bacterial SECIS element. These sequences were inserted into pET-28a (Novagen) at NheI and EcoRI sites. The sequences of all constructs were verified by direct DNA sequencing at the Genomics Core Facility of the University of Nebraska. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Subcellular Localization of mTR3 Isoforms—CV-1 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in 25-cm2 culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). CV-1 cells were transfected with the constructs coding for different mTR3 isoforms fused to EGFP. The pEGFP-N2 vector was used as a control. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) and subjected to staining. The cells were stained with MitoTracker, ER-Tracker, or LysoTracker (Molecular Probes) as recommended by the manufacturer. EGFP and Tracker fluorescence was visualized using Olympus FV500 inverted confocal microscopes at the Microscopy Core Facility of the University of Nebraska. Overexpression of mTR3, Human (h) TR1, hTrx1, and Rat (r) Trx2 in E. coli—Bacterial expression constructs, including pET-28a-mTR3, pET-28a-hTR1, pET-15b-hTrx1, and pET-15b-rTrx2, were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The pET-15b-rTrx2 construct (kindly provided by Drs. Antonio Miranda-Vizuete and Giannis Spyrou) codes for rTrx2 that lacks the mitochondrial signal peptide. Cells were grown in LB medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) or ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when cells reached ∼0.6 A600 nm. For expression of Sec-containing proteins, the pET-28a-mTR3-CU, pET-28a-mTR3-SU, and pET-28a-hTR1-CU constructs, containing an E. coli fdhH SECIS element, were used. These constructs were used alone, or the cells were cotransformed with the pSUABC plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Elias Arnér). pSUABC contains chromosomal fragments containing E. coli selA, selB, and selC genes under the control of their endogenous promoters. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when cells reached ∼0.6 A600 nm. Sodium selenite was added 1 h prior to induction to a final concentration of 2 μm. After the induction, cells were grown overnight at 30 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C until used. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—E. coli cells were resuspended at 4 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated. Following centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant fraction was loaded onto a 10-ml TALON™ column (Clontech). Recombinant proteins containing N-terminal His tags were eluted with a linear gradient of 20-200 mm imidazole in loading buffer. Fractions containing hTrx1 or rTrx2 were pooled, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stored at −80 °C. Fractions containing mTR3 or hTR1 were pooled, dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.3), and applied to a 5-ml 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS. The bound proteins were eluted with 1 m NaCl in PBS, and fractions containing pure proteins were dialyzed against PBS and stored at −80 °C. The N-terminal His tags were removed using a His tag cleavage kit (Novagen). Antibodies and Western Blot Analyses—Polyclonal antisera against mTR3 and hTR1 were produced by immunization of rabbits with recombinant mTR3 and hTR1 proteins that contained Cys in place of Sec. Polyclonal antisera against hTrx1 and rTrx2 were produced by immunization of rabbits with recombinant full-length hTrx1 and an rTrx2 form lacking the mitochondrial signal peptide. SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out using NuPAGE Novex gels (Invitrogen), followed by transfer of proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. In Western blot assays, antisera were used at the following dilutions: 1:4000 for TR3, 1:2000 for TR1, 1:2000 for Trx2 and Trx1, and according to the manufacturer's instructions for hTrx1 and proteins containing His tags. Immunoblot signals were visualized using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Thioredoxin Reductase Assay—The concentration of TRs was determined by measuring the flavin absorbance at 460 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 11.3 mm−1 cm−1) or the absorbance at 280 nm and subtracting the absorbance at 310 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 65 mm−1 cm−1). For other purposes, the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). TR and Trx activities were determined using the insulin reduction assay as described previously (19Arnér E.S. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (500 μl) containing 3 μm TR3 or TR1 were used. The reaction was followed by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm resulting from oxidation of NADPH. Apparent Km values were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots of 1/v versus 1/[S]. A molar extinction coefficient of 6220 m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate the kcat value. To test for inhibition of TR activity by metals, the proteins were incubated with the indicated concentrations of metal ions (Ca2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) for 5-10 min prior to adding them to the reaction mixtures. To study the role of EDTA, the reactions were carried out in the presence of the indicated concentrations of EDTA. Cell Fractionation—Cell fractionation was carried out by differential centrifugation. Briefly, rat livers (10-20 g) or mouse livers (2-5 g) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice by 60 Dounce strokes with a tight fitting pestle in buffered sucrose containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet/10 ml; Roche Applied Science). After two centrifugation runs at 1000 × g to discard nuclei, mitochondria were pelleted at 10,000 × g, washed once, resuspended in buffered sucrose, and stored at −80 °C. The cytosolic fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the post-mitochondrial supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. To obtain mitochondrial lysate, an aliquot of the mitochondrial fraction was thawed, resuspended in an appropriate buffer, and sonicated, and the mitochondrial lysate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The protein content was determined by the Bradford assay. Preparation of mTR3-immobilized Resins and Target Search—TR3-immobilized resins were prepared using a previously described procedure for preparing Sepharose-based affinity columns (20Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutant mTR3 proteins in 100 mm sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl were incubated with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) that had been swelled in the same solution for 2 h at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coupling reaction was stopped by centrifugation, and unreacted side chains on the resin were blocked by incubation with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 12 h at 4 °C. Immobilized TR3 was quantified based on the difference between the amounts of TR3 initially used and remaining in solution after the coupling reaction. Typically, >80% of the proteins could be immobilized. To search for TR3 targets, rat or mouse liver mitochondrial or cytosolic lysates (10 mg of protein) were incubated with 0.5 ml of mTR3-immobilized resin containing 5 mg of TR3 at 25 °C for 1 h under gentle stirring. Immobilized TR3 was initially reduced with 0.2 mm NADPH for 30 min. The resins were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The washing was repeated until the absorbance of the wash fraction at 280 nm was negligible. Finally, the resin was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) or 0.2 mm NADPH and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Eluted proteins were separated from the resin by centrifugation and collection of the soluble fractions. The proteins were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Western blot analyses or subjected to staining with a Bio-Safe Coomassie or silver staining kit (Bio-Rad) and identification of the proteins by tandem mass spectrometry at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the University of Nebraska. Identification and Subcellular Localization of TR3 Isoforms Generated by Alternative First Exon Splicing—By exhaustive searches of non-redundant and expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases, we detected several cDNA forms of mTR3, each represented by multiple ESTs. These forms differed in their 5′-sequences followed by common sequences corresponding to the core part of TR3, indicating alternative first exon splicing (Fig. 1). In addition to the mouse sequences, the corresponding forms were found in human and rat sequences, suggesting conservation of alternative splicing to generate multiple forms of TR3 in mammals. All detected TR3 cDNAs could be organized into three groups that resulted in unique open reading frames differing in their N-terminal sequences (Fig. 1A). The first form (TR3a) contains a predicted N-terminal signal peptide for mitochondrial targeting. It is represented by 12 ESTs in mice, 3 in rats, 13 in humans, and 1 in dog (GenBank™ accession number DN387361). Three mTR3 ESTs were slightly shorter than the remaining nine sequences containing the predicted translation initiation codon. However, two additional candidate initiation codons were found immediately downstream. Initiation of translation from any of the three codons was predicted to produce a mitochondrial form of the enzyme. The shorter form was designated as mTR3a2. Analysis of the Kozak consensus requirements (GCCRCCAUGG, where R = A or G) for translation initiation revealed that both the first (CGGACCAUGG) and third (GCGGCGAUGG) AUG codons have favorable consensus sequences and can initiate translation of mitochondrial mTR3. Thus, the mTR3a1 isoform is likely the major mitochondrial TR3 isoform in mice. Two other forms (TR3b and TR3c) have shorter predicted N-terminal sequences and lack predicted signal sequences. TR3b is represented by eight ESTs in mouse (GenBank™ accession numbers CN664710, BY226497, BB843112, BB842317, BY128436, BY217359, BY211475, and BB566223), four ESTs in rat (accession numbers CV114471, CB757630, CB708769, and CK482696), and one EST in human (accession number DN998641). This form was previously predicted, but not characterized (13Sun Q. Zappacosta F. Factor V.M. Wirth P.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol.

TR3c is represented by two ESTs in mouse (accession numbers BY707998 and AK008004), four ESTs in rat (accession numbers AI555332, CO393277, CK468797, and CB759068), and two ESTs in human (accession numbers BX489630 and BE146928). It has not been described previously. The three forms utilize alternative first exons 1-3, followed by common exon 4 (Fig. 1B). Similar gene architectures are used to generate alternative TR3 forms in mouse, rat, and human genomes (Fig. 1B). The order of exons is also conserved, although intron sequences are longer in humans compared with rodents. The cDNAs for TR3b and TR3c were cloned in the pEGFP-N2 expression vector to generate fusion proteins containing C-terminal EGFP. We also cloned the TR3a cDNA with and without the mitochondrial signal peptide. To increase the expression level of proteins, the C-terminal penultimate Sec codon was replaced with a Cys codon in all constructs. The four constructs were then used to assess subcellular localization of the three TR3 forms in CV-1 cells (Fig. 2). Consistent with the previous data for the mitochondrial form of TR3, the TR3a-EGFP protein was targeted to mitochondria (Fig. 2A, panels G-I). However, in the absence of the mitochondrial signal peptide, the protein was detected in the cytosol (Fig. 2A, panels D–F). The TR3b form has only a three-amino acid (in mice and rats) or four-amino acid (in humans) extension over the common sequence derived from exon 4. The protein with this short extension was cytosolic. The TR3c form has a 12-amino acid (in mice and humans) or 10-amino acid (in rats) extension and had a cytosolic location, but the signal exhibited a non-uniform distribution. The regions enriched in TR3c corresponded to neither the endoplasmic reticulum nor lysosomes (Fig. 2B, panels D-I). Overall, these data show that the location of TR3 is not limited to mitochondria and that at least two additional extramitochondrial forms exist. All TR3 forms appear to have unique cellular distribution properties. Preparation and Characterization of Sec-containing Recombinant mTR3 and hTR1—Sec-containing TR1 was previously expressed in E. coli from a construct in which a SECIS element derived from the E. coli fdhH gene was placed downstream of the TR1 open reading frame (16Su D.

To express Sec-containing TR3, we cloned mTR3 cDNA (without the sequence coding for the mitochondrial signal peptide) followed by the fdhH SECIS element into the pET-28a(+) vector. Recombinant His-tagged TR3 was isolated by affinity chromatography on TALON resin. Sec insertion is known to be inefficient during expression of recombinant selenoproteins. We estimated the amount of selenium in the TR3 preparation by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and found that only 5% of the protein was in the Sec-containing form. To increase the yield of the Sec-containing protein, we coexpressed the TR3 construct with the E. coli selA, selB, and selC genes, which code for Sec synthase, Sec-specific elongation factor, and tRNASec, respectively (21Arnér E.S.

Karsnas P. Arnér E.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 5159-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the case of TR3, this procedure allowed a dramatic increase in the efficiency of Sec insertion, as the new TR3 preparation had ∼0.5 eq of selenium, suggesting that 50% of the enzyme molecules were in the Sec-containing form. We repeated this experiment several times and found that the Seccontaining protein accounted for 41-65% of the recombinant enzyme preparations. We similarly cloned and prepared His-tagged Sec-containing hTR1, which also contained ∼0.5 eq of selenium when coexpressed with selA, selB, and selC. To our knowledge, TR3 has not been previously assayed as reductant for mammalian mitochondrial Trx2, its predicted natural substrate. In addition, no comparative analyses have previously been performed for TR1 and TR3. We characterized the catalytic properties of recombinant TR3 and TR1 using a spectrophotometric assay of Trx-dependent insulin reduction (19Arnér E.S. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We used three different recombinant thioredoxins as substrates for these enzymes, including hTrx1, rTrx2 and E. coli Trx. Because TR3 and Trx2 are known as mitochondrial proteins and TR1 and Trx1 as cytosolic proteins, the expectation was that these protein pairs may show the best kinetic parameters. However, we found that the TR3/Trx2 pair had the highest Km and the lowest catalytic efficiency of all tested enzyme-substrate combinations (Table 1). In addition, E. coli Trx was the best substrate for both mammalian TRs. Nevertheless, the differences in kinetic parameters were not dramatic, and the overall data suggest that the efficiency of TR1-based Trx reduction is nearly equal for Trx1 and Trx2 and that TR3 can reduce Trx1 and Trx2 with similar catalytic efficiency. These data are consistent with the results of TR3 intracellular localization experiments. Because the protein is located in different cellular compartments, it may be able to efficiently reduce various thioredoxins, not just the one in mitochondria.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for hTR1 and mTR3SubstrateKmkcatkcat/Kmμmmin−1hTR1E. coli Trx1.5727941180Human Trx11.831547845Rat Trx21.4116441118mTR3E. coli Trx2.561770691Human Trx12.361198508Rat Trx25.12273446 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Thioredoxin Reductase Activity by Metal Ions— It was previously observed that EDTA is required for TR1 catalytic activity, presumably because of inhibition of the enzyme by heavy metal ions present in the reaction mixture (19Arnér E.S.

In addition, a previous study suggested that Ca2+ might be a potential inhibitor of mammalian TR (25Schallreuter K.U. Wood J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The possibility remained that the differences observed were due to analyses of different TR isozymes. We tested various metal ions for their effect on the catalytic activities of recombinant TR1 and TR3 in in vitro assays of insulin reduction using E. coli Trx as a substrate. The presence of EDTA was required for the activities of both TR1 and TR3 (Fig. 3), and progressive increases in the EDTA concentration increased the activities of both enzymes. If the concentration of EDTA in the reaction mixture was higher than 100μm (up to 1 mm tested) (data not shown), the enzymes were fully active. We next tested the effect of Ca2+ on TR1 and TR3 activities and further extended these studies to include Zn2+ (Fig. 4). In this experiment, TR1 and TR3 were preincubated for 5 min with different concentrations of metal ions prior to adding the enzymes to reaction mixtures containing 100 μm EDTA. The data clearly indicated that addition of Ca2+ ions had no effect on either TR1 or TR3 activity up to concentrations higher than the physiological levels (up to 5 mm). In contrast, Zn2+ completely inhibited both enzymes at 100-200 μm and above. Above 200 μm Zn2+ for TR1 and 300 μm Zn2+ for TR3, enzymes precipitated, which precluded activity assays at high concentrations of this metal ion. In the experiments described above, the recombinant TR1 and TR3 we used had N-terminal His tags and were purified by metal affinity chromatography on a TALON resin. Because this resin contains chelated Co2+ ions, the possibility remained that these ions contaminated the protein"

Cells deficient in either of these activities are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of this class of chemotherapeutic drug. Because killing by Sn1 methylators has been attributed to O6-methylguanine (MeG), we have constructed nicked circular heteroduplexes that contain a single MeG-T mispair, and we have examined processing of these molecules by mismatch repair in nuclear extracts of human cells. Excision provoked by MeG-T is restricted to the incised heteroduplex strand, leading to removal of the MeG when it resides on this strand. However, when the MeG is located on the continuous strand, the heteroduplex is irreparable. MeG-T-dependent repair DNA synthesis is observed on both reparable and irreparable 3′ and 5′ heteroduplexes as judged by [32P]dAMP incorporation. Labeling with [α-32P]dATP followed by a cold dATP chase has demonstrated that newly synthesized DNA on irreparable molecules is subject to re-excision in a reaction that is MutLα-dependent, an effect attributable to the presence of MeG on the template strand. Processing of the irreparable 3′ heteroduplex is also associated with incision of the discontinuous strand of a few percent of molecules near the thymidylate of the MeG-T base pair. These results provide the first direct evidence for mismatch repair-mediated iterative processing of DNA methylator damage, an effect that may be relevant to damage signaling events triggered by this class of chemotherapeutic agent.

In addition to its roles in replication and recombination fidelity, the mammalian mismatch repair system has been implicated in the earliest steps of the cellular response to certain classes of DNA damage (1Surtees J.A.

MutSα (MSH2·MSH6 heterodimer) and MutLα (MLH1·PMS2 heterodimer) have been implicated in the earliest steps of the cellular response to Sn1 methylators. Perhaps the most compelling evidence for this view has been provided by the finding that MutSα and MutLα act upstream of damage signaling kinases in response to methylator damage (14Duckett D.R.

Although both MeG-T and MeG-C lesions are recognized by MutSα and both are subject to MutSα-dependent processing in nuclear extracts, MeG-T is a considerably better substrate (14Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I.H. Reardon J.T. Sancar A.

Two models, which are not mutually exclusive, have been proposed to explain the MutSα- and MutLα-dependent damage response to DNA methylators. The futile cycling model posits that replication bypass of a template strand MeG produces a base pair anomaly that activates the mismatch repair system. Because excision-repair by this system is restricted to the new strand, the MeG cannot be removed. This would lead to iterative and futile turnover of the daughter strand, which is postulated to activate damage signaling (10Goldmacher V.S. Cuzick R.A. Thilly W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12462-12471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Karran P. Bignami M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the alternate model, recruitment of a damage recognition complex consisting of MutSα, MutLα, and perhaps other activities to a MeG lesion in the absence of an excision-repair response is sufficient to trigger kinase activation (22Kat A. Thilly W.G. Fang W.H. Longley M.J. Li G.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6424-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Although no direct evidence for either of these models currently exists, the finding that Sn1 DNA methylators result in G2 arrest in the second cell cycle following exposure suggests that replication may be required to elicit the effect (10Goldmacher V.S. Cuzick R.A. Thilly W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12462-12471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tominaga Y. Tsuzuki T. Shiraishi A. Kawate H. Sekiguchi M. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although consistent with the futile turnover model, replication would also be required for production of an MeG-T base pair, which, as noted above, is better recognized by MutSα than is MeG-C. In fact, several DNA polymerases have been shown to display a significant preference for incorporation of thymidylate opposite a template MeG (24Spratt T.E. Levy D.E.

To further clarify the nature of mismatch repair-dependent processing of Sn1 methylator damage, we have constructed both reparable and irreparable nicked heteroduplex DNAs containing a single MeG-T base pair. Analysis of the fate of these DNAs in nuclear extracts has demonstrated that an irreparable heteroduplex molecule, containing MeG on the template strand, is subject to multiple rounds of excision. We have also observed that a small fraction of irreparable molecules is subject to cleavage on the incised strand near the mismatch in a manner that depends on functional MutLα.

Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, and T4 DNA ligase and RNase A were from Roche Applied Science. Substrate Synthesis and Purification—Plasmid pUC19Y (31Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a gift from J. Hays (Oregon State University), was digested with SapI and AatII; the 1927-bp fragment was gel-purified and ligated to one of two oligonucleotide cassettes containing HindIII and SalI sites. Plasmid pSYAH was constructed by ligation to the oligonucleotide duplex d(AGCCGTCGACTCCGATGCGGAAGCTTCGAGGACGGTAGCGAGAGACTCGACGT) annealed to d(CGAGTCTCTC↓GCTACCGTCCTCGAAGCTTCCGCATCGGAGTCGACG↓), which contains two N.BstNBI sites (underlined; location of nicking sites marked by ↓) on the antisense strand (defined as the transcribed strand of the β-lactamase gene and indicated as the outer or top strand in all figures). For plasmid pSYSH, the two N.BstNBI incision sites were placed on the sense strand (depicted as the inner or bottom strand in figures) by ligation of the 1927-bp pUC19Y fragment to the oligonucleotide cassette d(AGCGGAAGAGTCTCTC↓GCTACCGTCCTCGAAGCTTCCGCATCGGAGTCGACG↓T) hybridized to d(CGACTCCGATGCGGAAGCTTCGAGGACGGTAGCGAGAGACTCTTCC). pSYAH and pSYSH plasmids were digested with SspI, which cleaves ∼150 bp from the HindIII site. The linearized plasmid was blunt end-ligated to an oligonucleotide cassette containing a BbvCI site, d(TGGGATCCTCAGCATTATCG), and its complement. Resulting plasmids, pSYAH1A and pSYSH1B, contain a site for N.BbvCIB incision on the antisense strand 5′ to the HindIII sequence and an N.BbvCIA incision site on the sense strand 3′ to the HindIII site. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. pSYAH1A and pSYSH1B plasmids were used for preparation of G-T and MeG-T heteroduplexes, as well as control A·T homoduplex DNAs, by a strategy similar to that described by Wang and Hays (32Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In a typical preparation, 400 μg (300 pmol) of plasmid were incubated with 1000 units of N.BstNBI for 2 h at 55°C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. After supplementation with an additional 400 units of enzyme and incubation for an additional hour, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 nmol of d(CGTCGACTCCGATGCGGAAGCTTCGAGGACGGTAGC) and heating at 82 °C for 20 min. This inactivated the enzyme and melted out the 36-mer between N.BstNBI nicking sites, which was prevented from rehybridizing to the gapped circle by the excess exogenous oligonucleotide. The gapped plasmid was separated from oligonucleotides using either Hipure columns (Roche Applied Science, per manufacturer instructions) or by precipitation with 10% PEG8000. A 10-fold excess of synthetic 36-mer 5′d(pGCTACCGTCCTCGAXGCTTCCGCATCGGAGTCGACG) (X represents either G or MeG) was annealed to the gapped plasmid in T4 DNA ligase buffer (Roche Applied Science) by heating to 80 °C for 10 min and slow cooling to room temperature over an hour in a heating block. The reaction was supplemented with fresh 1 mm ATP and T4 DNA ligase (0.5 units/μg plasmid) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h to overnight. Approximately 50% of the molecules was converted to a closed circular form, which was isolated by CsCl ethidium bromide equilibrium centrifugation. Nicked circular heteroduplexes were prepared by digestion with 5 units of either N.BbvCIA or N.BbvCIB per μg of plasmid for 1 h at 37°C to generate a strand break 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch. Nicking was stopped by phenol extraction and substrate recovered by ethanol precipitation. For pSYAH1A derivatives, 3′ and 5′ nicks were located 152 or 155 bp from the mispair, respectively; corresponding values for pSYSH1B derivatives were 146 and 149 bp. Overall yield of nicked substrate was typically 15–20% relative to starting material. As shown in Fig. 1, G-T or MeG-T mismatches resided within overlapping restriction sites for XhoI and HindIII. As judged by XhoI and HindIII sensitivity, heteroduplex preparations contained <10% homoduplex contamination. Nicked circular homoduplex DNAs were prepared either by the procedures outlined above or by direct incision of pSYAH1A and pSYSH1B plasmid DNAs with N.BbvCIA or N.BbvCIB. No significant differences were observed between preparations obtained by the two methods. In Vitro Mismatch Excision and Repair—HeLa extract containing endogenous AGT was diluted with 1 volume of 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 110 mm KCl (to 12–18 mg/ml) and incubated with 25 μm O6BG for 30 min on ice prior to use in repair or excision reactions. When indicated, MeG-T heteroduplex DNA (100 ng) was pretreated with AGT. Reactions (4 μl) contained 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 400 fmol of AGT, and 100 ng (77 fmol) of heteroduplex. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, samples were chilled on ice prior to use. AGT treatment in this manner converted 80% of XhoI-resistant MeG-C heteroduplex to an endonuclease-sensitive form (not shown). We attribute the residual 20% resistant form to the presence of a contaminant in commercial MeG-containing oligonucleotide preparations. Similar contamination has been observed by others and has been attributed to incomplete deprotection of the modified guanine (33Cejka P. Mojas N. Gillet L. Schar P. Jiricny J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1395-1400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mismatch-provoked excision was performed as described (30Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13302-13311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 34Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 110 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm ATP, 1 mm glutathione, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 ng of substrate DNA, and 100 μg of nuclear extract. Components were assembled on ice, and excision was initiated by transfer to 37 °C. Reactions were terminated after 5 min by addition of 30 μl of stop solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K, 25 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml glycogen). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15–30 min, extracted twice with phenol, and precipitated with ethanol. Recovered DNA was resuspended in 5 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA and digested with 2 units each of BanI and SalI and 1 μg of RNase A before analysis on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml EtBr for 100 V-h. Excision was scored by quantifying the DNA fraction resistant to SalI, which cleaves 15 bp from the mismatch. Mismatch repair reactions were performed in a similar manner except that 100 μm dNTPs were included; reactions were stopped after 15 min, and recovered DNA was digested with BanI and XhoI (to score repair to G·C) or BanI and HindIII (to score repair to A·T). Use of the recommended buffer for HindIII (New England Biolabs buffer 2) resulted in cleavage of about 50% of MeG-T heteroduplex. Because this sensitivity was reduced to <10% by treatment with AGT, HindIII is apparently capable of cleaving a recognition site that contains MeG-T in place of the canonical A·T base pair. This problem was obviated (90–95% resistance) by performing HindIII digests (2 units of enzyme/100 ng of DNA, 37 °C for 1 h) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, which was used for the experiments described here. Label-Chase Analysis—Label-chase reactions (20 μl) with 5′ substrates were performed as described above, except that dNTP composition was 50 μm dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP, 1 μm dATP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 5 min at 37 °C, a 6-μl sample was removed and quenched by addition to 10 μl of stop solution as above. The remainder of the reaction was immediately supplemented with 1.5 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (control), or 10 mm unlabeled dATP (chase). Additional samples were removed at 15 and 30 min, and reactions were terminated as above. Quenched samples were incubated for 30–60 min at 37 °C, and DNA was recovered as described above. DNA products were digested with N.BbvCIB and AflII and subjected to electrophoresis through 1% alkaline agarose 360 V-h. Gels were dried onto DEAE paper (Whatman), and radioactivity was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis using IQMac software (GE Healthcare). For presentation here, line graphs are offset slightly along the x axis to facilitate visual comparison. Label-chase analysis using 3′ substrates was performed in a similar manner except that cold dATP chase was initiated after 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, and reactions done using HCT116BBR extracts were supplemented with 250 fmol of MutLα as indicated. After digestion with N.BbvCIA, AflIII, AflII, and BanI, DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 8% polyacrylamide in 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, 7 m urea (pH 8.0). Gels were dried and analyzed by PhosphorImager as above. Indirect End Labeling of 3′ Repair Products—Mismatch repair reactions were performed in the presence of unlabeled 100 μm dNTPs, and DNA products were recovered as described above. Samples were digested with NlaIII before separating on an 8% polyacrylamide urea gel as above. DNA was transferred to Hybond N+ using a semidry electrotransfer apparatus (Owl Scientific) at 200 mA for 15–30 min per manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS) for 1 h at 45°C before addition of oligonucleotide a136 d(CCGCGCACATTTCCCCGAAAAGTG), which had been end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Following PhosphorImager analysis, the blot was stripped by three 20-min washes with 0.1% SDS, 0.2 m NaOH at 68 °C. The membrane was then blocked again and reprobed with end-labeled oligonucleotide s149 d(CACTTTTCGGGGAAATGTGCGCGG). Excision and Repair on MeG-T Substrates—The nicked heteroduplexes used in this study, constructed using a strategy published previously (14Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 32Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), contained a single mispair (G-T, T-G, MeG-T, or T-MeG; in the notation used here, the first base of the mismatch corresponds to that on the continuous DNA strand, which serves as template for repair) positioned within overlapping HindIII and XhoI sites to allow detection of repair to either A·T or G·C (Fig. 1). The strand break in these molecules was located ∼150 bp either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch, as viewed along the shorter path in the circular DNAs. Mismatches containing MeG activate the mismatch repair system in nuclear extracts (14Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, when MeG resides on the continuous strand of a nicked heteroduplex, the lesion is not expected to be removed because mismatch-provoked excision is restricted to the incised heteroduplex strand (34Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This issue is addressed in Fig. 2 using HeLa nuclear extract, which was pretreated with O6BG to inactivate endogenous AGT. As shown in Fig. 2A, G-T and MeG-T heteroduplexes were subject to mismatch-provoked excision in nuclear extract, as was the MeG-T heteroduplex from which the O6-methyl group was removed by pretreatment with AGT. G-T and T-MeG mismatches were also efficiently repaired to G·C or T·A base pairs, respectively, as judged by conversion to XhoI or HindIII sensitivity, and production of these products was unaffected by AGT pretreatment (Fig. 2B). However, the MeG-T heteroduplex was not subject to detectable repair under these conditions but was corrected to G·C provided that the heteroduplex was pretreated with AGT (Fig. 2B). Repair Tract Labeling and Turnover of Newly Synthesized DNA on a 5′ MeG-T Heteroduplex—Radiolabeling with α-32P nucleotides was used to visualize DNA synthesis associated with mismatch repair. In agreement with previous studies (28Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 35Brooks P. Dohet C. Almouzni G. Mechali M. Radman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4425-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3744-3751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), repair synthesis occurring on a nicked circular DNA in nuclear extract was dependent on the presence of a mismatch within the molecule (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 3, 9, and 15 with lane 19). Analysis of this effect with a G-T heteroduplex showed synthesis to be MutSα-dependent and demonstrated that a 660-nucleotide segment of the incised strand that spans the mispair (fragment A) was labeled to a specific activity three times that of the 1337-nucleotide remainder of the strand (fragment B; supplemental Fig. 1), and synthesis was strongly biased to the incised strand. For G-T and MeG-T heteroduplexes, isotopic labeling of the nicked strand exceeded that of fragment C, which corresponds to the full-length continuous strand, by a factor of 10 or more (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1). The kinetics of repair synthesis on the irreparable 5′ MeG-T heteroduplex differed from those observed with the G-T substrate or the MeG-T heteroduplex that had been demethylated with AGT. Although repair synthesis on the latter reparable DNAs was complete or nearly so within 15 min, synthesis on the MeG-T heteroduplex was slower and ongoing throughout the 30-min period tested (Fig. 3A, compare the labeling of fragment A, which spans the mismatch, in lanes 7–9 with lanes 1–3 and 13–15; see supplemental Fig. 2). For all three DNAs, labeled material smaller than fragment A (<660 nucleotides) was evident; however, the fraction of total label present in this material was elevated in repair products from the MeG-T heteroduplex (Fig. 3A; also see Fig. 3B, dashed lines). The irreparable 5′ MeG-T heteroduplex was also distinguished from the G-T and AGT-treated MeG-T DNAs in terms of the stability of repair DNA synthetic tracts, which was evaluated by labeling with [α-32P]dATP for 5 min and then chasing for 10 or 25 min with a 1000-fold excess of cold dATP (Fig. 3A). For the 5′ G-T heteroduplex, isotopic incorporation into fragments A, B, and C was stable to a 10-min chase (Fig. 3B, top). However, label in DNA smaller than fragment A was reduced substantially during the chase, suggesting that this material represents intermediates produced during the course of repair synthesis. The irreparable 5′ MeG-T heteroduplex behaved differently (Fig. 3B, center). Although the label in fragments B and C was largely resistant to chase, the label in fragment A, which spans the mispair, was not, with a substantial fraction turning over during a 10-min chase. Because the MeG-T lesion in the irreparable heteroduplex activates excision (Fig. 2), production of full-length fragment A during the 5-min labeling period indicates bypass of the template MeG by repair DNA synthesis. Subsequent turnover of this labeled material therefore implies occurrence of an iterative repair/excision process, a presumed consequence of persistence of MeG on the template strand in the 5′ MeG-T heteroduplex. Importantly, pretreatment of the MeG-T heteroduplex with AGT completely eliminated this chase effect (Fig. 3B, bottom), proving that it is a consequence of the MeG lesion. Although fragment A label was stable to chase for the G-T, AGT-pretreated MeG-T, and T-MeG heteroduplexes, about 35% of that associated with the MeG-T heteroduplex was consistently turned over (Fig. 3C). The extent of fragment A turnover observed with the 5′ MeG-T heteroduplex was essentially independent of the whether the cold dATP chase was begun at 5, 10, or 15 min after initiation of the repair reaction (data not shown). Furthermore, DNA synthesis occurring on the MeG-T heteroduplex was greatly reduced, especially during the early stage of the reaction, if both strands of the circular substrate were covalently continuous (supplemental Fig. 3). We therefore attributed the interative excision observed to events occurring on a subset of molecules that retained a strand discontinuity during incubation in nuclear extract. Indeed, an iterative excision mechanism would be expected to inhibit ligation, and this was confirmed to be the case. As shown in supplemental Fig. 4A, ligation of the 5′ MeG-T heteroduplex was retarded as compared with 5′ G-T, AGT-pretreated MeG-T, or T-MeG heteroduplexes. Although only 40% of 5′ G-T, AGT-pretreated MeG-T, or T-MeG heteroduplexes remained unligated after a 5 min incubation in nuclear extract, about 70% of MeG-T heteroduplexes retained a strand discontinuity during this period, and this differential persisted upon further incubation. Thus, the finding that about 35% of the MeG-T fragment A label was turned over during chase implies that at least half of those molecules capable of being processed by the mismatch repair system were subject to interative excision. Processing of a 3′ MeG-T Heteroduplex—Mismatch repair in nuclear extracts of human cells can be directed by a strand break located either 3′ or 5′ to the mispair (34Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polarity of DNA synthesis dictates that excision and repair synthesis occ"
https://openalex.org/W2056355049,"ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels are present in the sarcolemma of cardiac myocytes where they link membrane excitability with the cellular bioenergetic state. These channels are in vivo composed of Kir6.2, a pore-forming subunit, SUR2A, a regulatory subunit, and at least four accessory proteins. In the present study, real-time RT-PCR has demonstrated that of all six sarcolemmal K(ATP) channel-forming proteins, SUR2A was probably the least expressed protein. We have generated mice where the SUR2A was under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter, a promoter that is more efficient than the native promoter. These mice had an increase in SUR2A mRNA/protein levels in the heart whereas levels of mRNAs of other channel-forming proteins were not affected at all. Imunoprecipitation/Western blot and patch clamp electrophysiology has shown an increase in K(ATP) channel numbers in the sarcolemma of transgenic mice. Cardiomyocytes from transgenic mice responded to hypoxia with shortening of action membrane potential and were significantly more resistant to this insult than cardiomyocytes from the wild-type. The size of myocardial infarction in response to ischemia-reperfusion was much smaller in hearts from transgenic mice compared to those in wild-type. We conclude that overexpression of SUR2A generates cardiac phenotype resistant to hypoxia/ischemia/reperfusion injury due at least in part to increase in levels of sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels."

Plant cell wall polysaccharides are the most abundant carbohydrate polymers in nature and constitute an important renewable natural source of energy available for conversion to biofuels (1Demain A.L. Newcomb M. Wu J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 124-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The plant resource is, however, difficult to exploit primarily because its components are extremely resistant to degradation; plant cell wall polysaccharides are often present as insoluble, often cross-linked, structures in which cellulose is the most abundant component. In the cell wall of flowering plants, cellulose is cross-linked by two major types of glycan: xyloglucans and glucuronoarabinoxylans. The xyloglucans form a complex network of hydrogen-bonded interactions with cellulose microfibrils that confers rigidity and extensibility to the walls of all dicotyledons and about one-half of monocotyledons (2Carpita N. McCann M. Buchanan B. Gruissem W. Jones R. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Somerset, NJ2000: 52-108Google Scholar). The xyloglucan polysaccharide consists of a linear chain of β-1,4 d-glucan regularly substituted with α-1,6 d-xylosyl units, which is, in a species-dependent manner, further derivatized with α-l-arabinose or β-d-galactose (2Carpita N.

Considerable interest in the structure, biosynthesis, and enzymatic modification of xyloglucans has been sustained because of the important role these polysaccharides play in plant cell wall morphogenesis (4Reiter W.D.

Microorganisms have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides and consequently exploit this rich carbon and energy source. Aerobic bacteria and fungi secrete several individual enzymes that synergistically degrade plant cell walls (14Milkowski K. Clark J.H. Doi S. Green Chem. 2004; 6: 189-190Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Some anaerobic microorganisms, notably Clostridia, utilize a large multi-enzymatic complex called the cellulosome (15Bayer E.A. Setter E. Lamed R. J Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 552-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellulosome displays a consortium of hydrolytic plant cell wall degrading enzymes, which may change with time, including cellulases, hemicellulases, pectinases, and various esterases.

This cellulosome is a multiprotein complex of about 3 MDa and displays endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase (exoglucanase), xylanase, chitinase, and β-glucanase (lichenase) enzymatic activity (16Bayer E.A. Shimon L.J. Shoham Y. Lamed R. J. Struct Biol. 1998; 124: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Cellulosome enzymes are tethered to the scaffolding protein of the complex through the interaction of dockerin domains with one of the nine cohesin platforms of the scaffold (17Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M.V. Prates J.A.M. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Ferreira L.M.A. Romaão M.J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13809-13814Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), Fig. 2A. There is particular interest in the exploitation of the cellulosome from C. thermocellum, primarily because of the potential it offers for the degradation of lignocellulosic waste and subsequent generation of ethanol (reviewed in Ref. 1Demain A.L. Newcomb M. Wu J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 124-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). To date, 71 open reading frames have been identified as cellulosomal components in Ct and about 23 genes can be ascribed a direct role in cellulose hydrolysis (18Zverlov V.V. Kellermann J. Schwarz W.H. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 3646-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). About half of the other proteins in the cellulosome are described as hemicellulolytic enzymes, highlighting the importance of these accessory enzymes in the processing of cellulosic composites. Recently, two major enzymes implicated in hemicellulose degradation by the Ct cellulosome have been characterized; an endo-β-xylanase and a xyloglucanase (19Zverlov V.V. Schantz N. Schmitt-Kopplin P. Schwarz W.H. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3395-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Xyloglucanase Xgh74A, Fig. 2B, is the first xyloglucanase identified in Ct and the first active xyloglucanase in a cellulosome and likely plays an important role in the degradation of dicot plant cell wall polysaccharides. Many xyloglucanases have been classified into glycosyl hydrolase family 74 (hereafter GH74) in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme (CAZy) classification (20Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar); recently reviewed in Ref. 21Davies G.J. Gloster T.M. Henrissat B. Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar. From the structural point of view, the only member of the GH74 family published to date is the reducing end-specific cellobiohydrolase (OXG-RCBH) from Geotrichum sp. M128 (22Yaoi K. Kondo H. Noro N. Suzuki M. Tsuda S. Mitsuishi Y. Structure. 2004; 12: 1209-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). OXG-RCBH recognizes the reducing end of various xyloglucan-derived oligosaccharides and releases two glucosyl residues of the type GG, XG, or LG (nomenclature according to Ref. 23Fry S.C. York W.S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 48276-48281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was noted that the glucosyl residue at position +2 (nomenclature according to Ref. 25Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) has to be unsubstituted, while that at -1 should preferentially posses a xylosyl substituent. The OXG-RCBH structure consists of a tandem repeat of two seven-bladed β-propeller motifs with the catalytic center formed by the interface of these two domains. The recent enzymatic characterization of the endoxyloglucanase, Xgh74A, shows that the enzyme hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond of the unbranched glucosyl residues in xyloglucan, to yield XXXG, XLXG (or XXLG), and XLLG oligosaccharides (19Zverlov V.V. Schantz N. Schmitt-Kopplin P. Schwarz W.H. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3395-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we describe the crystal structure of Xgh74A both as an uncomplexed apoenzyme at 2.1 Å resolution, and that of an inactive variant, Xgh74A-D70A, with a single molecule of XLLG and one of XXLG bound in the active site cleft. These structures, in light of kinetic and hydrolysis data, reveal the specificity determinants responsible for xyloglucan recognition and provide insight into the hydrolysis of this important plant cell wall polysaccharide. The cellulosomal xyloglucanase A from C. thermocellum is a bi-modular enzyme containing an N-terminal family 74 glycoside hydrolase (GH) catalytic domain followed by C-terminal dockerin (19Zverlov V.V. Schantz N. Schmitt-Kopplin P. Schwarz W.H. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3395-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To express the xyloglucanase catalytic module in Escherichia coli, Xgh74A hereafter, the DNA fragment encoding the protein domain was amplified by PCR from C. thermocellum YS genomic DNA with the thermostable DNA polymerase Pfu Turbo (Stratagene). The primers, 5′-CTCGCTAGCATTTCCAGCCAGGCTGTA-3′ and 5′-CACCTCGAGATCTGAAGCAGGTTCGCC-3′, incorporated NheI and XhoI restriction sites, which are depicted in bold. The amplified product was ligated into pMOSBlue (Amersham Biosciences) and sequenced to ensure that no mutations had occurred during the polymerase chain reaction. The recombinant pMOSBlue derivative was digested with NheI and XhoI, and the excised Xgh74A encoding gene was cloned into the similarly restricted expression vector pET21a to generate pCG1. CtXgh74A encoded by pCG1 contains a C-terminal His6-tag. Mutants of Xgh74A were generated using a PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using pCG1 as the template DNA. The sequences of the primers used to generate the protein mutants were as follows: 5′-GATTTATGCACGTGCCGCTATCGGAGGAGCGTACC-3′ and 5′-GGTACGCTCCTCCGATAGCGGCACGTGCATAAATC-3′, D70A; 5′-CTTGTAAGTGCAGTTGGGGCCCTTGTCGGTTTTGTTC-3′ and 5′-GAACAAAACCGACAAGGGCCCCAACTGCACTTACAAG-3′, D480A. The mutated DNA sequences were sequenced to ensure that only the appropriate mutations had been incorporated into the nucleic acid. E. coli Tuner cells (Novagen) harboring the pET21a-Xgh74A plasmid were cultured in LB containing ampicillin to mid-exponential phase (A600 0.6) at which point, cultures were transferred to 20 °C and induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) whereupon they were grown for a further 20 h. SeMet-labeled Xgh74A was produced in E. coli B834 (DE3) containing the pET21a-Xgh74A plasmid with recombinant protein expression induced by 1 mm IPTG and incubation at 20 °C for 20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 400 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 buffer. The cell-free extract was incubated at 65 °C for 15 min and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. Samples were further purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and buffer exchanged to 10 mm HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5. Xgh74A samples thus purified were assessed pure by SDS-PAGE and were used for crystallization experiments. Xgh74A-D70A and D480A mutants were produced and purified following the native Xgh74A expression and purification protocols. Oligosaccharides were analyzed on a Waters HPLC system with a Dionex Carbopac PA100 column. A Waters Concorde electrochemical detector was used in PAD mode with a 3-mm gold electrode and a HyREF platinum reference electrode. Two optimized gradients were used for different sizes of xylogluco-oligosaccharides. Gradient A (for Analysis of Glc4-based Xylogluco-oligosaccharides)—Solvent A: 100 mm NaOH, solvent B: 100 mm NaOH 200 mm NaOAc. Gradient program: 0-4 min, 100 mm NaOH, 60 mm NaOAc; 4-10 min linear gradient of 60 mm NaOAc to 117 mm NaOAc; 10-11 min 200 mm NaOAc. The system was then re-equilibrated for 4 min with the initial conditions prior to the next injection. Gradient B (for Analysis of Higher Order Xylogluco-oligosaccharides)—Solvent A: 100 mm NaOH, solvent B: 100 mm NaOH 500 mm NaOAc. Gradient program: 0-3 min, 100 mm NaOH, 40 mm NaOAc; 3-11 min linear gradient of 40 mm NaOAc to 170 mm NaOAc; 11-18 min. linear gradient 170 mm NaOAc to 200 mm NaOAc; 18-19 min 500 mm NaOAc. The system was then re-equilibrated for 4 min with the initial conditions prior to the next injection. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed with a Q-T of™ 2 mass spectrometer fitted with a nanoflow ion source (Waters Corporation, Micromass MS Technologies, Manchester, United Kingdom). External calibration of the TOF analyzer (single-reflectron mode, resolution >10000 FWHM) was obtained over the m/z range 50-1000 using a solution of NaI (1.5 g/liter) in 1:1 2-propyl alcohol/water. Solutions of xylogluco-oligosaccharides (typical concentration 0.01-0.1 g/liter in 1:1 MeOH/water containing 0.5 mm NaCl) were infused into the ion source (3 kV) at 200 nl/min (syringe pump). The cone voltage was varied between at 35 V and 130 V to optimize the intensity of [M+Na]+ and [M+2Na]2+ ions. Argon was present in the collision cell at all times, and the collision energy was 10 V. A scan time of 2.5 s with an interscan delay of 0.1 s was used, and continuum data were collected until an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio was achieved after the combination of individual spectra (typically 1-30 spectra). Mixture of Xylogluco-oligosaccharides Based on a Glc4 Backbone (XLLG, XLXG, XXLG, XXXG)—Deoiled tamarind kernel powder (Saiguru Food Gum Manufacturer, Mumbai, India) (20 g) was suspended in ammonium acetate buffer (1 liter; 10 mm; pH 4.5) at 60 °C and was vigorously stirred until homogenous. Then the suspension was cooled to 30 °C and crude cellulase from Trichoderma reesi (Fluka) was added (100 mg, 500 units). The resulting solution was incubated at 30 °C during 18 h under gentle stirring. The progress of the digestion was monitored by HPAEC-PAD (gradient B). The solution was filtered on a glass fiber filter, 1 ml of NH3 (37% in H2O) was added, and the basic solution was pumped over a Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column (10 cm high, 2.6 cm diameter) to remove the cellulase. The resulting solution was freeze-dried to yield a mixture of XGOs as a white powder (typical yield 8-9 g). The following oligosaccharide composition was obtained by HPAEC-PAD (gradient A): XXXG, XLXG, XXLG, XLLG (2:1:3:3). Mixture of Higher Order Xyloglucan Oligosaccharides (Glc8-Glc16 Backbone)—A modified protocol based on that described by Vincken et al. (26Vincken J.P. Dekeizer A. Beldman G. Voragen A.G.J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1579-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was used. One gram of deoiled tamarind kernel powder was dissolved in ammonium acetate buffer (50 ml; 10 mm; pH 4.5) at 60 °C for 1 h. The solution was cooled to 30 °C and 1 mg (1 unit) of crude cellulase (T. reseei, Fluka) was added. The progress of the digestion was monitored by HPAEC-PAD (gradient B). When HPAEC-PAD analysis indicated the presence of predominantly Glc4 and Glc8 oligosaccharides, the digestion was stopped (16 h) by boiling for 30 min. The solution was cooled to room temperature, filtered on a glass fiber filter, and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo to a volume of 10 ml. The oligosaccharides were separated by size exclusion chromatography on two Bio-Gel P6 (Bio-Rad) columns (2 × 90 cm, 2.6 cm diameter) connected in series and maintained at 60 °C. The products were eluted with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with ultrapure water. Fractions (5 ml) were analyzed by HPAEC-PAD (gradient B), pooled; concentrated in vacuo, and finally freeze-dried (typical yield 130 mg of Glc4 oligosaccharides, 190 mg of Glc8 oligosaccharides, 98 mg of Glc12 oligosaccharides, 20 mg of Glc16 oligosaccharides and 8 mg of Glc20 oligosaccharides). XXXGXXXG and Partially Degalactosylated Glc12-based Xyloglucan Oligosaccharides—Degalactosylated higher order oligosaccharides were produced exactly as described in the preceding paragraph, except that 4 units of β-galactosidase (Aspergillus niger, Megazyme, Eire) were added immediately after boiling and cooling the crude cellulase digestion mixture. The degalactosylation reaction was carefully controlled by HPAEC-PAD analysis (gradient B) because of contaminating isoprimeverase activity in the commercial β-galactosidase (27Kato Y. Matsushita J. Kubodera T. Matsuda K. J. Biochem. 1985; 97: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Crystals of SeMet-Xgh74A and Xgh74A-D70A in complex with xyloglucan-derived oligosaccharides were grown by the hanging-drop method. SeMet-Xgh74A (10 mg/ml) was crystallized in 5 mm CdCl2, 12% PEG 4000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. Xgh74A-D70A-XXLG complex crystals were prepared by co-crystallization of the Glc4 XGO mixture and the inactive mutant (46 mg/ml) in 200 mm KSCN, 22% PEG 3350, 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5. In both cases, crystals were cryoprotected by the addition of 20% glycerol (v/v) to the crystallization conditions. A 2.1-Å resolution dataset was collected from an uncomplexed SeMet-Xgh74A crystal at 100 K on beamline ID14.3 (ESRF). Diffraction data of the Xgh74A-D70A-XXLG complex were collected on beamline ID23.1 (ESRF). Both data sets were integrated with MOSFLM and scaled and reduced with SCALA from the CCP4 suite of programs (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Although SeMet data were collected, Xgh74A structure was solved by molecular replacement because the structure of the homologous Geotrichum sp. M128 oligoxyloglucan reducing end-specific cellobiohydrolase (PDB ID: 1SQJ) became available at the time these studies were carried out. The program PHASER (29McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) was used to place the 4 molecules of Xgh74A in the asymmetric unit. The Xgh74A model was built and refined, against the SeMet data using Arp-wARP (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the refined SeMet apo enzyme structure was used as a molecular replacement model for the solution of the Xgh74A-D70A ligand complex, which crystallized in a P43212 form with 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. Manual rebuilding and ligand placement were carried out with COOT (30Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23387) Google Scholar). Solvent model was build with Arp-wARP with maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Xgh74A—Reducing sugars released from the hydrolysis of plant cell wall polysaccharides by Xgh74A were quantified following the method described by Nelson (33Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 153: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and Somogyi (32Somogyi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 160: 69-73Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were measured in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 50 °C. The assay mixture (100 μl) contained 10 μl of enzyme (with appropriate dilution) and concentrations of substrate ranging from 0.05 to 15 g/liter. Activities were determined in triplicate in the linear range of the reactions. Limit Digest of Tamarind Xyloglucan and Glc4-, Glc8-, and Glc12-based Xylogluco-oligosaccharides by Xgh74A—Tamarind xyloglucan (1 g/liter) and Xgh74A (0.02 mg/liter) was incubated in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 (total volume 25 μl) at 50 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min. 10 μl of the sample was analyzed by HPAEC-PAD (gradients A and B). A mixture of Glc4-based xylogluco-oligosaccharides (XXXG, XLXG, XXLG, XLLG) (3.5 g/liter) and Xgh74A (2.3 g/liter) were incubated in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 (total volume 25 μl) at 50 C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then diluted 1:100 into ultrapure water and directly injected for HPAEC-PAD analysis (gradient A). Glc8-(6.3 g/liter) or Glc12-based (9.5 g/liter) xylogluco-oligosaccharides and Xgh74A (0.02 g/liter) were incubated in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 (total volume 25 μl) at 50 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then diluted 1:100 into ultrapure water and directly injected for HPAEC-PAD analysis (gradients A and B). For each of the above cases, comparative experiments were carried out by substituting Trichoderma longibrachiatum endoglucanase (0.25 units, EGII, lot 50201, Megazyme, Erie,) for Xgh74A under identical conditions. The Ct β-1,4-xyloglucan hydrolase Xgh74A is an 842-residue protein that consists of a N-terminal catalytic module (residues 1-776) and a C-terminal dockerin module (residues 777-842), Fig. 2B. For structural and kinetic studies, the Xgh74A catalytic module was cloned into the pET21a vector from residue Ile28 to Glu762 and overexpressed in E. coli Tuner cells (Novagen). Kinetics and Specificity of Xgh74A—Xgh74A was active on tamarind xyloglucan, lichenan, and the artificial substrates carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC 4M, Megazyme, Eire) and hydroxyethylcellulose, Table 1. Xgh74A shows considerably greater catalytic efficiency on xyloglucan (kcat/Km 63 (g/liter)-1 min-1) than on any of the other substrates including CMC 4M (kcat/Km 9 (g/liter)-1 min-1), which like xyloglucan is substituted at the 6 position, in this case with an average degree of substitution of 4 carboxymethyl groups every 10 sugars. The enzyme showed no activity on xylan, polygalacturonic acid, wheat arabinoxylan, rhamnogalacturan, curdlan, laminarin, galactomannan, galactan, and arabinan with a small unquantifiable activity on glucomannan. Taken together the results are strongly suggestive that Xgh74A is a true xyloglucanase.TABLE 1Kinetics of Xgh74A on different polysaccharidesPolysaccharidekcatakcat are in molecules of product per molecule of enzyme per minute.Kmkcat/Kmbkcat/Km values are in (g/liter)−1 min−1.min−1g/literXyloglucan47.540.7662.55CMC-4M43.194.619.37Lichenan35.696.575.43Hydroxyethylcellulose13.055.102.55a kcat are in molecules of product per molecule of enzyme per minute.b kcat/Km values are in (g/liter)−1 min−1. Open table in a new tab Limit digest analysis of tamarind xyloglucan hydrolysis by Xgh74A indicates the liberation of XXXG, XLXG, XXLG, and XLLG (Fig. 3) as the major products. Longer oligosaccharides did not accumulate, but were observed as transient species by HPAEC-PAD. In contrast to previous work on this enzyme (19Zverlov V.V. Schantz N. Schmitt-Kopplin P. Schwarz W.H. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3395-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we saw no evidence for the production of XXG, XXX, or XXGG by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4). We speculate that the acidic ESI conditions and/or different ion optics employed by Zverlov et al. (19Zverlov V.V. Schantz N. Schmitt-Kopplin P. Schwarz W.H. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3395-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) may have contributed to the formation of fragment ions in the ESI source. Here, our use of MeOH/H2O/NaCl as an ESI solvent minimized oligosaccharide fragmentation and yielded exclusively [M+Na]+ or [M+2Na]2+ adducts, depending upon the applied cone voltage (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Mass spectrometric analysis of the hydrolysis products of Xgh74A acting on tamarind xyloglucan.

Two nuclease-hypersensitive sites span the key regulatory elements that control basal tissue-specific and vitamin D3-enhanced OC gene transcription. To gain understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in chromatin remodeling of the OC gene, we have examined the requirement for SWI/SNF activity. We inducibly expressed an ATPase-defective BRG1 catalytic subunit that forms inactive SWI/SNF complexes that bind to the OC promoter. This interaction results in inhibition of both basal and vitamin D3-enhanced OC gene transcription and a marked decrease in nuclease hypersensitivity. We find that SWI/SNF is recruited to the OC promoter via the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, which together with Runx2 forms a stable complex to facilitate RNA polymerase II binding and activation of OC gene transcription. Together, our results indicate that the SWI/SNF complex is a key regulator of the chromatin-remodeling events that promote tissue-specific transcription in osteoblasts.

Within the eukaryotic nucleus, the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures have been implicated in the regulation of key cellular events, such as replication and transcription. During the last decade, a large family of protein complexes that promote transcription by altering chromatin structure have been described (1Becker P. Hörz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 2Narlikar G. Fan H.-Y. Kingston R.

Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Among them is the SWI/SNF complex subfamily that remodels chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner (1Becker P. Hörz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 2Narlikar G. Fan H.-Y. Kingston R.

Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). SWI/SNF complexes are composed of several subunits, which have been implicated in a wide range of cellular events, including gene regulation, cell cycle control, development, and differentiation (1Becker P. Hörz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 3Peterson C. Workman J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The mammalian SWI/SNF complexes contain a catalytic subunit that can be either BRG1 or BRM, which includes ATPase activity. Mutations in the ATPase domain of BRG1 or BRM that abrogate the ability of these proteins to bind ATP result in the formation of inactive SWI/SNF complexes (4De la Serna I. Carlson K. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 5De la Serna I. Carlson K. Hill D. Guido C. Stephenson R. Sif S. Kingston R. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, expression of mutant BRG1 or BRM proteins in NIH3T3 cells impairs the ability of these cells to activate endogenous stress response genes in the presence of arsenite (5De la Serna I.

In addition, we have recently shown that the presence of the mutant BRG1 protein in these NIH3T3 cell lines inhibits BMP2-induced differentiation into the osteoblast lineage (8Young D. Pratrap J.

Stein J. Stein G. Montecino M. van Wijnen A. Javed A. Gutierrez S. Steroids. 2001; 66: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Osteoblast-specific transcription of the OC gene is controlled by modularly organized basal and hormone-responsive elements located within two DNase I-hypersensitive sites (distal site −605 to −400 and proximal site −170 to −70; see Fig. 1) that are present only in osteoblastic cells expressing this gene (10Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5093-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, chromatin remodeling of the OC gene promoter accompanies transcriptional activity during osteoblast differentiation. Bone-specific expression of the OC gene is principally regulated by the Runx2 transcription factor (11Banerjee C. McCabe L. Choi J. Hiebert S. Stein J. Stein G. Lian J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 12Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G.

The rat OC gene promoter contains three recognition sites for Runx2 interaction (see Fig. 1), site A (−600 to −595), site B (−435 to −430), and site C (−138 to −130). Mutation of all three Runx2 sites results in altered chromatin structure reflected by loss of the DNase I-hypersensitive sites and by inhibition of OC promoter transcriptional activity (13Gutierrez S.

Another key regulatory element that controls OC gene expression is recognized by the 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D3) receptor (VDR) complex upon ligand activation. This vitamin D3-responsive element (VDRE) is located in the distal region of the rat OC promoter (−465 to −437; see Fig. 1) and functions as an enhancer to increase OC transcription (9Lian J. Stein J. Stein G. Montecino M. van Wijnen A. Javed A. Gutierrez S. Steroids. 2001; 66: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Runx2 interacts with the VDR within the context of the OC promoter, and together these factors up-regulate OC gene expression in vitamin D3-treated osteoblastic cells (15Paredes R. Arriagada G. Cruzat F. Villagra A. Olate J. Zaidi K. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8847-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, Runx2 recruits chromatin-remodeling complexes with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (p300-P/CAF), which enhance both basal and vitamin D3-stimulated OC promoter activity (16Sierra J. Villagra A. Paredes R. Cruzat F. Gutierrez S. Javed A. Arriagada G. Olate J. Imschenetzky M. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3339-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is also a principal transactivator of the OC gene that binds within the proximal promoter (−106 to −99; see Fig. 1) and synergizes with Runx2 to enhance basal and tissue-specific OC gene transcription (17Gutierrez S. Javed A. Tennant D. van Rees M. Montecino M. Stein G. Stein J. Lian J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1316-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ interacts with chromatin-remodeling complexes such as those including histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (p300-p/CAF) or ATP-dependent activities (SWI/SNF) (18Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama A. Shimizu K. Ohki M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2994-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Hence, C/EBPβ has been proposed to recruit these chromatin-remodeling complexes to tissue-specific gene promoters, leading to transcriptional activation during cell differentiation. Because there is a tight relationship between chromatin remodeling at the rat OC gene promoter and transcriptional activity of this gene, it is necessary to address the molecular mechanisms responsible for these cellular events. Here, we have determined that SWI/SNF activity is required for the chromatin remodeling that accompanies transcription of the OC gene in osteoblastic cells. We find that the SWI/SNF complex is associated with the OC promoter in osteoblastic cells expressing OC and that in the presence of inactive SWI/SNF, the OC gene is neither remodeled nor transcribed. Interestingly, the inhibition in OC transcription is associated with a drastic reduction in the level of RNA polymerase II bound to the proximal promoter. In addition, we determined that SWI/SNF is recruited to the proximal OC promoter region by the transcription factor C/EBPβ and, once bound to this region of the promoter, interacts also with the bone-specific transcription factor Runx2. Thus, our results indicate that the activity of the SWI/SNF complex at the proximal OC promoter is a requirement for both formation of the proximal nuclease-hypersensitive site and the transcriptional activation of this gene in differentiated osteoblastic cells. Expression Constructs—Luciferase reporter constructs driven by the wild type full-length (1.1 kb, pOC-Luc) or deleted forms (208 bp, p208OC-Luc) of the rat OC gene promoter were described previously (16Sierra J.

The total amount of exogenous DNA was maintained at 5 μg/well with salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen). The pCMVβ plasmid was included as internal control for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested at 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) and β-galactosidase (BD Biosciences) activities in a luminometer.FIGURE 9BRG1-dependent up-regulation of the OC promoter activity requires the C/EBP element in the proximal OC promoter region.

Selected cell lines were evaluated for expression of the tetracycline-VP16 regulator by transiently transfecting the plasmid pUHC13.3, which encodes the luciferase reporter gene under the control of a promoter containing tetracycline operator sites (22Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). A clone expressing high levels of luciferase activity in the absence but not in the presence of tetracycline was chosen for further studies. These cells were then stably transfected with 5 μg of the pTSCeBRG1K-R plasmid encoding an ATPase-defective BRG1 (5De la Serna I. Carlson K. Hill D. Guido C. Stephenson R. Sif S. Kingston R.

Once generated, the ROSBRG1TA cell lines were maintained in 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 100 μg/ml Geneticin, and 10 μg/ml tetracycline. All selected cell lines were evaluated for their ability to express FLAG-tagged mutant BRG1 (ROSBRG1TA) proteins by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Expression of the endogenous genes osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, VDR, Runx2, and β-actin (and others not shown) was determined by reverse transcription-PCR using specific primers. Immunoprecipitations—Nuclear extracts from wild type ROS17/2.8 or ROSBRG1TA cell lines cultured with or without tetracycline and in the presence or absence of 10−8 m vitamin D3 for 4 h were prepared by the Dignam method (23Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described before (16Sierra J. Villagra A. Paredes R. Cruzat F. Gutierrez S. Javed A. Arriagada G. Olate J. Imschenetzky M. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Mol. Cell.

C/EBPβ was immunoprecipitated with an antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blot using specific antibodies. Anti-BAF170, -C/EBPβ, and -Runx2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-BAF180 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Weidong Wang. Anti-BAF57 antibodies were generously donated by Dr. Belandia Borja. Anti-BRG1, anti-BRM, and anti-INI1 antibodies were described previously (5De la Serna I. Carlson K. Hill D. Guido C. Stephenson R.

Nuclease-hypersensitive Analyses—Restriction endonuclease accessibility analyses were performed as described before (10Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated from wild type ROS17/2.8 cells and from the ROSBRG1TA cell line incubated with the restriction endonucleases in the specific buffer conditions provided by the supplier (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the genomic DNA was purified. After complete cleavage with ApaI or BamHI, the samples were electrophoresed in 1.2 or 2% (w/v) agarose gels, blotted, and hybridized with probes shown in Fig. 7A, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 7. The intensities of the bands were determined by using a molecular imager System (BIO-RAD). The percentage of digestion was quantified as the fraction of the signal of the band compared with the total signal of the bands within a given lane on the gel. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Re-ChIP Assays—ChIP studies were performed as described earlier (15Paredes R. Arriagada G. Cruzat F. Villagra A. Olate J. Zaidi K. van Wijnen A. Lian J.

All of the steps were performed at 4 °C. ROS17/2.8 cell cultures (100-mm diameter plates) were incubated for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde and gentle agitation. The cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 0.125 m glycine for 5 min. The cells were then washed with 10 ml of PBS, scraped off in the same volume of PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The cell extract was collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 3.0 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate acid, 0.1% SDS, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors), and incubated for 10 min on ice. To reduce the length of the chromatin fragments to ∼500 bp or smaller (confirmed by electrophoretic analysis and PCR), the extract was sonicated with a Misonix sonicator (model 3000), using 10 15-s pulses at 30% power. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C. An aliquot was used for A260 measurements. Cross-linked extracts (10 A260 units) were resuspended in sonication buffer to a final volume of 500 μl. The samples were precleared by incubation with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads preblocked with bovine serum albumin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 15 min at 4 °C with agitation. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and immunoprecipitated with either an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), an anti-VDR monoclonal antibody (Merck), anti-RXRα polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-C/EBPβ polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-YY1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Runx2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RNA polymerase II antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TFIIB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-BRG1 polyclonal antibody (5De la Serna I.

The immunocomplexes were recovered with the addition of 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads and subsequent incubation for 1 h at 4°C with agitation. The complexes were washed twice with sonication buffer, twice with sonication buffer plus 500 mm NaCl, twice with LiCl buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm LiCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% deoxycholic acid), and twice with dialysis buffer (2 mm EDTA and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), with the solution incubated at each washing for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein-DNA complexes were then eluted by incubation with 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3 and 1% SDS) for 15 min at 65 °C. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and incubated with 10 μg of RNase A/ml for 1 h at 42 C. Then NaCl was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 200 mm and incubated at 65 °C to reverse the cross-linking. The proteins were then digested with 200 μg/ml of proteinase K for 2 h at 50 °C. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation using tRNA (5 μg/ml) as a precipitation carrier. The PCR conditions and primers used to evaluate the OC proximal and distal promoter regions (see Fig. 1) were reported previously (15Paredes R. Arriagada G. Cruzat F. Villagra A. Olate J.

To amplify the upstream OC promoter sequence, the following primers were used: forward, 5′-GCTCTACAGGGTAAGGGAAT-3′; reverse, 5-GTCCCAACATCTCCTAGACA-3′. The oligonucleotide used as a reverse primer in the amplification of the p208OC-Luc constructs was 5′-CGTATCTCTTCATAGCCTTA-3′. To amplify a histone H4 gene promoter sequence (see supplemental data), we used the following primers: forward, 5′-GATAGACAGCAGAGCACAAAGAAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CCAGGCAAGAGCTTATATTTCCT-3′. The re-ChIP assays were performed as described earlier (15Paredes R. Arriagada G. Cruzat F. Villagra A. Olate J. Zaidi K. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8847-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated complexes obtained by ChIP were eluted by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in 25 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 20 times with sonication buffer and subjected to the ChIP procedure. BRG1-containing SWI/SNF Complexes Stimulate Basal and Vitamin D3-enhanced Osteocalcin Promoter Activity—Chromatin remodeling accompanies basal tissue-specific and vitamin D3-enhanced transcription of the OC gene in osteoblastic cells (10Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5093-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SWI/SNF complexes have been shown to remodel chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner, therefore contributing to tissue-specific and steroid hormone-dependent regulation of transcription (2Narlikar G. Fan H.-Y. Kingston R. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 3Peterson C. Workman J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To determine whether SWI/SNF activity contributes to OC gene transcription, we overexpressed BRG1, a catalytic subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF complexes, and measured the effect on the activity of a full-length (1.1 kb) OC promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct in the osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cell line. Similar to terminally differentiated primary diploid osteoblasts, ROS17/2.8 cells express high levels of OC and respond to vitamin D3 with a 3–5-fold increase in OC gene transcription (10Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5093-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Majeska R. Rodan S. Rodan G. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, forced expression of BRG1 results in a significant increase in both basal and vitamin D3-enhanced OC promoter activity (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). This result suggests that BRG1-containing complexes may be functionally coupled to both the basal transcriptional machinery and the liganded VDR complex that interact with the OC promoter. The elevated intracellular levels of BRG1 protein following the transient overexpression in ROS17/2.8 cells were confirmed by Western blot analyses using antibodies that recognize the HA epitope present in this protein (Fig. 2B). Previous reports indicated that whereas transient overexpression of wild type BRG1 can increase activity of some reporter genes, expression of BRG1 mutated in the ATP-binding domain does not, since it forms inactive SWI/SNF complexes (20Khavari P. Peterson C. Tamkun J. Crabtree G. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 25Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). To show that the effect of BRG1 on the OC promoter requires its ATPase activity and therefore formation of active SWI/SNF complexes, we transiently co-expressed the BRG1K798R mutant protein (Fig. 2B), which is unable to bind ATP (20Khavari P. Peterson C. Tamkun J. Crabtree G. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and determined its effect on OC promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2, BRG1K798R functions as a dominant negative mutant, by both inhibiting OC promoter activity and preventing BRG1-dependent enhancement of this promoter (Fig. 2, lanes 5–10). To determine whether SWI/SNF complexes interact with the OC gene promoter in ROS17/2.8 osteoblastic cells, we carried out ChIP assays, using antibodies against SWI/SNF components and specific transcriptional regulators of the OC gene. We find that BRG1, INI1, and BAF57 (all key SWI/SNF components) bind strongly to the proximal (Fig. 3, A and B) but only weakly to the distal (Fig. 3, E and F) OC promoter regions. Binding of BRG1, INI1, or BAF57 was not affected by treatment of the cells with vitamin D3 (4 h), suggesting that the interaction of SWI/SNF complexes is independent of the liganded VDR/RXR heterodimer.

https://openalex.org/W2134976496,"Mitochondrial (mt) neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive disease associated with depletion, deletions, and point mutations of mtDNA. Patients lack a functional thymidine phosphorylase and their plasma contains high concentrations of thymidine and deoxyuridine; elevation of the corresponding triphosphates probably impairs normal mtDNA replication and repair. To study metabolic events leading to MNGIE we used as model systems skin and lung fibroblasts cultured in the presence of thymidine and/or deoxyuridine at concentrations close to those in the plasma of the patients, a more than 100-fold excess relative to controls. The two deoxynucleosides increased the mt and cytosolic dTTP pools of skin fibroblasts almost 2-fold in cycling cells and 8-fold in quiescent cells. During up to a two-month incubation of quiescent fibroblasts with thymidine (but not with deoxyuridine), mtDNA decreased to approximately 50% without showing deletions or point mutations. When we removed thymidine, but maintained the quiescent state, mtDNA recovered rapidly. With thymidine in the medium, the dTTP pool of quiescent cells turned over rapidly at a rate depending on the concentration of thymidine, due to increased degradation and resynthesis of dTMP in a substrate (=futile) cycle between thymidine kinase and 5'-deoxyribonucleotidase. The cycle limited the expansion of the dTTP pool at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. We propose that the substrate cycle represents a regulatory mechanism to protect cells from harmful increases of dTTP. Thus MNGIE patients may increase their consumption of ATP to counteract an unlimited expansion of the dTTP pool caused by circulating thymidine."

The two toxins share a high degree of sequence similarity; however, agglutinin-I is weaker in its activity. We compared the kinetics of protein synthesis inhibition by abrin and agglutinin-I in two different cell lines and found that ∼200-2000-fold higher concentration of agglutinin-I is needed for the same degree of inhibition. Like abrin, agglutinin-I also induced apoptosis in the cells by triggering the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, although at higher concentrations as compared with abrin. The reason for the decreased toxicity of agglutinin-I became apparent on the analysis of the crystal structure of agglutinin-I obtained by us in comparison with that of the reported structure of abrin. The overall protein folding of agglutinin-I is similar to that of abrin-a with a single disulfide bond holding the toxic A subunit and the lectin-like B-subunit together, constituting a heterodimer. However, there are significant differences in the secondary structural elements, mostly in the A chain. The substitution of Asn-200 in abrin-a with Pro-199 in agglutinin-I seems to be a major cause for the decreased toxicity of agglutinin-I. This perhaps is not a consequence of any kink formation by a proline residue in the helical segment, as reported by others earlier, but due to fewer interactions that proline can possibly have with the bound substrate.

Type I RIPs are single polypeptide proteins consisting of only the toxic A subunit with a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa, e.g. momordin (6Husain J. Tickle I.J. Wood S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and gelonin (7Hosur M.V. Nair B. Satyamurthy P. Misquith S. Surolia A. Kannan K.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 368-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Type II RIPs are two polypeptide proteins with the toxic A subunit and a lectin-like B subunit, e.g. abrin (8Tahirov T.H. Lu T.H. Liaw Y.C. Chen Y.L. Lin J.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 354-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and ricin (9Rutenber E. Katzin B.J. Ernst S. Collins E.J. Mlsna D. Ready M.P. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The latter bind to the cell-surface receptors containing terminal galactose through the B subunit, enter the cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis (10Sandvig K. van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5943-5950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the retrograde pathway (11Day P.J. Owens S.R. Wesche J. Olsnes S. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7202-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The reduction of the A-B intersubunit disulfide bond essential for the cytotoxicity takes place in the ER followed by translocation of the A chain to the cytosol. In addition to inhibition of protein synthesis, RIPs are also capable of inducing apoptosis (12Bolognesi A. Tazzari P.L. Olivieri F. Polito L. Falini B. Stirpe F. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The seeds of the subtropical leguminous climber Abrus precatorius contain the potent toxic lectin abrin and the relatively less toxic Abrus agglutinins (13Hegde R. Maiti T.K. Podder S.K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Abrin and agglutinin-I (APA-I) consist of a toxic subunit, the A chain of 30 kDa and the galactose-binding B subunit of 31 kDa (14Lin J.Y. Lee T.C. Hu S.T. Tung T.C. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A single disulfide bond covalently links the two chains. In our earlier studies we have demonstrated that apart from inhibiting protein synthesis abrin also triggers apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway of cell death (15Narayanan S. Surolia A. Karande A.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In spite of ∼70% overall sequence identity seen between abrin and APA-I, the striking differences in the toxicity exhibited by the toxin abrin and APA-I on different cells urged us to look at the structure-function relationship of these proteins. Studies were therefore initiated to compare the activities of abrin and APA-I with respect to the kinetics of protein synthesis inhibition and apoptosis. Data obtained showed that APA-I is manyfold less toxic than abrin on the cell lines tested. Apoptosis induced by APA-I follows the mitochondrial pathway of cell death like abrin. The three-dimensional structures of various type II RIPs have been reported, e.g. abrin (8Tahirov T.H. Lu T.H. Liaw Y.C. Chen Y.L. Lin J.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 354-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), ricin (9Rutenber E. Katzin B.J. Ernst S. Collins E.J. Mlsna D. Ready M.P. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), mistletoe lectin (16Niwa H. Tonevitsky A.G. Agapov I. Saward S. Pfuller U. Palmer R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2739-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), ebulin (17Pascal J.M. Day P.J. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Robertus J.D. Iglesias R. Perez Y. Ferreras J.M. Citores L. Girbes T.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2295-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The complete amino acid sequence of APA-I has been determined (19Liu C.-L. Tsai C.-C. Lin S.-C. Wang L.-I. Hsu C.-I. Hwang M.-J. Lin J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1897-1901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Crystals of Abrus agglutinin were obtained almost 30 years ago, and attempts to solve the crystal structure of APA-I were made 5 years ago by other groups (20Panneerselvam K. Lin S.-C. Liu C.-L. Liaw Y.-C. Lin J.-Y. Lu T.-H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 898-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21Wei C.H. Koh C. Pfuderer P. Einstein J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4796-4801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the three-dimensional structure of APA-I. Abrin was chosen as a starting model for molecular replacement structure solution in view of the sequence similarity between APA-I and abrin. The structural model of APA-I was refined using a data set at 3.5 Å resolution collected at room temperature using a single crystal. The three-dimensional model thus obtained has provided a structural basis for understanding the decreased toxicity of APA-I in relation to abrin. The proteins were purified from the seeds of A. precatorius as described previously (13Hegde R. Maiti T.K. Podder S.K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The seed kernels were soaked in 5% acetic acid overnight and homogenized. The crude extract was subjected to 30% ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the supernatant was subsequently subjected to 90% ammonium sulfate precipitation. Proteins precipitated were dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), and dialyzed extensively against the same. The dialysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto lactamyl-Sepharose affinity column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm PBS. The bound proteins were then eluted with 0.4 m lactose. The fractions containing abrin and APA-I were pooled separately and loaded onto Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm PBS. The fractions corresponding to peak I (∼120 kDa) and peak II (∼60 kDa) were pooled, dialyzed extensively against water, and lyophilized. The peak corresponding to APA-I was subjected to DEAE ion-exchange chromatography to exclude contamination by abrin, if any. Purified proteins were analyzed on 7.5% native gel. As reported earlier, the proteins Abrin and APA-I elute with 0.4 m lactose, and hence the lactose eluate has been used as a standard for checking the mobility of Abrin and APA-I on the native gel. JR4, J16 Bcl2 (overexpresses Bcl2), and A3 I9.2 (caspase 8 mutant) clones of Jurkat were cultured in RPMI 1640, and MCF-7, the human breast cancer cell line, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and both media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified air/CO2 (19:1) atmosphere. Suspension Cultures (Jurkat Cell Lines)—Cells (1 × 106/ml) were cultured in the presence or absence of different concentrations of abrin or APA-I in 200 μl of leucine-free RPMI 1640 medium. After the indicated time, 1 μCi of [3H]leucine was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (22Sharma S. Podder S.K. Karande A.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; : 133-141Google Scholar). The total protein was precipitated with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid after addition of bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein (100 μg), and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was then washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized in 20 μl of 2 m NaOH, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). Adherent Cultures (MCF-7)—Cells (0.2 × 106/well) were cultured at 37 °C in the presence or the absence of different concentrations of the toxins in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After the treatment period the cells were kept under leucine starvation for 2 h after which 1 μCi of [3H]leucine was added and incubated for 1 h. The total cell protein was precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed twice with 20% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in 200 μl of 0.1 n NaOH in 1% SDS. The incorporated radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. The conjugates abrin-FITC and APA-I-FITC were prepared as described elsewhere (23Talian J.C. Olmsted J.B. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold PBS, and 0.5 × 106 cells were incubated with different concentrations of the FITC conjugates on ice for 45 min. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, and bound fluorescence was analyzed by a fluorescence-activated flow cytometric analysis (FACScan, BD Biosciences). Briefly, Jurkat cells were cultured in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of abrin or APA-I. At different time intervals, and the cells were harvested and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. After draining the supernatant completely, the pellet was resuspended in 3 μl of dye mixture of acridine orange and ethidium bromide (100 μg/ml each in PBS) (24McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 172-173Google Scholar). The cells were observed under fluorescence microscope (Leica) using a blue filter. As described elsewhere (25Gong J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), Jurkat cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with 10 ng/ml (0.16 nm) of abrin in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. At the end of each time interval as indicated, the cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm PBS, and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 min at -20 °C. The cells were pelleted and washed once with PBS and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), staining solution containing 100 μg/ml RNase A, 1% Triton X-100, and 40 mm sodium citrate for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were then analyzed by FACScan analysis. Similar assay was carried out using the caspase 8 mutant Jurkat cell line A3I9.2. As described earlier (25Gong J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), cells (1 × 106/ml) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the presence of abrin or APA-I. At various time intervals, cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g at room temperature for 5 min, suspended in 100 μl of 50 mm PBS, and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 60 min. After removing ethanol completely, the cells were resuspended in 0.1 m citrate phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and incubated at room temperature for 60 min with occasional mixing. To the cell pellet 3 μl of 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and 1 μlof RNase A (10 mg/ml stock) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Then 1 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml stock) was added, and the incubation was continued for 3 h at 37°C. Ten μl of DNA loading dye (orange G) was added to the mixture and loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel and electrophoresed at 30 V for 12 h. The gel was then observed under a UV trans-illuminator. Initial crystallization conditions were screened by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using commercial crystallization screening kits (Crystal Screen 1 and Crystal Screen 2) from Hampton Research. A protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, a reservoir volume of 400 μl, and a drop size of 6 μl (1:1 ratio of protein and reservoir solution) were used for initial screening. Truncated bipyramidal crystals of size 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm, suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis, appeared in 2-3 weeks from the crystallization condition No. 36 from Crystal Screen 1 (8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). Crystals were damaged upon cryo-cooling despite trials with a variety of cryo-protectants. Hence, the x-ray diffraction data were collected at ambient temperature. The data were collected on X9A using synchrotron radiation source at beam line of National Synchrotron Light Source, at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The wavelength of incident radiation was 0.978 Å. With an oscillation range of 1° for each image, a total range of 45° was covered. The total exposure time was 6 s in order to avoid radiation damage as the data were collected at room temperature. Auto-indexing routines gave solutions consistent with tetragonal space group P42212, which enabled unit cell dimensions to be refined to a = b = 141.122 Å, c = 105.253 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°. The space group was subsequently confirmed by the successful structure solution and refinement. The value of Matthew's coefficient (Vm) (26Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar) was found to be 4.65 A3 Da-1, which is consistent with the presence of one dimer in the crystal asymmetric unit. The estimated solvent content is 73.3%. Molecular Replacement—Molecular replacement for APA-I was performed using the coordinates of abrin-a from the Protein Data Bank at Brookhaven National Laboratory (access code 1ABR) and employing the molecular replacement program AmoRe (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The rotation and translation searches were carried out assuming that the APA-I molecule contains two independent modules as follows: one represented by the abrin-a A chain and the other by abrin-a B chain. The best solution corresponding to a high correlation coefficient of 65.1% and an R factor of 36.8% was used to generate the two chains of APA-I. An x-ray diffraction data shell from 15 to 4 Å was used for the calculation of cross-rotation function. The disulfide bond linking A and B chains could be clearly located in the electron density maps, in the subsequent steps of refinement, and model building. Crystallographic Refinement and Model Building—The structure determined using 3.5 Å data were refined with CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Kunstleve G.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 59: 905-925Crossref Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Iterations of rigid body refinement, positional refinement, and simulated annealing were alternated with model building using COOT (29Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The refinement of the model was completed using REFMAC5 (30Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). This step included the refinement of temperature factor using TLS (31Winn M.D. Murshdov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The APA-I molecule was divided into four TLS groups. Groups I and II consist of residues 1-165 and 166-248 of chain A and groups III and IV consist of residues 7-142 and 143-267 of chain B. Ten cycles of TLS refinement were carried out. Composite omit maps (32Bhat T.N. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 279-281Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 33Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar) were calculated for the entire macromolecule under study, and the model was built into the omit density. In the final refinement the R factor and Rfree converged to 19.4 and 25.4%, respectively. The final model was then subjected to PROCHECK (34Lakowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) analysis. Only one non-glycine residue (Asn-140(B)) was present in the disallowed region. The PROCHECK parameters are given in Table 1. The shape complementary index was calculated using the software from the CCP4 (30Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) suite of programs. All the figures were generated using PyMOL molecular graphics package (35DeLano W. pymol. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar).TABLE 1Data collection, refinement statistics, and the model parametersData collectionResolution limit (Å)30-3.5 (3.7-3.5)aParentheses show high resolution shellTotal reflections13,311Unique reflections11,360Completeness, %95.7 (96.8)Multiplicity3.8 (3.8)I/σ(I)13.1 (2.3)Rmerge, %9.5 (53.9)Mosaicity0.25°Number of molecules in A.

The 7.5% native gel profile of purified proteins is shown in Fig. 1B. APA-I eluted in the void volume of the column suggesting that it is a tetramer (∼120 kDa). The mobility of APA-I is slower on the native gel as compared with that of abrin, the molecular mass which is ∼62 kDa. Inhibition of Protein Synthesis by Abrus Toxins—To determine the cytotoxicity of APA-I in comparison to abrin, Jurkat and MCF-7 cells were cultured with varying concentrations of the toxins for varying periods of time. The amount of protein synthesized was assessed by the incorporation of [3H]leucine in the cells and expressed as the percentage of [3H]leucine incorporated in the treated cells as compared with the untreated cells. Fig. 2 shows the kinetics of inhibition of protein synthesis. Abrin inhibited protein synthesis in both cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, as is clearly seen, no toxicity was seen in the MCF-7 cells at 1 ng/ml even up to 4 h of incubation, indicating that the amount of protein is directly related to the kinetics of inhibition (Fig. 2A). APA-I also inhibited protein synthesis in both the cell lines tested, but the concentrations of the protein required was higher than that of abrin (Fig. 2B). Higher amounts of both the toxins showed faster kinetics. Jurkat cells appear to be more sensitive to abrin and APA-I as compared with MCF-7. APA-I Binding Is Comparable with Abrin on Cells—The initial step in the cytotoxicity of toxins is binding to the cell surface. To find out whether the lower activity of APA-I is due to lower extent of binding to cells, binding of APA-I-FITC to Jurkat and MCF-7 cells was compared with that of abrin-FITC. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of the toxin conjugates for 1 h at 4 °C. Data shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the binding of both toxin conjugates is comparable in both cell lines employed. Triggering of Apoptosis by Abrin and APA-I—RIPs have been shown to induce apoptosis in different cell lines (36Shih S.-F. Wu Y.-H. Hung C.-H. Yang H.-Y. Lin J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21870-21877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and studies from our laboratory have shown that Jurkat cells undergo apoptosis when treated with abrin (15Narayanan S. Surolia A. Karande A.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To test whether APA-I is similar to abrin with respect to this activity as well, Jurkat and MCF-7 cells were treated with the toxins, and their DNA was analyzed by FACScan and agarose gel electrophoresis. Fig. 4 shows that like abrin, APA-I also induces apoptosis in both cell lines, although the concentration of APA-I required to trigger apoptosis is more than 10-fold higher as compared with that of abrin. The onset of DNA fragmentation in Jurkat cells by both abrin and APA-I was earlier (6 h) than seen in MCF-7 (48 h). To determine the involvement of caspases in the apoptotic activity of APA-I, the cells were incubated with the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OME)-fluoromethyl ketone before treatment with the toxins and then analyzed for the apoptotic population by FACScan analysis. The inhibitor rescued both the cell lines from apoptosis by abrin and APA-I (Fig. 5). Toxins like diphtheria toxin (37Thorburn J. Frankel A.E. Thorburn A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 9: 861-865Google Scholar) and shiga toxin (38Barnet Foster D. Abul-Milh M. Huesca M. Lingwood C.A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3108-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have been reported to induce apoptosis by activating caspase 8, but our earlier studies (15Narayanan S. Surolia A. Karande A.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have shown that abrin-induced apoptosis does not involve the death receptor pathway. Cross-linking of cell-surface receptors has been shown to be essential for the manifestation of biological responses by lectins (39Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). APA-I is a multivalent lectin, and hence there exists a possibility that death receptors may be cross-linked and thereby get activated. To understand the apoptotic pathway initiated by APA-I, comparative studies were carried on Jurkat A3I9.2 cells that lack the expression of caspase 8. These cells were treated with APA-I and abrin for different time intervals and then analyzed by FACScan (Fig. 6) and nuclear staining (Fig. 7). It was observed that APA-I-like abrin induces apoptosis in this cell line, and the extent of apoptosis induced is comparable with that of the Jurkat cells suggesting that lectin activity is not linked with the apoptosis induced by APA-I, and therefore APA-I-induced cell death is independent of caspase 8.FIGURE 7Staining apoptotic nuclei with acridine orange and ethidium bromide. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of abrin and APA-I for 12 h. After the indicated time points, cells were pelleted, stained with 3 μl of the dye mixture, and viewed under a fluorescence microscope using blue filter. Arrowheads indicate the apoptotic bodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Abrin induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells via the intrinsic pathway of cell death (15Narayanan S. Surolia A. Karande A.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); hence, we examined whether APA-I also induces apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that blocks the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. When the J16 Bcl-2 clone of Jurkat cells was treated with different concentrations of APA-I, no apoptosis was observed as measured by flow cytometry for DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6) and nuclear staining (Fig. 7). These experiments further confirm that APA-I-induced apoptosis follows the intrinsic pathway of cell death. Overall Structure of APA-I—APA-I structure has been solved by molecular replacement methods using the coordinates of Abrus agglutinin as a search model (Protein Data Bank accession code 1ABR). The crystallographic R/Rfree values for the refined model are 19.4/25.4% for a total of 11,360 unique reflections in the resolution range 30.0-3.5 Å. The summaries of data statistics, refinement statistics, and model parameters are tabulated in Table 1. The complete amino acid sequence of APA-I was determined by Liu et al. (19Liu C.-L. Tsai C.-C. Lin S.-C. Wang L.-I. Hsu C.-I. Hwang M.-J. Lin J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1897-1901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A and B chains of APA-I have 66.9% sequence identity with abrin-a A chain and 80.2% with the abrin-a B chain, respectively. However, the sequence identities with other type II RIPs are considerably lower (40Hegde R. Podder S.K. Karande A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). APA-I shares 37% sequence identity with A chain of ricin and 58% with the B chain. Similarly, the corresponding values with mistletoe lectin are 39 and 54% for A chain and B chain, respectively. Although the sequence identities between respective chains of abrin and APA-I are high, the variations in their sequences are of great biological significance in view of the differences in their toxicity. Hence, determination of the three-dimensional structure becomes crucial for analyzing the major dissimilarities between abrin and agglutinin, which could help in exploring the biological potential of APA-I. The overall folding of APA-I is similar to that of abrin. However, there exist some major biologically important substitutions that account for the less toxic nature of APA-I. The root square mean deviation calculated only for structurally related Cα atoms of abrin-a and APA-I is 1.14 Å. It is higher than that calculated separately for A chains and B chains, 0.78 and 0.57 Å respectively. The general architecture of APA-I is similar to that of other type II RIPs that include ricin, abrin, and mistletoe lectin. Fig. 8 sh"
https://openalex.org/W2078731163,"The E and G subunits of the yeast V-ATPase are believed to be part of the peripheral or stator stalk(s) responsible for physically and functionally linking the peripheral V1 sector, responsible for ATP hydrolysis, to the membrane V0 sector, containing the proton pore. The E and G subunits interact tightly and specifically, both on a far Western blot of yeast vacuolar proteins and in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Amino acids 13-79 of the E subunit are critical for the E-G two-hybrid interaction. Different tagged versions of the G subunit were expressed in a diploid cell, and affinity purification of cytosolic V1 sectors via a FLAG-tagged G subunit resulted in copurification of a Myc-tagged G subunit, implying more than one G subunit was present in each V1 complex. Similarly, hemagglutinin-tagged E subunit was able to affinity-purify V1 sectors containing an untagged version of the E subunit from heterozygous diploid cells, suggesting that more than one E subunit is present. Overexpression of the subunit G results in a destabilization of subunit E similar to that seen in the complete absence of subunit G (Tomashek, J. J., Graham, L. A., Hutchins, M. U., Stevens, T. H., and Klionsky, D. J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26787-26793). These results are consistent with recent models showing at least two peripheral stalks connecting the V1 and V0 sectors of the V-ATPase and would allow both stalks to be based on an EG dimer. The E and G subunits of the yeast V-ATPase are believed to be part of the peripheral or stator stalk(s) responsible for physically and functionally linking the peripheral V1 sector, responsible for ATP hydrolysis, to the membrane V0 sector, containing the proton pore. The E and G subunits interact tightly and specifically, both on a far Western blot of yeast vacuolar proteins and in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Amino acids 13-79 of the E subunit are critical for the E-G two-hybrid interaction. Different tagged versions of the G subunit were expressed in a diploid cell, and affinity purification of cytosolic V1 sectors via a FLAG-tagged G subunit resulted in copurification of a Myc-tagged G subunit, implying more than one G subunit was present in each V1 complex. Similarly, hemagglutinin-tagged E subunit was able to affinity-purify V1 sectors containing an untagged version of the E subunit from heterozygous diploid cells, suggesting that more than one E subunit is present. Overexpression of the subunit G results in a destabilization of subunit E similar to that seen in the complete absence of subunit G (Tomashek, J. J., Graham, L. A., Hutchins, M. U., Stevens, T. H., and Klionsky, D. J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26787-26793). These results are consistent with recent models showing at least two peripheral stalks connecting the V1 and V0 sectors of the V-ATPase and would allow both stalks to be based on an EG dimer. V-ATPases are ubiquitous proton pumps involved in acidification of organelles such as lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus in all eukaryotic cells (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic V-ATPpases are structurally very conserved; subunit compositions are highly similar between evolutionarily distant eukaryotes, and subunit sequences are as much as 80% identical between humans and yeast (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 2Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition, low resolution electron microscopy structures show a high level of similarity (3Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The yeast V-ATPase shares many features with other V-ATPases and has emerged as an excellent model for these enzymes (4Kane P.M. Smardon A.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The yeast V-ATPase is composed of a peripheral complex, V1, containing eight subunits designated A-H, and a membrane complex, V0, containing six subunits designated a, c, c′, c″, d, and e (4Kane P.M. Smardon A.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ATP-driven proton transport requires association of the V1 sector, which contains the ATP hydrolytic sites, and the V0 sector, which contains the proton pore, but in vivo the inactive V1 and V0 subcomplexes exist in dynamic equilibrium with the fully assembled enzyme (5Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Earley F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 6Kane P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). V-ATPases share an evolutionary history with F-type ATP synthases and archaebacterial ATP synthases and proton pumps (7Muller V. Gruber G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 474-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 8Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although direct sequence similarity is limited primarily to the ATP binding catalytic and regulatory subunits, V-ATPases utilize a rotary mechanism like that of F-ATPases to couple ATP hydrolysis to proton transport (9Hirata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Sun-Wada G.H. Okajima T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23714-23719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10Yokoyama K. Nakano M. Imamura H. Yoshida M. Tamakoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24255-24258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In rotational catalysis of ATP-driven proton pumping by F1F0, the conformational changes at the catalytic sites are transmitted to a ring of proteolipid subunits by rotation of a central stalk (11Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Rotation of the proteolipid subunits is believed to transiently create a proton transport pathway between the proteolipid subunits and another membrane protein, the a subunit of the F0 sector (12Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One structural requirement of rotational catalysis in F1F0 is the presence of a “stator,” a complex of proteins that physically ties the a subunit to the head group containing the catalytic and regulatory subunits to allow productive relative rotation of the rotor subunits (13Dunn S.D. McLachlin D.T. Revington M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The stator of the Escherichia coli F1F0 is the best studied and consists of a dimer of integral membrane b subunits along with the F1 δ subunit, which together generate a stalk structure (designated the peripheral or stator stalk) that extends along the outside of the F1F0 molecule from the membrane to the top of F1 (13Dunn S.D. McLachlin D.T. Revington M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The subunit-subunit interactions that allow the stator to resist rotation include interactions between the δ and α subunit (14Carbajo R.J. Kellas F.A. Runswick M.J. Montgomery M.G. Walker J.E. Neuhaus D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 824-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Wilkens S. Borchardt D. Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11786-11794Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and interactions between the b dimer and one of the three sets of catalytic and regulatory subunits (16Motz C.

Wise J.G. Vogel P.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3856-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The interaction data indicate that the stator provides the stability essential for rotational catalysis through a combination of relatively strong interactions (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Nadanaciva S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11253-11258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and image analysis of V-ATPases has suggested the presence of at least one, or possibly more, peripheral stalks that could provide the stator function, but definitive assignment of specific subunits to these stalks has been rather difficult (3Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Wilkens S. Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Only the G subunit shows any homology to the stalk subunits of F1F0, and even this homology to subunit b is rather limited (22Supekova L. Sbia M. Supek F. Ma Y. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent evidence from a number of laboratories has placed subunits E, C, and B in proximity with subunit G (20Venzke D. Domgall I. Kocher T. Fethiere J. Fischer S. Bottcher B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Fethiere J. Venzke D. Madden D.R. Bottcher B.

Very recently, electron microscopy and image reconstruction of the Neurospora crassa V-ATPase have suggested that there might be two structurally distinct links, or potentially two stators, providing peripheral connections between V1 and V0. The authors of this work suggested that these two links contain subunits H and a and subunits E, G, and C, respectively (20Venzke D. Domgall I. Kocher T. Fethiere J. Fischer S. Bottcher B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this work, we focus on the interaction between subunits E and G of the yeast V-ATPase and the potential role of these subunits in stator structure and function. We provide evidence supporting a tight interaction between subunits E and G that requires the N-terminal third of subunit E, and we also show that there are more than one G and E subunit in each V1 complex. Materials—Anti-HA 2The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein. antibody, anti-Myc antibody, and anti-FLAG antibody were purchased from Covance, Roche Applied Science, and Sigma, respectively. Tran35S-label and [35S]methionine were purchased from MP Biomedicals, Inc. G418, anti-HA agarose, anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads, and FLAG peptide were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs, and LA-Taq (Panvera) was used for PCR. Plasmid and Strain Construction—Construction of N-terminally Myc- and FLAG-tagged VMA10 plasmids was described previously (30Charsky C.M. Schumann N.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37232-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Zhang Z. Charsky C. Kane P.M. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In order to allow for selection of both plasmids simultaneously in a diploid cell, the Myc-tagged VMA10 gene was transferred to the low copy plasmid pRS316 [CEN6, URA3] and transformed into SF838-5Aα vma10Δ::kanMX. FLAG-tagged VMA10 in plasmid pRS315 [CEN6, LEU2] was transformed into SF838-5Aa vma10Δ::kanMX, and the two strains were mated to obtain the diploid strain containing both Myc-tagged and FLAG-tagged G subunits. Overexpression of VMA10 was achieved by cloning the N-terminally Myc-tagged VMA10 gene into plasmid YEp352 [2μ, LEU2] (32Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the E subunit was tagged with 3HA (three copies of the hemagglutinin epitope) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) by integrating the tag along with the kanMX selectable marker at the 3′ end of the VMA4 gene as described by Longtine et al. (33Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Briefly, cassettes containing the 3HA-kanMX and GFP-kanMX were PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides F2 (5′-CGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′) and R1 (5′-GAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC) as described (33Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar), using plasmids pFA6a-GFP-kanMX or pFA6a-3HA-kanMX (generous gifts from Mark Longtine) as templates. Two ∼200-bp fragments of VMA4 corresponding to a sequence just upstream from the stop codon (amplified with oligonucleotides VMA4-c1, 5′-GGAAAAGGCCCAGCGCGCAC-3′, and VMA4-c2, 5′-TTAATTAACCCGGGGATCCGATCAAAGAACTTTCTTGTCTTGGAAG-3′) and a sequence downstream from the VMA4 stop codon (amplified with oligonucleotides VMA4-c3, 5′-GTTTAAACGAGCTCGAATTCTCGACCAGCAGCTTGTATACCTA-3′, and VMA4-200, 5′-GAACGTACCAGGAGACGCCGATTC) were created by PCR amplification from yeast genomic DNA. These fragments contain sequences overlapping the tag-containing cassettes and were combined with the tag fragments by fusion PCR of all three fragments using oligonucleotides VMA4-c1 and VMA4-200. The fusion products were introduced into yeast strain SF838-5Aα by lithium acetate transformation (34Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected by growth on YEPD (yeast extract, peptone, 2% dextrose) medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. Formation of the correct fusion protein was confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies against both the E subunit and the HA or GFP tags. To test for retention of V-ATPase function in the presence of the tagged E subunits, the strains containing the integrated tags were grown on YEPD buffered to pH 7.5 containing 60 mm CaCl2 (35Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The strain containing the VMA4-3HA construct showed wild-type growth under these conditions, but the strain containing the VMA4-GFP construct did not grow, indicating that V-ATPase function was compromised. Vacuoles isolated from the VMA4-GFP-containing strain had little or no concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity but did contain the VMA4-GFP protein; these vacuoles are used in Fig. 1. To construct a diploid strain containing both VMA4-3HA and the wild-type E subunit, the VMA4-3HA strain was mated to the congenic wild-type strain of the opposite mating type, SF838-5Aa. To construct a diploid strain containing both VMA4-3HA and FLAG-tagged VMA10, the SF838-5Aa vma10Δ::kanMX strain containing the pRS315-FLAG-VMA10 plasmid, described above, was mated to the SF838-5Aα VMA4::3HA-KanMX strain, and diploids were isolated under a dissecting microscope. Far Western Analysis—To create constructs appropriate for expression from the promoter in the in vitro transcription/translation system, the start codons of the VMA4 and VMA10 genes were placed in proximity to the T7 promoter in plasmid pRS316. For VMA4, this was achieved by PCR amplification of VMA4 from genomic DNA with oligonucleotides 5′-CGATACACCATGTCCTCCGC-3′ and 5′-GGTATACAAGCTGCTGGTCG-3′, cloning the PCR fragment into pGEM-T-Easy, and then removing the VMA4 fragment with SacII and SpeI for cloning into the same sites in pRS316. For VMA10, a fragment lacking the intron but retaining the N-terminal Myc tag was obtained by PCR amplification with oligonucleotides 5′-CAAAGCAGAATGGAACAAAAGC and 5′-CCATACTTTCTCCTTTACAACCG-3′ from pAL-TER-myc-VMA10 described by Charsky et al. (30Charsky C.M. Schumann N.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37232-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fragment was introduced into pRS316 as described for VMA4. In vitro transcription and translation were carried out in the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). 1 μg of each plasmid was added to 40 μl of TnT Quick Master mixture containing 2 μl of [35S]methionine, and the transcription/translation reaction was carried out for 1.5 h at 30 °C. The products were visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to confirm production of a protein of the correct size for the subunits. For far Western analysis (36Guichet A. Copeland J.W. Erdelyi M. Hlousek D. Zavorszky P. Ho J. Brown S. Percival-Smith A. Krause H.M. Ephrussi A. Nature. 1997; 385: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the entire 50-μl reaction mixture was combined with 6.5 ml of AC buffer (10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% nonfat dry milk and 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated on ice before adding to the blot. Blots for far Western analysis were prepared by solubilizing vacuolar vesicles containing the indicated amount of protein in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), then separating by SDS-PAGE, and blotting to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in AC buffer containing 2% nonfat dry milk and 1 mm dithiothreitol and at the same time exposed sequentially to decreasing concentrations of guanidine-HCl for 30 min each, starting with 6 m guanidine-HCl and decreasing to 3, 1, and 0.1 m in subsequent 30-min incubations. The blot was then incubated without guanidine-HCl overnight, then incubated with probe, and prepared as described above for 3 h at 4°C. Identical results, but a less intense signal, were obtained when the guanidine denaturation and renaturation steps were omitted. Two-hybrid Analysis—To introduce VMA4 into two-hybrid plasmid, VMA4 was amplified by PCR from wild-type yeast genomic DNA with oligonucleotides VMA4-BamHI (5′-GCGGATCCTCATGTCCTCCGCTATTACTGCTTTG-3′ for introduction of a BamHI site (underlined) just upstream from the ATG (italicized)) and VMA4-3′ (5′-GGTATACAAGCTGCTGGTCG). The PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and then cut with BamHI and SalI for ligation to pAS2 cut with the same enzymes. VMA10 was cloned into pACT2 by similar methods but was amplified with oligonucleotides VMA10NBamHI (5′-GCGGATCCTCATGTCCCAAAAAAACGGAATTGCC) and VMA10-200 (5′-AGTAATCCCCATCGGCGTTTAG-3′). Deletion mutations were introduced into pAS2-VMA4 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (State University of New York Upstate Medical University DNA sequencing core). pAS2-VMA4, or the corresponding VMA4 mutant plasmid, was cotransformed with pACT2-VMA10 into yeast strain PJ69-4a (MATa trp1-901 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ (38James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Cotransformants were selected on supplemented minimal media lacking tryptophan (for pAS2) and leucine (for pACT2). Cotransformed cells were tested for two-hybrid interaction by transfer to supplemented minimal media lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine (38James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the above VMA4- and VMA10-containing plasmids were also cotransformed with the empty pACT2 or pAS-lamin plasmids, respectively. No growth was observed for strains containing the empty plasmids on medium lacking histidine and adenine. Affinity Purification of Yeast V1—Affinity purification of V1 complexes via the FLAG-tagged G subunit was performed as described in Zhang et al. (31Zhang Z. Charsky C. Kane P.M. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Supplemented minimal medium lacking leucine was used to grow cells at all times, and the use of French pressure cell for cell lysis was replaced by microfluidizer processor M-110L (Microfluidics). After ultracentrifugation of the lysate, V1 was salted out by addition of 60% ammonium sulfate. Precipitated protein was redissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, desalted, concentrated in Amicon Centricon Plus-20 filter (molecular weight cutoff of 100,000), and then applied to the anti-FLAG M2 affinity column (Sigma). The affinity-purified protein was eluted from the beads with FLAG peptide (Sigma) and then further purified by gel filtration on a Bio-Silect SEC 250-5 column using the Bio-Rad BioLogic Duo-Flow FPLC system. To purify V1 via the C-terminal 3HA tag on the E subunit, whole cell lysates were prepared from 3 liters of either the haploid strain containing VMA4-3HA as the sole copy of VMA4 or the VMA4-3HA/VMA4 diploid strain. Lysates were prepared as described above. The lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 52,100 rpm for 2 h in a 70 Ti rotor, and the resulting supernatant was concentrated ∼20-25-fold using an Amicon filter. This supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of monoclonal anti-HA-agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C with shaking. After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, bound material was eluted in cracking buffer (8 m urea, 5% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA) by heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Sequential purification of V1 via FLAG-tagged G and then the HA-tagged E subunit was performed by first isolating FLAG-G containing V1 complexes from the soluble fraction of a VMA4-3HA × vma10Δ/ pRS315-VMA10 diploid on a FLAG-M2 affinity column as described above, then eluting with FLAG peptide and immunoprecipitating Vma4-HA tagged complexes from the eluant as described above. Other Biochemical Methods—Yeast whole cell lysates were prepared for Western blotting from yeast cells grown to log phase in selective medium. Protein derived from 1 A600 unit of cells was solubilized in 100 μl of cracking buffer, and 12.5-25 μl of this solution was subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Immunoblots were probed as described by Charsky et al. (30Charsky C.M. Schumann N.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37232-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the E subunit were the generous gift from Dan Klionsky, University of Michigan. Vacuoles were prepared and analyzed as described (39Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase immunoprecipitations under denaturing conditions were performed as described (40Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18470-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interaction of the E and G Subunits—There is substantial genetic and biochemical evidence that the V-ATPase E and G subunits interact, with some of the most convincing evidence coming from recent work with bacterially expressed and purified E and G subunits (26Jones R.P. Durose L.J. Findlay J.B. Harrison M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11924Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 41Fethiere J. Venzke D. Diepholz M. Seybert A. Geerlof A. Gentzel M. Wilm M. Bottcher B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40670-40676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We took two different approaches to further address the interaction between these subunits. First, we expressed each subunit in an in vitro transcription/translation system, labeled the expressed proteins with [35S]methionine, and examined whether they would recognize any partner proteins on a blot of solubilized vacuolar membranes separated by SDS-PAGE (a far Western blot). Fig. 1 shows far Western blots of yeast vacuolar proteins probed with labeled E and G subunits. Both subunits recognized a single band on the far Western blots, despite the fact that the solubilized wild-type vacuolar membranes contain all of the V-ATPase subunits. The labeled E subunit recognized a band at ∼16 kDa and the labeled G subunit recognized a band at ∼27 kDa, the molecular masses of the G and E subunits, respectively. To confirm the identities of the proteins recognized in the two blots, we probed blots of vacuoles derived from the vma2Δ strain, which lack all V1 subunits but contain other vacuolar proteins (42Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and vacuoles containing epitope-tagged versions of the E and G subunits, in which there is a well defined shift in molecular mass of the tagged subunits. As shown in Fig. 1B, the labeled E subunit recognized a slightly larger protein in the vacuoles containing a Myc-tagged G subunit, and the labeled G subunit recognized an ∼50-kDa protein in the vacuoles from a strain with the E subunit tagged at the C terminus with GFP. Both of the proteins recognized are at the molecular mass expected for the tagged subunit. Neither labeled subunit interacted with anything in vacuoles from the vma2Δ strain. These results indicate that the E subunit is recognizing the G subunit on a far Western blot and the G subunit is recognizing the E subunit and support a tight and specific interaction between the two proteins. We also probed the interaction between the E and G subunits in the two-hybrid assay, using a system in which successful interaction between the GAL4 activation and binding domains could be assessed by expression of two different nutritional marker genes. In this system, interaction between two proteins is manifest as growth of the transformed cells on medium lacking histidine and/or adenine, and the growth rate of the cells provides a semi-quantitative measure of the strength of the interaction being measured. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Cells containing VMA10, the gene encoding the G subunit, attached to the GAL4 activation domain (pACT-VMA10) along with VMA4, the gene encoding the E subunit, attached to the GAL4 binding domain (pAS2-VMA4), are able to grow well on medium lacking histidine and adenine (Fig. 2), indicating high level expression of the HIS3 and ADE2 genes placed under control of GAL4-driven promoters. In contrast, neither the pACT-VMA10 nor the pAS2-VMA4 plasmid permitted significant growth when combined with an empty version of the companion plasmid. These results also support the presence of a tight interaction between the E and G subunits. One of the strengths of the two-hybrid method is that it allows rapid assessment of regions required for binding between proteins without requiring that mutant proteins be capable of assembly into a larger complex. The E subunit is highly conserved with an overall sequence identity of 30-35% and sequence similarity of 53-58% when compared with homologs from Drosophila melanogaster (GenBank™ accession number NP_730957.1), human (GenBank™ accession number AAP35792.1), Caenorhabditis elegans (GenBank™ accession number AAK67210.1), Arabidopsis thaliana (GenBank™ accession number NP_187468.1), and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (GenBank™ accession number CAB11186.1). Sequence identities vary somewhat in different regions of the E subunit, and this might suggest regions of interaction. The C-terminal 50 amino acids of Vma4p (amino acids 183-233) are 42-50% identical with the sequences cited above, whereas amino acids 100-183 are only 25-30% identical, and amino acids 13-100 are 35-39% identical. We made constructs of Vma4p lacking these different regions and tested their interaction with Vma10p as described above. Deletion of the C-terminal amino acids, which appear to be the most conserved region, did not affect interaction between Vma4p and Vma10p. Two-hybrid constructs containing only the first 100 amino acids of Vma4p interacted with Vma10p as strongly as the full-length construct, but deletion of either amino acids 13-98 or 13-78 completely prevented the interaction. These data suggest that the N-terminal third of the E subunit is critical for the E-G subunit interaction. Although they still permitted interaction with the G subunit, the two C-terminal deletions of the E subunit did appear to slow the growth of yeast cells, even under the +his, +ade conditions that do not require two-hybrid interactions. A dominant negative effect of overexpression of the N-terminal 83 amino acids of the yeast E subunit has been reported previously (50Lu M. Vergara S. Zhang L. Holliday L.S. Aris J. Gluck S.L. J.

https://openalex.org/W2051146938,"Hyperosmotic exposure of rat hepatocytes induced a rapid oxidative-stress(ROS) response as an upstream signal for proapoptotic CD95 activation. This study shows that hyperosmotic ROS formation involves a rapid ceramide- and protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ)-dependent serine phosphorylation of p47phox and subsequent activation of NADPH oxidase isoforms. Hyperosmotic p47phox phosphorylation and ROS formation were sensitive to inhibition of sphingomyelinases and were strongly blunted after knockdown of acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM) or of p47phox protein. Hyperosmolarity induced a rapid bafilomycin- and 4,4 ′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2 ′-disulfonic acid disodium salt (DIDS)-sensitive acidification of a vesicular compartment, which was accessible to endocytosed fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran and colocalized with ASM, PKCζ, and the NADPH oxidase isoform Nox 2 (gp91phox). Bafilomycin and DIDS prevented the hyperosmolarity-induced increase in ceramide formation, p47phox phosphorylation, and ROS formation. As shown recently (Reinehr, R., Becker, S., Höngen, A., and Häussinger, D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 23977-23987), hyperosmolarity induced a Yes-dependent activation of JNK and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), followed by EGFR-CD95 association, EGFR-catalyzed CD95-tyrosine phosphorylation, and translocation of the EGFR-CD95 complex to the plasma membrane, where formation of the deathinducing signaling complex occurs. These proapoptotic responses were not only sensitive to inhibitors of sphingomyelinase, PKCζ, or NADPH oxidases but also to ASM knockdown, bafilomycin, and DIDS, i.e. maneuvers largely preventing hyperosmolarity-induced endosomal acidification and/or ceramide formation. In hepatocytes from p47phox knock-out mice, hyperosmolarity failed to activate the CD95 system. The data suggest that hyperosmolarity induces endosomal acidification as an important upstream event for CD95 activation through stimulation of ASM-dependent ceramide formation and activation of NADPH oxidase isoforms.

Hyperosmotic CD95 activation involves a complex pathway, including ROS-dependent activation of the Src family kinase Yes, a Yes-dependent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

The mechanisms underlying the hyperosmolarity-induced oxidative stress response remains unclear. One potential candidate for the generation of reactive oxygen species is the NADPH oxidase isoform, which exhibits sequence homology to the classical phagocyte NADPH oxidase gp91phox (Nox 2) (12Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Such isoforms are thought to participate in signal transduction (13Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and these homologs of gp91phox are called Nox and Duox (12Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin.

Duox 1 and 2 reflect high molecular mass gp91phox homologs with an N-terminal peroxidase domain in addition to the C-terminal NADPH oxidase activity. NADPH oxidases are activated by assembly with regulatory proteins such as p47phox, p67phox, and Rac (15Vignais P.V. Cell. Mol.

Although being dispensable for NADPH oxidase activity under cell-free conditions, p47phox is critical for normal NADPH oxidase function, because p47phox acts as an adaptor protein, which facilitates stimulus-induced binding of p67phox to the enzyme complex. In neutrophils, p47phox is activated in response to inflammatory stimuli by multiple phosphorylations, which are thought to trigger intramolecular rearrangements thereby exposing Src homology 3 domains for binding to proline-rich regions of other NADPH oxidase components in order to form the active enzyme complex (19Inanami O.

This study was undertaken in order to investigate the role of NADPH isoforms in hyperosmotic signaling toward CD95 activation. Materials—The materials used were purchased as follows: collagenases from Roche Applied Science; William's E medium, desipramine, AY9944, d-(+)-neopterin, and FITC dextran (average molecular mass 70 kDa) from Sigma; penicillin/streptomycin from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany); fetal calf serum from Invitrogen; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/NUT.

The antibodies used were purchased as follows: rabbit anti-p47phox, rabbit anti-gp91phox (Nox 2), rabbit anti-acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM), mouse anti-PKCζ, rabbit anti-CD95, rabbit anti-FADD, and mouse anti-caspase 8 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rabbit anti-phospho-JNK-1/-2 antibodies from BioSource Int. (Camarillo, CA); monoclonal mouse anti-GAPDH and monoclonal mouse antiannexin II antibodies from Pharmingen; goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany); rabbit anti-Yes, sheep, anti-EGFR, mouse anti-phosphotyrosine, and rabbit anti-p47phox antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); rabbit anti-phospho-Src family Y418 antibodies from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); mouse antiphosphoserine (clone 16B4) from Biomol; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG from BioRad. All other chemicals were from Merck at the highest quality available. Cell Preparation and Culture—Hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of male Wistar rats or 5-6-week-old male wild type or p47phox knock-out mice, both with the C57BL/6 background and fed ad libitum with a standard diet by a collagenase perfusion technique as described previously (23Reinehr R. Graf D. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 839-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). p47phox knock-out mice (24Jackson S.H. Gallin J.I. Holland S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) were obtained from Taconic, Ry, Denmark. Aliquots of 1.5 × 106 hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated 6-well culture plates (Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany) and cultured as published recently (23Reinehr R. Graf D. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 839-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) for 24 h. Hepatocyte viability was more than 95%, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Human hepatoma cell line 7 (Huh7) cells were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/NUT.Mix F12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown to 70% confluency before transient transfection using expression vectors of the CD95-YFP and EGFR-CFP fusion proteins supplemented with Lipofectamine 2000 culture medium without antibiotics. About 54 ± 6% (n = 3) of the cells coexpressed the transfected EGFR-CFP and CD95-YFP constructs. Osmolarity changes were performed by appropriate addition or removal of NaCl from the medium. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured wild type and p47phox knock-out mice hepatocytes, colon, kidney, and thyroid gland. PCR was conducted using standard protocols. For further details including primers used in this study see Supplemental Material. Plasmid Construction—The nucleotide sequence encoding the CD95 receptor was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using HepG2 mRNA and ligated into the pTOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen). After introduction of restriction sites and removal of the stop codon by PCR, the fragment was inserted into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) to create a fusion protein with YFP linked to the C terminus. The EGFR-CFP-construct was obtained by replacing GFP of F7 erb B1-EGFP (kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Arndt-Jovin (25Brock R. Hamelers I.H. Jovin T.M. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)) by CFP of pECFP-N1 (Clontech). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotec, Ebersberg, Germany). p47phox and ASM Protein Knockdown—Antisense oligonucleotides directed to p47phox and the corresponding controls (i.e. nonsense oligonucleotides) were designed and manufactured by Biognostik (Göttingen, Germany). Immediately after hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated culture plates (inner diameter, 6 cm; Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany) at a density of 4 × 106 cells/plate, 4 μmol/liter of the respective oligonucleotides (nonsense, p47phox antisense, or ASM antisense) supplemented with Lipofectamine 2000 were instituted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Thereafter, cells were kept in culture for up to 4 days. In control experiments, uptake of FITC-labeled nonsense oligonucleotides (2 μmol/liter) was already visible after 1 h of incubation and lasted for up to 4 days. Western Blot Analysis—At the end of the incubations, medium was removed, and cells were washed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immediately lysed. Samples were transferred to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were then blotted to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) as described recently (23Reinehr R. Graf D. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 839-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For further details see Supplemental Material. Immunoprecipitation—Hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated culture plates (inner diameter, 10 cm; Falcon) at a density of 8 × 106 cells/plate. They were harvested in lysis buffer as published recently (23Reinehr R. Graf D. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 839-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Equal protein amounts (200 μg) of each sample were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a polyclonal rabbit anti-p47phox, rabbit anti-CD95, or rabbit anti-Yes antibody (dilution 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to immunoprecipitate p47phox, CD95, or Yes. Then 10 μl of protein A- and 10 μl of protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times as published recently (23Reinehr R. Graf D. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 839-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and then transferred to Western blot analysis as described above. Activation of p47phox by serine phosphorylation was detected using an anti-phosphoserine antibody (26Bataller R. Schwabe R.F. Choi Y.H. Yang L. Paik Y.H. Lindquist J. Qian T. Schoonhoven R. Hagedorn C.H. Lemasters J.J. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated culture plates (inner diameter, 10 cm; Falcon) at a density of 8 × 106 cells/plate. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mmol/liter Tris, 30 mmol/liter mannitol, and 10 mmol/liter CaCl2 (pH 7.5). After centrifugation of the samples (5 min, 1200 × g), the supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation (35 min, 40,000 × g) in order to separate the plasma membrane fraction (pellet) from the cytosolic compartment, including intracellular endomembranes (supernatant). This supernatant was then again subjected to ultracentrifugation (2 h, 100,000 × g) in order to separate the intracellular endomembranes (pellet) from the cytosol (supernatant). The latter fractions underwent Western blotting as described above for p47phox, gp91phox, acidic sphingomyelinase, GAPDH, and annexin II. GAPDH and annexin II served as markers for the cytosolic and the plasma membrane fraction, respectively. GAPDH was not detectable in the plasma membrane fraction, and annexin II was absent in the cytosolic fraction, indicating a high efficacy of separation. Immunocytochemistry of ASM—To visualize ASM expression, 1.5 × 106 hepatocytes were seeded on collagen-coated glass coverslips (inner diameter, 30 mm) in 6-well culture plates (Falcon) and cultured for 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS and then fixed using paraformaldehyde (4% v/v, 10 min). If indicated, cells were incubated for 1 h with 5 mg/ml FITC-dextran before fixation in order to visualize endocytotic vesicles. First antibodies against ASM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100) were diluted in PBS and applied for 1 h. After intense washing with PBS, Cy3-coupled secondary antibodies (1:500) were applied for another hour. Coverslips were mounted with diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane 0.1% in PBS. Confocal pictures were taken using the LSM-510-META (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). PKCζ- and CD95 Translocation to the Plasma Membrane—Detection of PKCζ translocation to the plasma membrane was performed as published recently (21Reinehr R. Becker S. Eberle A. Grether-Beck S. Häussinger D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27179-27194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For details see Supplemental Material. CD95 translocation was studied by detecting total CD95 amount in cytosolic and membrane fractions using Western blot analysis as published previously (11Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For details see Supplemental Material. Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—To detect ROS generation, Hepatocytes were loaded with CM-H2DCFDA, and fluorescence was measured at 515-565 nm using a luminescence spectrometer at 488 nm excitation wavelength as published previously (21Reinehr R. Becker S. Eberle A. Grether-Beck S. Häussinger D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27179-27194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For details see Supplemental Material. Detection of Apparent Vesicular pH (pHves) by Single Cell Fluorescence Recordings—Primary hepatocytes grown for 24 h on glass coverslips (inner diameter, 30 mm) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with FITC-dextran (5 mg/ml) for another 60 min at 37 °C. For fluorescence recording, the coverslips were mounted with PBS at 37 °C and equilibrated with room atmosphere resulting in a pH of 7.4. Measurements of apparent pHves in single cells were performed with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert) combined with the QuantiCell 2000-calcium imaging setup (VisiTech, Sunderland, UK). This apparatus allows FITC-dextran fluorescence measurements at the single-cell level at the excitation wavelengths of 488/440 nm with a time resolution of 20 Hz by a monochromator, and emission was measured at 515-565 nm using a CCD camera as provided by the QuantiCell 2000-calcium imaging setup. By use of regions of interest using the QuantiCell 2000 software, the field of measurement was chosen to be within one single cell. The raw fluorescence signals were corrected for autofluorescence as published previously (27Schreiber R. Stoll B. Lang F. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Apparent pHves were obtained from the corrected ratios of 488/440 nm after appropriate calibration according to Thomas et al. (28Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 19: 2210-2218Crossref Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Experiments—FRET was used in order to visualize hyperosmotically induced interactions between EGFR and CD95. For this purpose Huh7 hepatoma cells were cotransfected with CD95-YFP and EGFR-CFP, as described in detail recently (29Eberle A. Reinehr R. Becker S. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2005; 41: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Confocal pictures were taken using the LSM-510-META (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). All cotransfections with YFP/CFP-coupled constructs were detected using the META scan avoiding bleed through of CFP in the YFP channel. CFP was excited with 405 nm and YFP with 514 nm (30Dickinson M.E. Simbuerger E. Zimmermann B. Waters C.W. Fraser S.E. J. Biomed. Opt. 2003; 8: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). FRET efficiency was determined using the LSM-Image-Examiner version 3.1 software (Zeiss), and FRET pictures were normalized for the FRET efficiencies in the respective setting as indicated by the accompanying scale (FRET efficiency is given from blue/0 to red/255) (29Eberle A.

Lipid Extraction and High Performance Thin Layer Chromato-graphy—To measure intracellular ceramide concentrations, 500 μg of protein of the respective samples were transferred to quantification of lipids by Folch extraction (31Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Amplification of the centrosome leads to chromosomal missegregation and generation of aneuploidy, which are closely associated with cell transformation and tumorigenesis (Doxsey, S. J. (2001) Nat.

Here we show that Gadd45a, a DNA damage-inducible protein that is regulated by tumor suppressors p53 and BRCA1, participates in the maintenance of centrosome stability. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from gadd45a knock-out mice exhibit centrosome amplification (designated as increased centrosome numbers). Introduction of exogenous Gadd45a into mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from gadd45a-null mice substantially restored the normal centrosome profile. In contrast to p21waf1/cip1, which ensures coordinated initiation of centrosome, Gadd45a had no significant effect on centrosome duplication in S phase. Interestingly Gadd45a was found to physically associate with Aurora-A protein kinase, whose deregulated expression results in centrosome abnormality. Furthermore Gadd45a was demonstrated to strongly inhibit Aurora-A kinase activity and to antagonize Aurora-A-induced centrosome amplification. These findings identify a novel mechanism for Gadd45a in the maintenance of centrosome stability and broaden understandings of p53- and BRCA1-regulated signaling pathways in maintaining genomic fidelity.

The essence of successful mitosis in mammalian cells is the generation of two genetically identical daughter cells. This requires the assembly of a strictly bipolar mitotic apparatus that will ensure that all daughter chromosomes are segregated to opposite sides of the cell before the completion of mitosis. This process is controlled by the centrosomes that organize the spindle poles during mitosis. In a manner similar to the chromosomal DNA of a cell, centrosomes replicate only once per cell cycle, generating two centrosomes, which then form the two poles of the mitotic spindle. If the centrosome duplicates more than once in a cell cycle then a multiple spindle may be assembled, and the chromosomes may be unequally distributed to the daughter cells, leading to genetic imbalances that generate genomic instability and produce cells with aggressive growth characteristics. Therefore, centrosome abnormalities may result in chromosomal missegregation and generation of aneuploidy, which are closely associated with cell transformation and tumorigenesis (1Doxsey S.J. Nat.

Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The precise function of Aurora-A is not known, but it may be involved in centrosome separation, spindle assembly, and spindle maintenance. Furthermore Aurora-A is considered as an oncogene and is capable of conferring transformed phenotypes to non-oncogenic cells (16Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Interestingly absence of p53 appears to exacerbate the Aurora-A-induced centrosome amplification, providing a plausible explanation for why cells with inactivated p53 function display increased centrosome numbers (8Chiba S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). GADD45a is a p53- and BRCA1-regulated stress gene and is highly induced by a variety of genotoxic agents, such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), UV radiation, and hydroxyurea (25Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In addition to the response to base-damaging agents and certain other stress-related growth arrest treatments including hypoxia and growth factor withdraw, the human GADD45a gene is induced by ionizing radiation (26Papathanasiou M.A. Kerr N.C.

The ionizing radiation induction of GADD45a is transcriptionally dependent on cellular p53 function. Recently GADD45a has been characterized as a downstream gene of BRCA1 (27Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a breast cancer-associated gene that plays roles in the control of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, DNA repair, and gene regulation. Gadd45a is an acidic and nuclear protein. It physically binds to multiple important cellular proteins, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen, p21waf1/cip1 (p21), Cdc2 protein kinase, core histones, and MTK/MEKK4, an upstream activator of the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)/stress-activated protein kinase pathway. The associations of Gadd45a with these molecules indicate that Gadd45a may be involved in the control of cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and the regulation of signaling pathway. GADD45a has been implicated in maintenance of genomic fidelity, although the precise mechanism(s) remains to be further defined. Previous findings have demonstrated that the MEFs derived from gadd45a knock-out mice exhibit aneuploidy, chromosomal aberrations, gene amplification, abnormal cytokinesis, and centrosome amplification. In addition, gadd45a-null mice are susceptible to DNA damage-induced tumors, including carcinogenesis induced by ionizing radiation, UV radiation and dimethylbenzanthracene. Interestingly Gadd45a has been shown to contribute to tumor progression and malignancy. In this study, we report that MEFs with disrupted Gadd45a exhibit centrosome amplification as manifested by increased centrosome copies. Gadd45a was found to physically associate with Aurora-A kinase. The interaction between Gadd45a and Aurora-A was shown to strongly inhibit Aurora-A kinase activity. These observations provide a tight connection between Gadd45a and centrosome stability, further supporting a role for Gadd45a in the maintenance of genomic fidelity. Plasmid Clones and Antibodies—Myc-tagged Gadd45a expression vectors were described previously (29Zhan Q. Antinore M.J. Wang X.W. Carrier F. Smith M.L. Harris C.C. Fornace Jr., A.J.

They were constructed by PCR cloning of the open reading frame regions from human cDNA clones for GADD45a (pHu145B2) and p21waf1/cip1 (pZL-WAF1). The PCR products were inserted into the HindIII/XbaI sites in pCMV.3 downstream from cytomegalovirus promoter. PEGFP-Gadd45a, pEGFP-p21, and pEGFP-p53 were made by inserting open reading frames of GADD45a, p21, and p53 into BglII/KpnI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector, respectively. These constructs express green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). pEGFP-Aurora-A was constructed by inserting the open reading frame region of Aurora-A into XhoI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector. Myc-tagged Aurora-A was made by inserting the open reading frame of Aurora-A into NocI/XhoI sites of pCS2-MT vector. GST-Gadd45a was made by cloning GADD45a cDNA into the XhoI site of the pGEX-5X-1 vector. GST-Cdc2, GST-p53, GST-p21, and GST-ERK were constructed by inserting their open reading frames into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX-5X-1 plasmid. GST-B23 was provided by Dr. Kenji at the University of Cincinnati. The following antibodies were used in the experiments. Antibodies against Gadd45a, Cdc2, c-Myc, γ-tubulin, and Actin were commercially provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Aurora-A was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Cell Culture and Transfection—MEFs derived from both normal and gadd45a knock-out mice were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Normal human fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. Human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in F-12 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS. For cell transfection, 5 × 105 HeLa or CHO cells were seeded onto 10-mm plates 1 day prior to transfection. In each plate, 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) were added to 300 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) in separate tubes. The solutions were mixed gently, allowed to sit for 15 min at room temperature, diluted with 2.4 ml of Opti-MEM, and added to the plates for 6 h at 37°C. Equal volumes of medium with 10% FBS were added, and plates were incubated overnight. Fresh medium was added the following day, and cells were harvested 48 h later. Cell Treatment—For UV treatment, cells plated in 100-mm dishes were rinsed with PBS and irradiated with UV radiation at a dose of 10 J/m2. After cell exposure to UV radiation, fresh medium was added in plates, and the cells were cultured in the incubator until harvest. For MMS treatment, cells were grown in medium containing MMS at a concentration of 50 μg/ml for 4 h. Medium was replaced, and cells were collected at the indicated time. Cellular Protein Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting Analysis—Following treatment, cells were harvested, rinsed with PBS, and lysed in PBS containing 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (lysis buffer). Lysates were collected by scraping and cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C. 100 μg of cellular protein were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Protran membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% milk, washed with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h. Membranes were washed four times in PBST, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was added at 1:4000 in 5% milk. After 1 h, membranes were washed and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For immunoprecipitation, cellular lysates were incubated with 10 μl of the indicated antibodies and 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 6 h. Immunocomplexes were analyzed as described above. GST Preparations—GST fusion protein expression was performed as follows. Escherichia coli were treated with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for GST protein induction. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, and bacterial pellets were resuspended in cold STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl). After incubation with lysozyme (100 μg/ml), bacteria were treated with dithiothreitol (10 mm) and Sarkosyl (0.7%) and subjected to sonication. Following centrifugation, supernatants were treated with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 2%. Next the glutathione-agarose beads were mixed with supernatant solution at 4 °C overnight. After washing several times with PBS, glutathione-agarose bead-conjugated GST fusion proteins were ready for use in the designed experiments. Immunofluorescent Staining of Centrosome—Normal human fibroblasts were placed in 100-mm dishes. 16 h later, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Cells were treated with cold methanol at -20 °C followed by 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. After incubation with antibodies to γ-tubulin and Gadd45a, plates were washed and incubated with Cy3- or Cy4-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Following washing with PBS, cells were visualized using an Olympus fluorescence microscope, and photographs were generated using a Kodak digital camera. Similarly MEFs were placed onto Lab-tek (Nunc) tissue culture slides. After incubation with antibody to γ-tubulin, slides were washed and incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. After washing with PBS, cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope. Aurora-A Kinase Assay—HeLa cells were grown in F-12 medium with 10% FBS and transfected with 5 μg of Myc-tagged Aurora-A expression vector. 48 h later, cells were collected for preparation of cellular protein. 400 μg of whole cell lysates were incubated with 15 μl of anti-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 6 h, and the immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged Aurora-A proteins were incubated with the indicated amounts of GST-Gadd45a, GST-p21, and GST proteins. Kinase assays were then conducted in the presence of 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP; Sigma), 15 mm MgCl2, 7 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30-μl total volumes. After 15 min at 30 °C, the reactions were mixed with an equal amount of protein loading buffer, size-separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. In some cases, 1 mg of cellular protein was directly immunoprecipitated by antibody to Aurora-A, and kinase assays using MBP as substrate were then performed. Centrosome Amplification in gadd45a-/- MEFs—In addition to its role in the control of cell cycle G2-M checkpoint after DNA damage, previous observations have demonstrated that Gadd45a is involved in the maintenance of chromosomal and centrosome stability (11Hollander M.C. Sheikh M.S. Bulavin D.V. Lundgren K. Augeri-Henmueller L. Shehee R. Molinaro T.A. Kim K.E. Tolosa E. Ashwell J.D. Rosenberg M.P. Zhan Q. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Morgan W.F. Deng C.X. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). To further confirm the impact of Gadd45a on genomic stability, the MEFs derived from both wild type or gadd45a-null mice were used for analysis of centrosome abnormalities. MEFs were grown on tissue culture slides and stained with monoclonal antibody against γ-tubulin protein, which is specifically localized at centrosome. After incubation with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, centrosome numbers were then examined using fluorescence microscopy. It should be noted here that in addition to γ-tubulin antibody, the antibody to pericentrin was also used to further confirm that γ-tubulin staining structures are real centrosomes, and we found that both antibodies presented similar results (results not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, MEFs isolated from wild type mice (gadd45a+/+) displayed one or two centrosomes. However, MEFs from gadd45a-null mice (gadd45a-/-) exhibited more than two centrosomes. The quantitative results are summarized in Fig. 1B where ∼30% of gadd45a-/- MEF cells display centrosome amplification (defined as centrosome copies equaling three or greater than three per cell) compared with 3.7% of MEFs (gadd45a+/+) showing centrosome amplification. These results indicate that disruption of endogenous gadd45a results in abnormally amplified centrosome. We next examined whether overexpression of Gadd45a protein in gadd45a-deficient cells restores normal centrosome status. pMSCV-GFP-Gadd45a, a retroviral expression vector that produces GFP-Gadd45a fusion protein, was transfected into gadd45a-/- MEF cells. 96 h later, cells were stained with anti-γ-tubulin antibody, and centrosomes were examined in 400 GFP-positive cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, gadd45a-/- MEFs transfected with GFP empty vector displayed 27% of cells containing three or more than three centrosomes. Following introduction of pMSCV-GFP-Gadd45a expression vector into gadd45a-deficient MEFs, amplified centrosomes were reduced by two-thirds, indicating that expression of exogenous Gadd45a substantially restored the normal centrosome profile in gadd45a-/- MEFs. In the same experiments, p21, a p53-regulated Cdk inhibitor, was also included. Although p21 has been characterized as a major component in regulating centrosome duplication and defect of cellular p21 causes centrosome hyperamplification, overexpression of p21 in gadd45a-/- MEF cells did not restore centrosome abnormality, suggesting that p21 and Gadd45a act on different molecular targets involved in the process of centrosome replication. However, introduction of p53 expression vector into gadd45a-/- MEFs partially rescued centrosome abnormalities. To confirm exogenous expressions of various proteins (Gadd45a, p21, and p53), we examined cellular lysates using immunoblotting analysis and found that those proteins were well expressed in gadd45a-/- MEF cells following transfection (Fig. 2B). Additionally apoptosis was also examined following overexpression of Gadd45a in gadd45a-/- MEF cells, and no evident cell death was observed in the experiments (data not shown). Gadd45a Expression Does Not Affect Centrosome Duplication in S Phase—Centrosome amplification has been observed to often occur at S and late mitotic phases (8Chiba S. Okuda M. Mussman J.G. Fukasawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Tarapore P. Horn H.F. Tokuyama Y. Fukasawa K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3173-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 24Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The former is associated with centrosome over-replication that is carried out by Cdk2-Cyclin E kinase complex, and the latter is associated with aborted cytokinesis that might be due to overactivity of Aurora kinases or polo kinases. A numbers of investigations have demonstrated that p21 plays a critical role in regulating centrosome replication in S phase through its inhibition of Cdk2-Cyclin E kinase. Although the previous studies have shown that Gadd45a has no inhibitory effect on Cdk2-Cyclin E kinase, we examined whether Gadd45a acts on S phase-related centrosome amplification (Fig. 2C). We transfected pEGFP-Gadd45a or pEGFP-p21 expression vectors into CHO cells and synchronized cells at S phase using hydroxyurea, which is a chemical blocker of DNA synthesis. Following synchronization by hydroxyurea, more than 60% of untransfected cells displayed increased centrosome numbers (three or greater than three copies). Introduction of p21 expression vector substantially inhibited centrosome amplification. In the presence of p21 protein, cells containing amplified centrosome were dropped from 67 to 9%, further confirming that p21 mainly targets Cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase complex and then ensures coordinated initiation of centrosome. In contrast, Gadd45a had no significant effect on centrosome amplification, indicating that Gadd45a does not act on centrosome duplication at S phase. These results are consistent with the findings shown in Fig. 2A that p21 and Gadd45a act on different components involved in centrosome stability. Gadd45a Physically Interacts with Aurora-A—Previous studies have demonstrated that Gadd45a is neither a kinase nor a phosphatase. Likely the role of Gadd45a in maintenance of centrosome stability might be mediated through its interaction with certain regulatory components involved in centrosome duplication. Using a “yeast two-hybrid” approach, we identified 12 candidates of the Gadd45a-interacting protein, one of which is Aurora-A kinase, which is a key regulator in centrosome separation and maturation. Because deregulated expression of Aurora-A has been shown to result in centrosome instabilities, efforts were made to determine the physical association of Gadd45a with Aurora-A. In Fig. 3A, HeLa cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Gadd45a vector, and cellular lysates were incubated with a group of GST fusion proteins. Clearly Myc-tagged Gadd45a was pulled down by GST-Aurora-A as well as by GST-Cdc2, GST-p21, and GST-B23, which were reported previously to interact with Gadd45a. In contrast, GST-Cyclin B1 and GST alone did not pull down Myc-tagged Gadd45a fusion protein. Next GST-Gadd45a protein was incubated with cell lysates from untreated HeLa cells and followed by pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 3B, endogenous Aurora-A protein was detected in GST-Gadd45a pulldown complexes. As a positive control, endogenous Cdc2 was pulled down by GST-Gadd45a. An association between cellular Gadd45a and GST-Aurora-A proteins was also demonstrated. GST-Aurora-A, GST-Cdc2, and GST-Cyclin B1 fusion proteins were incubated with cellular lysates isolated from HeLa Gadd45a-inducible cells, which were collected at 24 h after withdrawal of tetracycline and which expressed substantial amounts of Gadd45a protein, and followed by GST pulldown assays. In Fig. 3C, both GST-Cdc2 and GST-GST-Aurora-A were able to pull down Gadd45a, but GST alone or GST-Cyclin B1 did not associate with cellular Gadd45a. Additionally the physical interactions between endogenous Gadd45a and Aurora-A proteins were further examined. Cellular lysates were prepared from HeLa cells treated with UV radiation (10 J/m2) and incubated with anti-Aurora-A antibody. As shown in Fig. 3D, endogenous Gadd45a protein was highly induced after cell exposure to UV radiation (upper panel). Following immunoprecipitation by the antibody to Aurora-A, endogenous Gadd45a was detected. Interestingly the interactions between Gadd45a and Aurora-A proteins were enhanced by DNA treatment because increased amounts of Gadd45a protein were observed in Aurora-A immunocomplexes following UV radiation. To rule out nonspecific interactions, the antibody to Actin was also included in the immunoprecipitation assays. Both Gadd45a and Aurora-A proteins were not seen in Actin immunocomplexes. Collectively these results indicate a specific physical interaction of Gadd45a with Aurora-A. Gadd45a Inhibits Aurora-A Kinase Activity—The kinase activity of Aurora-A is closely associated with Aurora-A-induced centrosome abnormalities despite the observation that overexpression of inactive Aurora-A kinase also deregulates the control of centrosome duplication. Interestingly overexpression of wild type Aurora-A or a constitutively active mutant of the kinase in NIH3T3 or Rat1 cells leads to more aggressive properties, but that was not the case when an inactive mutant Aurora-A was overexpressed, suggesting that high activity of Aurora-A is tightly connected with genomic instability and malignant transformation. To determine whether Gadd45a protein inhibits Aurora-A activity, Myc-tagged Aurora-A expression vector was transfected into HeLa cells. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for preparation of protein extracts. Myc-tagged Aurora-A protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and then an in vitro kinase assay was conducted in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and MBP. In the Aurora-A kinase assay, different amounts of purified GST-Gadd45a protein were added. In addition, GST-p21 protein and GST protein alone were included in the same experiments. As shown in Fig. 4A, 20 ng of Gadd45a protein exhibited strong inhibition on Aurora-A kinase activity. The Gadd45a inhibition of Aurora-A activity was dose-dependent. With the addition of 500 ng of GST-Gadd45a protein, Aurora-A activity appeared to be completely suppressed. In contrast, both GST-p21 and GST alone did not present any inhibitory effect on Aurora-A kinase activity. Additionally antibodies against Cdc2, Cdk2, and Aurora-A were utilized for immunoprecipitation and followed by kinase assays. These immunocomplexes displayed strong kinase activity using histone H1 or MBP as substrates (Fig. 4B). Addition of GST-Gadd45a proteins resulted in substantial inhibition of activities for Cdc2 and Aurora-A kinases but did not affect Cdk2 kinase activity, indicating that Gadd45a inhibition of Aurora-A is a specific effect. It should be noted here that the experiments were conducted to examine whether Aurora-A can directly phosphorylate Gadd45a but failed to get positive results (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that the inhibition of MBP phosphorylation by Aurora-A could be due to competitive inhibition of Gadd45a with Aurora-A. To explore the effect of Gadd45a on cellular Aurora-A in vivo, Aurora-A kinase activity was examined in MEFs derived from wild type and gadd45a-null mice (gadd45a -/-). Both types of MEFs were treated with UV radiation (10 J/m2) and MMS (50 μg/ml), which are DNA-damaging agents and highly induce cellular Gadd45a protein. Cell lysates were prepared 8 h post-treatment and immunoprecipitated with antibody to Aurora-A. A kinase assay was then carried out in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and MBP. As shown in Fig. 4C, the levels of Aurora-A kinase activity were similar in untreated MEFs. After UV radiation or MMS treatment, wild type MEFs exhibited a reduction in Aurora-A kinase activity, but MEFs from gadd45a-null mice did not display any significant inhibition on Aurora-A kinase activity. It should be mentioned here that equal amounts of immunoprecipitated Aurora-A were used in the kinase assays as the aliquots of immunoprecipitates were examined with Western analysis. Taken together with the findings in Fig. 4, A and B, these results indicate that Gadd45a inhibits Aurora-A kinase activity. Gadd45a Antagonizes Aurora-A-induced Centrosome Amplification—It was thought that deregulated expression of Aurora-A results in centrosome abnormalities. To demonstrate the inhibitory effect of Gadd45a on Aurora-A-induced centrosome amplification, CHO cells were transfected with pEGFP empty vector (control) or pEGFP-Aurora-A expression vector, and centrosome copies were analyzed 96 h post-transfection. As shown in Fig. 5, Aurora-A-transfected CHO cells exhibited evident centrosome amplification as reflected by the fact that 38% of cells overexpressing Aurora-A contained three or greater than three centrosomes. In contrast, only 4% of GFP empty vector-transfected cells revealed increased centrosome numbers (three or greater than three centrosomes per cell). However, when pEGFP-Aurora-A was co-expressed with a Gadd45a expression vector, the CHO cells containing increased centrosome numbers were reduced from 38 to 11%, but co-expression of p21 was unable to suppress Aurora-A-induced centrosome amplification. These observations demonstrate that Gadd45a antagonizes induction of centrosome amplification by Aurora-A. GADD45a is a downstream target effector gene for both p53 and BRCA1 and is highly induced by a wide spectrum of genotoxic agents, including ionizing radiation, MMS, and UV radiation (25Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In addition to its roles in the control of cell cycle G2-M checkpoint and induction of apoptosis, Gadd45a appears to be one of the key components in regulating centrosome stability. MEFs derived from gadd45a-null mice display aneuploidy, chromosomal aberrations, abnormal cytokinesis, and gene amplification (11Hollander M.C. Sheikh M.S. Bulavin D.V. Lundgren K. Augeri-Henmueller L. Shehee R. Molinaro T.A. Kim K.E. Tolosa E. Ashwell J.D. Rosenberg M.P. Zhan Q. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Morgan W.F. Deng C.X. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The observations that MEFs with disrupted Gadd45a exhibited increased centrosome copies (Fig. 1, A and B) further confirmed that Gadd45a plays a critical role in the maintenance of centrosome stability. We also conducted cell cycle synchronization using either serum starvation that arrests cell at G0/G1 phase or nocodazole, a microtubule disruptor that arrests cells at late mitotic phase, and examined centrosome numbers but found that centrosome amplification in gadd45a-deficient cells occurred in all different phases and was independent of cell cycle (results not shown). In support of these findings, expression of exogenous Gadd45a in gadd45a-deficient cells was shown to greatly restore normal centrosome states (Fig. 2A). Because centrosome abnormalities are associated with malignant transformation, the finding that disruption of Gadd45a leads to centrosome amplification can at least in part account for susceptibility of the gadd45a-/- knock-out animals to DNA damage-induced carcinogenesis by ionizing radiation, UV radiation, and dimethylbenzanthracene. Centrosome abnormalities are tightly linked to genetic alterations in the tumor suppressors p53 and BRCA1. p53 directly interacts with Aurora-A kinase and suppresses its kinase activity. In addition, the p53-regulated p21, a potent inhibitor of cell cycle kinases, has been shown to regulate centrosome replication through its inhibition of Cyclin E-Cdk2 activity. In contrast to well characterized mechanism(s) by which p53 plays an important role in maintenance of centrosome stability, the pathway that mediates the role of BRCA1 in regulating normal centrosome states is currently unclear, although BRCA1 has been shown to localize at centrosome via its physical interaction with γ-tubulin, a major component of the centrosome. Several reports by others and by us have demonstrated that GADD45a is transcriptionally up-regulated by BRCA1 in a p53-independent manner, suggesting that Gadd45a possibly might mediate the role of BRCA1 in the control of genomic fidelity and cell cycle progression. Recently genetic interactions between BRCA1 and Gadd45a were characterized by crossing genetic mutants of BRCA1 and Gadd45a (31Wang X. Wang R.H. Li W. Xu X. Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Deng C.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29606-29614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because centrosome amplification was seen to dramatically increase in the mice with combined mutations, this synergistic effect suggests that the relationship between BRCA1 and Gadd45a in centrosome duplication is not just epistatic. Although BRCA1 plays a function not only through Gadd45a, this BRCA1 downstream target gene would still be expected to at least in part mediate the role of BRCA1 in regulating centrosome duplication. Both GADD45a and p21 are transcriptionally activated by p53 and play important roles in the control of cell cycle check-points. However, these two proteins appear to act on different phases of the cell cycle. p21 has been demonstrated to guard against premature activation of Cdk2-Cyclin E and function in the initiation of centrosome duplication. In contrast, Gadd45a acts on Aurora-A kinase to ensure centrosome maturation or completion of cytokinesis. Given our previous finding that Gadd45a inhibits Cdc2-Cyclin B1 and blocks cell entry into mitosis, Gadd45a might regulate centrosome stability probably via its inhibitory effect on both Aurora-A and Cdc2 activities. Thus, the observations presented here have broadened the p53-regulated pathways involved in the control of centrosome stability. Several protein kinases have been implicated in the centrosome cycle, particularly in centrosome amplification. These include Aurora-A kinase, Aurora-B kinase (15Giet R. Prigent C. J.

Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The precise function of Aurora-A is not known, but it may be involved in centrosome separation, spindle assembly, and spindle maintenance. Furthermore Aurora-A is considered as an oncogene and is capable of conferring transformed phenotypes to non-oncogenic cells (16Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). In the current study, we defined a strong inhibitory effect of Gadd45a on Aurora-A kinase activity (Fig. 4). Addition of GST-Gadd45a protein resulted in suppression of Aurora-A activity (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly following UV radiation or MMS treatment, MEFs derived from wild type mice showed a strong reduction of Aurora-A kinase activity, whereas the inhibition was greatly abolished in the cells with disrupted Gadd45a, suggesting that Gadd45a inhibition of Aurora-A is likely enhanced in response to DNA damage. The Gadd45a inhibition of Aurora-A kinase activity is likely to be mediated through its physical interactions with Aurora-A protein. Although Gadd45a has been shown to physically associate with Cdc2, whose activity is mainly required for G2-M transition, the interactions between Gadd45a and Cdc2 or Aurora-A appear to be different. The Cdc2-binding motif is characterized at the central region of Gadd45a, but Aurora-A-binding domain was found to be located at the N terminus of the Gadd45a protein (results not shown). As discussed earlier, overexpression of Aurora-A leads to centrosome hypertrophy. This was further confirmed by the observations in chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with Aurora-A expression vector (Fig. 5). Consistent with the finding that Gadd45a suppressed Aurora-A kinase activity (Fig. 4), the Aurora-A-induced centrosome amplification was antagonized by co-introduction of Gadd45a, but expression of p21 had no effect on Aurora-A-caused centrosome abnormality. Given the fact that centrosome amplification in cells with disrupted Gadd45a is coupled with aborted cytokinesis, which often occurs due to deregulation of Aurora kinases, our results further support the possibility that the failure to undergo cytokinesis also results in centrosome amplification in addition to failure of inhibition of centrosome reduplication in G/S phases. We thank Dr. Albert J. Fornace and M. Christine Hollander at the National Institutes of Health for providing us with gadd45a knock-out MEFs. In addition, we thank Dr. Sen at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center for providing us with Aurora-A cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2030833691,"As a direct correlation between aging and the risk of onset of vascular disease has been universally accepted, we prepared an in vitro aging model consisting in sequential passages of human aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMC) in order to evaluate the cell behavior changes during aging. Because matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are actively involved in matrix remodeling and disease outcome, in our model we found active MMP-2 only in the conditioned medium of young AoSMCs, whereas aged cells showed only the inactive zymogen form of MMP-2 (pro-MMP-2). We ascribed the pro-MMP-2 activation in young cells to an increase in membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) content. Furthermore, we found that transcripts coding for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were up-regulated in aged cells, and this increase of TIMPs could also prevent pro-MMP-2 activation in aged cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that young AoSMCs possess higher migratory capabilities than aged cells. The young AoSMC migration can be inhibited by adding TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 to the cells reproducing aged AoSMC migratory behavior. Finally, the role of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in AoSMC migration was confirmed silencing MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in young and aged AoSMCs, respectively; therefore, in this study we showed that these enzymes play a pivotal role in the regulation of the AoSMC migration during in vitro aging."
https://openalex.org/W2149735074,"Many early molecular events in symbiotic infection have been documented, although factors enabling Rhizobium to progress within the plant-derived infection thread and ultimately survive within the intracellular symbiosome compartment as mature nitrogen-fixing bacteroids are poorly understood. Rhizobial surface polysaccharides (SPS), including the capsular polysaccharides (K-antigens), exist in close proximity to plant-derived membranes throughout the infection process. SPSs are essential for bacterial survival, adaptation, and as potential determinants of nodulation and/or host specificity.

Deletion of three genes located in the rkp-3 gene cluster, rkpM, rkpN, and part of rkpO, abolished pseudaminic acid synthesis, yielding a mutant in which the strain-specific K-antigen was totally absent: other surface glycoconjugates, including the lipopolysaccharides, exopolysaccharides, and flagellin glycoprotein appeared unaffected. The NGRΔrkpMNO mutant was symbiotically defective, showing reduced nodulation efficiency on several legumes. K-antigen production was found to decline after rhizobia were exposed to plant flavonoids, and the decrease coincided with induction of a symbiotically active (bacteroid-specific) rhamnan-LPS, suggesting an exchange of SPS occurs during bacterial differentiation in the developing nodule.

Rhizobium sp. NGR234 is a broad host range endosymbiont able to initiate nitrogen-fixing symbioses with more than 112 genera of legumes (1Pueppke S.G. Broughton W.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe. Interact. 1999; 12: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A Gram-negative bacterium, it is a member of the α-2 subgroup of the Proteobacteria (2Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. Busch M. Mayer H. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1991; 41: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Bhat U.R. Mayer H. Yokota A. Hollingsworth R.I. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which includes the Rhizobiaceae, plant pathogens such as Agrobacterium, and phylogenetically related bacteria such as the intracellular animal pathogen Brucella. Most members of this subgroup share an important characteristic, the ability to survive within intracellular host membrane-derived compartments. In the case of rhizobia these are referred to as symbiosomes. Successful colonization of a legume by a compatible Rhizobium involves an initial exchange of signal molecules, e.g. flavonoids and lipochitooligosaccharides (Nod factors) leading to the development of unique plant-derived structures (infection threads, symbiosomes, root nodules). Rhizobia migrate through the infection threads and are eventually internalized into the nodule cells, resulting in the formation of symbiosomes, specialized intracellular compartments composed of a plant-derived membrane, which closely surrounds the bacterium (4Kannenberg E.L.

Bacteria differentiate into bacteroids within the symbiosome where they actively reduce atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia. Although the early molecular events are well studied, the factors enabling the bacteria to progress within the infection thread, penetrate the root cortical cells, and ultimately survive within the symbiosome compartment are poorly understood (4Kannenberg E.L.

These SPS include exopolysaccharides (EPS), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), capsular polysaccharides (K-antigens or KPS), and cyclic β-glucans. Most studies have focused on the LPS and EPS, demonstrating that these components are essential for normal nodule development and active nitrogen fixation (Ndv+, Fix+ phenotype) (4Kannenberg E.L.

Relatively few studies have examined the K-antigens, and their specific symbiotic role remains unclear (4Kannenberg E.L. Reuhs B.L. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. Spaink H.P. Kondorosi A. Hooykaas P.J. The Rhizobiaceae. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Boston, London1998: 119-154Google Scholar, 5Broughton W.J. Jabbouri S. Perret X. J.

KPS are tightly associated with the rhizobial outer membrane, and thus distinct from the loosely associated, high molecular weight EPS of these bacteria (reviewed in Ref. 4Kannenberg E.L. Reuhs B.L. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. Spaink H.P. Kondorosi A. Hooykaas P.J. The Rhizobiaceae. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Boston, London1998: 119-154Google Scholar). Rhizobial KPS are strain-specific antigens, and are structurally analogous to the group II K-antigens of Escherichia coli in that they are generally acidic, linear polysaccharides having simple (usually disaccharide) repeating units (4Kannenberg E.L. Reuhs B.L. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. Spaink H.P. Kondorosi A. Hooykaas P.J. The Rhizobiaceae. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Boston, London1998: 119-154Google Scholar, 14Reuhs B.L. Carlson R.W. Kim J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3570-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial surveys of various rhizobial strains suggested that a common structural motif exists for many of these polysaccharides, in which a 1-carboxy-2-oxo-3-deoxy sugar such as Kdo, or a Kdo analogue (Kdx) alternates with a neutral hexose or uronic acid, yielding linear disaccharide repeats of the type Kdx-Sug, possessing high negative charge density (15Reuhs B.L.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5366-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exceptions to this structural motif have been reported (15Reuhs B.L. Geller D.P. Kim J.S. Fox J.E. Kolli V.S.K. Pueppke S.G. Appl.

J. 1999; 342: 527-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a variety of unusual structural features are now known, including KPS composed of alternating glycosidic and amidic linkages (20Gil-Serrano A.M. Rodríguez-Carvajal M.A. Tejero-Mateo P. Espartero J.L. Menendez M. Corzo J. Ruiz-Sainz J.E. Buendía-Clavería A.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 527-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A correlation between KPS structure and host range specificity was recently suggested for some strains of Rhizobium fredii (17Rodriguez-Carvajal M.A. Rodrigues J.A. Soria-Diaz M.E. Tejero-Mateo P. Buendía-Clavería A. Gutierrez R. Ruiz-Sainz J.E. Thomas-Oates J. Gil-Serrano A.M. Biomacromolecules. 2005; 6: 1448-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), although the available structural information was considered insufficient to allow reliable classification. A role for K-antigens in symbiotic infection was demonstrated in an exoB- (EPS-deficient) mutant of Rhizobium meliloti strain Rm41. Although EPS production is abolished in the mutant (AK631), the K-antigens were expressed at normal levels, and were functionally able to compensate for EPS, allowing effective nodulation (Fix+ phenotype) on Medicago sativa (alfalfa) (21Reuhs B.L. Williams M.N.V. Kim J.S. Carlson R.W. Côté F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4289-4296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Petrovics G. Putnoky P. Reuhs B. Kim J. Thorp T.A. Noel D. Carlson R.W. Kondorosi A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Further mutations in genes associated with KPS synthesis produced phenotypes with aborted infection threads and empty nodules devoid of nitrogen-fixing bacteroids (Inf-, Fix-) (23Putnoky P. Grosskopf E. Ha D.T.C. Kiss G.B. Kondorosi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Williams M.N.V. Hollingsworth R.I. Brzoska P.M. Signer E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6596-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, the precise role of KPS in symbiotic infection and the regulation of KPS expression remain unclear. In the present study we identified and characterized the genetic locus responsible for the synthesis of the unique KPS-specific sugar precursor of NGR234, and present the complete structure of the primary KPS. This is the first report of a completely determined structure for a rhizobial KPS containing 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-nonulosonic acid (pseudaminic acid, Pse) as a component of a disaccharide repeating unit. By identifying and deleting the genes responsible for the synthesis of the glycosyl precursor (pseudaminic acid), KPS synthesis was specifically blocked, resulting in a defective phenotype with reduced ability to initiate symbiotic infection. Growth of Bacteria—E. coli recombinants were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). NGR234 and its derivatives were raised for 40 h (unless otherwise stated) at 27 °C in tryptone/yeast (TY) (26Beringer J.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1974; 84: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar) or in a minimal medium containing succinate as the sole carbon source (RMS) (27Broughton W.J. Wong C.H. Lewin A. Samrey U. Myint H. Meyer Z.A.H. Dowling D.N. Simon R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Gentamycin (Gm), spectinomycin (Sp), rifampicin (Rif), and tetracyclin (Tet) were added when needed to final concentrations of 20, 50, 50, and 15 μg·ml-1, respectively. Flavonoid induction was performed with apigenin as described previously (28Deakin W.J. Marie C. Saad M.M. Krishnan H.B. Broughton W.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2005; 18: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rhizobium strains were grown in 100 ml of RMS for 40 h; then the medium was supplemented with 100 μl of 1 mm apigenin in methanol (100 μl of methanol was added to the non-induced cultures). Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in the supplemental materials, Table S1. Construction of a NGRΔrkpMNO Mutant—The rkp-3 locus of S. meliloti strain 41 (Sm41) 3Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium are synonymous; (Sino)Rhizobium meliloti strain Sm41 is strain Rm41. (GenBank™ accession no. AJ245666) contains genes essential for the synthesis of the K-antigen polysaccharides (29Kiss E. Kereszt A. Barta F. Stephens S. Reuhs B.L. Kondorosi A. Putnoky P. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In their report, Kiss et al. (29Kiss E. Kereszt A. Barta F. Stephens S. Reuhs B.L. Kondorosi A. Putnoky P. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showed that some of the genes from the rkp-3 region hybridized to DNA of NGR234 suggesting that homologues could be present in the latter. To search for these homologues, the Sm41 rkp-3 DNA sequence was blasted against the Genome Survey Sequences data base (dbGSS) (NCBI), and sequences originating from NGR234 (30Viprey V. Rosenthal A. Broughton W.J. Perret X. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 1381-1389Crossref Google Scholar) were retrieved. Among the four sequences obtained, two (Genbank™ ID: AZ577715 and AZ577319) had strong homologies to genes (rkpL and rkpQ, respectively) involved in the synthesis of K-antigen precursors in Sm41 (29Kiss E. Kereszt A. Barta F. Stephens S. Reuhs B.L. Kondorosi A. Putnoky P. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A rkpL-forward primer (5′-ACTGGTCTGGCACGCATTCG-3′) and the rkpQ-reverse primer (5′-GAGAGCCTTCACGAAATAAAGC-3′) were used to amplify a 4.4-kb fragment using genomic DNA of NGR234 as the template. The amplified fragment was ligated into EcoRV-restricted pBKS (pALQ01) A 2.2-kb fragment from the latter plasmid was deleted using EcoRV digestion (pALQ02). Later sequencing of the locus showed that the region deleted included rkpM, rkpN, and the 5′-end of rkpO (Fig. 1 and see text below). After digestion with SmaI, a spectinomycin resistance gene (isolated from pHP45Ω-Sp) (31Fellay R. Frey J. Krisch H. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) was ligated into the EcoRV site of pALQ02 yielding pALQ03. Finally, the full insert of pALQ03 was excised using XbaI and SalI, then cloned into XbaI/SalI-restricted pJQ200SK (32Quandt J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid (pALQ04) was mobilized into NGR234 using a tri-parental mating procedure and the helper plasmid pRK2013 (33Figurski D.H. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). The mating mixture was plated on TY agar containing Rif and Gm, then on TY plates containing Rif, Sp, and 5% (w/v) sucrose to promote marker exchange. Southern blotting techniques were used to confirm that the deletion in NGRΔrkpMNO was correctly inserted. Sequence Analysis of the rkp-3 Region in NGR234—The rkp-3 region of Sm41 (GenBank™ accession no. AJ245666) was blasted against the almost complete NGR234 sequence. 4W. R. Streit et al., manuscript in preparation. One contig (GenBank™ accession no. DQ341105) was highly homologous to the rkp genes and was further annotated. Putative ORFs were predicted using the ERGO suite as well as BioEdit software and the BLAST search engines accessible from NCBI. Predicted ORFs were finally translated and blasted against the nonredundant protein data base using the BlastP program (see supplemental materials, Table S2). Extraction of Cell Surface Polysaccharides and SDS-PAGE— The bacterial cells obtained by centrifuging 5-ml liquid cultures of RMS were lysed using 100 μl of lysis buffer as described previously (34Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two volumes of sample buffer (120 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3% (w/v) SDS, 9% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue) were then added to the polysaccharide extracts. The final mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) using 0.2 m Tris (pH 8.9) as the anode buffer while the cathode buffer comprised 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m Tricine, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.9, at 20 mA. Gels were stained specifically for LPS using periodate oxidation-silver (35Tsai C. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar), and KPS were visualized by sequential staining with alcian blue-silver (15Reuhs B.L. Geller D.P. Kim J.S. Fox J.E. Kolli V.S.K. Pueppke S.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Corzo J. Pérez-Galdona R. León-Barrios M. Gutiérrez-Navarro A.M. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with omission of the periodate treatment so that LPS was not detected. These procedures readily distinguish the KPS from LPS; the alcian blue pretreatment is required for KPS visualization, and periodate oxidation is required for LPS staining. Plant Assays—Seeds of Flemingia congesta, Leucaena leucocephala, Pachyrhizus tuberosus, Tephrosia vogelii, and Vigna unguiculata were purchased from the suppliers listed in Pueppke and Broughton (1999) (1Pueppke S.G. Broughton W.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe. Interact. 1999; 12: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The plant tests were performed as described previously (1Pueppke S.G. Broughton W.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe. Interact. 1999; 12: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and were repeated three times with a minimum of 12 plants for V. unguiculata and T. vogelii and repeated once for L. leucocephala, P. tuberosus, and F. congesta. To do this, the seeds were surface-sterilized with concentrated H2SO4 and 5% H2O2 before being placed on B&D agar (37Broughton W.J. Dilworth M.J. Biochem. J. 1971; 125: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) to germinate at 26 °C in the dark. The germinating seeds were planted into sterile vermiculite held in Magenta jars™, inoculated with 107 log-phase cells and grown for 6 weeks. Isolation and Purification of Capsular Polysaccharides for Chemical Analyses—For chemical analyses, cells were cultured at 28 °C in 20 liters of tryptone/yeast extract (TY) supplemented with Ca2+ as described for related species (38Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). At late-log phase (A600 ≃ 2.50), the cells were pelleted and then washed by resuspending in phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation to remove EPS. The supernatants, containing EPS, were subjected to glycosyl composition analysis (described below). The washed cell pellets were then extracted by a hot phenol/water procedure (38Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Water layer extracts containing KPS and LPS were dialyzed and treated sequentially with ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, and proteinase K (38Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) then subjected to size exclusion chromatography under dissociative conditions (0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 m NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris pH 9.2) (39Peterson A.A. McGroarty E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 738-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on a column of Sephadex G-150 (1.1 × 100 cm). This procedure separates the major K-antigen polysaccharides from the rough and smooth LPS (40Gudlavalleti S.K. Forsberg L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3957-3968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The refractive index of the eluant was monitored using a RID-10A detector (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan), and fractions were assayed colorimetrically for 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo), for uronic acid, and for neutral carbohydrate (41York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Pooled fractions were dialyzed as described (14Reuhs B.L. Carlson R.W. Kim J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3570-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and freezedried. LPS and KPS were analyzed by DOC-PAGE, with 18% acrylamide gels, using the differential staining procedures for KPS and LPS as described above (15Reuhs B.L. Geller D.P. Kim J.S. Fox J.E. Kolli V.S.K.

The KPS fraction was subjected to glycosyl composition, mass spectrometry, and NMR analyses described below. Glycosyl Analyses—Glycosyl compositions were determined by GC-MS analysis of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) methyl glycoside derivatives (12Forsberg L.S. Noel K.D. Box J. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51347-51359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P.

Inositol was used as an internal standard, and retention times were compared with authentic standards. The absolute configuration of glucuronic acid residues was determined by GC-MS analysis of the TMS (-)-2-butyl glycoside derivatives (42Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 1-7Crossref Scopus (543) Google Scholar) of the carbohydrate components and authentic d-GlcA. Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager-DE time of flight (TOF) spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Boston, MA) in the positive and negative modes, using a matrix of 100 mm 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 90% methanol. The instrument was operated at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV with extraction delay time of 100 ns. Samples were desorbed with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm) using a detector sensitivity of 1000 mV FS. Mass spectra were recorded over an m/z range of 500-20,000 and represent the summation of 200 acquisitions. Polygalacturonic acid was used as the calibration standard. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analyses—1H spectra and all two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear spectra of the KPS were recorded at 29 °C on a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer using a 5-mm triple probe and standard Varian software (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). The polysaccharide was dissolved and analyzed in D2O yielding clear solutions at ∼5 mg/ml; spectra were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt (DSS) (δH 0.00 ppm). In most experiments, presaturation was applied to the residual HDO signal. 1H-1H COSY (43Piantini U. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1880) Google Scholar) data were recorded in the absolute value mode with a 4.0 kHz spectral width and a matrix size of 256 × 2048 complex data points with eight scans per increment. 1H-1H TOCSY (44Braunschweiler L.

https://openalex.org/W2013474843,"Abstract Neurexins mediate protein interactions at the synapse, playing an essential role in synaptic function. Extracellular domains of neurexins, and their fragments, bind a distinct profile of different proteins regulated by alternative splicing and Ca2+. The crystal structure of n1α_LNS#2 (the second LNS/LG domain of bovine neurexin 1α) reveals large structural differences compared with n1α_LNS#6 (or n1β_LNS), the only other LNS/LG domain for which a structure has been determined. The differences overlap the so-called hyper-variable surface, the putative protein interaction surface that is reshaped as a result of alternative splicing. A Ca2+-binding site is revealed at the center of the hyper-variable surface next to splice insertion sites. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that the Ca2+-binding site in n1α_LNS#2 has low affinity (Kd ∼ 400 μm). Ca2+ binding ceases to be measurable when an 8- or 15-residue splice insert is present at the splice site SS#2 indicating that alternative splicing can affect Ca2+-binding sites of neurexin LNS/LG domains. Our studies initiate a framework for the putative protein interaction sites of neurexin LNS/LG domains. This framework is essential to understand how incorporation of alternative splice inserts expands the information from a limited set of neurexin genes to produce a large array of synaptic adhesion molecules with potentially very different synaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W2123285450,"To replicate, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) needs to integrate a cDNA copy of its RNA genome into a chromosome of the host cell, a step controlled by the viral integrase (IN) protein. Viral integration involves the participation of several cellular proteins. SNF5/Ini1, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, was the first cofactor identified to interact with IN. We report here that SNF5/Ini1 interferes with early steps of HIV-1 replication. Inhibition of SNF5/Ini1 expression by RNA interference increases HIV-1 replication. Using quantitative PCR, we show that both the 2-long terminal repeat circle and integrated DNA forms accumulate upon SNF5/Ini1 knock down. By yeast two-hybrid assay, we screened a library of HIV-1 IN random mutants obtained by PCR random mutagenesis using SNF5/Ini1 as prey. Two different mutants of interaction, IN E69G and IN K71R, were impaired for SNF5/Ini1 interaction. The E69G substitution completely abolished integrase catalytic activity, leading to a replication-defective virus. On the contrary, IN K71R retained in vitro integrase activity. K71R substitution stimulates viral replication and results in higher infectious titers. Taken together, these results suggest that, by interacting with IN, SNF5/Ini1 interferes with early steps of HIV-1 infection.

Following retrovirus entry, a large nucleoprotein complex called preintegration complex (PIC) is formed in the cytoplasm with components of the virion core and cellular factors. In addition to viral cDNA, PICs contain several viral proteins: matrix, nucleocapsid, reverse transcriptase, VPR protein, and integrase (IN), which carries out DNA-cutting and -joining reactions (1Bukrinsky M.I. Sharova N. McDonald T.L. Pushkarskaya T. Tarpley W.G. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6125-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 2Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 IN consists of three functional domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1-49), the catalytic core domain (residues 50-212), and the C-terminal domain (residues 213-288) (3Chen J.C. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J. Finer-Moore J.S. Tang A.H. Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 4Wang J.Y. Ling H. Yang W. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains an HHCC motif that binds one Zn2+ atom and is involved in the multimerization of the protein (4Wang J.Y. Ling H. Yang W. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain binds DNA non-specifically and plays a role in the formation of an active multimer of IN (3Chen J.C. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J. Finer-Moore J.S. Tang A.H. Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The catalytic core domain contains the canonical 3-amino acid motif, D, D(35)E, that is essential for the catalytic activity of the protein (4Wang J.Y. Ling H. Yang W. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). These residues coordinate a divalent metal ion (Mg2+) and are highly conserved among all integrases and retrotransposases. Integration proceeds in three steps, 3′-processing, strand transfer, and gap repair. Purified IN exhibits both 3′-processing and strand transfer in vitro. Double-stranded blunt-ended viral DNA produced by reverse transcription is first cleaved immediately 3′ of a conserved CA dinucleotide motif. This reaction generates CA-3′-hydroxyl DNA ends that are the active intermediates of the strand transfer reaction. Both viral DNA ends are then inserted into a host cell chromosome. Finally, gap filling of the unrepaired 5′-ends of the viral DNA is under the control of cellular enzymes. In addition to the integration reaction, non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination cellular pathways are involved in the formation of 1 and 2-LTR circles that are detected in the nuclei of infected cells (5Li L.

Other cellular proteins, such as HMG1a and Barrier of Autointegration Factor (BAF) interact with viral cDNA and participate in the integration reaction (18Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D.

While in vivo HIV-1 integration is not sequence specific, transcriptionally inactive regions of the genome, such as centromeres and telomeres, are disfavored targets (20Carteau S. Hoffmann C. Bushman F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4005-4014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jordan A. Defechereux P. Verdin E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1726-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Jordan A. Bisgrove D. Verdin E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1868-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Integration of proviral HIV-1 DNA occurs preferentially into transcriptional units of active genes, whereas the oncoretrovirus murine leukemia virus shows integration preference near the transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes (23Schroder A.R.

Science. 2003; 300: 1749-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). The differences observed between the integration profiles of these two viruses strongly suggest that cellular cofactors actively tether proviral DNA to specific regions of the genome (25Bushman F.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).SNF5/Ini1 was the first host protein identified as an IN-interacting factor by two-hybrid screenings (8Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). SNF5/Ini1 is one of the core subunits of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF that regulates expression of numerous eukaryotic genes by altering DNA/histone interactions (26Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 27Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). This complex was recently shown to be directly involved in Tat-mediated activation of HIV-1 transcription (28Treand C. du Chene I. Bres V. Kiernan R. Benarous R. Benkirane M. Emiliani S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1690-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Mahmoudi T. Parra M. Vries R.G. Kauder S.E. Verrijzer C.P. Ott M. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19960-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Moreover, SNF5/Ini1 was found to act as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in children with Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor (30Versteege I. Sevenet N. Lange J. Rousseau-Merck M.F. Ambros P. Handgretinger R. Aurias A. Delattre O. Nature. 1998; 394: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Further studies have shown that SNF5/Ini1 regulates cell proliferation by inhibiting activation of E2F-dependent genes through the p16ink4a-CDK4/Cyclin D-Rb pathway (reviewed in Ref. 31Imbalzano A.N. Jones S.N. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 294-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that, through the same pathway, SNF5/Ini1 controls chromosomal stability (32Vries R.G. Bezrookove V. Zuijderduijn L.M. Kia S.K. Houweling A. Oruetxebarria I. Raap A.K. Verrijzer C.P. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). SNF5/Ini1 was also found to interact with viral proteins such as Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 2 (EBNA2) (33Wu D.Y. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Schubach W.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human papillomavirus E1 (34Lee D. Sohn H. Kalpana G.V. Choe J. Nature. 1999; 399: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar) as well as cellular proteins ALL1 (35Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Rozovskaia T. Burakov D. Sedkov Y. Tillib S. Blechman J. Nakamura T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22330-22337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).The exact role of SNF5/Ini1 in HIV-1 replication remains unclear. Recombinant SNF5/Ini1 stimulates IN catalytic activity in vitro (8Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, a cytoplasmic fragment of SNF5/Ini1 was able to interact with IN in the context of the Gag-pol precursor and in addition was reported to inhibit viral particle production, suggesting a role during the late stage of HIV-1 replication (38Yung E. Sorin M. Pal A. Craig E. Morozov A. Delattre O. Kappes J. Ott D. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SNF5/Ini1 was shown to be packaged in HIV-1, but not HIV-2 or simian immunodeficiency virus, viral particles (39Yung E. Sorin M. Wang E.J. Perumal S. Ott D. Kalpana G.V. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2222-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been observed that HIV-1 infection induces the cytoplasmic relocation of SNF5/Ini1 along with PML, leading to their association with incoming PIC before nuclear migration (40Turelli P. Doucas V. Craig E. Mangeat B. Klages N. Evans R. Kalpana G. Trono D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1245-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, the cytoplasmic accumulation of PML observed after retroviral infection is independent of the presence of SNF5/Ini1 (41Boese A. Sommer P. Gaussin A. Reimann A. Nehrbass U. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a direct effect of PML on HIV-1 infectivity was recently challenged (42Berthoux L. Towers G.J. Gurer C. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Luban J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3167-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has also been postulated that SNF5/Ini1 could target PICs to regions of the genome that are enriched for the SWI/SNF complex (43Greene W.C. Peterlin B.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Using siRNA-mediated silencing of SNF5/Ini1 expression, we found that SNF5/Ini1 impairs early steps of HIV-1 replication by inhibiting formation of 2-LTR circle and integrated forms of viral DNA. We show that a single amino acid change, K71R, in integrase that reduces its ability to interact with SNF5/Ini1 leads to an increase in viral infectivity. Our results highlight the role of the interaction between SNF5/Ini1 and the incoming IN during early steps of the HIV-1 life cycle.MATERIALS AND METHODSIntegrase Mutant Library—Yeast two-hybrid screening procedures were performed as previously described (14Emiliani S.

To generate the envelope-deleted NL4-3 vector (NL4-3Δenv), a frameshift was introduced in the env gene. The NdeI site (nt6399) in pNL4-3 was digested, filled with Klenow, and religated. Wild-type and mutant integrases were inserted into bacterial expression vector pET15b (Novagene). GST-SNF5/Ini1 was constructed by PCR amplification from the SNF5/Ini1 expression vector (28Treand C. du Chene I. Bres V. Kiernan R. Benarous R. Benkirane M. Emiliani S.

HeLa P4.2 cells were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Jurkat and A3.01 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin; Invitrogen). A3.01 cells were transfected by nucleofection using the AMAXA cell line, Nucleofector Kit V, and program T014 following the manufacturer's instructions.Virus stocks were produced by transfecting human embryonic kidney 293 cells using the calcium phosphate method with pBru-derived molecular clone. Single-round virus stocks were produced by co-transfecting pNL4-3Δenv with vesicular stomatitus virus-glycoprotein (VSV-G) envelope expression vector. Supernatants were collected 2 days after transfection, and levels of HIV-1 p24 antigen were monitored by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (BD Biosciences). Jurkat cells were infected with viral doses corresponding to 30 ng of HIV-1 p24 antigen/106 cells.siRNA Knockdown Experiments—SNF5/Ini1 siRNAs (SNF5.1, GAGAUACCCCUCACUCUGGTT, and SNF5.3, GAACUCACCAGAGAAGUUUTT) and control siRNAs (SNF5inv, GGUCUCACUCCCCAUAGAGTT, and GL2, CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGATT) were synthesized by Eurogentec and annealed following the manufacturer's instructions. Jurkat T cells (2 × 106) were washed with PB-sucrose (phosphate-buffered sucrose buffer: 7 mm sodium phosphate, 272 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2) and then electroporated with siRNA at 1 mm with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II electroporator with an RF module (100 V, modulation 50%, 25 kHz, 10 bursts of 2 ms, burst interval 100 ms). HeLa or HeLa P4.2 cells were transfected twice at 24 h intervals with 10 or 30 nm siRNA using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using the NuPAGE Bis-Tris Electrophoresis System (Invitrogen) and revealed by Western blotting.Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-SNF5 (raised against a synthetic peptide representing amino acids 370-386 of SNF5/Ini1 (HRNTRRMRRLANTGPAW), mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin (clone DM 1A; Sigma). Secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse or rabbit immunoglobulins were purchased from Dako.Quantification of Total HIV-1 DNA, 2-LTR Circles, and Integrated HIV-1 DNA—HeLa cells (2 × 105) were transfected with 30 nm siRNA. 24 h later, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped Bru virus (multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) corresponding to 0.1). At different times postinfection cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and treated for 1 h at 37 °C with 500 units of DNaseI (Roche Diagnostics) prior to DNA extraction using a QIAamp blood DNA mini kit (Qiagen). Quantifications were performed by real-time PCR on a LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics). Sequences of primers and probes have been described previously (14Emiliani S. Mousnier A. Busschots K.

Copy numbers of total DNA, 2-LTR circle forms, and integrated DNA were determined in reference to standard curves prepared by amplification of cloned DNA with matching sequences (44Brussel A. Sonigo P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Results were normalized by the number of cells and the amount of cellular DNA quantified by PCR of the β-globin gene according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins and in Vitro Integration Assays—Recombinant GST-SNF5/Ini1 and N-terminal His-tagged IN were produced in Escherichia coli BL21. E. coli transformed with GST-SNF5/Ini1 expression plasmid were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h to induce protein expression. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in GST-lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% IGEPAL, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture) (Sigma), and 1 mg/ml lysozyme was added. Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze and thaw and then sonicated for 30 s. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed four times with GST-lysis buffer and then twice with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 17% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). GST-SNF5/Ini1 was eluted from the resin in buffer B containing 25 mm reduced glutathione for 10 min at room temperature. His-IN mutants were purified by nickel affinity as previously described (45Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F.

Oligonucleotide substrates for IN reaction assays were as follows: U5B (5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT-3′), U5B-2 (5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA-3′), and U5A (3′-CACACCTTTTAGAGATCGTCA-5′). U5B or U5B-2 oligonucleotides were 32P labeled using polynucleotide kinase and annealed to the complementary U5A oligonucleotide. IN activity reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2. 3′-processing reactions were performed in the presence of 1.25 nm blunt IN substrate U5B/U5A. Strand transfer reactions were performed in the presence of 6.25 nm U5B-2/U5A substrate. 32P-labeled duplex DNAs were incubated in 20 μl of reaction buffer with 200, 400, or 600 nm integrase at 37 °C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by adding 80 μlof a stop solution (7 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). IN was extracted with phenol/chloroform. DNA fragments were ethanol precipitated, suspended in a loading dye, and separated on 18% polyacrylamide denaturing gels. Gels were analyzed on a STORM 840® PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare).Homogenous Time-resolved Fluorescence Assays (HTRF)— Assays were carried out in a black 384-halfwell microplate (Greiner) using the following assay buffer: 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 800 mm KF, 0.44 mm CHAPS, 10 μm ZnCl, and 5 mm MgCl. Anti-GST cryptate (lot 49F) and anti-His-XL (lot 33F) from CisBio International were reconstituted as recommended. Protein concentrations and buffer conditions were previously optimized to result in an optimal signal. Consequently, recombinant His-tagged integrases were used at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, whereas GST-SNF5/Ini1 was at 0.25 μg/ml. After addition of the interacting proteins and both antibodies on ice, the microplate was kept at 4 °C and read every 30 min in a Pherastar (BMG) at 665 and 620 nm after excitation at 337 nm. All points were in quadruplicate. The specific HTRF signal was expressed as a percentage of Δ F and calculated as follows: Δ F (%) = {[(665/620) sample - (665/620) blank]/(665/620) blank} × 100.RESULTSTransient Inhibition of SNF5/Ini1 Expression Stimulates HIV-1 Replication—To evaluate the importance of SNF5/Ini1 for viral replication, we first used RNA interference to knock down SNF5/Ini1 expression in different cell lines before infection with HIV-1 was performed. Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with siRNA directed against SNF5/Ini1 (SNF5.1)or control siRNA (GL2). Expression of SNF5/Ini1 was greatly reduced 48 h after treatment with SNF5.1 siRNA but not with GL2 siRNA, whereas the expression of tubulin was similar in both conditions (Fig. 1A, lower panel). When compared with cells treated with control siRNA, HIV-1 replication was stimulated up to 3-fold when SNF5/Ini1 expression was inhibited (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Because of the transient effect of siRNA, the increase in HIV-1 replication upon SNF5/Ini1 knock down was optimal at day 3. In a single-round assay using HeLa P4.2 reporter cells, silencing of SNF5/Ini1 gene expression using two different siRNA (SNF5.1 or SNF5.3, Fig. 1B, lower panel) enhanced infection of NL4-3Δenv virus pseudotyped with VSV-G by 3- to 4-fold (Fig. 1B, upper panel). These results indicate that inhibition of SNF5/Ini1 expression enhances early steps of HIV-1 replication. As expected, HeLa cells transfected with two different doses of SNF5.3 siRNA also showed a 2-fold increase in transduction efficiency of an HIV-1 GFP reporter gene vector (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the converse effect was observed. When SNF5/Ini1 was transiently overexpressed in A3.01 cells, HIV-1 replication was reduced ∼3-fold 24 h postinfection. Overexpression of SNF5/Ini1 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4C). All together, these data suggested that SNF5/Ini1 could negatively regulate an early step of HIV-1 replication.FIGURE 4K71R mutation increases viral infectivity. A, infectivity of HIV-1WT, HIV-1E69G, and HIV-1K71R was measured in a single-cycle assay on HeLa P4.2 cells and was normalized for the amount of p24 viral antigen of the virus stocks. Values are expressed as percentages of HIV-1WT and represent the means and standard deviation of three independent experiments. B, Jurkat cells were infected with HIV-1WT, HIV-1E69G, and HIV-1K71R, (25 ng of p24 antigen/106 cells), and viral accumulation was quantified by measuring p24 antigen in the supernatant of the cells. Values represent the means and standard deviation of three independent experiments. C, transient overexpression of SNF5/Ini1 impairs HIV-1 replication. A3.01 cells were transfected with control or HA-SNF5/Ini1 expression plasmids. Cells were infected with HIV-1WT or HIV-1K71R (m.o.i. 10−3), and 24 h postinfection viral accumulation was quantified by measuring p24 antigen in the supernatant of the cells. Errors bars represent standard deviation of three experiments. Ratio of p24 in HA-SNF5/Ini1 versus control cells is indicated for each virus. SNF5/Ini1 overexpression in these cells was detected 24 h after transfection by Western blotting of cell lysates using anti-HA antibody, or anti-tubulin antibody as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Accumulation of 2-LTR Circles and Integrated HIV DNA Forms in SNF5/Ini1 Knockdown Cells—Because we observed that inhibition of SNF5/Ini1 expression led to an increase in HIV-1 replication, we next assessed which step in the virus life cycle is affected by SNF5/Ini1. We monitored the levels of total DNA, 2-LTR circles, and integrated forms of proviral HIV-1 DNA by quantitative PCR on cell extract from HeLa cells transfected with either siRNA control or siRNA against SNF5/Ini1 (SNF5.3). SNF5/Ini1 expression was efficiently inhibited 24 h after siRNA transient transfection (Fig. 2A). Cells were then infected with HIV-1 Bru pseudotyped with VSV-G envelope (m.o.i. 0.1) and harvested at 3, 9, 24, and 48 h postinfection. In HeLa cells, HIV-1 replication was restricted to a single round of infection. Levels of total HIV cDNA synthesis peaked at 9 h postinfection and were similar in cells treated with either control or SNF5.3 siRNA. This amount remained higher at 24 and 48 h postinfection in cells where SNF5/Ini1 was inhibited (Fig. 2B). As expected, total HIV cDNA was barely detectable when infected cells were treated with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, indicating that the quantitative PCR quantified de novo synthesized HIV cDNA. Interestingly, a 3- to 4-fold increase in 2-LTR circle forms was observed at 24 h postinfection in cells knocked down for SNF5/Ini1 (Fig. 2C). In addition, a 3- to 4-fold increase in the amount of integrated proviral DNA was also observed when SNF5/Ini1 expression was inhibited (Fig. 2D). S"

Deletions of the C terminus differentially impact the two functions of the enzyme in splicing and aminoacylation in vivo. Herein, we determined that a fiveamino acid C-terminal deletion of LeuRS, which does not complement a null strain, can form a ternary complex with the bI4 intron and its maturase splicing partner. However, the complex fails to stimulate splicing activity. The x-ray co-crystal structure of LeuRS showed that a C-terminal extension of about 60 amino acids forms a discrete domain, which is unique among the LeuRSs and interacts with the corner of the L-shaped tRNALeu. Interestingly, deletion of the entire yeast mitochondrial LeuRS C-terminal domain enhanced its aminoacylation and amino acid editing activities. In striking contrast, deletion of the corresponding C-terminal domain of Escherichia coli LeuRS abolished aminoacylation of tRNALeu and also amino acid editing of mischarged tRNA molecules. These results suggest that the role of the leucine-specific C-terminal domain in tRNA recognition for aminoacylation and amino acid editing has adapted differentially and with surprisingly opposite effects. We propose that the secondary role of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS in RNA splicing has impacted the functional evolution of this critical C-terminal domain.

We propose that the secondary role of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS in RNA splicing has impacted the functional evolution of this critical C-terminal domain. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase is one of 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that are responsible for linking tRNA with its correct amino acid during protein synthesis (1Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 36-46Google Scholar). In the yeast mitochondria, it is also critical for enabling splicing of the bI4 and aI4α introns from the cob and cox1α genes, respectively (2Herbert C.J. Labouesse M. Dujardin G. Slonimski P.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Labouesse M. Netter P. Schroeder R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4Labouesse M.

LeuRS 4The abbreviation used is: LeuRS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase.4The abbreviation used is: LeuRS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase. forms a ternary complex with the bI4 maturase to confer splicing activity to the group I intron (5Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 1882-1894Google Scholar). LeuRSs from other organisms effectively substitute for the yeast mitochondrial LeuRS in null strains, suggesting that its role in splicing is aided by ancient adaptations of LeuRS that are universally conserved (6Houman F. Rho S.B. Zhang J. Shen X. Wang C.C. Schimmel P. Martinis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). LeuRSs are class IA tRNA synthetases (7Cusack S. Hartlein M. Leberman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3489-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 8Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar) that contain a catalytic core composed of a Rossmann nucleotide-binding fold (9Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Branden C.I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar). Similar to other synthetases, its N-terminal canonical core is appended to a second C-terminal domain that is less conserved (10Martinis S.A. Schimmel P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1996: 887-901Google Scholar, 11Burbaum J.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, unlike other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the C-terminal domain of LeuRS does not interact with the anticodon for recognition of its cognate tRNA (12Larkin D.C. Williams A.M. Martinis S.A. Fox G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2103-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Asahara H. Himeno H. Tamura K. Hasegawa T. Watanabe K. Shimizu M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Rather, a C-terminal extension of about 60 amino acids folds into a unique domain that is tethered via a flexible linker and interacts with the corner of the L-shaped tRNA (14Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Specifically, the C-terminal domain of Thermus thermophilus LeuRS makes significant contacts with the G19:C56 tertiary base pair of the tRNA (14Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the absence of tRNALeu, this small unique C-terminal domain was disordered in the LeuRS apo-crystal structure (15Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C-terminal domain has been shown to decrease aminoacylation activity of LeuRS (14Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Zheng Y.G. Wei H. Ling C. Martin F. Eriani G. Wang E.D.

Mutational analysis has also demonstrated that the C terminus is required for LeuRS splicing activity (6Houman F. Rho S.B. Zhang J. Shen X. Wang C.C. Schimmel P. Martinis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Li G.Y. Becam A.M. Slonimski P.P. Herbert C.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 667-675PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of synthetases to their cognate tRNAs depends on identity elements found within the tRNA (19Giegé R.S.M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). For tRNALeu, the unpaired base at A73 appears to be the primary identity element required for base-specific recognition by LeuRS (12Larkin D.C. Williams A.M. Martinis S.A. Fox G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2103-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Asahara H. Himeno H. Tamura K. Hasegawa T. Watanabe K. Shimizu M. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 263: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, recognition by LeuRS also depends on the tRNA tertiary structure, particularly in the D-loop region (12Larkin D.C. Williams A.M. Martinis S.A. Fox G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2103-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Normanly J. Ollick T. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5680-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, the triple interaction between A15:U48-A20a, and the invariants G18 and G19 are important for recognition of tRNALeu (13Asahara H. Himeno H. Tamura K. Hasegawa T. Watanabe K. Shimizu M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Asahara H. Nameki N. Hasegawa T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this C-terminal domain of LeuRS may be important for RNA binding and recognition and constructed deletion mutants for yeast mitochondrial and Escherichia coli LeuRS. Complementation experiments show that the C terminus is critical to the LeuRS splicing activity (18Li G.Y. Becam A.M. Slonimski P.P. Herbert C.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 667-675PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that this unique domain of LeuRS has adapted differentially for aminoacylation. We propose that the role of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS in splicing impacts the adaptation of the C terminus to optimally accommodate both its splicing and aminoacylation roles. Materials—Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by MWG Biotech (High Point, NC). Tritium-labeled amino acids were acquired from Amersham Biosciences. T4 DNA ligase was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). DpnI was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Cloned Pfu DNA polymerase and dNTP mix were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). His-Select™ Resin from Sigma was used for protein purification. RNA-dependent Two-hybrid Assays—Yeast two-hybrid cells were grown on solid agarose synthetic medium (Ura-, His-, Trp-) containing 2% galactose, 1% raffinose, and 20 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). β-Galactosidase assays and reverse transcription-PCR analysis were carried out as described previously (5Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 1882-1894Google Scholar). Protein Mutagenesis and Purification—A BamHI restriction site was introduced into the plasmid p15ec3-1 (24Martinis S.A. Fox G.E. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 36: 125-128PubMed Google Scholar), encoding the wild-type E. coli LeuRS using primers EcLeuRS-ΔC-Fwd (5′-GCG ATG GTG GAA TAA GGA TCC GAC TCC ACG CTG GTC G-3′) and EcLeuRS-ΔC-Rev (5′-CGA CCA GCG TGG AGT CGG ATC CTT ATT CCA CCA TCG C-3′)by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. Likewise, for deletion mutagenesis of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS, a SalI restriction site was introduced into the plasmid pYM3-17 (5Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 1882-1894Google Scholar) encoding the wild-type yeast mitochondrial LeuRS by site-directed PCR mutagenesis, using primers yMLRS-ΔC-Fwd (5′-CGC ACT ACT GAG TCC TAA GTC GAC AAA TTC AAA AAG TTT C-3′) and yMLRS-ΔC-Rev (5′-GAA ACT TTT TGA ATT TGT CGA CTT AGG ACT CAG TAG TGC G-3′). Each 50-μl PCR reaction contained 25 ng of plasmid DNA, 10 pmol of each forward and reverse primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1× Pfu DNA polymerase buffer (Stratagene), and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase. The template DNA from each PCR reaction was restriction digested by 20 units of DpnI prior to transformation of E. coli DH5α (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA from the selected transformant was isolated using a Qiaprep mini-prep spin kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme. A fragment of about 180 bases confirmed the insertion of the restriction site. The backbone vector was gel-purified using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and then religated in a 10-μl reaction using 3 units of T4 DNA ligase. The DNA sequences of the mutated LeuRS gene were confirmed by DNA sequencing (SeqWright, Houston, TX). Plasmids expressing the wild-type and mutant E. coli LeuRS were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and incubated at 37 °C overnight. A single cell transformant was transferred to a test tube containing 3 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and again incubated at 37 °C overnight. A 500-ml LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated using the entire 3-ml overnight culture and incubated by shaking at 37 °C. When the A600 increased to between 0.6 and 0.8, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C to express LeuRS. The recombinant yeast mitochondrial proteins were essentially expressed using the same procedures, with the exception that the transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus cells were grown and induced at 30 °C. The cells were then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 15 min in a Beckman J2-HS centrifuge with a JA-17 rotor. The cell pellets were collected and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer HA1 (10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm sodium Pi, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) and then sonicated at 60 A for 1 min using a Sonics Vibra Cell (Sonics, Newtown, CT). The sonication was repeated, and the cells were centrifuged in the Beckman JS-HS at 4 °C at 6 750 × g for 15 min. Approximately 10 ml of lysate was added to 2 ml of His-Select™ resin that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer HA1. The resin was mixed at 4 °C for 1 h followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed and stored. The resin was washed once with 10 ml of HA2 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm sodium Pi, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) followed by centrifugation and supernatant removal. The supernatant was reloaded onto the resin and mixed at 4 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation to remove the supernatant. The resin was washed a total of five times with 10 ml of HA2 buffer and centrifuged. The LeuRS with the six-histidine tag was eluted by mixing the resin with 1 ml of elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm sodium Pi, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 200 mm imidazole). The purified protein was concentrated using a Centricon-50 (Amicon, Bedford, MA). The final concentration of the protein was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay as described in the commercial protocol. T7 RNA Polymerase Transcription of tRNALeu—The plasmid ptDNAleu14 containing the gene of E. coli tRNALeuUAA and plasmid pymtDNAleu1 containing the gene of yeast mitochondrial tRNALeuUAA were digested with BstNI. The reaction was incubated overnight at 60 °C and the digested plasmid analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The product of the BstNI digest was used as a template for in vitro transcription reactions containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 30 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 40 units of Prime RNase inhibitor (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY), 8 μg/ml pyrophosphatase (Sigma), 5mm spermidine, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP at 7.5 mm each, 80 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, 60 μg/ml template, and 0.21 mg/ml T7 RNA polymerase (25Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar, 26Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 6 h. The RNA product was precipitated by ethanol, washed twice with cold 70% ethanol by centrifugation, and vacuum-dried. The RNA was resuspended and purified on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel that contained 8 m urea. The RNA bands were detected by UV shadowing, excised, crushed, and then incubated overnight with shaking at 37 °C in 0.5 m NH4OAC and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The procedure was repeated twice. The supernatant was collected, combined, and filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter. Butanol extractions were used to concentrate the RNA solution to 500 μl followed by the addition of 10 μl of 25 mg/ml glycogen and 1 ml of ethanol for an overnight precipitation at −80 °C. The tRNA pellet was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and vacuum-dried. The concentration of tRNA was determined by absorbance at 260 nm using the extinction coefficient of 840,700 liters/mol·cm for E. coli tRNALeuUAA and 878,500 liters/mol·cm for yeast mitochondrial tRNALeuUAA (27Puglisi J.D. Tinoco Jr., I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Purified tRNALeuUAA was denatured at 80 °C for 1 min followed by the addition of 1 mm MgCl2 and quick-cooling on ice. Aminoacylation Assays—Each aminoacylation reaction contained 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μm folded tRNALeu, 21 μm l-[3H]leucine (150 μCi/ml), and 50 nm enzyme. Kinetic rate constants were measured using six different tRNALeu concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 25 μm. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 4 mm ATP and then quenched at specific time points by transferring to filter pads (Whatman) that had been presoaked with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The pads were washed three times with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with 70% ethanol, each washing for 10 min. The pads were dried by soaking in ether and then under an ultra-red lamp. Each pad was transferred into a 20-ml scintillation vial and quantitated using a Beckman LS6000IC scintillation counter. Alternatively, acid gel analysis for each aminoacylation reaction was carried out using the conditions described above, except that 1.2 mm l-[14C]leucine (19 μCi/ml) was substituted for l-[3H]leucine. A 10-μl aliquot of the aminoacylation reaction was quenched with an equal volume of 30 mm NaOAC, pH 5.0, and 8 m urea. An 8-μl aliquot of each quenched reaction was separated by electrophoresis on a 10% acidic acrylamide gel that had been pre-equilibrated in 25 mm NaOAC, pH 5.0. Each sample was electrophoresed at 5 mA overnight or for ∼20 h. The gel was dried and phosphorimaged using a Fuji BAS 1000 phosphorimaging screen (Fujifilm Medical Systems, Stamford, CT) and quantified by a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX. Inorganic Pyrophosphate (PPi) Exchange Assay—A 21-μl reaction contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm [32P]PPi (2.5 μCi/ml), and 1 mm l-leucine was initiated with 100 nm enzyme. Aliquots were quenched on polyethyleneimine TLC plates (Scientific Adsorbents, Atlanta, GA) that had been pre-run in water. The TLC plates were developed in 750 mm KH2PO4, pH 3.5, and 4 m urea at 25 °C. Separated radiolabeled bands were detected by phosphorimaging as described above. Hydrolytic Editing Assays—Hydrolytic editing assays were carried out at room temperature in 60 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.8 μm [3H]Ile-tRNALeu. The reactions were initiated with 100 nm enzyme. At specific time points, 5-μl aliquots were spotted onto filter pads and washed as described previously (28Mursinna R.S. Lincecum Jr., T.L.

Circular Dichroism—CD measurement was carried out using the Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. A sample containing 0.8 μm protein in 5 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, was measured in the far-ultraviolet region using an 0.1-cm path cell. Background signals from the cell and the buffer were subtracted from each spectrum. A C-terminal Deletion Affects Splicing Complex Assembly and RNA Splicing Activity—Previously, we determined that yeast mitochondrial LeuRS and bI4 maturase simultaneously bind to the bI4 intron and stimulate splicing activity using an RNA-dependent two-hybrid assay (5Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 1882-1894Google Scholar). In addition, complementation assays have shown that a five-amino acid deletion of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS (18Li G.Y. Becam A.M. Slonimski P.P. Herbert C.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 667-675PubMed Google Scholar) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis LeuRS (6Houman F. Rho S.B. Zhang J. Shen X. Wang C.C. Schimmel P. Martinis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) abolish splicing activity but maintain protein synthesis. We used the RNA-dependent two-hybrid assay to test a five-amino acid truncation at the C terminus of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS (ΔC5) that was fused to the B42 activation domain and found that it forms a stable ternary complex with the bI4 intron and bI4 maturase. Fig. 1A shows that colonies develop a blue color because of an intracellular β-galactosidase reporter activity when the wild-type or five-amino acid C-terminal deletion is co-expressed with maturase and the bI4 intron. RNA isolated from the cells that exhibited ternary complex formation was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR to identify spliced product (Fig. 1B). However, even though the yeast mitochondrial LeuRS ΔC5 mutant binds to the bI4 intron, the assembled splicing complex fails to support splicing activity, which is consistent with its lack of complementation activity. Thus, although the ternary complex assembles, it is not competent to support splicing activity. Deletion of the C-terminal Domain Differentially Affects LeuRS from Different Origins—The co-crystal structure of T. thermophilus LeuRS with its tRNA bound was recently solved (14Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). In the presence of tRNA, a folded C-terminal domain of 60 amino acids, which is linked to the canonical aminoacylation body of the LeuRS via a tether, binds to the D-loop of tRNALeu. This domain was disordered in previous LeuRS structures that lacked tRNA (15Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 32Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grøtli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The co-crystal structure of T. thermophilus LeuRS also revealed RNA-protein interactions between the LeuRS C-terminal domain and the conserved G19:C56 tertiary corner of the tRNA (Fig. 2B). The primary sequence alignment of the LeuRS C-terminal domain exhibits significant homology (Fig. 2C). This suggests that a similarly folded domain is common to the LeuRSs and may be important to their function. Based on this new crystal structure information, we designed deletion mutants to eliminate the entire C-terminal domain of E. coli and yeast mitochondrial LeuRSs and test for effects on their protein synthesis activities. The C-terminal domains of the E. coli and yeast mitochondrial enzymes were truncated after Glu797 and Ser828, respectively (Fig. 2C), leaving two amino acids from the end of a helix in the main body marked by Leu812 in the T. thermophilus LeuRS. Wild-type E. coli and yeast mitochondrial LeuRS as well as their deletion mutants were expressed with a fused N-terminal six-histidine tag and purified by affinity chromatography. Deletion of the E. coli LeuRS C-terminal domain nearly abolished leucylation of E. coli tRNALeu (Fig. 3A). In contrast, when the C-terminal domain from yeast mitochondrial LeuRS was deleted, its aminoacylation activity was significantly enhanced compared with the wild-type yeast enzyme. Likewise, in aminoacylation reactions with yeast mitochondrial tRNALeu, both the E. coli and yeast mitochondrial LeuRS deletion mutants showed similar results (Fig. 3B). Deletion of the unique C-terminal domain increased the leucylation activity of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS but eliminated activity for E. coli LeuRS. Acid gel analysis of the charged E. coli and yeast mitochondrial tRNA products confirmed the opposing species-specific effects on aminoacylation activity (Fig. 3, C and D). These results support the proposition that the effects were not correlated to the cognate tRNA origins per se but broadly affected RNA interactions. PPi exchange activity was measured directly by separating 32P-containing ATP and PPi on TLC plates. Each of the C-terminal deletion mutants exhibited similar PPi exchange activities compared with the respective wild-type enzymes (Fig. 4). Although the PPi exchange activity for the yeast mitochondrial LeuRS is weak compared with the E. coli enzyme, it is appreciable and overlaps for both the wild-type and C-terminal deletion mutant of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS. Thus, the active site catalytic core of the E. coli and yeast mitochondrial LeuRS that is responsible for amino acid activation appears to be largely unaffected by the deletion of the C-terminal domain. We examined the yeast mitochondrial LeuRS wild-type and C-terminal domain deletion mutant by CD. Interestingly, Fig. 5 shows that the absence of the C-terminal domain yielded a protein that exhibits more α-helical character than the full-length wild-type LeuRS. Because the canonical class I core has similar activities for pyrophosphate exchange, we hypothesized that the structure of other more peripheral protein domains that are essential to transfer of the amino acid to tRNA may be impacted by the presence of the C-terminal domain in yeast mitochondrial LeuRS. It is also possible that these tRNA-binding domains cross-react in RNA splicing to interact with the group I intron. If this were the case, then evolutionary pressures could have forced the C-terminal domain or another region of the LeuRS that cooperates with the C-terminal domain to diverge in the yeast mitochondrial enzyme to accommodate its dual splicing and aminoacylation roles. We also tested each of the deletion mutants for E. coli and yeast mitochondrial LeuRS for post-transfer editing activity. As found for aminoacylation, the E. coli LeuRS C-terminal domain deletion mutant showed significantly decreased hydrolysis activity of the mischarged E. coli or yeast mitochondrial Ile-tRNALeu compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 6). In contrast, the yeast mitochondrial LeuRS C-terminal deletion showed a striking increase in hydrolysis activity of mischarged tRNA compared with its wild-type enzyme. The post-transfer editing active site is located within the CP1 domain and is separated from the amino acid activation site by nearly 40 Å (Fig. 2A) (32Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grøtli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Movement of the tRNA between the aminoacylation and editing active sites is clearly accompanied by the leucine-specific C-terminal domain that interacts with the core of the tRNA. Deletion of the C-terminal domain profoundly affects both aminoacylation and amino acid editing activity and in a similar manner for each LeuRS. However, the effects oppose each other for LeuRSs from different origins. The presence of the leucine-specific C-terminal domain aids E. coli LeuRS while appearing to impede yeast mitochondrial LeuRS protein synthesis activities. It is possible that evolutionary pressures from the dual role of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS in RNA splicing resulted in species-specific differences. Site-specific Mutational Analysis of the Leucine-specific C-terminal Domain—We mutationally scanned several conserved residues within E. coli LeuRS to identify specific sites that we hypothesized might be important to RNA-protein interactions between the C-terminal domain and tRNALeu (Fig. 2C and Table 1). These included conserved positively charged amino acids that could directly interact with the phosphate backbone of the tRNA. We also targeted specific sites based on the x-ray co-crystal structure of T. thermophilus LeuRS that appeared to be in close proximity to the bound tRNA.TABLE 1Apparent kinetic parameters of E. coli LeuRS wild-type and C-terminal domain mutantsMutationsKmkcatkcat/KmRelative kcat/KmμMs−1μM−1 s−1Wild-type1.1 ± 0.117 ± 515.11.0ΔCNMaNot measured because of low activity.NMaNot measured because of low activity.NMaNot measured because of low activity.NMaNot measured because of low activity.Q805A1.3 ± 0.211 ± 48.20.5N807A0.8 ± 0.311 ± 413.90.9Q805A/N807A1.0 ± 0.512 ± 512.40.8K809A1.4 ± 0.414 ± 39.90.7R811A5.8 ± 0.516 ± 52.70.2K846A1.3 ± 0.428 ± 121.81.5K846E3.0 ± 1.143 ± 614.20.9K853A2.1 ± 0.630 ± 1015.21.0K853E2.2 ± 0.743 ± 719.71.3K846A/K853A1.2 ± 0.217 ± 114.20.9K846E/K853E6.8 ± 0.272 ± 1210.60.7L854A1.0 ± 0.230 ± 329.72.0L855A1.4 ± 0.815 ± 810.40.7N856A0.3 ± 0.058.4 ± 1.828.01.9N807A/N856A0.3 ± 0.055.0 ± 0.716.71.1Q805A/N807A/N856A0.5 ± 0.16.6 ± 2.013.20.9a Not measured because of low activity. Open table in a new tab As shown in Table 1, mutations of the targeted sites to either alanine or glutamic acid in E. coli LeuRS resulted in minimal, if any, effects on aminoacylation activities. Leu-tRNALeu was formed with similar catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for each of the mutants compared with wild-type LeuRS. The greatest change was a 5-fold reduction in kcat/Km. The mutants outlined in Table 1 also failed to impact the post-transfer editing activity of mischarged tRNA molecules (data not shown). To more dramatically affect enzyme activity, we constructed double and triple mutants within the E. coli LeuRS, but these also showed only modest changes in kcat/Km. Interestingly, a double mutant that reversed the charge of two conserved lysines (Lys846 and Lys853) showed a significant increase in the kcat value that was compensated for by an increase in the Km for aminoacylation (Table 1). We also introduced two mutations into yeast mitochondrial LeuRS that we postulated would disrupt interactions with the tRNA based on the co-crystal structure of T. thermophilus LeuRS with its tRNA. However, mutations to alanine at Gln834 and Asn838 did not affect the protein synthesis activities (data not shown) as we have described above for the E. coli mutant enzymes. Thus, we propose that these conserved residues contribute primarily to folding and stabilization of the unique C-terminal domain. It is possible that interactions between the tRNA and LeuRS are not driven so much by specific atomic interactions as by more global features that conform to the overall bend at the corner of the L-shaped tRNA. In the case of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS, these RNA-protein interactions may have been optimized to accommodate RNA splicing. Chimeric Swapping of the C-terminal Domain Confers Wildtype-like Protein Synthesis Activities—The C-terminal domains of yeast mitochondrial and E. coli LeuRS were swapped. The chimeric enzyme that comprised the E. coli enzyme fused to the yeast mitochondrial LeuRS C-terminal domain (Ec ymCTD) retained significant aminoacylation activity in the presence of either yeast or E. coli tRNALeu (Fig. 7A). Likewise, the Ec ymCTD LeuRS chimera edited Ile-tRNALeu similar to the wildtype enzyme. Thus, the yeast mitochondrial C-terminal domain contains sufficient information to function in the context of the E. coli LeuRS to support its enzyme activities. Introduction of the E. coli C-terminal domain into the yeast mitochondrial LeuRS failed to significantly alter aminoacylation or editing activities. We hypothesize then that the C-terminal domain functions in concert with other domains or portion of the LeuRS enzyme, as postulated based on CD structural analysis above, to support both the yeast mitochondrial LeuRS RNA splicing and protein synthesis activities. LeuRS is essential to group I intron splicing and protein synthesis within the yeast mitochondria. Previous experiments showed that short C terminus truncations abolished splicing activity, whereas protein synthesis activity is maintained (6Houman F. Rho S.B. Zhang J. Shen X. Wang C.C. Schimmel P. Martinis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Li G.Y. Becam A.M. Slonimski P.P. Herbert C.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 667-675PubMed Google Scholar). We determined that a short truncation of just five amino acids, which fails to complement yeast null strains, can form a ternary complex with the bI4 intron and the bI4 maturase splicing partner. However, in the presence of the LeuRS truncation, the complex is not competent to induce splicing activity either in complementation assays or under yeast two-hybrid conditions. The x-ray co-crystal structure of T. thermophilus LeuRS bound to tRNA shows that a unique C-terminal domain interacts directly with the tRNA. We hypothesize that this conserved RNA-binding domain in yeast mitochondrial LeuRS also interacts with the bI4 intron and has co-evolved to accommodate both of the critical functions of the enzyme in splicing group I introns and aminoacylation of tRNA. We compared the protein synthesis activities using C-terminal deletion mutants of both E. coli and yeast mitochondrial LeuRS. In the absence of the C-terminal domain, both aminoacylation and editing activities of the E. coli LeuRS were abolished. Deletion of the C-terminal domain from various LeuRSs also impacts their aminoacylation activities (14Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Zheng Y.G. Wei H. Ling C. Martin F. Eriani G. Wang E.D.

In striking contrast, deletion of the yeast mitochondrial C-terminal domain clearly enhanced aminoacylation and editing activities. It is likely that as evolutionary pressures recruited and optimized LeuRS to carry out a secondary role in RNA processing, a region of the LeuRS that impacts the C-terminal domain, either directly or indirectly via an RNA mediator, adapted to maintain critical levels of aminoacylation for protein synthesis while optimizing splicing activity to express essential mitochondrial genes. This adaptation has resulted in functional divergence of the LeuRS C-terminal domain. Interestingly, the presence of the yeast mitochondrial C-terminal domain appears to impede significantly the editing activity in vitro, which could threaten the fidelity of protein synthesis. It is possible that the benefit of splicing the cob and cox1a genes in yeast mitochondria may outweigh the cost of an elevated level of misincorporation of amino acids during translation. Examples of editing aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from origins that lack editing activities include the human cytoplasmic ProRS, human mitochondrial LeuRS, and yeast mitochondrial PheRS. Each fails to hydrolyze mischarged tRNAs or misactivated adenylates (33Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Lue S.W. Kelley S.O.

Chem. 2005; 280: 38186-38192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For the human enzymes, it has been proposed that enhanced discrimination within the aminoacylation active site combined with low intracellular concentrations of noncognate amino acids that are below the Km of the enzyme apparently suffice to achieve fidelity levels that maintain mitochondrial and/or cellular functions. Previously, LeuRSs that originated from varied origins, including bacterial and human mitochondria, were shown to effectively complement yeast null strains (6Houman F. Rho S.B. Zhang J. Shen X. Wang C.C. Schimmel P. Martinis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains for other LeuRSs are clearly important for aminoacylation (14Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Zheng Y.G. Wei H. Ling C. Martin F. Eriani G. Wang E.D.

Although the yeast mitochondrial LeuRS is dependent on the C terminus for splicing activity, the presence of the C-terminal domain impedes its protein synthesis activities. Thus, it is clear that variations within LeuRS that impact the C-terminal domain can shift the aminoacylation, editing, and splicing function of LeuRS in a dramatic way that ranges from significant increases to limiting activity. These evolutionary shifts may have played an important role in conferring an essential secondary activity in splicing to yeast mitochondrial LeuRS, in addition to its original role in protein synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2155252651,"Bok/Mtd (Bcl-2-related ovarian killer/Matador) is considered a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Although identified in 1997, little is known about its biological role. We have previously demonstrated that Bok mRNA is up-regulated following E2F1 overexpression. In the current work, we demonstrate that Bok RNA is low in quiescent cells and rises upon serum stimulation. To determine the mechanism underlying this regulation, we cloned and characterized the mouse Bok promoter. We find that the mouse promoter contains a conserved E2F binding site (−43 to −49) and that a Bok promoter-driven luciferase reporter is activated by serum stimulation dependent on this site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that endogenous E2F1 and E2F3 associate with the Bok promoter in vivo. Surprisingly, we find that H1299 cells can stably express high levels of exogenous Bok protein. However, these cells are highly sensitive to chemotherapeutic drug treatment. Taken together these results demonstrate that Bok represents a cell cycle-regulated pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, which may predispose growing cells to chemotherapeutic treatment."

This aberrant protein deposition, triggered by a product of inflammation, may be common to other compounds that disrupt microtubules and induce protein aggregation, such as MPP+ and rotenone, found to be associated with neurodegeneration. Protein aggregates containing ubiquitinated proteins are detected in a variety of degenerative diseases. These diseases range from neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease, to liver diseases, such as Wilson disease and alcoholic hepatitis, to name a few (1Lowe J. Blanchard A. Morrell K. Lennox G. Reynolds L. Billett M. Landon M. Mayer R.J. J. Pathol. 1988; 155: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Whether these protein aggregates are pathogenic or represent a coping mechanism to prolong survival of the affected cells, including neurons and hepatocytes, is a hotly debated issue (2Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The protein aggregates, however, are indicative of a malfunction of the normal process of protein turnover because they are not prevalent in healthy cells.Most of these protein aggregates are detectable with antibodies that react with ubiquitinated proteins but their major structural components vary from cell type to cell type. For example, tau proteins are found in cortical neurofibrillary tangles, α-synuclein in dopaminergic Lewy bodies, and huntingtin in intranuclear inclusions of striatal projection neurons (reviewed in Ref. 3Alves-Rodrigues A. Gregori L. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 516-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Full characterization of the components and mechanisms leading to the formation of these protein aggregates is lacking.Notably, most of the diseases associated with the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in intracellular inclusions also exhibit signs of inflammation in the respective damaged areas (reviewed in Ref. 4Li Z.

For example, the levels of 15d-PGJ2, a PGJ2 metabolite, were found to be elevated in spinal cord motor neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (5Kondo M. Shibata T. Kumagai T. Osawa T.

All of these events are associated with neurodegeneration.We recently demonstrated that J2 prostaglandins induce the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins into distinct aggregates in neuronal cells (10Li Z.

To understand the mechanisms leading to the formation of these protein aggregates and to identify some of their components, we investigated the effects of PGJ2 on human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Herein, we show that PGJ2 damages the cytoskeletal structure. The ensuing microtubule disruption and ER collapse coincides with the formation of protein aggregates co-localized with the centrosome/microtubule organizing center (MTOC). In addition to ubiquitinated proteins, the PGJ2-induced aggregates contain calnexin, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and α-synuclein. Thus, products of inflammation, such as PGJ2, destabilize the microtubule network resulting in collapse of the ER and trigger the formation of protein aggregates containing ubiquitinated proteins. Most of the ubiquitinated proteins accumulate as insoluble aggregates. In conclusion, disruption of the microtubule and ER networks in conjunction with the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, both caused by PGJ2, may represent mechanisms shared by other inducers of protein aggregation associated with neurodegeneration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—PGJ2 was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Colchicine and brefeldin A were from Sigma. Kits to assess tubulin and actin polymerization were from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-COMT (1:500, from Chemicon Int., Temecula, CA), goat polyclonal anti-calnexin (C-20, 1:40), and anti-COX-1 (C-20, 1:1,000) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-actin (1:200, clone AC-20), and mouse monoclonal anti-γ-tubulin (1:200, clone GTU-88) from Sigma, rabbit polyclonal anti-α-tubulin (1:200) from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA), mouse monoclonal anti-α-synuclein (1:200) from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antiubiquitinated proteins (1:250) from Chemicon Int. (Temecula, CA) and Dako Cytomation (Carpinteria, CA), respectively, mouse monoclonal anti-α4 (1:500) and anti-S8 (1:1,000), both proteasome subunits, were obtained from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The respective secondary antibodies with fluorophores (1:50) were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA).Cell Cultures—SK-N-SH cells are a human neuroblastoma cell line derived from peripheral tissue (11Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained as described in Ref. 8Li Z. Jansen M. Ogburn K. Salvatierra L. Hunter L. Mathew S. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 824-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and were obtained from ATCC.Cell Treatments—SK-N-SH cell cultures were treated for the indicated times with vehicle (Me2SO) or with different concentrations of PGJ2 in Me2SO added directly to serum-containing medium. The final Me2SO concentration in the medium was 0.5%. At the end of the incubation, all cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and processed for the different assays as described below. Cell washes removed unattached cells, therefore subsequent assays were performed on adherent cells only.Immunofluorescence—After treatment SK-N-SH cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in ice-cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 10 min at −20 °C, and co-incubated with the antibodies listed in each figure. Slides were mounted with Vectashield medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cell staining was visualized with an OPTIPHOT-2 fluorescence microscope (NIKON, Melville, NY).In Vitro Tubulin and Actin Polymerization—Standard tubulin and actin polymerization assays were performed with kits from Cytoskeleton Inc. following the manufacturer's recommendations. Tubulin polymerization was assessed at 340 nm every 60-s with a temperature-regulated Power Wave 200™ microplate scanning spectrophotometer, Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc. (Winooski, VT). Actin polymerization was assessed at 365/407 nm every 60-s with a 650-10S Fluorescence Spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 Xenon Power Supply, PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Data were analyzed with KC4 Kineticalc for Windows, from Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.DTNB Assay for Free Tubulin Sulfhydryl Groups—Tubulin (3 μg/μl, 50 μl) in general tubulin buffer with 1 mm GTP was incubated under basal conditions with 5 μl of general tubulin buffer alone or containing Me2SO (1.5%), PGJ2 (273 or 545 μm), or PGE2 (545 μm) for 90 min, with gentle rocking at 37 °C. Free sulfhydryl groups were assessed with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) essentially as described in Ref. 12Landino L.M. Hasan R. McGaw A. Cooley S. Smith A.W. Masselam K. Kim G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. A standard curve with l-cysteine (10-20 nmol) was used to calculate the free sulfhydryls in the tubulin samples.Western Blotting—Western blot analysis was carried out by SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Samples were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer and loaded onto the gel (30 μg of protein/lane for total cell lysates, 5 μg of protein/lane for fractionation). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was probed with an antibody that reacts with poly-ubiquitinated proteins (1:1,500, from Dako Cytomation). When specified, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with the anti-COX-1 antibody. Antigens were visualized by a chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent. Semi-quantitative analysis of protein detection was done by image analysis with the Image PC program from NIH as described (13Pereira M.E. Yu B. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In-gel Proteasome Activity and Detection—Upon treatment with vehicle (Me2SO) or 15 μm PGJ2 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove extracellular prostaglandins and were then harvested with the following buffer A: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP (grade 1; Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Following homogenization the protein content of the cleared supernatants (determined with the Bradford assay) was adjusted to equal concentrations with buffer A. The cleared supernatants (15 μg of protein/lane for proteasome activity and 5 μg of protein/lane for Western blotting) were resolved by non-denaturing PAGE using a modification of the method described in Ref. 14Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. We used a four-gel layer consisting of equal amounts, from the bottom up, of 6, 5, 4, and 3% polyacrylamide with Rhinohide™ polyacrylamide strengthener (Molecular Probes). Bromphenol blue was added to the protein samples prior to loading. Non-denaturing minigels were run at 125 volts for 3 h. The gels were then incubated on a rocker for 30 min at 37 °C with 15 ml of 0.4 mm Suc-LLVY-AMC in buffer B (buffer A modified to contain 1 mm ATP only). Proteasome bands were visualized upon exposure to UV light (360 nm) and were photographed with a NIKON Cool Pix 8700 camera with a 3-4219 fluorescent green filter (Peca Products, Inc.). Proteins on the native gels were transferred (110 mA) for 2 h onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blot analyses were then carried out sequentially for detection of the 26 S and 20 S proteasomes with anti-α4 and anti-S8 subunit antibodies. The anti-α4 antibody reacts with a core particle subunit, and therefore detects both the 26 S and 20 S proteasomes. The anti-S8 antibody reacts with a regulatory particle subunit thus only detecting 26 S proteasomes. Antigens were visualized by a chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent.Subcellular Fractionation—After treatment for 24 h, SK-N-SH cells in 10-cm dishes (4.5 × 105 cells/ml) were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested by gently scraping into ice-cold homogenization buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, and 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Homogenization and subcellular fractionation were performed as described in Ref. 15Liu C.L. Ge P. Zhang F. Hu B.R. Neuroscience. 2005; 134: 1273-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar. Briefly, samples were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes) followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 1,000 × g to obtain the crude nuclear pellet (P1) and supernatant fraction (S1). S1 was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to collect the pellet (P2). The S2 supernatant was further centrifuged at 162,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman TL-100 (Palo Alto, CA) to collect the cytosolic fraction (S3) and the microsomal pellet (P3). The P2 pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 400 mm KCl, sonicated five times for 5 s each, washed on a shaker for 1 h followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g to obtain the Triton X-100-insoluble and Triton X-100-soluble fractions. The P1 and Triton X-100-insoluble pellets were re-suspended in denaturing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1% SDS, and 1 mm Na3VO4).Protein Concentration—Concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce) or the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).RESULTSPGJ2 Disrupts the Cytoskeleton Structure—To determine the effect of PGJ2 on the cytoskeleton we visualized two of its components, namely microtubules and actin filaments, by immunofluorescence analysis with anti-α-tubulin and anti-actin antibodies, respectively. We chose to treat cells with 15 μm PGJ2 for 24 h, because in our previous studies, these conditions clearly induced both accumulation and aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins as well as neuronal cell death (10Li Z. Melandri F. Berdo I. Jansen M. Hunter L. Wright S. Valbrun D. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 1171-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).In the absence of PGJ2, microtubules and actin filaments were intact, straight, and oriented parallel to the longest axis of the SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 1, A, B, and E). Upon treatment for 24 h with 15 μm PGJ2, the appearance of the microtubule network and actin filaments was altered. The microtubules were fragmented and displayed a circular arrangement surrounding the nucleus (Fig. 1, C and F) and the actin filaments exhibited an amorphous pattern (Fig. 1D). The shape of the cell complemented the change observed for the microtubule network. Control cells were elongated (Fig. 1, A, B, and E), whereas PGJ2-treated cells displayed a round to square shape (Fig. 1, C, D, and F).The alterations in microtubule appearance elicited by PGJ2 suggest that this product of inflammation affects microtubule polymerization. We thus investigated the effect of PGJ2 on the in vitro polymerization of highly purified (>99%) bovine brain tubulin at pH 6.9 and 37 °C, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effect of PGJ2 on microtubule assembly was determined as a function of time with a turbidimetric assay. The in vitro microtubule polymerization assay requires high tubulin concentrations (3 mg/ml or 54.5 μm) for turbidity assessment, thus we increased the PGJ2 concentrations in the in vitro assay, accordingly. Other compounds found to oxidize tubulin sulfhydryls, such as peroxynitrite, were tested at similar concentrations (12Landino L.M. Hasan R. McGaw A. Cooley S. Smith A.W. Masselam K. Kim G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Standard polymerization reactions in the absence of drug or solvent (crosses) or in the presence of 1.5% Me2SO (prostaglandin solvent, open triangles), or 545 μm PGE2 (solid triangles), or 273 and 545 μm PGJ2 (open and solid circles, respectively) are shown in Fig. 2A. The curves represent the average of two experiments. The Vmax for each curve is listed in Fig. 2B. Tubulin polymerizes with a Vmax of ∼5.5 milli-OD units per minute (mOD/min) in the general tubulin buffer plus GTP. Me2SO alone (1.5% final concentration) eliminates the nucleation phase of polymerization and enhances the Vmax of the growth (elongation) phase by ∼4-fold. Others have reported that Me2SO induces self-assembly of tubulin (16Himes R.H. Burton P.R. Gaito J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6222-6228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is not well characterized, it was suggested that solvents such as Me2SO alter the H2O structure around the tubulin dimers lowering the free energy of polymerization.FIGURE 2PGJ2 hinders microtubule polymerization and decreases the number of tubulin-free sulfhydryl groups. A, tubulin polymerization was assayed in general tubulin buffer (GTB) with 1 mm GTP and 2 mm magnesium chloride in the absence of drugs (crosses) or in the presence of Me2SO (1.5%, open triangles), PGE2 (545 μm, solid triangles), PGJ2 (273 μm, open circles; 545 μm, solid circles) at 37 °C in a 96-well plate. The increase in turbidity indicative of tubulin polymerization was monitored at 340 nm for ∼30 min. The results represent the means of two independent determinations. B, the Vmax (mOD/min) for each reaction was determined with the KC4 Kineticalc program. C, following incubation under the specified conditions, tubulin was denatured and its free sulfhydryls were assessed with DTNB. Absorbance was read at 412 nm. The results represent the mean ± S.E. of three determinations. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the presence of PGJ2 (in 1.5% Me2SO) tubulin polymerization was hindered as depicted by a significant decrease in Vmax and in levels of assembled microtubules when compared with Me2SO alone (Fig. 2, A and B). The Vmax was lowered by 28 and 43% by 273 and 545 μm PGJ2, respectively (Fig. 2B). PGE2, a prostaglandin that does not cause aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins, did not affect microtubule polymerization (Fig. 2, A and B).Prostaglandins of the J2 series are unique among the prostaglandin family as they contain α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups in their cyclopentenone ring (17Straus D.S. Glass C.K. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 185-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). One of these prostaglandins, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), was shown to induce cysteine-targeted protein oxidation in SH-SY5Y cells (18Ishii T. Uchida K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tubulin was one of the proteins that was identified as being S-oxidized in these cells. Microtubules are composed of the heterodimeric protein tubulin that contains 20 cysteines: 12 in the α- and 8 in the β-subunit (19Ponstingl H. Krauhs E. Little M. Kempf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2757-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 20Krauhs E. Little M. Kempf T. Hofer-Warbinek R. Ade W. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4156-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We thus reasoned that PGJ2 may hinder microtubule polymerization by inducing the S-oxidation of free sulfhydryl groups in tubulin. To test our hypothesis, we assessed the levels of free sulfhydryl groups in purified tubulin incubated in the absence and presence of PGJ2, using DTNB. This reagent forms a colored product measurable at 412 nm when it reacts with free sulfhydryl groups. Fig. 2C depicts the decrease in the levels of DTNB-reactive sulfhydryls in tubulin elicited by PGJ2 treatment. A 22 and 35% drop in free sulfhydryls was observed when tubulin was treated with 273 and 545 μm PGJ2, respectively. The decrease in free tubulin sulfhydryl groups induced by PGJ2 correlated well with its inhibition of microtubule polymerization (Fig. 2, A-C). No decline in free tubulin sulfhydryl groups was detected in the presence of 545 μm PGE2, a prostaglandin that does not contain α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups.PGJ2 also disrupted the structure of actin filaments in SK-N-SH cells. Thus we assessed the effect of PGJ2 on in vitro actin polymerization by pyrene fluorescent enhancement as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Me2SO alone (1.5% final concentration) slightly enhanced the Vmax of actin polymerization by ∼1.4-fold, when compared with general actin buffer (Fig. 3B). However, the levels of polymerized actin were not altered by Me2SO (Fig. 3A). In the presence of PGJ2 or PGE2 the Vmax and polymerized actin levels were equivalent to the ones observed for Me2SO and general actin buffer (Fig. 3, A and B). We thus conclude that PGJ2 failed to directly affect actin polymerization in this in vitro assay.FIGURE 3In vitro actin polymerization is not affected by PGJ2. A, actin polymerization was assessed in general actin buffer (GAB) with 0.2 mm ATP and 0.2 mm calcium chloride in the absence of drugs (crosses) or in the presence of Me2SO (1.5%, open triangles), or PGE2 (30 μm, solid triangles), or PGJ2 (30 μm, open circles; 545 μm, solid circles). Enhanced pyrene fluorescence, an indication of actin polymerization, was monitored at 365/407 nm for ∼20 min. The results represent the means of two independent determinations. B, the Vmax (OD/min) for each reaction was determined with the KC4 Kineticalc program.

Cytol. 2001; 205: 149-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microtubule disruption causes the ER to retract toward the nucleus (21Terasaki M. Chen L.B. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 22Baumann O. Walz B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 205: 149-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Because we observed that PGJ2 disrupts microtubule integrity, we investigated the effect of PGJ2 on ER morphology assessed by immunofluorescence analysis with an anti-calnexin antibody. Calnexin is a membrane-bound ER resident protein and under control conditions, it exhibits a uniform reticular distribution that extends from the nuclear envelope out to the periphery of the cell with a characteristic ER morphology (Fig. 4B). Similarly, immunofluorescence staining for COMT, an enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of catecholamines including dopamine, revealed its predominant ER localization (Fig. 4C). Calnexin and COMT are co-localized (Fig. 4D).FIGURE 4PGJ2 triggers the collapse of the ER and formation of protein aggregates. Immunofluorescence staining of SK-N-SH cells treated with vehicle only (Me2SO, A-D), 5 μm PGJ2 (E-H), or 15 μm PGJ2 (I-L) for 24 h. The ER was visualized by immunostaining for calnexin, an ER integral membrane protein (B, F, and J, fluorescein isothiocyanate) or with the anti-COMT antibody (C, G, and K, Texas Red). Nuclei (n) were detected with DAPI (A, E, and I). Merged images are shown for DAPI/COMT (A, E, and I) and for COMT/calnexin (D, H, and L). Arrows point to large calnexin/COMT aggregates. Scale bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The distribution of calnexin and COMT was altered by PGJ2 treatment. In cells treated for 24 h with 5 μm PJG2, calnexin and COMT immunoreactivity appeared less diffuse throughout the cells and was more concentrated around the nuclei (Fig. 4, F and G, merged in H). In cells treated with a higher PGJ2 concentration (15 μm) calnexin and COMT immunostaining emerged as a large perinuclear aggregate next to a nuclear indentation (Fig. 4, J and K, merged in L, arrows). This pattern of immunostaining suggests that the ER collapsed into a large perinuclear aggregate. The panels in Fig. 4 showing DAPI/COMT and COMT staining were previously published (23Ogburn K.D. Bottiglieri T. Wang Z. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Neurobiol.

In contrast, in vivo experiments in E. coli and its bacteriophages, in which maturation of replication intermediates was blocked, report discontinuous DNA synthesis of both the lagging and the leading strands. To address this discrepancy, we analyzed nascent DNA species from ThyA+ E. coli cells replicating their DNA in ligase-deficient conditions to block maturation of replication intermediates. We report here that the bulk of the newly synthesized DNA isolated from ligase-deficient cells have a length between 0.3 and 3 kb, with a minor fraction being longer that 11 kb but shorter than the chromosome. The low molecular weight of the replication intermediates is unchanged by blocking linear DNA processing with a recBCD mutation or by blocking uracil excision with an ung mutation. These results are consistent with the previously proposed discontinuous replication of the leading strand in E. coli.

These results are consistent with the previously proposed discontinuous replication of the leading strand in E. coli. Before the polarity of DNA strand extension was established, both DNA strands at the replication fork were thought to be synthesized continuously, being extended by two distinct DNA polymerases with opposite polarities (1Okazaki R.

Freeman and Co., San Francisco1978: 248-249Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The finding that DNA polymerases extend DNA strands only in the 5′ to 3′ direction (reviewed in Ref. 3Kornberg A. DNA Synthesis. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1974Google Scholar) made it clear that at least the DNA strand synthesized in the direction opposite to the one of the replication fork movement has to be replicated in pieces and then assembled (maturated) into a full-length molecule (4Iyer V.N. Lark K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5Okazaki R. Okazaki T. Sakabe K. Sugimoto K. Kainuma R. Sugino A. Iwatsuki N.

Since this strand could not be synthesized continuously, its synthesis would lag behind the apparently continuous synthesis of the opposite DNA strand, which would thus lead the replication fork progress. The two strands were eventually called the “lagging” and the “leading” strands, respectively, and the hypothetical difference in their synthesis formed the basis of the semidiscontinuous model of DNA replication (Fig. 1B) (7Alberts B. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1977; 269: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the semidiscontinuous paradigm is based on in vitro results and ignores a large body of in vivo data, which is reviewed below.Okazaki and colleagues (1Okazaki R. Okazaki T. Sakabe K.

Using alkaline (denaturing) sucrose gradients to separate replication intermediates from their template strands, Okazaki and colleagues observed that the newly synthesized DNA after 2–10 s of labeling migrated mostly as low molecular weight (LMW) 2The abbreviations used are: LMW, low molecular weight; HMW, high molecular weight; IMW, intermediate molecular weight.2The abbreviations used are: LMW, low molecular weight; HMW, high molecular weight; IMW, intermediate molecular weight. species, with a mean length between 1 and 2 kb (1Okazaki R.

A chase with nonradioactive thymidine shifted the label into high molecular weight (HMW) DNA, proving that the LMW species are true replication intermediates (5Okazaki R. Okazaki T. Sakabe K.

A. 1968; 60: 1356-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Gottesman M.M. Hicks M.L. Gellert M. Wells R.D. Inman R.B. DNA Synthesis in Vitro.

Not only was all DNA synthesized in LMW pieces in polA and ligA mutants, but it then stayed short for some time, indicating that both DNA polymerase I and DNA ligase are the maturation functions. Later it was demonstrated that in polA mutants (18Kurosawa Y. Ogawa T. Hirose S. Okazaki T. Okazaki R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and especially in rnhA polA double mutants (19Kitani T. Yoda K. Ogawa T. Okazaki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), some Okazaki fragments retain short RNA primers at their 5′ ends, which were predicted to provide the original 3′-OH for DNA polymerization (20Wickner W. Brutlag D. Schekman R. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At the same time, Yudelevich and colleagues showed that 1) in nondenaturing conditions, the bulk of the low molecular weight replication intermediates stay with the high molecular weight chromosomal DNA; 2) treatment with DNA polymerase I and DNA ligase in vitro turns the short pieces into high molecular weight DNA (6Yudelevich A. Ginsberg B. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). With this evidence, Okazaki and colleagues proposed a discontinuous model of DNA replication (Fig. 1C) in which both the lagging and the leading strands are synthesized in short fragments and maturated later into HMW species by the combined action of DNA polymerase I (plus RNase H) and DNA ligase (15Okazaki R. Arisawa M. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2954-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Kitani T. Yoda K. Ogawa T. Okazaki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).According to the current model of semidiscontinuous replication in E. coli, the mobile primosome DnaB-DnaG unwinds the template DNA duplex and lays RNA primers on the template for the lagging strand, whereas the DNA polymerase III utilizes these primers to synthesize nascent DNA strands (21Johnson A. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 283-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 22Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar, 23Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the leading strand is thought to be synthesized continuously, primed only once at the replication origin (23Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When DNA polymerase III reaches the RNA primer of a downstream Okazaki fragment, it cannot remove the RNA portion because it does not have a 5′–3′ exonuclease or RNase H activities. RNase H helps to remove RNA primers in vivo (24Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ogawa T. Okazaki T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but the bulk of RNA primers in E. coli are removed by DNA polymerase I, which elongates Okazaki fragments in the process, creating DNA-DNA nicks, suitable for ligation (22Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). DNA ligase then forms a phosphodiester bond between adjacent DNA fragments, thus completing the maturation of Okazaki fragments (22Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Therefore, one requirement for a reliable detection of replication intermediates in E. coli is inactivation of either DNA ligase or DNA polymerase I, which is achieved by shifting temperature-sensitive mutants in the corresponding genes to the nonpermissive temperature of 42 °C.The second and equally important requirement for detection of replication intermediates is an instant termination of the DNA metabolism, to prevent residual maturation of the replication intermediates during processing of the cultures before lysis. In fact, KCN/ice, the most popular early method of metabolism termination (4Iyer V.N. Lark K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 6Yudelevich A. Ginsberg B. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Sakabe K. Okazaki R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 129: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Hanawalt P.C. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) allows maturation of the replication intermediates to continue for several seconds after the arrest of strand elongation (the latter one being monitored by incorporation of thymidine label in DNA). This imprecise stop in early experiments resulted in accumulation of ≥50% of all label in the intermediate molecular weight (IMW) and HMW fractions even after very short 10-s pulses, which was at first ignored (1Okazaki R. Okazaki T. Sakabe K. Sugimoto K. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 6Yudelevich A. Ginsberg B. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Bird R.E. Lark K.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 49: 343-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Eventually, Iyer and Lark investigated these IMW and HMW replication intermediates and found them to be composed of the newly synthesized DNA, attached to the 3′-ends of the previously synthesized material, suggesting a continuous synthesis (4Iyer V.N. Lark K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such an asymmetry in the replication of DNA supported the semidiscontinuous model of DNA replication (Fig. 1B) and was also consistent with a hybrid model, according to which the leading strand is synthesized in much longer pieces than is the lagging strand (Fig. 1D). However, the realization that these IMW and HMW replication intermediates could be the result of maturation of some Okazaki fragments into longer species led to the search for better termination procedures. Two new stopping techniques, KCN + pyridine/ice (27Jacobson M.K. Lark K.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 73: 371-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and phenol-ethanol-acetate mix (28Kurosawa Y. Okazaki R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Manor H. Goodman D. Stent G.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 39: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), were soon described. They minimized formation of IMW and HMW replication intermediates at the earliest time points, revealing their origin as a result of maturation of existing LMW intermediates.A radical solution to the maturation problem is offered by in vitro systems. Olivera, Bonhoeffer, and co-workers (30Herrmann R. Huf J. Bonhoeffer F. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 240: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Olivera B.M. Bonhoeffer F. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 240: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) studied replication intermediates in whole cell lysates on cellophane disks, providing dNTPs and inactivating DNA ligase with a by-product of the ligation reaction, nicotinamide mononucleotide. Although they did not show the evidence of a complete inactivation of DNA ligase, Olivera and Bonhoeffer reported a bimodal distribution of the sizes of replication intermediates, with about 50% of the replication intermediates sedimenting as LMW fragments, the other 50% of the pulse-labeled DNA fragments being of intermediate molecular weight (30Herrmann R. Huf J. Bonhoeffer F. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 240: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Olivera B.M. Bonhoeffer F. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 240: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 5-fold dilution of provided dNTPs reduced the size of IMW species almost to the size of LMW species, suggesting that 1) both are formed by discontinuous synthesis, and 2) the size of replication intermediates is determined by competition between the rates of propagation versus the rates of priming of the new chains (31Olivera B.M. Bonhoeffer F. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 240: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).On the genetic front, two types of E. coli mutants were found with changes in the size of Okazaki fragments: the dnaG(Ts) mutants synthesized longer Okazaki fragments at semipermissive temperatures (32Lark K.G. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 240: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas sof mutants synthesized shorter Okazaki fragments (33Konrad E.B. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2150-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Eventually, the DnaG protein was shown to be the hypothesized primase that lays short RNAs to initiate Okazaki fragments (34Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 758-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas sof mutants were shown to be the same as dut mutants, deficient in hydrolysis of a noncanonical DNA precursor dUTP (35Tye B.K. Nyman P.O. Lehman I.R. Hochhauser S. Weiss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The dut mutants feature extremely short Okazaki fragments due to uracil incorporation into nascent DNA with its subsequent rapid excision by uracil DNA glycosylase (the product of the ung gene) (36Tye B.-K. Lehman I.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, Tye et al. (35Tye B.K. Nyman P.O. Lehman I.R. Hochhauser S. Weiss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) proposed that a fraction of Okazaki fragments, even in dut+ cells, forms as a result of uracil excision. However, the subsequent testing of this idea showed that uracil excision in vitro does not change the sedimentation pattern of replication intermediates in wild type E. coli, indicating very little uracil incorporation in dut+ cells (37Tye B.-K. Chien J. Lehman I.R. Duncan B.K. Warner H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Eventually, Tye et al. (37Tye B.-K. Chien J. Lehman I.R. Duncan B.K. Warner H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) ruled out a significant role for uracil incorporation and excision in the generation of Okazaki fragments in E. coli by demonstrating that their size in both wild type and polA mutant cells does not change if the uracil excision is inactivated in vivo by an ung mutation.Although the original idea of Okazaki, that both strands at the replication fork are synthesized in pieces (Fig. 1C), thus survived the experimental challenge of uracil incorporation and excision, it could not overcome the practical appeal of the simpler alternative, in which the leading strand is synthesized continuously (Fig. 1B). Using whole cell lysates on cellophane disks, Olivera demonstrated that he can regulate the size of “Okazaki fragments” in vitro by varying the concentration of dUTP in the feeding buffer (38Olivera B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This “regulation” was suppressed by the inactivation of ung (39Olivera B.M. Manlapaz-Ramos P. Warner H.R. Duncan B.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 128: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These in vitro results allowed Olivera to speculate that 1) the effective concentration of dUTP in dut+ cells is higher than assumed, and 2) the leading strand is synthesized continuously in vivo but is quickly fragmented due to uracil excision, creating an appearance of a discontinuous synthesis (38Olivera B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, these ideas were never tested in vivo and were in disagreement with the experimental results of others (37Tye B.-K. Chien J. Lehman I.R. Duncan B.K. Warner H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The proposal of Olivera might have been without significant consequences, were it not for the fact that all later in vitro experiments on reconstitution of the replication fork of E. coli and its bacteriophages with highly purified enzymes yielded strong evidence for continuous synthesis of the leading strand for as long as at least 40 kb in the complete absence of DNA ligase (40Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12220-12225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9818-9830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all of these systems, the lagging strands were synthesized in a coupled reaction on the same parental DNAs that provided the template for the leading strand synthesis, as short pieces of the size range characteristic of Okazaki fragments (the omission of DNA ligase in the in vitro reactions preserved Okazaki fragments) (40Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12220-12225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9818-9830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the in vitro reconstitution experiments rendered strong support for the semidiscontinuous model (Fig. 1B), turning it into a paradigm and a textbook fixture.However, the discrepancy between the in vivo demonstration of fully discontinuous replication versus the in vitro demonstration of semidiscontinuous replication remains unresolved (43Kuzminov A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 751-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Wang T.C. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As a first step to address this discrepancy, we have isolated replication intermediates from one of the strongest E. coli ligA(Ts) mutants, pulse-labeled at the nonpermissive temperature. To detect Okazaki fragments, we tried three labeling/separation approaches: 1) gel electrophoresis of nonlabeled DNA followed by blot hybridization; 2) [3H]thymidine in vivo labeling with subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis; and 3) [3H]thymidine in vivo labeling with subsequent sucrose gradient sedimentation. We found that 1) all of the newly synthesized DNA in ligase-deficient conditions has a low molecular weight; 2) this LMW nascent DNA can be chased into chromosomal size DNA if the mutant cells are returned to permissive temperatures; and 3) these short DNA species are not the results of uracil excision or the products of DNA processing by the RecBCD helicase/nuclease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains—All E. coli strains are K12 derivatives. The wild type strain GR523 and its ligA251 derivative GR501 have been described (45Dermody J.J. Robinson G.T. Sternglanz R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 701-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were obtained from Mary Berlyn at the E. coli Genetic Stock Center. LA8 is GR501 Δung::cat, whereas LA9 is GR523 Δung::cat. AK147 is GR523 ΔrecBCD3::kan, whereas AK148 is GR501 ΔrecBCD3::kan. AK149 is GR523 dut-1 zic4901::Tn10, whereas AK150 is GR501 dut-1 zic4901::Tn10. LA20 is GR501 ypeB::kan, made by the Datsenko-Wanner technique (46Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar). LA35 is a ligA+ derivative of AK150 Δung::cat, essentially AK149 Δung::cat. LA33 is LA35 ligA251 ypeB::kan. All derivatives of the original GR501 and GR523 strains were constructed by P1 transduction of mutations from other laboratory strains by their association with antibiotic resistance determinants. The ligA251 defect was confirmed by the inability to plate above 37 °C and by detection of LMW replication intermediates at 42 °C (45Dermody J.J. Robinson G.T. Sternglanz R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 701-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the recBCD defect was confirmed by sensitivity to T4 2 mutant phage (47Silverstein J.L. Goldberg E.B. Virology. 1976; 72: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); the dut defect was confirmed by the inability to plate in the presence of 10 mm uracil (48Hochhauser S.J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the ung defect was confirmed by the ability to serve as a host for uracil-containing phage λ isolated from dut ung mutant cells (49Duncan B.K. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 689-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described (50Kouzminova E.A. Kuzminov A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1279-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); the double dut ung defect was confirmed by detecting the high density of uracils in DNA from these cells (51Warner H.R. Duncan B.K. Garrett C. Neuhard J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 687-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described (52Kouzminova E.A. Kuzminov A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Media and Growth Conditions, Pulse-labeling, and DNA Isolation—Cells were grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.4 followed by incubation at the nonpermissive or permissive temperatures. For [3H]thymidine labeling, cells were grown in 2–10 ml of M9 minimal medium (53Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids (M9CAA) and pulse-labeled with 5–10 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 60 s. In some experiments, the pulse was followed by a chase for the specified amount of time in the presence of 50 μg/ml cold thymidine. For nonlabeled DNA isolation, the cells were grown similarly, but no label was added. To stop the cellular metabolism instantly, we mixed the culture with an equal volume of the phenol-ethanol-acetate mix (29Manor H. Goodman D. Stent G.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 39: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 54Okazaki R. DNA Replication.in: Wickner R.B. 7. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1974: 1-32Google Scholar) (a mixture of 75 ml of ethanol, 21 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3), 2 ml of 100 mm EDTA, and 2 ml of phenol). The cells were later collected by centrifugation, and DNA was extracted in several ways, depending on the subsequent analytical procedure. For gel electrophoresis, native DNA was purified by SDS lysis with subsequent phenol-chloroform extraction (52Kouzminova E.A. Kuzminov A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For alkaline sucrose gradients, denatured chromosomal DNA was isolated by suspending the cells in 0.5 ml of 1% sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate containing 40 mm EDTA, followed by lysis with 0.5 ml of 0.4 m NaOH (54Okazaki R. DNA Replication.in: Wickner R.B. 7. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1974: 1-32Google Scholar). After a 15-min centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and 300 μl of it were dialyzed (as detailed below) and loaded on an alkaline sucrose gradient.Kinetics of DNA Synthesis or Degradation—Cells were grown in M9CAA at 30 °C to A600 of 0.4. For DNA synthesis, before adding 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine, the medium was supplemented with 0.8–1.0 mm deoxyadenosine (54Okazaki R. DNA Replication.in: Wickner R.B. 7. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1974: 1-32Google Scholar, 55Boyce R.P. Setlow R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 61: 618-620Google Scholar). At the desired time points, 250-μl aliquots of cultures were mixed with 5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice. After the third time point at 30 °C, half of the culture was switched to the nonpermissive temperature (42 °C), and several more time points were similarly taken. The precipitate was collected on glass fiber filters (Fisher G6), washed twice with 5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and twice with 5 ml of ethanol. The filters were air-dried, and the radioactivity was counted in the LS 6500 Beckman scintillation system. To monitor stability of the newly synthesized DNA, cells were grown in 2.5 ml of M9CAA at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.4 and switched to a 42 °C for 5 min before labeling with [3H]thymidine for 60 s at 42 °C. The labeling was ended by adding 250 μl of 5 mg/ml nonradioactive thymidine. Time points were taken by mixing 250 μl of the culture with 5 ml of 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were collected by filtration and processed as above.Alkaline Gel Electrophoresis—1% agarose was prepared in water, cooled to 60 °C, and, before pouring, supplemented with alkaline buffer by adding NaOH to 50 mm and EDTA (pH 8.0) to 1 mm. DNA was ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in 10 μl of a 50 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA solution, and mixed with 10 μl of 1× alkaline loading dye (56Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Gels were run for 710 min in a 1.5 V/cm electric field, and DNA was vacuum-transferred and UV-cross-linked to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences). Before transfer, gels were soaked in 0.2 m HCl for 40 min, then in 0.5 m NaOH for 45 min, and, finally, in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 40 min. When [3H]thymidine-labeled DNA was loaded, the lanes of the membrane were cut in"

GPIb-IX-V consists of four members of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family: GPIbα disulfide-linked to GPIbβ and associated with GPIX and GPV (2:2:2:1) (1Andrews R.K. Gardiner E.E. Shen Y. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1170-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). VWF binds to the N-terminal domain of GPIbα (His1-Glu282), consisting of seven leucine-rich repeats (Leu36-Ala200), N- and C-terminal flanking sequences (His1-Ile35 and Phe201-Gly268), and an anionic sequence (Asp269-Glu282) containing three sulfotyrosines at positions 276, 278, and 279. We previously expressed a series of human/canine and canine/human chimeras of GPIbα and mapped binding sites for VWF and a panel of inhibitory anti-GPIbα antibodies to precise structural domains (6Shen Y.

This approach is based on the specificity of human VWF and murine antibodies for human (not canine) GPIbα (6Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.-F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C.

Chimeras consisted of human sequence incrementally replaced by canine sequence from the N terminus at domain boundaries and canine sequence His1-Glu282 rehumanized from the N terminus (human replacing canine sequence). LRR2-4, spanning residues Leu60-Glu128, was identified as crucial for GPIbα-dependent adhesion to VWF under shear conditions. Paradoxically, co-crystal structures subsequently reported for GPIbα N-terminal domain and VWF-A1 domain fragments (8Sadler J.E.

This discrepancy between structure and function requires resolution to understand the molecular basis for shear-dependent platelet adhesion, especially if the GPIbα-VWF interaction is considered as an anti-thrombotic target (4Bhatt D.L.

Notably, LRR2-4 in human but not canine GPIbα has a pronounced negative charge patch at the concave surface of the repeats, complementary to a positive patch on VWF, implying electrostatic interactions are critical for GPIbα-mediated adhesion to VWF (1Andrews R.K.

Comparing wild-type (WT) human GPIbα and a homology swap with canine instead of human sequence within Leu60-Glu128 (HUMCAN60-128) expressed on CHO cells shows that LRR2-4 of GPIbα is essential for GPIbα·VWF-dependent adhesion as hydrodynamic shear increases.

This approach enables functional analysis of the N-terminal domain of GPIbα that is conformationally sensitive and not amenable to analysis by short peptides or scanning mutagenesis (6Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.-F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. López J.A. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2000; 95: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shen Y. Dong J.-F. Romo G.M.

Furthermore, expressing mutants on CHO cells enables antibody binding and adhesion to VWF under flow to be evaluated. Several lines of evidence confirm that GPIbα homology swaps are expressed in a functional form without significant conformational disruption. First, modeling of constructs as described previously (6Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.-F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. López J.A. Andrews R.K.

The models also illustrate conspicuous electrostatic differences in surface charge between human and canine GPIbα (Fig. 1B). A negative patch on human GPIbα is predominantly centered on Asp63 and other residues comprising this surface. In canine GPIbα, Asp63 is substituted by Arg, which together with His61 results in loss of the negative patch. There is no direct contact between the human GPIbα sequence, Leu60-Glu128 (LRR2-4), and VWF-A1 (Fig. 1B), although the co-crystal structure (10Dumas J.J. Kumar R. McDonagh T. Sullivan F. Stahl M.L.

Second, GPIbα homology swaps expressed as a GPIb-IX complex on CHO cells are recognized by conformation-sensitive antibodies (6Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.-F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D.

Third, all of the mutants bind human VWF in the presence of the modulator botrocetin, which does not discriminate between species (6Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.-F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D.

In contrast, the HUMCAN60-128 swap (Leu60-Glu128 replaced by canine sequence) showed a substantial decrease in the number of cells adhering from flow at 50 s-1 and a significantly reduced ability to maintain adhesion with increasing shear (Fig. 4, A and C). This is despite the fact that the two major contact sites for VWF-A1 predicted by crystal structures were preserved. The interaction at low shear suggests that although HUMCAN60-128 was competent to bind, shear-dependent adhesion was severely compromised without human Leu60-Glu128 (and almost non-existent at high shear, where WT-GPIbα still remained functional). HUMCAN60-128 cells that did roll on VWF rolled 2.5-6-fold faster than WT-GPIbα; this difference became more pronounced with increasing shear rate (Fig. 4, C and D). The lack of binding of CANHUM60-128 (Fig. 4A) suggests human Leu60-Glu128 alone is not sufficient to support adhesion to VWF. In this regard, the co-crystal structures of GPIbα N-terminal domain and VWF-A1 fragments (9Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P.

However, the combined functional data show that the relative functional importance of specific structural elements within Leu60-Glu128 increases as the shear force increases. The aim of this study was to reconcile discrepancies between structural and functional analyses of binding of platelet GPIbα (the major ligand-binding subunit of GPIb-IX-V) to VWF, an interaction that initiates pathophysiological thrombus formation under shear stress (1Andrews R.K.

Our previous studies using human/canine chimeras of GPIbα suggested that the LRR2-4 sequence, Leu60-Glu128, is required for GPIbα-dependent adhesion to VWF under flow conditions (6Shen Y. Romo G.M.

All of the chimeras showing impaired VWF binding, however, not only lack human Leu60-Glu128 sequence (6Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.-F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C.

Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). To establish the functional role of Leu60-Glu128, we expressed human/canine homology swaps of GPIbα on CHO cells. Three lines of evidence (molecular modeling, conformation-specific antibody binding, and botrocetin-dependent VWF binding) support the correct folding of the mutant receptor as published previously (6Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.-F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. López J.A. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2000; 95: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shen Y. Dong J.-F. Romo G.M.

These functional data, on adhesion of GPIbα-expressing cells to VWF in a flow chamber mimicking pathophysiological shear (14Cranmer S.L. Ulsemer P. Cooke B.M. Salem H.H. de la Salle C. Lanza F.

This is not to imply that regions outside LRR2-4 are not important for the interaction of GPIbα with VWF but rather that the elements within LRR2-4 become increasingly critical for binding as shear rate increases. The lack of binding of CANHUM60-128 to VWF suggests that human Leu60-Glu128 alone is not sufficient to support adhesion to VWF at low or high shear. The structure of the N-terminal domain of GPIbα has been described as a cupped human hand with LRR domains as the palm and fingers, the extended loop of the C-terminal flanking sequence as the thumb, and the anionic/sulfated sequence as the wrist (17Uff S.

The dimensions of VWF-A1 preclude contact with a ligand-binding surface at the palm of GPIbα because of steric hindrance from the thumb, but Uff et al. (17Uff S. Clemetson J.M. Harrison T. Clemetson K.J. Emsley J. J. Biol.

Science. 2002; 297: 1128-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), would appear more consistent with a low-affinity structure postulated by Uff et al. (17Uff S. Clemetson J.M. Harrison T. Clemetson K.J. Emsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35657-35663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the VWF-A1 domain could be satisfactorily docked against the concave surface of GPIbα if the “thumb” is moved (17Uff S. Clemetson J.M. Harrison T. Clemetson K.J. Emsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35657-35663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the absence of VWF modulators ristocetin and botrocetin, shear stress may provide the necessary impetus to open the structure sufficiently to allow interaction between VWF-A1 and the concave surface of the LRR domain, mediated predominantly by complementary electrostatic patches on GPIbα and VWF-A1 (9Huizinga E.G.

This model would predict that although the contact sites may confer specificity, there is an increasing requirement for the electronegative surface encompassing Leu60-Glu128 as the shear rate increases, consistent with the functional data (6Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.-F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. López J.A. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2000; 95: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Definitive resolution of the contact surface between receptor and ligand will undoubtedly require further structural information. However, in the context of shear this will be almost impossible to achieve using current technologies. Instead, the functional analysis of homology domain swaps of GPIbα identifies shear-dependent regions of the receptor involved in binding VWF."

Intracellular signal transduction in eukaryotic organisms relies on the precise regulation of protein phosphorylation by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. These enzymes are broadly classified based on their specificity for serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues. Approximately equal numbers of protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases are encoded by most eukaryotic genomes (1Kennelly P.J. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2291-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In contrast, merely a handful of protein serine/threonine phosphatases appear to be required for reversing the actions of a much larger cohort of protein serine/threonine kinases (3Barford D.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), raising the question of how protein serine/threonine phosphatase specificity is achieved. To counter this numerical disparity, protein serine/threoninephosphatases rely on a rich array of regulatory subunits that control the localization, activity, and substrate specificity of protein phosphatase catalytic subunits.

Most of these regulators are involved in the targeting of PP-1 to specific subcellular locations, whereas several modulate its catalytic activity.Historically, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (inhibitor-1, or I-1) was the first such endogenous molecule found to regulate protein phosphatase activity in vivo (8Huang F.L. Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This 19-kDa protein has a highly conserved primary sequence in vertebrates ranging from fish to mammals (9Elbrecht A. DiRenzo J. Smith R.G. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13415-13418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sikes S. Shenolikar S. Cellsci. Rev. 2005; 2: 175-178Google Scholar). It largely lacks elements of secondary structure (11Cohen P. Nimmo G.A. Shenolikar S. Foulkes J.G. FEBS Symp. 1978; 54: 161-169Google Scholar), possibly explaining why it is unusually stable to heat, acid, detergents, and organic solvents (12Nimmo G.A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Thr35 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) converts the inactive protein into a selective and highly potent inhibitor of the catalytic subunit of PP-1 (IC50 ≈ 1 nm) (8Huang F.L. Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Foulkes J.G. Strada S.J. Henderson P.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This site is dephosphorylated by the type-2 protein serine/threonine phosphatases, PP-2A and PP-2B (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, or calcineurin) (14Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar, 15Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). PP-2B activity predominates in the presence of high intracellular Ca2+, placing inhibitor-1 regulation under the opposing influences of cAMP and Ca2+ signaling. Downstream from inhibitor-1, a mechanism for signal amplification is provided by the substrate specificity of PP-1. PP-1 dephosphorylates a broad spectrum of phosphoproteins targeted by an array of protein serine/threonine kinases, including PKA as well as others (14Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of PP-1 by phospho-Thr35 inhibitor-1 results in the amplification of PKA-dependent signaling cascades and has the potential to impose cAMP regulation upon the phosphorylation state of cellular substrates phosphorylated by other protein kinases.Inhibitor-1 is highly expressed in the brain, adipose tissue, kidney, and skeletal muscle (17MacDougall L.K. Campbell D.G. Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), with lower levels occurring in the heart and lung (9Elbrecht A. DiRenzo J.

It has been shown to play a particularly important role as a PP-1 inhibitor in excitable tissues like brain and cardiac muscle, where it has emerged as a key player in models of synaptic plasticity (16Mulkey R.M.

Within the brain, inhibitor-1 is especially enriched in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation (22Gustafson E.L. Girault J.A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 310: 170-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the heart, nearly 80% of inhibitor-1 is found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (23Gupta R.C. Mishra S. Rastogi S. Imai M. Habib O. Sabbah H.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H2373-H2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for inhibitor-1 in the regulation of PP-1 substrates associated with this compartment in cardiomyocytes.Protein phosphatase regulatory subunits like inhibitor-1 can be regulated by multiple protein kinases and phosphatases, thus serving as potential points of integration for disparate signal transduction cascades. For instance, DARPP-32, a homologous PP-1 inhibitor highly enriched in the striatum, is phosphorylated at different serine/threonine residues by PKA (24Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Tung H.Y. Cohen P. Nature. 1984; 310: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), casein kinases 1 and 2 (25Desdouits F. Cohen D. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Girault J.A. J. Biol.

Consistent with this notion, inhibitor-1 isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle in earlier studies was found to be heavily phosphorylated at Ser67 (28Aitken A. Bilham T. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This residue was later characterized as a site of phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), and Cdk5 in vitro, with Cdk5 accounting for all phosphorylation in the brain (29Bibb J.A. Nishi A. O'Callaghan J.P. Ule J. Lan M. Snyder G.L. Horiuchi A. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol.

The same study found that phospho-Ser67 inhibitor-1 does not inhibit PP-1 but rather serves as a slightly less efficient substrate for PKA at Thr35. More recently, it was suggested that inhibitor-1 may be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) in cardiac muscle, where phospho-Ser67 inhibitor-1 was implicated in modulating the contractile response by regulating the activity of the SERCA-2 pump in a PKC-dependent fashion (30Braz J.C. Gregory K. Pathak A. Zhao W. Sahin B. Klevitsky R. Kimball T.F. Lorenz J.N. Nairn A.C. Liggett S.B. Bodi I. Wang S. Schwartz A. Lakatta E.G. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Robbins J. Hewett T.E. Bibb J.A. Westfall M.V. Kranias E.G. Molkentin J.D. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). However, the precise interaction between PKC and inhibitor-1 in this novel signaling pathway has not yet been delineated and is the focus of the present study.In this report, we show that inhibitor-1 is phosphorylated by PKC at Ser65 in vitro and in intact striatal brain tissue. We further demonstrate that under basal conditions in the striatum, inhibitor-1 is maintained in a dephosphorylated state at this site by tonic PP-1 activity but becomes resistant to PP-1 in the presence of Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation at the nearby Ser67 residue. Thus, only diphospho-Ser65/Ser67 inhibitor-1 is detected in vivo. Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors positively regulated the levels of diphospho-Ser65/Ser67 inhibitor-1 in the striatum, whereas the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors opposed PKC- and Cdk5-mediated increases in striatal diphospho-Ser65/Ser67 inhibitor-1 levels. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that diphospho-Ser65/Ser67 inhibitor-1 is a poor substrate for PKA at Thr35. Together, these findings support a role for inhibitor-1 as an integrator of PKA-, PKC-, and Cdk5-mediated signaling pathways in the regulation of PP-1 activity in the brain and possibly other tissues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Enzymes—All chemicals were from Sigma, except where indicated.

O'Callaghan J.P. Ule J. Lan M. Snyder G.L. Horiuchi A. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol.

Mutants containing single or multiple amino acid substitutions were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and following the manufacturer's recommendations for mutagenic primer design. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing along both strands, using primers specific for the T7 promoter and T7 terminator.Purification of Inhibitor-1—Recombinant inhibitor-1 was generated as previously described (29Bibb J.A. Nishi A. O'Callaghan J.P. Ule J. Lan M. Snyder G.L. Horiuchi A. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol.

Chemically competent BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET-15b expression vectors encoding wild-type or mutant rat inhibitor-1. Cultures were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and lysed by French press. Cleared lysates were incubated with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen). Bound protein was eluted from the resin using a linear gradient of 0–500 mm imidazole. All forms of inhibitor-1 eluted at ∼150 mm imidazole. Samples were dialyzed overnight in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with two changes of buffer. Dialyzed protein (10 μg) was analyzed for purity by SDS-15% PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining.In Vitro Protein Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation Reactions—All protein phosphorylation reactions were performed at 30 °C in a final volume of at least 30 μl containing 10 μm substrate (unless otherwise specified), 100 μm ATP, and 0.2 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. The PKC reaction solution included 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phosphotidylserine, and 0.01 mg/ml diacylglycerol, where the final two components were added to the reaction mixture following sonication on ice for 1 min. PKA reactions were conducted in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; MAPK reactions were in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm EGTA; and Cdk5 reactions were in 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and 5 mm MgCl2. Time course reactions were performed by removing 10-μl aliquots from the reaction solution at various time points and adding an equal volume of 5× SDS protein sample buffer to stop the reaction. Kinetic parameters and initial reaction rates were determined from the results of at least four experiments performed in duplicate with 1.5–20 μm substrate under empirically defined linear steady-state conditions. In all cases, [32P]phosphate incorporation was assessed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. To calculate reaction stoichiometries, radiolabeled reaction products and radioactive standards were quantified by densitometry using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Standards consisted of spotted aliquots from serial dilutions of each reaction mixture (1:100, 1:500, 1:1000), with the moles of phosphate per unit volume of each dilution defined using the ATP concentration of the original reaction. Division of the signal per mole of substrate by the signal per mole of phosphate yielded the stoichiometry of phosphate incorporation (mol of phosphate/mol of substrate).In some studies, preparative phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 by a protein kinase was followed by repurification of phosphoinhibitor-1 prior to use in a subsequent assay. For these experiments, phosphoinhibitor-1 was repurified from in vitro protein phosphorylation reaction mixtures by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and dialysis as previously described (29Bibb J.A. Nishi A. O'Callaghan J.P. Ule J. Lan M. Snyder G.L. Horiuchi A. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14490-14497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Protein dephosphorylation reactions were conducted at 30 °C in a final volume of 30 μl containing 10 μm substrate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% Brij, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm caffeine, using the catalytic subunit of PP-1 in the absence or presence of 25 nm phospho-Thr35 inhibitor-1 repurified from preparative phosphorylation reactions conducted with PKA. Phosphoinhibitor-1 forms evaluated as PP-1 substrates in these studies were generated by preparative phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 with PKC in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, followed by repurification and preparative phosphorylation with or without Cdk5. Reactions conducted with PKC and Cdk5 for these studies achieved final stoichiometries of 0.90 and 0.92 mol/mol, respectively. Following 30 min of incubation, protein dephosphorylation reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 5× SDS protein sample buffer and quantified by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis.PP-1 inhibition assays were performed under linear steady-state conditions as previously described (24Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Tung H.Y. Cohen P. Nature. 1984; 310: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), using 1 mg/ml 32P-labeled phosphorylase a as a PP-1 substrate in the absence or presence of wild-type and site-directed mutant forms of recombinant inhibitor-1 repurified from preparative phosphorylation reactions conducted with and without PKA. These protein dephosphorylation reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Following centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 3 min, supernatants were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting for the amount of free [32P]phosphate released into solution.Phosphorylation Site Identification by Mass Spectrometry (MS)—In one set of experiments, inhibitor-1 from in vitro protein phosphorylation reaction mixtures with and without PKC was subjected to SDS-PAGE and in-gel digestion with trypsin. Dried digest mixtures were redissolved in 20 μl of 5% formic acid and loaded onto a POROS R2 reversed-phase column (Applied Biosystems) for purification. After being washed with 5% formic acid, peptides were eluted directly into a nanoelectrospray needle (Proxeon Biosystems) with 1 μl of either 50% methanol, 1% NH3·H2O for precursor ion scanning in negative ion mode or 50% methanol, 1% acetic acid for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in positive ion mode. MS analysis was performed on a QSTAR Pulsar I quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). For precursor ion scanning, the instrument was set in negative ion mode to detect the PO–3 fragment ion at m/z –79. After data acquisition, the instrument was switched to positive ion mode, and the phosphopeptide sequence and site of phosphorylation were determined by nanoelectrospray-QSTAR Pulsar I quadrupole time-of-flight MS/MS. In the MS/MS scan mode, the precursor ion was selected in the quadrupole (Q1) and fragmented in the collision cell (q2), using argon as the collision gas.In parallel studies, 32P-labeled phosphoinhibitor-1, resulting from phosphorylation by PKC in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, was subjected to SDS-PAGE and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C. The digest mixture was fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column (1.0-mm inner diameter × 150 mm; Vydac), and collected fractions were screened for radioactivity. The fraction containing the radiolabel was subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis. To confirm phosphorylation, a small aliquot of the fraction was treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The remainder of the fraction was dried, and the phosphorylation site was modified with 1-propanethiol to produce S-propylcysteine after β-elimination of the phosphate. This modification results in a net mass shift of –21 Da, generating a derivative that is stable to Edman degradation chemistry and elutes after phenylthiohydantoin-leucine. The reaction was performed by incubating the phosphopeptide with 10 μl of 1 m NaOH, 3 μl of saturated Ba(OH)2, and 15 μl of 0.5 m 1-propanethiol at 37 °C for 2 h. Edman degradation was performed after the modified peptide was analyzed by MALDI-TOF to confirm the completion of the reaction.Generation of Phosphorylation State-specific Antibodies—Polyclonal phosphorylation state-specific antibodies for phospho-Ser65 and diphospho-Ser65/Ser67 inhibitor-1 were generated and affinity-purified as previously described (34Czernik A.J. Mathers J. Tsou K. Greengard P. Mische S.M. Hemmings Jr., Hugh C. Regulatory Protein Modification. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 219-246Google Scholar), using synthetic phosphopeptides encompassing the local amino acid sequence around Ser65 of inhibitor-1. Briefly, New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with one of two inhibitor-1 phosphopeptides, incorporating either phospho-Ser65 alone or phospho-Ser65 and phospho-Ser67. Phosphorylation state-specific antibodies were purified from the resulting antisera using a SulfoLink resin (Pierce) conjugated to the corresponding phosphopeptide antigens. Purified antibodies were evaluated for specificity by immunoblot analysis of dephosphoand phosphoinhibitor-1 standards (50 ng). Three forms of phosphoinhibitor-1 were generated by preparative phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser65, Ser67, or Ser65 and Ser67 using PKC and/or Cdk5. The reactions with PKC achieved a final stoichiometry of 0.35 mol/mol at Ser65, whereas the Cdk5 reactions reached a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol at Ser67. Diphospho-Ser65/Ser67 inhibitor-1 was generated by phosphorylating inhibitor-1 first with PKC and then with Cdk5.Infection of Cultured Cells with Replication-deficient Adenoviruses—The adenoviruses encoding rat inhibitor-1 (20El-Armouche A.

PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, courtesy of Eric Nestler (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum in 60-mm plates. After 24 h, the culture medium was changed, and cells were infected with a selected adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque-forming units for 2 h at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Infected cells were cultured for an additional 24 h before being harvested for analysis. N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells, a gift from Susanne Mumby (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and infected with the adenovirus encoding inhibitor-1. Subsequently, cells were cultured for 24 h and treated with 1 μm PDBu for 10 min following incubation in the presence or absence of 1 μm Ro-32-0432 for 1 h. After drug treatment, cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline using a cell scraper. Following centrifugation, cell pellets were rapidly frozen on dry ice and stored at –80 °C until assayed.Preparation and Incubation of Acute Striatal Slices—Male C57BL/6 mice (8–10 weeks old) were killed by decapitation. The brains were rapidly removed and placed in cold, oxygenated Krebs buffer (124 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 1.5 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4). 350-μm coronal sections were prepared using a vibrating blade microtome.

https://openalex.org/W2048167827,"To reveal mechanistic differences in transcription initiation between variant TATA elements, in vivo and in vitro assays of the functional activity of 14 different sequences were compared. Variant elements exhibited particular degrees of activation in vivo but universally were unable to support the -fold activation observed for an element consisting of TATAAA. Each element was classified by its functional activity for in vitro interaction with TATA-binding protein (TBP), TFIIA, and TFIIB. Certain off-consensus TATA elements form poor binding sites for TBP and this compromised interaction interferes with higher order complex formation with TFIIA and/or TFIIB. Other elements are only modestly decreased for TBP binding but dramatically affected for higher order complex formation. Another distinct category is comprised of two elements (CATAAA and TATAAG), which are not affected in the initial formation of the TBP, TFIIA-TBP, or TFIIB-TBP complexes. However, CATAAA and TATAAG are unable to form a stable TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex in vitro. Moreover, fusion of TFIIA to TBP specifically restores activity from these two elements in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that the interplay between the sequence of the TATA element and the components of the general transcription machinery can lead to variations in the formation of functional complexes and/or the stability of these complexes. These differences offer distinct opportunities for an organism to exploit diverse steps in the regulation of gene expression depending on the precise TATA element sequence at a given gene.

These differences offer distinct opportunities for an organism to exploit diverse steps in the regulation of gene expression depending on the precise TATA element sequence at a given gene. Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II is the major site for regulation of eukaryotic gene expression during cell cycle progression, development, and physiological induction (1Nothias J.Y. Majumder S. Kaneko K.J. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22077-22080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Increased gene expression is mediated by activator proteins that bind regulatory sequences in the promoter and, either directly or indirectly, facilitate recruitment of the general transcription factors assembled near the initiation site at the core promoter (2Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). TATA-binding protein (TBP) 3The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. specifically recognizes and binds to the TATA sequence of the core promoter allowing for the nucleation of other general transcription factors including TFIIA, -B, -E, -F, -H, -J, and polymerase II (for reviews, see Refs. 3Woychik N.A. Hampsey M. Cell. 2002; 108: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar and 4Hahn S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2004; 11: 394-403Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Although high affinity binding sites have been identified for yeast TBP (5Chen W. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2691-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Singer V.L. Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and computational studies indicate that TATA(A/T)A(A/T)(A/G) is commonly found at TBP-dependent promoters in yeast (8Basehoar A.D. Zanton S.J. Pugh B.F. Cell. 2004; 116: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), a wide variety of off-consensus elements have been shown to exhibit transcriptional activity. Indeed, these alterations from the consensus sequence are not passive players in gene regulation but can contribute to the proper expression of a given gene. For example, activation by E1A of the human hsp70 promoter is highly dependent on the sequence of the TATA element: substitution of the hsp70 TATA (TATAA) with the SV40 early promoter TATA (TATTTAT) results in loss of induction by E1A but not by heat shock (9Simon M.C. Fisch T.M. Benecke B.J. Nevins J.R. Heintz N. Cell. 1988; 52: 723-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, an off-consensus TATA element is essential for the proper regulation of the osteocalcin gene by glucocorticoid receptor (10Meyer T. Carlstedt-Duke J. Starr D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30709-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As such, the particular sequence of the TATA element is likely to be critical for appropriate gene expression of a specific gene. To understand how variations in the TATA element affect transcription initiation, we compared the functional activity of 14 different elements. Because the first six bases are the most well defined in the 8-base pair sequence, we focused our efforts on replacements within these bases (positions 1 through 6). Each position of the first six bases was replaced with either a cytosine (C) or guanine (G) base. These elements were tested for their ability to direct transcription in vivo, and to form complexes with TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB in vitro. The use of identical sequence context, recombinant proteins, and conditions, allows for a detailed dissection of the mechanistic role that TATA sequence variation plays in transcription initiation. We found that each of the substituted elements is reduced for directing high levels of gene expression in vivo compared with TATA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB demonstrate that many of these TATA variants are compromised for formation of particular complexes, indicating sequence-specific alterations in complex formation. Two elements, TATAAG and CATAAA, fell into a previously described category of TATA variants (11Stewart J. Stargell L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30078-30084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that are compromised for the stability of the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex, whereas other complexes are unaffected. Overall, the data suggest that different positions of the TATA box can influence the kinetics of factor binding and/or the stability of the complex, which could contribute to multiple opportunities for transcription regulation. This work represents the first description of the functional activity of variant TATA elements for higher order complex formation and serves as the foundation for further studies aimed at understanding the mechanistic penalties associated with non-consensus TATA elements. Transcriptional Analyses—Plasmids used for measuring activated transcription in vivo were derivatives of YCp86 containing the hybrid HIS3 promoter and the wild-type initiation and amino-terminal region of the HIS3 gene fused in-frame with functional Escherichia coli LacZ (5Chen W. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2691-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Singer V.L. Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The promoter region contains a 365-bp GAL1,10 fragment containing four GAL4 binding sites fused upstream of the EcoRI-SacI restriction endonuclease sites, between which the substituted element oligonucleotides could be inserted. When the synthesized oligos were cloned into this molecule, the plasmids were renamed pJS3801 through pJS3814 (Table 1).TABLE 1DNA oligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequenceaThe sequence of the synthesized oligonucleotides (23 bases) are shown.

Open table in a new tab For the experiments measuring gene expression in vivo, the pJS3801–pJS3814 constructs were transformed into yeast strain yJS156, a derivative of KY804 (relevant genotype: MATα ura3–52 trp1-Δ1 leu2::PET56 gal2 gcn4-Δ1) (12Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1986; 46: 885-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) with the chromosomal copy of SPT15 deleted by a two-step knock-out. TBP functions are provided by a URA3-marked plasmid containing the TBP promoter, open reading frame, and terminator. Plasmid shuffling on 5-fluoroorotic acid was used to create the TRP1-marked wild-type TBP, TFIIB-TBP, or the Toa2-TBP fusion strains assayed. The resulting transformants were used in liquid assays for β-galactosidase. The cells were grown in selective medium containing either 2% raffinose or 2% galactose to mid-exponential growth phase (A600 ≅ 1–2). Enzyme activities were determined in duplicate and normalized to the A600 of the cultures. Protein Expression and Purification—Full-length yeast TBP was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 DE3 (13Campbell K.M. Ranallo R.T. Stargell L.A. Lumb K.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein was purified from the soluble fraction with Q, SP, and Heparin HiTrap columns (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting fractions were equilibrated in 100 mm KCl, 40 mm HEPES, 20 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final pH 7.9). The protein was shown to be 90% pure upon staining with Coomassie Blue. TFIIB was produced by fusing the open reading frame to glutathione S-transferase and transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 (Novagen). Cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.7. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm final concentration) was added and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 30°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with a 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl buffer. Following sonication, the lysate was incubated with shaking at 4 °C with glutathione resin. After two consecutive wash steps, the protein was eluted using 5 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris buffer. The eluate was equilibrated in 100 mm KCl, 40 mm HEPES, 20 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final pH 7.9). The protein was shown to be 75% homogeneous on SDS-PAGE upon staining with Coomassie Blue. Recombinant yeast TFIIA was purified as described (14Ranish J.A. Lane W.S. Hahn S. Science. 1992; 255: 1127-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This procedure involves expressing each subunit, TOA1 and TOA2, in separate strains of E. coli BL21 DE3. Cells were ruptured by sonication; insoluble material was collected by centrifugation. Each insoluble pellet was resolubilized in 8 m urea. Each subunit was renatured in the presence of the other subunit and dialyzed against the buffer described in the TBP and TFIIB purification. The TFIIA was ∼60% pure as determined by Coomassie staining. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—The DNA elements used for the in vitro protein DNA interaction studies were 23-base pair oligonucleotides (11Stewart J. Stargell L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30078-30084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The TATAAA oligo is 5′-AATTCCTATAAAGTAATGTGGAG-3′. The other elements were synthesized with the appropriate base substitution and prepared in the exact same way. Protein-DNA interactions in vitro were studied by incubation of purified proteins with 32P internally labeled probes. Binding reactions contained 10 μm poly(dG-dC) nonspecific competitor, 100 mm KCl, 40 mm HEPES, 20 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final pH 7.9). TBP (13.8 nm) and the TATA element probe (2.4 pmol) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and the complex was separated on a 5% acrylamide gel containing 50 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm MgCl2 in both the gel and running buffer. Recombinant yeast TFIIA (5.0 nm) and TFIIB (8.5 nm) were incubated with TBP and probe DNA as described above except that MgCl2 was omitted from the gel and running buffer. Omission of the divalent cations from the binding reaction allows for the stable formation of only the ternary complex. For dissociation kinetic studies, TBP-DNA, TFIIA-TBP-DNA, and TFIIB-TBP-DNA complexes were incubated for 30 min and then challenged with 1000-fold molar excess of specific competitor poly(dA-dT) for the specified amount of time. The samples were then loaded on to the gel and resolved by EMSA. Single Cytosine or Guanine Replacements in the TATAAA Element Diminish Gene Expression in Vivo—A set of variant elements was designed based on the first six bases of the natural HIS3 TATA element (TATAAAGT; Table 1). Variants of the TATA element with cytosine bases substituted at each of the first six positions were termed the C series. Because there was a concern about the effect of substituting a purine (adenine) for a pyrimidine (cytosine), a series of guanine base substitutions at each of the first six positions was also constructed (the G series). For all of the variants, the flanking sequences remained identical. To test for transcriptional capability in vivo, each element was cloned individually into the core promoter region of a reporter plasmid containing the GAL1,10 UAS and the HIS3 initiation region driving the expression of a HIS3-LacZ fusion (5Chen W. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2691-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Singer V.L. Wobbe C.R. Struhl K.

This reporter system was used to measure the response to Gal4, a potent acidic activator that stimulates transcription in the presence of galactose. Incubation in galactose medium resulted in a greater than 50-fold induction in β-galactosidase activity for cells containing the TATAAA driven reporter (Table 2). In contrast, the reporters driven by the non-canonical elements exhibited inductions ranging from less than 2-fold to nearly 4-fold, depending on the particular sequence. To determine the impact of altering the TATA sequence on protein-DNA interactions, the extent of TBP-DNA complexes formed on each element was determined in vitro.TABLE 2TATA variants are reduced for activated transcription in vivoElementbThe yeast strain yJS156 was transformed with a HIS3/Lac Z fusion plasmid containing either the canonical TATAAA element or the indicated non-canonical element, driven by the GAL1,10 UAS.Activity relative to TATAAAaβ-Galactosidase activities were performed with cells cultured in medium containing either 2% raffinose or 2% galactose for 18 h.

Open table in a new tab Internal Base Substitutions in the TATA Sequence Can Disrupt TBP Binding—Each of the C series elements was tested for the ability to form the TBP-DNA complex (Fig. 1A). As reported in previous work (11Stewart J. Stargell L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30078-30084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), substitution of the first T position with a C (CATAAA) did not alter the amount of TBP-DNA complex formed compared with TATAAA. Two other elements (TACAAA and TATAAC) also exhibited fairly robust TBP binding (60–70% of TATAAA activity). Substitutions at the second, fourth, and fifth positions with C (TCTAAA, TATCAA, and TATACA) were not as well tolerated, with less than 50% of the TBP-DNA complex formed on TATAAA or CATAAA. TBP-DNA complex formation was also measured on the G series elements (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, a substitution of the sixth position A with G (TATAAG) formed the TBP-DNA complex to the same degree as TATAAA and CATAAA, indicating that retaining a purine at this position is better tolerated than a pyrmidine (compare with TATAAC in Fig. 1). This was also observed for the first and third positions: compare the activity of CATAAA (nearly 100%) to GATAAA (50%); and TACAAA (65%) to TAGAAA (45%). The TATGAA and GATAAA substitutions were the most functional, showing 50% of TATAAA and CATAAA binding. In contrast, the TATAGA element showed the most compromised ability to form the TBP-DNA complex, with less than 30% of the amount of complex formed on the control elements. Higher Order Complex Formation Also Depends on the Sequence of the Core Element—Higher order complex formation was measured for the C series of elements and compared with the binding to the TATAAA element (Fig. 2A). TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex formation on the elements ranged from TCTAAA with 53% of TATAAA binding, to TATCAA showing the most dramatic decrease in TFIIA-TBP-DNA binding (25%). A similar trend was observed with the formation of the TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex on the C series of elements, although TFIIB complexes seem to be more significantly affected by the cytosine base substitutions with activities ranging from 12 to 35% of TATAAA binding (Fig. 2A and 3A).FIGURE 3Complex formation on C- and G-substituted non-canonical elements is sequence dependent. Experimental results from Figs. 1 and 2 are presented graphically to summarize the degree of protein complex formation on the C series (panel A) and G series (panel B) of non-canonical elements. The total amount of binding to the canonical TATA element is shown as a function of the position of the substitution in each element. Data are mean ± the range from two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TFIIA-TBP and TFIIB-TBP complex formation on the G series elements was also determined (Fig. 2B). In the case of TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex formation, the TATAAG element formed this complex to the same extent as TATAAA. In contrast, the remainder of the elements showed varying amounts of the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex formed, with TGTAAA and TAGAAA (both ≅ 7%) showing the most dramatic decreases. In the case of TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex formation, TATAAG and TATGAA formed this complex to a similar extent as TATAAA. The TATGAA element is an interesting case because this element is compromised for both TBP and TFIIA-TBP complex formation but not TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex formation, suggesting a TFIIB-dependent conformational change is stabilizing the TBP-DNA interaction. Conversely, the GATAAA element is much more functional in forming the TBP-DNA and TFIIA-TBP-DNA complexes (50–65% TATAAA binding), but is extremely defective for formation of the TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex (5%). The remaining elements do not show significant TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex formation, with amounts of complex formed at ≤10% of TATAAA (Figs. 2B and 3B). The TFIIA-TBP-DNA Complex Is Destabilized on the TATAAG Element—In the studies presented above, many of the elements have specific alterations in protein-DNA complex formation. However, certain substitutions of the first (with a C) and sixth (with a G) positions do not appear to affect initial complex formation of TBP-DNA, TFIIA-TBP-DNA, or TFIIB-TBP-DNA complexes. We have demonstrated previously that the CATAAA element is unable to form a stable TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex (11Stewart J. Stargell L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30078-30084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that TATAAG may have a similar affect on TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex stability, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to measure the relative binding and stability of the TFIIA-TBP complex on both TATAAA and TATAAG (Fig. 4A). A comparison of the absolute amount of binding of TFIIA-TBP to each of the elements shows very similar amounts of complex formation on both elements. The stability of the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex was determined by examining the dissociation kinetics for the two complexes. The stability of the TFIIA-TBP-TATA complex on TATAAA differs significantly from the complex formed on the TATAAG element. The TFIIA-TBP complex was extremely stable on TATAAA, with little or no loss of complex over the course of the experiment. In contrast, the TFIIA-TBP complex on TATAAG showed significant loss of complex, with almost complete loss of complex over the 2-h time course. Because the stability of the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex is compromised on the TATAAG element, we wished to determine whether this was specific to the TFIIA-TBP complex, or whether a loss of stability is also observed for other complexes. The TBP-DNA complexes form and decay with a similar kinetic rate on both TATAAA and TATAAG (Fig. 4B). The TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex also behaved very similarly on both TATAAA and TATAAG as well (Fig. 4C). In conclusion, TBP binds to TATAAA and TATAAG in such a manner that allows for the stable association of the TFIIB-TBP higher order complex and the difference in stability of the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex on TATAAG, like CATAAA (11Stewart J. Stargell L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30078-30084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), is specific to the complex containing TFIIA. Lack of Stability of the TFIIA-TBP-DNA Complex Is Also Observed for Other Elements—The stability of the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex on the remaining TATAAA variants was also tested. Although the TATCAA, TGTAAA, and TAGAAA elements do not form TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex to the same extent as TATAAA, the amount of complex that does form is stable over the course of the experiment (Fig. 5A). Because complex formation is the result of the association and dissociation rates, this suggests that these elements have different relative on rates and similar off rates as compared with the control TATAAA element. The TCTAAA, TACAAA, TATACA, and TATGAA elements also do not form the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex to the same extent as TATAAA but are moderately stable with approximately a 20% loss of complex during the time course of the competition (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, TATAAC, GATAAA, and TATAGA are very unstable, showing a significant loss of complex over the course of the experiment similar to TATAAG (Fig. 5C). TATAAC, GATAAA, and TATAGA (along with CATAAA and TATAAG) all have substitutions near the ends of the six bases that we examined, suggesting a role for these positions in destabilizing the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex. The Stability of the TFIIB-TBP-DNA Complex Depends Strongly on the Sequence of the TATA Element—Competition studies were conducted to measure the stability of the TFIIB-TBP-DNA on the TATAAA variants. Although the TATAAC, TACAAA, and TCTAAA elements do not form the TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex to the same extent as TATAAA, the kinetics of the loss of complex from these elements is very similar to that of TATAAA (Fig. 6A). The TGTAAA, TAGAAA, TAT-GAA, and TATAGA elements form different initial amounts of the TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex but these elements share the trend that there is nearly complete loss of the complex very quickly during the competition, usually in less than 30 min (Fig. 6B). The final group containing elements TATCAA, TATACA, and GATAAA form very low initial amounts of the TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex, and these complexes are as stable as the TFIIB-TBP-TATAAA complex (Fig. 6C). Fusion of TBP and TFIIA Results in an Increase in Expression from CATAAA and TATAAG in Vivo—The in vitro results suggest that the lack of formation of stable protein-DNA complexes could contribute to the extremely low levels of gene expression observed from several of the non-canonical elements in vivo. One would predict that if these complexes could be stabilized in vivo, this would result in an increase in transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized yeast strains expressing TFIIA-TBP and TFIIB-TBP fusion molecules. Presumably, fusing TBP directly to a subunit of TFIIA (Toa2) or to TFIIB will artificially increase the effective concentration of these proteins at the promoter element being tested. The response to Gal4 in the strain containing the TFIIA-TBP or TFIIB-TBP fusion as the sole source of TBP was measured for all 13 elements using the β-galactosidase assay. Incubation in galactose medium for 18 h resulted in significant induction in activity in both the TFIIA-TBP and TFIIB-TBP fusion strains harboring the TATAAA driven reporter (Fig. 7), as expected for a canonical element. Strikingly, the TFIIA-TBP fusion strains containing the CATAAA and TATAAG driven reporters showed a dramatic increase in activity to ∼30% of TATAAA activity. This increase in CATAAA and TATAAG activity is specific to these elements because none of the other elements showed any increase in activity in the Toa2-TBP fusion strains. Moreover, the increase is specific for TFIIA because no such increase is observed in the TFIIB-TBP fusion strain. Thus, transcriptional output from elements characterized by an unstable TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex can be specifically enhanced by fusing TFIIA and TBP. Recent studies using whole genome analysis have shifted the view of a rigid requirement for the TATA element for transcriptional activity from genes expressed by RNA polymerase II. In fact, it is estimated that less than one-third of promoters actually contain sequences that resemble the classical TATA motif (8Basehoar A.D. Zanton S.J. Pugh B.F.

Ioshikhes I.P. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Inherent flexibility in the TBP-DNA interaction is also suggested by the observations that yeast TBP binds similarly to TATAAA and CATAAA elements (11Stewart J. Stargell L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30078-30084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis TBP binds 10 variations of the adenovirus major late promoter TATA element in a structurally similar manner (18Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). And yet, even subtle sequence variations that still fall within the consensus sequence can alter TBP-TATA interactions (19Bareket-Samish A. Cohen I. Haran T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the observations that the absolute amount of TBP binding to off-consensus elements does not always correlate well with transcriptional activity (20Bernues J. Carrera P. Azorin F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2950-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Diagana T.T. Norht D.L. Jabet C. Fiszman M.Y. Takeda S. Whalen R.G. J. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29782-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicate that there may be significant consequences of alternative TBP-DNA complexes. Taken together, these studies suggest that the TBP-DNA complex may exist in different structural contexts for variant sequences, and this context may also impact downstream steps in the transcription process. Because variant TATA elements play a fundamental role in the proper expression of many eukaryotic genes (9Simon M.C. Fisch T.M. Benecke B.J. Nevins J.R. Heintz N. Cell. 1988; 52: 723-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Meyer T. Carlstedt-Duke J. Starr D.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is essential to determine the mechanisms underlying differential levels of transcription from varying TATA elements. To further explore the role of sequence variation in TATA element function, the in vivo and in vitro properties of a panel of substituted elements were characterized (summarized in Table 3). As expected, each of the elements was capable of binding TBP in vitro, albeit to varying extents. We observed that C and G substitutions at the first and sixth position of the TATA element were better tolerated for TBP binding, whereas substitutions in the middle positions typically resulted in decreased TBP binding. Sensitivity of TBP binding to substitutions in the middle bases of the TATA element are likely to arise from an exocyclic NH2 protruding from G in a C-G or G-C base pair. This protruding group has been predicted to disrupt the TBP-DNA interaction by sterically clashing with hydrophobic residues on the concave undersurface of TBP (18Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Replacement of A for C or G at position 2 clashes with TBP residue Leu-163. A substitution at position 3 from T to G clashes with Val-119. At position 4, the A to C or G replacement clashes with Val-119, and at position 5 the A to C or to G substitution is disallowed by Val-29. These steric clashes are consistent with our results showing that these particular substitutions at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are compromised for TBP binding. In contrast, substitutions at positions 1 (CATAAA) and 6 (TATAAG) are sterically allowed (18Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and we find that these elements can form the TBP-DNA complex to the same extent as TATAAA.TABLE 3Functional comparison of the 14 elements utilized in the studyElementRelative amount of complex formation and stability of the complexaRelative amount of complex formed on the variant sequences versus TATA (set at 100%) using EMSA.

Enhanced gene expression was observed in only two cases (CATAAA and TATAAG). Open table in a new tab TBP recognition of the TATA box sets the stage for the nucleation of the remainder of the pre-initiation complex. TFIIA and TFIIB have each been shown to make direct contacts with TBP and DNA, and in so doing, stabilize the TBP-DNA complex. We found that elements that exhibited a decrease in the TBP-DNA interaction were typically also compromised in forming the higher order complexes with TFIIA and TFIIB. Generally speaking, neither TFIIA nor TFIIB could overcome defects in TBP binding to the TATA variants, with one notable exception. The presence of TFIIB, but not TFIIA, restored TBP binding to the TATGAA element to the level of complex formed on TATAAA. This result suggests that TFIIB specifically introduces a conformational change in the TBP-DNA complex that can overcome the steric clash between the exocyclic NH2 group on the guanine and Val-119 of TBP. Although TATAAG was able to form the initial TBP-DNA, TFIIA-TBP-DNA, and TFIIB-TBP-DNA complexes to the same extent as the control elements TATAAA and CATAAA, measurements of the stability of the TFIIA-TBP-DNA showed that, like CATAAA (11Stewart J. Stargell L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30078-30084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), TATAAG was defective for the formation of a stable TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex. Experiments measuring the stability of the TBP-DNA complex and TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex on TATAAG revealed that these complexes behaved indistinguishably from TATAAA and CATAAA. Therefore, the difference in stability of protein complexes formed on CATAAA and TATAAG is specific to the higher order complex containing TFIIA and a TFIIA-TBP fusion molecule can restore activity from these two elements in vivo (whereas a TFIIB-TBP fusion could not). Significantly, the other TATA variants did not show an increase in transcriptional activity in the TFIIA-TBP fusion strain even though some of these elements showed measurable loss of TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex during the competition experiments. Thus, stabilizing the TFIIA-TBP interaction could only restore activity from the elements CATAAA and TATAAG, where the stability of the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex appears to be the primary mechanistic defect. Why study variant TATA elements? It is clear from the analysis of yeast and higher eukaryotic promoter sequences that a majority of genes do not possess TATA elements that match the consensus (8Basehoar A.D. Zanton S.J. Pugh B.F.

In addition, whole genome approaches reveal that a consensus TATA element does not appear to be a major indicator of in vivo TBP binding or gene expression (27Kim J. Iyer V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8104-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As such, determining the properties of variant TATA elements with regard to preinitiation complex formation and in vivo gene expression is fundamental for advancing our understanding of the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1977882151,"The plant toxin ricin is synthesized in castor bean seeds as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted precursor. Removal of the signal peptide generates proricin in which the mature A- and B-chains are joined by an intervening propeptide and a 9-residue propeptide persists at the N terminus. The two propeptides are ultimately removed in protein storage vacuoles, where ricin accumulates. Here we have demonstrated that the N-terminal propeptide of proricin acts as a nonspecific spacer to ensure efficient ER import and glycosylation. Indeed, when absent from the N terminus of ricin A-chain, the non-imported material remained tethered to the cytosolic face of the ER membrane, presumably by the signal peptide. This species appeared toxic to ribosomes. The propeptide does not, however, influence catalytic activity per se or the vacuolar targeting of proricin or the rate of retrotranslocation/degradation of A-chain in the cytosol. The likely implications of these findings to the survival of the toxin-producing tissue are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2101862937,"Self-assembly via coiled-coil domains (CC) is crucial for the regulation of the dystrophia myotonica kinase (DMPK) -related family of kinases. These CC domains are thought to form dimeric arrangements and thus to mediate dimerization in these enzymes. Using size exclusion chromatography combined with multiangle static light scattering, we analyzed the oligomeric state of DMPK as well as that of a truncated variant lacking the CC fraction. Remarkably, both forms were found to assemble into robust dimers. In contrast, the CC domain in isolation yielded trimeric assemblies, indicating that the oligomerization properties of CC domains from this kinase family are more diversified than anticipated. The crystal structure of this CC has been elucidated to 1.6 angstroms resolution and its properties in solution established using sedimentation equilibrium and thermal denaturation. These data show that, contrary to expectations, the self-assembly of DMPK is not dictated by the association properties of its CC domain. Instead, it appears to be driven by sequence segments flanking both N and C termini of the catalytic kinase fraction, as suggested by models of head-to-head dimers based on small angle X-ray scattering data. Our findings support a shared pattern of assembly across DMPK, ROCKs, and MRCK members of this family."
https://openalex.org/W1983241112,"Gas sensory heme proteins respond to their environment by binding a specific gas molecule to heme and transmitting this primary binding signal to the protein. How the binding signal is transmitted from the heme to the protein remains to be clarified. Using UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy, we investigated this pathway in sperm whale myoglobin as a model gas sensory heme protein. Based on the UVRR data and the effects of deleting one of three important pathways (His-93, 6-propionate, or 7-propionate), we determined the changes in the conformation of globin that occur upon binding of CO, nitric oxide (NO), or O2 to heme and how they are transmitted from heme to globin. The UVRR results show that heme discriminates different ligands, resulting in different conformations in the globin protein. Specifically, NO induces changes in the spectrum of Trp residues in the A-helix that are significantly different from those induced by O2 or CO binding. On the other hand, binding of O2 to heme produces changes in the Tyr residues of the H-helix that are different from those induced by CO or NO binding. Furthermore, we found that cleavage of the Fe-His-93 covalent bond eliminates communication to the terminal region of the H-helix and that the 7-propionate hydrogen-bonding network is essential for transmitting the CO or NO binding signal to the N and C termini. Finally, the 6-propionate is important only for NO binding. Thus, the hydrogen-bonding network in the protein appears to be critical for intramolecular signal transduction in gas sensory heme proteins.

Biol. 1977; 110: 569-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 6Kachalova G.S. Popov A.N. Bartunik H.D. Science. 1999; 284: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 7Brucker E.A.

J. 1999; 77: 2153-2164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The out-of-plane displacement of the iron atom is thought to be responsible for a conformational change between the deoxy and ligated forms of Mb. Our previous ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) experiments, wherein Mb was excited at 244 nm, suggested that slight structural changes in Trp-7 and Tyr-151 occur upon CO binding (9Haruta N. Aki M. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6956-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, time-resolved resonance Raman (RR) measurements of the Fe-His stretching mode with visible laser pulses have demonstrated that, for Mb, the structural change takes place rapidly (time constant of ∼120 ps) (10Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Chem. Rec. 2001; 1: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the transmission of the heme structural change to globin via His-93 has become a matter of controversy because a fast structural change has also been observed for the Gly-93(+Imd) mutant, which lacks the Fe-His covalent bond (11Franzen S. Bohn B. Poyart C. DePillis G. Boxer S.G. Martin J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1718-1720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates the hydrogen-bonding networks in the vicinity of heme in sperm whale Mb (swMb) as revealed by x-ray crystallography (6Kachalova G.S. Popov A.N. Bartunik H.D. Science. 1999; 284: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The proximal His (His-93) forms hydrogen bonds with Ser-92 and Leu-89. The CO2− group of the propionate side chain at position 7 forms hydrogen bonds with His-97 and Ser-92, whereas the CO2− group of the propionate side chain at position 6 participates in a hydrogen-bonding network with Arg-45, H2O, and His-64 (distal His). It is very likely that these hydrogen-bonding systems transmit conformational changes in heme upon ligand binding to the globin protein. We next examined swMb by UVRR spectroscopy to explore the role of hydrogen bonds in this communication process. We first analyzed the conformational changes in Mb upon binding of various gaseous ligands (CO, NO, and O2). We found that heme discriminates between different ligands by inducing significantly different conformations in the A- and H-helices. Furthermore, we monitored the UVRR spectral changes of Trp and Tyr residues that occur upon CO and NO binding to versions of Mb in which the predicted pathways for transmission of conformational changes (His-93, 6-propionate, or 7-propionate) were eliminated by mutation or chemical modification of the heme. We found that the 7-propionate hydrogen-bonding network in the heme proximal site is essential for communicating the conformational changes to the N and C termini upon binding of CO or NO to heme, whereas the 6-propionate pathway is important only for the communication of NO binding. Furthermore, we found that cleavage of the Fe-His-93 covalent bond eliminates the communication to the C terminus. Sample Preparation—Native (NT) swMb (Biozyme) and horse Mb (hMb, Sigma) were used without further purification. Mb mutants including W7F-, W14F-, H93G(+Imd), S92A, and R45L Mb were expressed and purified as described previously (12Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3057-3060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Barrick D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) with some modifications (9Haruta N. Aki M. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6956-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Chemically modified hemes in which the 7- (7M6P) or 6-propionate (6M7P) of protoporphyrin IX was replaced by a methyl group were synthesized as described elsewhere (14Hayashi T. Nakagawa T. Harada K. Matsuo T. Hitomi Y. Hisaeda Y. Chem. Lett. 2004; 33: 1512-1513Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Fe(III) complexes were reconstituted into the swMb apoprotein (15Hauksson J.B. La Mar G.N. Pandey R.K. Rezzano I.N. Smith K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 6198-6205Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Fe-CO and Fe-His stretching modes of these preparations observed with visible RR spectra were not significantly different from those of the NT Mb, although the heme spectra in the lower frequency region were distinct from that of the NT protein. For UVRR measurements, the concentration of protein was adjusted to 200 and 300 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for excitation at 229 and 244 nm, respectively. As an internal intensity standard for UVRR difference spectra, 400 and 100 mm Na2SO4 were included in the samples for excitation at 229 and 244 nm, respectively. The ferric form of NT swMb was directly used from the commercial product. DeoxyMb was prepared by adding a minimal amount of sodium dithionite solution (final concentration 1-2 mm) to the protein solution under a nitrogen atmosphere. The O2-bound form was prepared by passing the dithionite-reduced Mb protein through a small Sephadex G25 column under aerobic conditions and then saturating the sample with oxygen by flushing it with pure oxygen gas in a sealed Raman cell. The CO or NO adducts of Mb were prepared by introducing pure CO or NO gas into the Raman cell with an airtight syringe through a rubber septum. The formation of six-coordinate ligand-bound forms was confirmed by examining the optical absorption spectra. UV Resonance Raman Measurements—UV resonance Raman measurements were performed as described previously (16Aki M. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 10765-10774Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The UV probe light at 229 or 244 nm was generated by an intracavity frequency-doubled argon ion laser (Coherent; Innova 300 FReD). The second harmonic in the laser output was separated from the fundamental with a Pellin-Broca prism and focused into a protein sample solution. An ∼100-μl aliquot of the sample solution was placed into a spinning cell with a stirring function (16Aki M. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 10765-10774Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Light scattered at a right angle was collected with the objective lens of a UV microscope, dispersed with a 126-cm single monochromator (Spex 1269) equipped with a 3600 groove/mm holographic grating, and detected with an intensified charge-coupled detector (Princeton Instruments; model ICCD-1024MG-E/1). The laser power at the sample point was 0.2-0.3 milliwatt, and the spectral resolutions were set at 6.9 and 7.8 cm-1 for 244 and 229 nm excitations, respectively. The protein sample was replaced with fresh one every 5-10 min, and the total exposure time to obtain each spectrum was ∼1 h. The integrity of the sample after exposure to UV laser light was confirmed by comparing the visible absorption spectra obtained before and after the UVRR measurements. If some spectral changes were found, the Raman spectrum was discarded. Raman shifts were calibrated with cyclohexane, trichloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, and toluene. Changes in the 229-nm-excited UVRR Spectrum of Mb upon Binding of Different Ligands—Fig. 2 shows the raw 229-nm-excited UVRR spectrum of the deoxy (a) form of NT swMb and the deoxy - ferric (b), deoxy - O2 (c), deoxy - CO (d), and deoxy - NO (e) difference spectra for NT swMb. The raw spectrum of NT swMb is dominated by the bands arising from two Trp (Trp-7 and Trp-14) and three Tyr (Tyr-103, Tyr-146, and Tyr-151) residues, which are labeled W and Y, respectively, followed by their mode numbers (17Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems, Advances in Spectroscopy. Vol. 13. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 113-175Google Scholar). Because the protein concentrations are the same in all measurements performed at a given excitation wavelength, the intensities of the Raman features were comparable in all of the raw spectra. The difference spectra were calculated so that the band for SO42− (981 cm-1), which was present at the same level in all samples as an internal intensity standard, would be zero. Difference spectrum b shows strong negative bands at 758 (W18), 877 (W17), 1011 (W16), 1359 (W7), 1558 (W3), and 1616 cm-1 (Y8a/W1), indicating an increase in the intensity of the Trp and Tyr bands in the ferric form. Because of the importance of the physiological ligand, O2, for Mbs, we examined the UVRR spectral changes of NT Mb upon binding of O2. It is known that in the O2-bound form, the heme iron is rapidly photo-oxidized even at very low laser power. The absorption spectra showed that the sample was partially photo-oxidized to the ferric form (∼30%) after exposure to the UV light, independent of solution in the pH range between 7 and 9. Thus, to obtain the spectrum of the O2-bound form, we subtracted the contribution of the spectrum of the ferric form from the observed spectrum. The resulting UVRR spectral changes upon O2 binding are displayed in spectrum c. The low signal-to-noise ratio of spectrum c is due to this double-difference procedure. The deoxy - O2 spectrum (c) reveals small features near the W18, W16, and W3 bands, implying that the intensity of the Trp Raman bands is slightly enhanced in the O2-bound form. Spectrum d displays negative features similar to those observed upon O2 binding (c); however, the features at the W16 and W18 modes seem to be stronger in the CO-bound than the O2-bound form (Supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, spectrum e (deoxy - NO) yields very strong positive peaks for almost all Trp bands, indicating a large decrease in intensity for the Trp bands in the NO-bound form. Thus, the UVRR difference spectra show that, upon NO binding, the Trp Raman bands undergo spectral changes that are the opposite of those that occur upon CO and O2 binding. Assignment of Trp Spectral Changes Induced by CO Binding in the 229-nm-excited Spectra—Fig. 3 displays the raw UVRR spectrum of the deoxy form (a) of NT swMb excited at 229 nm and the deoxy - CO difference spectra for NT (b), W14F- (c), and W7F-Mb (d). The frequency of the W17 band (∼875 cm-1) serves as a marker of hydrogen bonding of the Trp indole ring (18Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This band of NT Mb (a) appears at 877 cm-1, indicating moderate strength of hydrogen bonding, consistent with the crystal structure, wherein both Trp-7 and Trp-14 form hydrogen bonds with water molecules (6Kachalova G.S. Popov A.N. Bartunik H.D. Science. 1999; 284: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The W7 band appears as a doublet at 1360/1340 cm-1 in the raw spectrum of NT Mb (a). The expanded spectra W7 bands of the W7F- and W14F-Mb are displayed in Fig. 3, inset A. This doublet arises from Fermi resonance between the N1-C8 stretching fundamental (W7 mode) and the combination of out-of-plane bending vibrations (17Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems, Advances in Spectroscopy. Vol. 13. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 113-175Google Scholar). The intensity ratio of the W7 doublet serves as a marker of the hydrophobicity of the environment around the indole ring (17Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems, Advances in Spectroscopy. Vol. 13. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 113-175Google Scholar, 18Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The I1358/I1340 ratio for Trp-14 is larger than that for Trp-7, which is consistent with the fact that Trp-14 is buried in a more hydrophobic environment than Trp-7 (5Takano T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 569-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 6Kachalova G.S. Popov A.N. Bartunik H.D. Science. 1999; 284: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The frequency of the Trp W3 mode is sensitive to the absolute value of the torsion angle (|χ2,1|) about the bond (Cβ-C3) connecting the indole ring to the peptide main chain (18Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It appears at 1558 cm-1 in spectrum a, and expanded spectra for NT and the W14F- and W7F-Mb (Fig. 3, inset B) indicate that the more precise frequencies are 1557 cm-1 for Trp-7 and 1560 cm-1 for Trp-14. The 1557 cm-1 band for Trp-7 suggests a χ2,1 of 114°, which is comparable with the value of 118° determined from the crystal structure (6Kachalova G.S. Popov A.N. Bartunik H.D. Science. 1999; 284: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar); however, the frequency of 1560 cm-1 for Trp-14 is unexpectedly high and does not fit well with the empirical correlation curve (18Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3b, the W18, W17, W16, W7, and W3 bands of NT Mb exhibit prominent negative features, implying an increase in intensity of the Trp bands in the CO-bound form. Similar features have been observed for the W14F-Mb (Fig. 3c). The difference spectrum of W7F-Mb (Fig. 3d), however, displays no such negative features. These results indicate that the spectral changes that occur in NT Mb upon CO binding mainly arise from Trp-7 rather than from Trp-14. Changes in the 229-nm-excited UVRR Spectrum upon CO Binding to Mb with a Modified Heme and Mutant Mbs—Fig. 4 shows the raw UVRR spectrum of NT deoxyMb (a) excited at 229 nm and the deoxy - CO difference spectra for NT (b), H93G(+Imd) (c), 6M7P- (d), 7M6P- (e), and S92A Mb (f). Unexpectedly, the difference spectrum for H93G(+Imd) (c), in which exogenous imidazole is bound as a ligand of iron instead of His-93, is very similar to that of NT (b) despite the absence of a covalent bond between the heme and globin. Because this strongly suggests that the Fe-His-93 bond is not directly responsible for the spectral change of Trp-7, we examined other possibilities by obtaining spectra d-f. As described by Hayashi et al. (14Hayashi T. Nakagawa T. Harada K. Matsuo T. Hitomi Y. Hisaeda Y. Chem. Lett. 2004; 33: 1512-1513Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we synthesized the modified iron-protoporphyrins in which the 6- or 7-propionate is selectively replaced by a methyl group and used them to reconstitute Mb apoprotein (6M7P- and 7M6P-Mb, respectively). The deoxy - CO difference UVRR spectra were obtained in a similar way as for NT Mb. The difference spectrum of 6M7P-Mb (d) exhibits negative features for Trp bands similar to those observed for NT Mb (b). In contrast, the difference spectrum of 7M6P-Mb (e) shows small positive/large negative peaks at 750/760 and 1006/1014 cm-1. In addition, a strong negative peak appeared at 1562 cm-1 (W3) in contrast to the negative peak at 1557 cm-1 in spectra b-d (Fig. 4, inset). This frequency shift is probably caused by an upshift of the Trp-7 W3 band coupled with a large increase in intensity upon CO binding and may indicate a slight increase (10°-20°) in the χ2,1 angle of Trp-7 (9Haruta N. Aki M. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6956-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar); however, we cannot rule out the possibility that Trp-14 undergoes spectral changes in 7M6P-Mb because W3 of Trp-14 is located at 1560 cm-1. Regardless, the spectrum of 7M6P-Mb (e) differs significantly from the spectra of NT and H93G(+Imd) Mb, indicating that the structural change in Trp-7 was perturbed by removal of the 7-propionate group or its hydrogen-bonding network. To confirm the effect of hydrogen bonding by 7-propionate, its hydrogen-bonding partner, Ser-92 (Fig. 1), was replaced with Ala (Fig. 4, spectrum f). Its spectrum is similar to spectrum e but different from spectrum b. Furthermore, the difference spectra (e and f) reveal a derivative pattern near 1616 cm-1, indicating an upshift of the Y8a/W1 frequency in the CO-bound form, whereas this frequency is not up shifted in spectra b-d. Consequently, we concluded that the structural change of heme upon CO binding is communicated to Trp-7 via the hydrogen-bonding network through the 7-propionate and Ser-92. Assignments of Spectral Changes upon NO Binding in the 229-nm-excited Spectra—Fig. 5 displays the raw UVRR spectrum of the deoxy form of NT Mb (a) and the deoxy - NO difference spectra of NT (b), W14F- (c), and W7F-Mb (d), respectively. Spectrum b has strong positive peaks at W18, W17, W16, W7, and W3 mode, indicating a large decrease in the intensity of Trp bands in the NO-bound form. Some weak positive features are observed in the spectrum for Trp-7 (W14F-Mb; c), whereas the spectrum for Trp-14 (W7F-Mb; d) has stronger positive features. More precisely, the doublet-like positive peak for W18 in spectrum b arises from the contributions of both Trp-7 (c) and Trp-14 (d), which have slightly different W18 frequencies and intensities (Fig. 5, inset). On the other hand, the W16, W7, and W3 bands in the spectrum for NT Mb (b) can be regarded as the summation of spectra c and d, that is, simple addition of the changes in Trp-7 and Trp-14. Thus, both Trp-7 and Trp-14 show spectral changes upon NO binding. UVRR Spectral Changes of Mb Mutants upon NO Binding in the 229-nm-excited Spectra—Fig. 6 shows the raw UVRR spectrum of the deoxy form of NT swMb (a) and the deoxy - NO difference spectra for NT (b), H93G(+Imd) (c), S92A (d), and R45L Mb (e). The spectra for H93G(+Imd) (c) and NT Mb (b) are the same and show positive bands at W18, W17, W16, W7, and W3 mode. In contrast, mainly negative features are observed in the difference spectra for S92A (d) and R45L Mb (e). The spectrum for S92A Mb (d), which is expected to reflect the contribution of hydrogen bonding through the 7-propionate, exhibits large negative/small positive peaks at 753/771 and 1007/1013 cm-1, which are produced from frequency downshifts of W18 and W16 upon NO binding, respectively, and negative peaks at 1558 and 1616 cm-1. On the other hand, R45L Mb, which is expected to reflect the contribution of hydrogen bonding through the 6-propionate, yields mainly negative peaks. Thus, the spectral changes observed upon NO binding for H93G(+Imd) and NT Mb are similar, whereas the spectral changes for both S92A and R45L Mb are distinct. Changes in the 244-nm-excited UVRR Spectrum of Mb upon Binding of Different Ligands—The raw UVRR spectrum of the deoxy form of NT swMb is shown in Fig. 7, trace a. The Tyr bands are significantly enhanced when compared with Fig. 2a. Trace b shows the deoxy - CO difference spectrum of NT swMb, revealing a derivative pattern near 1177 cm-1 (Y9a), thus indicating an upshift of the Y9a frequency in the CO-bound form. This change was not observed for hMb, which lacks Tyr-151 (replaced by Phe) and therefore is attributed to Tyr-151 in swMb (9Haruta N. Aki M. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6956-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The most prominent feature in spectrum b is a positive peak at 1619 cm-1, which is due to a decrease in intensity of the Y8a band in the CO-bound form. It may also contain contributions from C=C stretching of heme vinyl groups. In addition, it shows a positive feature at 1560 cm-1, indicating an increased intensity of W3 in the deoxy form. These changes in spectrum b are identical to those observed previously by Haruta et al. (9Haruta N. Aki M. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6956-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fig. 7, traces c and d, show the difference spectra of the deoxy - NO forms of swMb and hMb, respectively, and traces e and f show the difference spectra of deoxy - O2 and deoxy - ferric forms of swMb, respectively. The intensity-normalized raw spectra of the Y9a band are displayed in the inset for the ligand-bound (dotted line) and -free forms (solid line) as references for the difference spectra shown in traces b-f. Trace c reveals a derivative feature at 1177 cm-1 and a positive band at 1619 cm-1, similar to those observed upon CO binding. To assign the spectral change of the Y9a band observed upon NO binding by swMb, we examined the UVRR spectra of hMb, which lacks Tyr-151. Trace d shows the deoxy - NO difference spectrum of NT hMb, which has a small negative peak instead of a derivative. This indicates a small increase in intensity without a frequency shift for Tyr-103 and Tyr-146 upon NO binding. Accordingly, the upshift in Y9a upon NO binding in swMb can be attributed to Tyr-151. We additionally examined the UVRR spectral changes of NT Mb upon binding of O2 and subtracted the ferric contribution to the O2-bound form in a way similar to that carried out for the 229 nm excitation (Fig. 2c). The UVRR spectral changes upon O2 binding, displayed in spectrum e, reveal a positive feature near Y9a, implying a decrease in intensity for the O2-bound form. We noted that the reduction in intensity of Y9a upon O2 binding is coupled with a frequency upshift (Fig. 7, inset). In addition, the Y8a band (1619 cm-1) of the O2-bound form (e) appears less intense than the positive peaks in spectra b and c. We further noted that trace f displays features at W3 and Y8a distinct from those observed upon O2 binding. Therefore, we concluded that the spectral changes of Tyr caused by O2 binding, especially those near the Y9a band (traces b-e), differ from those observed caused by NO and CO binding. Changes in the 244-nm-excited UVRR Spectrum upon CO Binding to Mb with a Modified Heme and Mutant Mbs—Fig. 8 shows the raw UVRR spectrum of the deoxy form of NT swMb excited at 244 nm and the deoxy - CO difference spectra of NT (b), H93G(+Imd) (c), 6M7P- (d), R45L (e), 7M6P- (f), and S92A Mb (g). H93G(+Imd) (c) exhibits a negative Y9a peak, which appears to be different from other spectra. Arg-45 is a hydrogen-bonding partner of 6-propionate (Fig. 1), and, therefore, its mutation to Leu disrupts the hydrogen-bonding network through 6-propionate. The difference spectra for 6M7P- (d) and R45L Mb (e) are very similar and have features like those observed for NT Mb (b). On the contrary, the features at 1558 and 1619 cm-1 in 7M6P-Mb (f) are distinct from those in spectrum b. To confirm that the spectral change in 7M6P-Mb is due to changes in the hydrogen-bonding network, we changed the hydrogen-bonding partner of 7-propionate from Ser to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. The results are shown in spectrum g. As expected, the overall features of spectra f and g are similar, but the effects of 7M6P and S92A on Y9a at 1177 cm-1 (spectra f and g, respectively) are slightly different; the S92A mutation (g) gives rise to a derivative pattern at Y9a similar to that of NT Mb (b), whereas a small negative feature is observed for 7M6P-Mb (f). Conformational Changes in the N Terminus upon Ligand Binding—There are two Trp residues in the A-helix of swMb. These residues can be used in UVRR spectroscopy to probe the conformational changes in the N terminus upon ligand binding because they provide information about the protein tertiary structure in solution. We found that the intensity of the 229-nm-excited Trp-7 signal is enhanced in the CO-bound form. On the other hand, binding of NO to the heme reduces the intensity of both Trp-7 and Trp-14 Raman bands. The intensities of the Trp bands are known to be sensitive to environmental hydrophobicity and/or hydrogen-bonding interactions of the Trp side chain (18Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Rodgers K.R. Su C. Subramaniam S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 55-127Google Scholar). Because a frequency shift is not observed for the hydrogen bond marker band (877 cm-1), we inferred that the hydrogen bonds between Trp-7 or Trp-14 and water molecules hardly change during the transition from the deoxy to the CO- or NO-bound forms. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the hydrophobicity around Trp-7 only changes upon CO binding, whereas the hydrophobicity around both Trp-7 and Trp-14 changes upon NO binding. W7 mode is known as a marker for environmental hydrophobicity around Trp (18Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The ratio of the intensity of the W7 doublet bands (I1358/I1340) confirmed that the hydrophobicity around Trp-7 only changes upon CO binding, whereas the hydrophobicity around bo"

The rationale is that RhoA and PKD regulate common biological responses during T cell development, but there is nothing known about their interdependence. In fibroblasts, Rho function is required for activation of PKD catalytic activity. However, the data show that activation of Rho is neither sufficient nor essential for PKD activation in T cells. One alternative explanation for the apparent convergence of PKD and Rho signaling in T cells is that PKD responses might be Rho-dependent. To address this latter possibility, we probed the Rho requirements for the actions of constitutively active PKD mutants in pre-T cells of transgenic mice. Active PKD can localize to either the plasma membrane or the cytosol, and we therefore compared the Rho requirements for the actions of membrane- or cytosol-localized PKD. Here we show that membrane-localized PKD regulation of pre-T cell differentiation is Rho-dependent, but the actions of cytosol-localized PKD are not. These studies demonstrate that a Rho requirement for PKD activation is not ubiquitous. Moreover, links between PKD and Rho are determined by the cellular location of PKD.

These studies demonstrate that a Rho requirement for PKD activation is not ubiquitous. Moreover, links between PKD and Rho are determined by the cellular location of PKD. Protein kinase D1 is a member of a conserved family of serine/threonine kinases that includes PKD2 and PKCν/PKD3 (1Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol.

Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region contains the serine/threonine catalytic kinase domain that shares homology with the calmodulin-dependent kinases. PKDs are expressed ubiquitously and can be activated by a wide variety of physiological stimuli, including growth factors, neuropeptides, and oxidative stress (4Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PKDs are particularly abundant in lymphocytes where they are selectively activated by triggering of antigen receptors (5Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Exp.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6245-6251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The activation of PKD in lymphocytes requires DAG binding and protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser-744 and 748) within the activation loop of the catalytic domain (1Rozengurt E.

As well, a recently proposed function for PKD in lymphocytes is the phosphorylation of class II histone deacetylases (8Vega R.B. Harrison B.C. Meadows E. Roberts C.R. Papst P.J. Olson E.N.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13762-13770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The activation of PKD by antigen receptors is a sustained response and is also associated with changes in PKD intracellular location (11Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the initial phase of lymphocyte activation there is a rapid translocation of PKD to the plasma membrane. However, during sustained activation, PKD relocates to the cytosol where it remains active for a prolonged period of time (11Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The function of PKD at these different locations has been probed in an in vivo model using active PKD mutants targeted to either the plasma membrane or the cytosol of pre-T cells of transgenic mice. Studies of these mice have shown that PKD can substitute for the pre-T cell receptor and induce both proliferation and differentiation of T cell progenitors in the thymus. Moreover, cellular localization of PKD within a thymocyte is critical; membrane-targeted and cytosolic PKD thus control different facets of pre-T cell differentiation (12Marklund U. Lightfoot K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The idea that PKD function is determined by its intracellular localization is supported by more recent studies showing that Golgi-localized PKD regulates phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ, whereas PKD localized to the mitochondria controls NF-κB-induced expression of SOD2, a gene involved in apoptosis (13Hausser A. Storz P. Martens S. Link G. Toker A. Pfizenmaier K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 14Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8520-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).PKDs are substrates for PKCs (15Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but other than this connection little is known about where PKD is positioned relative to other signal transduction pathways. A number of recent studies have shown links between PKD and Rho GTPases. Hence, a genetic screen for signaling pathways involved in regulating the class II histone deacetylases in COS cells not only identified PKD2 but also RhoA, RhoC, and the guanine nucleotide exchange factors RhoGEF1 and RhoGEF5 as histone deacetylase regulators (16Chang S. Bezprozvannaya S. Li S. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8120-8125Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PKD activation has also been shown to be required for secretion of a gut peptide, neurotensin, from endocrine cells, and critical upstream regulators include PKCα, PKCδ, and the Rho/ROK pathway (17Li J. O'Connor K.L. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28466-28474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of phospholipase C-ϵ by heterotrimeric G proteins, Gα12/13 requires a direct interaction of RhoA with phospholipase C-ϵ, implicating RhoA function in lipid metabolism (18Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41253-41258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The simplest model for Rho involvement in PKD signal transduction has been proposed in fibroblasts where bombesin stimulation via G13 heterotrimeric proteins activates PKD in a PKC-dependent pathway, which also requires Rho function (17Li J. O'Connor K.L. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28466-28474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Yuan J.

Physiol. 2006; 290: C1469-C1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).The relationship between PKD and RhoA in T cells has not been examined directly, but there is circumstantial evidence for a connection. For example, both PKD and RhoA are involved in the Rap1A-mediated pathways that regulate β1 integrins (7Medeiros R.B. Dickey D.M. Chung H. Quale A.C. Nagarajan L.R. Billadeau D.D. Shimizu Y. Immunity. 2005; 23: 213-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Vielkind S. Gallagher-Gambarelli M. Gomez M. Hinton H.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is also known that RhoA, like PKD, can control pre-T cell differentiation (22Henning S.W. Galandrini R. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2397-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hence, the loss of Rho function severely impairs T cell development and prevents pre-T cell receptor and p56 lck-induced thymocyte differentiation (23Henning S.W. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Cleverley S. Henning S. Cantrell D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One explanation for the shared ability of PKD and RhoA to control T cell responses is that as in fibroblasts, RhoA is required for PKD activation in T cells. In this respect, in B lymphocytes RhoA regulates antigen receptor-induced production and hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a key step for the production of DAG that mediates PKD activation (25Saci A. Carpenter C.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, whether Rho regulation of PKD activation occurs in T cells is not known.In this study the objective is to explore the involvement of Rho in PKD signal transduction in T cells because both PKD and RhoA are important signal transduction molecules in T cells, but it is not known whether they work independently. The present results found that RhoA activation is not sufficient or essential for PKD activation in T lymphocytes. There is a requirement for RhoA function for T cell responses triggered by PKD, but the PKD dependence on Rho is determined by the cellular location of this serine kinase. Links between PKD and Rho signal transduction thus differ depending on cell lineage, cell stimulus, and intracellular location of PKD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs—Vectors encoding a chimeric fusion protein between green fluorescent protein (GFP) and wild type PKD1 or the constitutively active membrane-targeted PKD have been described before (6Wood C.D. Marklund U. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6245-6251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Marklund U. Lightfoot K. Cantrell D.

Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar).Cell Preparation and Stimulation—The human T lymphoma line Jurkat 6.2 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of Jurkat was carried out by electroporation at 310 V, 950 microfarads using a 4-mm cuvette (Bio-Rad Gene Pulsar Xcell). Cells were allowed to recover overnight before experimental use. Cell stimulation was carried out using medium alone, 10 μg/ml of the anti-CD3 antibody, UCHT1, or 20 ng/ml phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate for 10 min at 37 °C. Stimulated cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to Western blot analysis.SRE Reporter Gene Assays—Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were carried out essentially as described (28Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr.

A TKCAT reporter plasmid controlled by two copies of the serum-response element (SRE) was described previously (30Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells were transfected as described above with an SRE-CAT reporter gene comprising V14RhoA (2 μg) alone or with C3 transferase constructs (5 μg). Cells were collected after 24 h, washed with PBS, and analyzed for CAT activity. Briefly, cells were lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (0.65% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) for 10 min on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysate was heat-treated at 68 °C for 10 min before use. Lysates were incubated in a solution containing 150 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.05 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol, and 2 mm acetyl coenzyme A for 24 h. Chloramphenicols were extracted with ice-cold ethyl acetate, and the amount of radioactivity in the acetylated products and nonacetylated substrate was determined by liquid scintillation counting of organic and aqueous phases, respectively. Results are expressed as percentage conversion of chloramphenicol to the acetylated form.Cell Lysis and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C (20 × 106 cells/ml) using 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm iodoacetamide, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Soluble proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 1.5 volumes of acetone and incubated at –20 °C for at least 1 h. Protein concentrates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected by Western blotting analysis with the appropriate antibodies. Phospho-Ser-916 PKD antibody has been described previously and was used to detected PKD activity (26Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). PKD phospho-Ser-744/748 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Monoclonal GFP antibody was used in Western blot analysis to verify expression levels. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Transgenic Mice—Mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the transgenic animal unit. Transgenic mice expressing the constitutively active membrane-targeted PKD or cytosolic targeted PKD in the thymus under the control of CD2 promoter and locus control region have been described previously (12Marklund U. Lightfoot K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). C3 transgenic mice, which selectively express the bacterial toxin C3 transferase under the control of CD2 promoter and locus control region in the thymus, have been described in detail elsewhere (24Cleverley S. Henning S. Cantrell D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Flow Cytometric Analysis—Fluorescein isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin (PE), allophycocyanin, and biotin-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen. Tricolor-conjugated antibodies or streptavidin were from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). Cells were stained for cell surface markers and analyzed on a FACSCalibur fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using CellQuest software. CD4–CD8– double negative T cell subsets were analyzed for CD44 and CD25 expression by lineage exclusion of mature DP and SP cells as well as non-T cell lineage cells using a mixture of biotinylated antibodies (CD4, CD8, CD3 B220, Mac-1, NK, Gr-1, and γδ) revealed with streptavidin tricolor and costained with CD25-FITC, CD44-PE, and Thy1.2-APC. Surface expression of membrane-targeted PKD was assessed using the Ox34 monoclonal antibody as described (12Marklund U. Lightfoot K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Intracellular TCRβ staining was carried out on thymocyte subpopulations by antibody staining, which were subsequently fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and permeabilized with saponin buffer (0.5% saponin, 5% FBS, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were incubated with PE-conjugated TCRβ antibody for 45 min at room temperature in saponin buffer, washed in saponin buffer, and analyzed by FACS. Cell surface binding sites were blocked using biotinylated TCRβ antibody, and specificity of staining was verified by parallel staining with PE-conjugated isotype-matched control antibody (Armenian hamster IgG group 2λ).RESULTSPKD Activation Does Not Require Endogenous RhoA Function—The activity of RhoA is required for PKD activation in fibroblasts and intestinal cells (19Yuan J. Slice L.W. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38619-38627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (17Li J. O'Connor K.L. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28466-28474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Song J. Li J. Lulla A. Evers B.M. Chung D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C1469-C1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of endogenous RhoA in PKD activation in lymphocytes, the effects of expressing Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase, which selectively inhibits RhoA function, on antigen receptor activation of PKD in T cells was examined. C. botulinum C3 transferase ADP-ribosylates Asn-41 on RhoA, thereby preventing its ability to regulate downstream targets. The data in Fig. 1A show the impact of C3 transferase expression on PKD activation induced by T cell antigen receptor ligation or following exposure to the phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, a pharmacological mimic of DAG. PKD activation is mediated by phosphorylation of residues Ser-744 and Ser-748 in the catalytic domain of the enzyme, and this results in immediate autophosphorylation of PKD1 on a C-terminal autophosphorylation site, Ser-916. Accordingly, PKD1 catalytic activity “in vivo” (i.e. in an intact cell) can be monitored using phospho-specific antisera that selectively recognize PKD molecules phosphorylated on Ser-744/748 or Ser-916.The data (Fig. 1A) show that both phorbol ester and antigen receptor activation of PKD in lymphocytes is accompanied by phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748 and Ser-916. These TCR and phorbol ester responses were not blocked by expression of C3 transferase indicating that TCR-induced activation of PKD can occur in the absence of endogenous Rho function. ADP-ribosylated RhoA has reduced electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE. The efficacy of C3 transferase in terms of RhoA ribosylation was thus confirmed by Western blot analysis of RhoA (Fig. 1B). Additionally, C3 transferase could block the transcriptional activation of serum-response factor (SRF) by expression of constitutively active V14RhoA in T cells (Fig. 1C).In COS7 cells expression of active mutants of RhoA can stimulate basal activity of PKD (19Yuan J. Slice L.W. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38619-38627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the effect of expressing V14RhoA, the constitutively active mutant of RhoA, on PKD activation in T cells. The data (Fig. 1D) show that V14RhoA did not stimulate the basal activity of PKD in T cells nor did it synergize with antigen receptor stimulation of phorbol esters for PKD activation. The positive control for V14RhoA functional activity is shown in Fig. 1B; these data show expression of V14RhoA induced a strong activation of SRF.The Role of RhoA for Functional Responses Induced by PKD in T Cells—RhoA does not appear to be required for PKD activation in T cells, but we considered an alternative possibility that RhoA signaling pathways might mediate PKD actions. We have recently developed transgenic mouse models with gain of function mutants of PKD targeted to the plasma membrane or cytosol of pre-T cells that allow us to explore PKD-mediated responses in pre-T cells in vivo. We also have available transgenic mice that express C. botulinum C3 transferase (C3 mice) under the control of T cell-specific promoters in pre-T cells. Accordingly, by generating mice doubly transgenic for PKD mutants and C3 transferase, we can assess whether biological responses induced by PKD activation at the membrane or cytosol of pre-T cells requires endogenous RhoA function.During thymocyte development the pre-T cell receptor, which activates PKD, controls a critical differentiation checkpoint known as β-selection (31von Boehmer H. Aifantis I. Azogui O. Saint-Ruf C. Grassi F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Michie A.M. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Semin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). T cell progenitors that enter the thymus from the bone marrow lack expression of the major histocompatibility coreceptors CD4 and CD8 and are termed double negatives (CD4– and CD8–). The commitment of these progenitors to the T cell lineage begins with rearrangements of the TCR-β locus that, if successful, results in expression of the β-subunit of the antigen receptor as part of the pre-T cell receptor complex. The pre-TCR then instructs cells to proliferate rapidly and induces a well characterized set of genetic changes that control T cell differentiation. The pre-TCR-induced genetic program includes modulation of the cell membrane phenotype of pre-T cells. The pre-TCR thus switches off expression of CD25, the interleukin-2 receptor α subunit, but up-regulates expression of other cell surface receptors, including the coreceptors CD4 and CD8, the adhesion molecule CD2, and signaling molecules such as CD5 (33von Boehmer H. Aifantis I. Feinberg J. Lechner O. Saint-Ruf C. Walter U. Buer J. Azogui O. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).In the absence of a pre-TCR T cells become blocked in differentiation at a CD25+ CD2– CD5– CD4– CD8– stage; for example in recombinase activating gene 2 (RAG2–/–), null mice which cannot undergo TCR gene rearrangements (34Godfrey D.I. Kennedy J. Mombaerts P. Tonegawa S. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4783-4792PubMed Google Scholar, 35Shinkai Y. Rathbun G. Lam K.P. Oltz E.M. Stewart V. Mendelsohn M. Charron J. Datta M. Young F. Stall A.M. Alt F.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 855-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). One role for the pre-TCR is to activate PKD, and accordingly, expression of active PKD mutants can bypass the absence of the pre-TCR and induce pre-T cell differentiation (12Marklund U. Lightfoot K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Triggering of antigen receptors causes a transient relocalization of PKD to the lymphocyte plasma membrane, and to probe the function of PKD at the membrane, transgenic mice expressing a mutated active membrane-targeted PKD under the control of T cell-specific promoters have been produced (membPKD) (12Marklund U. Lightfoot K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To target active PKD to the plasma membrane, the catalytic core of PKD was fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domain of the cell surface receptor rat CD2 (rCD2) to create a chimera (membPKD). The characterization of the membPKD chimera has been described (12Marklund U. Lightfoot K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The backcrossing of membPKD mice onto a RAG2–/– genetic background, where there is no endogenous pre-TCR and no activation of endogenous PKD, makes it possible to assess the functional consequence of activating PKD at the plasma membrane in pre-T cells in the absence of any other pre-TCR signaling pathways. The data in Fig. 2A show that expression of active PKD at the plasma membrane of RAG2–/– null mice down-regulates expression of CD25 but up-regulates expression of CD4, CD8, and CD5. The activity and plasma membrane localization of the CD2-membPKD chimera is not inhibited when RhoA function is inhibited by expression of C. botulinum C3 transferase (Fig. 2, B and C). Hence to investigate whether membPKD-mediated signaling in pre-T cells requires endogenous RhoA function, we expressed active membrane-targeted PKD in pre-T cells that lack RhoA function because of expression of C3 transferase. This was achieved by breeding transgenic mice expressing active membrane-targeted PKD under the control of the CD2 promoter with transgenic mice expressing C. botulinum C3 transferase also under the control of the CD2 promoter (C3 mice). Previous studies have shown that inhibition of RhoA function in C3 mice prevents β-selection and causes T cells to become blocked in differentiation at a CD25 + CD2-CD5-CD4-CD8-stage indistinguishable from the phenotype of RAG2–/– mice (24Cleverley S. Henning S. Cantrell D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). C3 transferase can ADP-ribosylate different members of the Rho GTPase family, but microarray analysis of pre-T cell subsets using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array has shown that T cell progenitors express RhoA but not RhoB or RhoC (data not shown). Accordingly, the ability of C3 transferase to block pre-T cell development reflects a requirement for the function of RhoA for β-selection. The data in Fig. 2D show that membrane-targeted PKD cannot induce CD25 down-regulation in pre-T cells that express C3 transferase nor can this active PKD mutant up-regulate expression of CD4 and CD8 or CD5. Membrane-targeted PKD can thus bypass loss of pre-TCR function in pre-T cells in the RAG2–/– mice but cannot bypass loss of RhoA function in C3 transgenic mice.FIGURE 2A, membrane-targeted active PKD can induce the expression of cell surface markers in pre-TCR-deficient thymocytes from RAG null mice. Histograms show CD25, CD4, CD8, and CD5 staining profiles in total Thy1.2+ thymocytes from RAG2–/– and RAG2–/– membPKD mice. B, PKD activity of membrane-targeted active PKD in control Jurkat cells or cell coexpressing C. botulinum C3 transferase. Data show Western blot analysis of cell lysates with phospho-Ser-916 antibodies or the rat CD2 antibody Ox-34 to monitor PKD activity or protein loading. C, membrane-targeted active PKD is a chimera comprising the catalytic core of PKD fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domain of rat CD2.

https://openalex.org/W2092448612,"We previously established the murine adrenal chromaffin cell line tsAM5D, which was immortalized with the temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen. tsAM5D cells have the capacity to differentiate into neuron-like cells in response to neurotrophic factors when the culture temperature is shifted from 33 to 39 °C. In this model system, the temperature shift in the absence of neurotrophic factors led to cell death. Hoechst staining analysis revealed that typical apoptotic nuclei appeared in a time-dependent manner after the temperature shift. Upon shifting to 39 °C, the degradation of T-antigen was accompanied by the transcriptional activation of p53 protein. Among the p53 target genes, death receptor 5 (DR5), which is the receptor for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), showed the highest level of induction. Interestingly, TRAIL-neutralizing antibody protected tsAM5D cells from the temperature shift-induced apoptotic cell death by blocking the activation of caspase-8 and -3, indicating the involvement of TRAIL-mediated death signaling in the temperature shift-induced apoptosis. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) inhibited the TRAIL-mediated activation of caspase-8 in tsAM5D cells exposed to 39 °C and cooperated with basic fibroblast growth factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor. Interestingly, the temperature shift induced oligomerization of DR5, which is the earliest process necessary for transduction of the death signal. This oligomerization was inhibited by treatment with GDNF plus ciliary neurotrophic factor but not by that with GDNF alone or GDNF plus basic fibroblast growth factor. These results are discussed with respect to the intracellular mechanism underlying the protective function of neurotrophic factors against TRAIL-mediated death signaling.

Cells immortalized with the tsSV40T oncogene proliferate under the permissive temperature of 33 °C, and they differentiate at the nonpermissive temperature of 39 °C (2Chou J.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1511-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Jat P.S. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1672-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). An advantage of tsSV40T is the ability to study the differentiation function of the cell without the interference of the transforming oncogene at the nonpermissive temperature. In fact, several tsSV40T-immortalized neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines have been shown to retain their capacity to differentiate even when the immortalizing oncogene has been inactivated (4Eves E.M.

Commun. 2001; 286: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the tsSV40T-transformed cell line can be useful for studying the regulatory mechanism by which target cells differentiate in response to extracellular stimuli. Tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of the catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (12Nagatsu T. Levitt M. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2910-2917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Levitt M. Spector S. Sjoerdsma A. Udenfriend S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1965; 148: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine hydroxylase is selectively expressed in the central and peripheral catecholaminergic neurons and in the adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. Previously, we demonstrated that an 11-kb DNA fragment of the human tyrosine hydroxylase gene, consisting of 2.5 kb of the 5′-upstream region, the entire exon-intron portion, and 0.5 kb of the 3′-flanking region was sufficient to confer tissue-specific and high level expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in transgenic mice (14Kaneda N. Sasaoka T. Kobayashi K. Kiuchi K. Nagatsu I. Kurosawa Y. Fujita K. Yokoyama M. Nomura T. Katsuki M. Nagatsu T. Neuron. 1991; 6: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On the basis of this experiment, we generated transgenic mice expressing the tsSV40T gene under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter to provide an ideal source for the establishment of catecholaminergic cell lines. We succeeded in establishing a conditionally immortalized adrenal chromaffin cell line, tsAM5D, from an adrenal tumor of an adult tyrosine hydroxylase-tsSV40T transgenic mouse (15Murata T. Hikita K. Tsuboi M. Niwa K. Suzuki M. Kaneda N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1126-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). tsAM5D cells conditionally grow at the permissive temperature of 33 °C and exhibit the dopaminergic phenotype. In addition, tsAM5D cells proliferate at the permissive temperature in response to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). At the nonpermissive temperature of 39 °C, bFGF and CNTF act synergistically to cause tsAM5D cells to differentiate into neuron-like cells. In the presence of bFGF plus CNTF (bFGF/CNTF), the temperature shift is capable of up-regulating the expression of neuronal cell markers, including neuron-specific enolase, growth-associated protein-43, microtubule-associated protein 2, and neurofilament, thereby indicating induction of the neuronal phenotype by the temperature shift. Thus, tsAM5D cells should be a good tool to allow a detailed study of the mechanisms regulating neuronal differentiation. It was reported that in some of tsSV40T-immortalized cell lines, the shift up to the nonpermissive temperature not only induces growth arrest but also causes cell death (16Vayssiere J.L. Petit P.X.

The temperature shift-induced cell death of tsSV40T-immortalized cells has been demonstrated to be due to apoptosis, based on the observation of nuclear fragmentation or DNA fragmentation. However, the molecular basis for the apoptosis of tsSV40T-immortalized cells is not yet understood. During the course of our study to characterize tsAM5D cells, we found that these cells dramatically underwent cell death by the temperature shift from 33 to 39 °C in the absence of bFGF/CNTF. In this study, we examined the mechanism of cell death triggered by this temperature shift. Here we report that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) mediated the cell death induced by the temperature shift in a p53-dependent fashion. Furthermore, by using this model system, we demonstrated the protective effects of neurotrophic factors against this TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

Cell Culture—tsAM5D cells were seeded into type IV collagen-coated dishes and cultured in DMEM supplemented with G5 supplement (insulin, transferrin, selenite, biotin, hydrocortisone, bFGF, and epidermal growth factor), 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 33 °C (15Murata T. Hikita K. Tsuboi M. Niwa K. Suzuki M. Kaneda N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1126-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cell Viability—To examine the effects of culture temperature on cell viability, we plated tsAM5D cells (4 × 104 cells/well for the permissive temperature; 8 × 104 cells/well for the nonpermissive temperature) on type IV collagen-coated 96-well dishes and maintained them in the defined growth medium at 33 °C. After 24 h (day 0), the cells were washed twice with DMEM containing 10% FBS and then cultured at 33 or 39 °C in 150μl/well of the serum-containing medium. To examine the involvement of death receptor signaling and the caspase cascade in the cell death, we preincubated cells with neutralizing antibodies (10 μg/ml), control IgG (10 μg/ml), or caspase inhibitors (50 μm) for 2 h prior to temperature shift. The neutralizing antibodies used were rat anti-mouse TRAIL antibody, goat anti-mouse Fas ligand antibody, and goat anti-mouse TNF-α antibody. The caspase inhibitors used were caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-fmk), caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-fmk), and general caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk). To examine the effect of neurotrophic factors on the temperature shift-induced cell death, we added 50 ng/ml of various neurotrophic factors at day 0. At the time points indicated in the figures, the number of viable cells was assessed by adding 30 μl/well of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution reagent containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS tetrazolium). After 2 h of incubation at 33 or 39 °C, the absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad). Background absorbance because of the medium was subtracted from the data. Quantification of Apoptosis—After the cells had been treated on 4-well chamber slides previously coated with mouse type IV collagen, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed once with PBS, and then stained for 15 min with 3 μm Hoechst 33342 dye. After being washed with PBS, the coverslips were mounted by using Vectashield, and the cells were then observed under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Jena, Germany). Apoptotic cells were defined by condensed and/or fragmented chromatin in the blue fluorescence-emitting nuclei. At least 250 cells from randomly selected fields were counted in each experiment. Morphological Analysis—Cells were plated on type IV collagen-coated 35-mm dishes at an initial density of 80% confluence and maintained in the defined growth medium at 33 °C for 24 h after plating. After the cells had been washed with 10% FBS-containing medium, the culture medium was switched to serum-containing medium supplemented or not with 50 ng/ml of various neurotrophic factors and maintained at 39 °C for the times indicated in the figures; and the cultures were then photographed under a phase-contrast microscope (model TE300, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Assay of Transcriptional Activity of p53—Cells were plated on type IV collagen-coated 24-well dishes to ∼80% confluence and maintained in defined growth medium at 33 °C. After 12 h, either pp53-TA-Luc vector (0.5 μg/well) or an equivalent molar amount of pTA-Luc vector (negative control) was used along with pRL-TK vector (0.125 μg/well) to co-transfect the cells. We used a synthetic cationic lipid component, TransFast reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions, for the transfection. The pRL-TK vector containing the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the minimum promoter from herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase was used as an internal control to correct for transfection efficiency and differences in cell number. After the transfection, the transfected cells were cultured in the defined growth medium at 33 °C. After 18 h (time 0), the cells were cultured at 33 or 39 °C for the desired periods. At the end of the culture period, the transfected cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity in each cell lysate was then measured by conducting the dual-luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reporter gene activity was expressed as the firefly luciferase activity of pp53-TA-Luc vector divided by the Renilla luciferase activity of the pRL-TK vector. The luciferase activity of the pTA-Luc vector was subtracted from that of pp53-TA-Luc vector. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Cells were plated on type IV collagen-coated 35-mm dishes at an initial density of 80% confluence and maintained in the defined growth medium at 33 °C for 24 h after plating. After the cells had been washed with 10% FBS-containing medium, the culture medium was switched to serum-containing medium supplemented or not with 50 ng/ml of various neurotrophic factors, and the cells were then maintained at 33 or 39 °C for the desired periods. Total RNA was isolated from the cultured cells by using Isogen according to the manufacturer's instructions and then treated with RNase-free DNase. In a 100-μl reaction, the purified total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed at 48 °C in the presence of oligo(dT) primers by using TaqMan reverse transcription reagent. A QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit was used to analyze the mRNA expression level of target genes. PCR was performed in a reaction mixture (25 μl) containing cDNA solution (5 μl), 1× QuantiTect SYBR Green, and 0.5 μm specific primers. Nucleotide sequences of the specific primers used were as follow: DR5, 5′-TCTGCCAGTCATGCTCTAACTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGAGTCTTGCCAGGTTCCGTGT-3′ (antisense); p21, 5′-TTGACTTCGTCACGGAGACG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTCCCGTGGGCACTTCAGG-3′ (antisense); Mdm2, 5′-ACTGTCTACCTCATCTAGAAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCTGTCTGATAGACTGTGACC-3′ (antisense); Fas, 5′-ATGCTGATAAATGCAGAAGATGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTTCTAGATTCAGGGTCATCCTG-3′ (antisense); Bax, 5′-TGGAGATGAACTGGATAGCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATGATGGTTCTGATCAGCTC-3′ (antisense); TRAIL, 5′-AAGTGGCAGCTCACATTACTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGGTGTACTTGTAGATGTACTG-3′ (antisense); Fas ligand, 5′-GTATCAGCTCTTCCACCTGCAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCAGTAGTGCAGTAGTTCAAC-3′ (antisense); mDcTRAILR1, 5′-TCTCCAGTCTGAGTCACTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCTGGGTGACACTTCTCAC-3′ (antisense); mDcTRAILR2, 5′-TCGGCCATGTTTGGCTTCTTCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGAGCAAAGTATACAAGCATC-3′ (antisense); osteoprotegerin, 5′-CCGGCGTGGTGCAAGCTGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGTCCCAGGCAAACTGTCCA-3′ (antisense); and β-actin, 5′-GTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCACCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGG-3′ (antisense). These primer pairs yielded PCR products of 329, 347, 391, 340, 214, 301, 405, 215, 318, 309, and 244 bp for DR5, p21, Mdm2, Fas, Bax, TRAIL, Fas ligand, mDcTRAILR1, mDcTRAILR2, osteoprotegerin, and β-actin, respectively. The following thermal profile was used: PCR amplification, 1 cycle at 94 °C for 15 min and then 45 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 57–59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. For the quantitative determination of the mRNA of a target gene, the accumulation of PCR products was measured directly by monitoring fluorescence intensity with an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy cloning vector and then sequenced with an automated fluorescence DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 310-2 Genetic Analyzer, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to confirm the identity of the cloned inserts. The housekeeping gene β-actin was also amplified to normalize the cDNA content of each sample, because the expression level of β-actin mRNA did not change under any culture conditions. The cycle threshold (Ct) values for target genes and β-actin were measured, and the change in mRNA level of target genes was calculated by using the comparative Ct method (User Bulletin 2, Applied Biosystems). Assay of Caspase Activity—The activities of caspases-8 and caspase-3 were measured by using an ApoAlert caspase fluorescence assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured on type IV collagen-coated 24-well dishes under the appropriate conditions, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in caspase lysis buffer for 15 min on ice. To study the effects of LY294002 and PD98059 on caspase activity, we preincubated cells with either inhibitor 1 h prior to treating them with neurotrophic factors at 39 °C. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the protein concentration of supernatants was determined with a micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit. Supernatants containing 50 μg of protein were incubated with 50 μm IETD-AFC (caspase-8 substrate) or DEVD-AFC (caspase-3 substrate) for 1 h. Caspase activity was determined by fluorometric detection of the hydrolyzed products with a microplate spectrofluorometer (Bio-Rad). Excitation at 400 nm and emission at 505 nm were used for caspase-3 and caspase-8 analyses. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were cultured on type IV collagen-coated 60-mm dishes under the appropriate conditions. For the analysis of tsSV40T, cells were lysed in lysis buffer consisting of 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 4% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 15% glycerol. For the analysis of DR5, cells were lysed in a different lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the protein concentration of supernatant was determined with BCA protein assay reagent kit. The supernatant (100 μg of protein) was boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The proteins was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking for 1 h with TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 3% skim milk, the membranes were incubated with mouse anti-SV40T-antigen antibody (1:100) or goat anti-mouse DR5 antibody (1:100) in TBS-T containing 1% skim milk and then with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody or anti-goat IgG antibody in the same buffer. Bound antibody was visualized by using the ECL system. The same blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody, as β-actin was used as a loading control. TRAIL Receptor DR5 Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were treated with 2 mm 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate), a cleavable cross-linker, in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. After the reaction had been stopped with 10 mm ammonium acetate in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed for 30 min on ice with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating ∼2 mg of supernatant protein in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing the desired concentration of hamster anti-mouse DR5 antibody and protein G-Sepharose 4B at 4 °C overnight with agitation. The immunocomplexes were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were resolved on 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. To rule out the possibility that the bands were nonspecific bands derived from the cell lysate proteins and immune IgG used for immunoprecipitation, we treated the beads with either cell lysate alone or anti-DR5 antibody alone in lysis buffer. These beads were then mixed and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and the samples were loaded as an immunoprecipitation negative control. By using the goat anti-mouse DR5 antibody and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody, we performed the immunoblotting of DR5 as mentioned above. Immunocytochemical Analysis—After the cells had been cultured on 2-well chamber slides coated previously with mouse type IV collagen, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were blocked with Block Ace for 1 h and then incubated with goat anti-mouse DR5 antibody (1:50) in Block Ace solution at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with the primary antibody, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (1:200) in Block Ace solution. Subsequently, they were washed with PBS, and coverslips were mounted using Vectashield, and the cells were analyzed by Zeiss LSM510 META confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). For quantification of the fluorescence signals, images of labeled cells were acquired by using all the same settings below saturation at 512 × 512 pixels. The z-series images were collected at 0.4-μm steps, and a maximum transparency projection in Zeiss-LSM Image Browser version 3.5 was used for producing figures. Immunofluorescence analysis for each experiment was performed 3–5 times, and the most representative results were displayed. Statistical Analysis—The significance of differences was estimated by using Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. We recently succeeded in establishing a conditionally immortalized adrenal chromaffin cell line named tsAM5D (15Murata T. Hikita K. Tsuboi M. Niwa K. Suzuki M. Kaneda N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1126-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In serum-containing medium supplemented with bFGF/CNTF, cells proliferate at the permissive temperature of 33 °C, and they differentiate into neuron-like cells at the nonpermissive temperature of 39 °C (15Murata T. Hikita K. Tsuboi M. Niwa K. Suzuki M. Kaneda N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1126-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, when cultured at 39 °C in the absence of bFGF/CNTF, the cells dramatically undergo cell death (15Murata T. Hikita K. Tsuboi M. Niwa K. Suzuki M. Kaneda N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1126-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). One purpose of our study was to investigate the intracellular mechanism responsible for the cell death at 39 °C in the absence of neurotrophic factors. We first examined the cell viability of tsAM5D cells in medium containing serum alone at 33 and 39 °C. To assess cell viability, we used the Cell-Titer 96 aqueous assay kit, which is based on the metabolic conversion of MTS tetrazolium compound to a colored formazan product by living cells. The absorbance of the formazan product is directly proportional to the number of viable cells in culture. As shown in Fig. 1A, when the cells were cultured at 33 °C in the presence of 10% FBS alone, the MTS level was constant, but it dramatically decreased when the temperature was increased to 39 °C. Upon morphological analysis, a small number of floating dead cells was seen at 6 h after the temperature shift, and most of cells had detached from the culture dish by 30 h (Fig. 1B). At the permissive temperature (33 °C), the morphology of the cells did not change over a 30-h period (data not shown). To determine whether the loss of cell viability elicited by the temperature shift was because of apoptosis, we monitored the nuclear morphology of the cells by Hoechst staining. As shown in Fig. 1C, the percentage of apoptotic cells at 39 °C gradually increased in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, when the temperature was shifted to 39 °C, the tsSV40T protein was gradually degraded and became undetectable after a 12-h incubation (Fig. 1D). At the permissive temperature, however, the expression level of tsSV40T did not change over the same period of time (data not shown). These results suggest that apoptotic cell death induced by the temperature shift depended on the expression level of tsSV40T. The tsSV40T-immortalized cell lines TLR2 (17Yanai N. Obinata M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and REtsAF (18Zheng D.Q. Vayssiere J.L. Petit P.X. LeCoeur H. Spatz A. Mignotte B. Feunteun J.

T-antigen is thought to induce immortalization by interacting with p53 or retinoblastoma suppressor protein (23Levine A.J.
