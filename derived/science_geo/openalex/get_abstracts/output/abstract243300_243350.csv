https://openalex.org/W2170704593,"The serine/threonine kinase Akt is an upstream positive regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, the mechanism by which Akt activates mTOR is not fully understood. The known pathway by which Akt activates mTOR is via direct phosphorylation and inhibition of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), which is a negative regulator of mTOR. Here we establish an additional pathway by which Akt inhibits TSC2 and activates mTOR. We provide for the first time genetic evidence that Akt regulates intracellular ATP level and demonstrate that Akt is a negative regulator of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is an activator of TSC2. We show that in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells AMP/ATP ratio is markedly elevated with concomitant increase in AMPK activity, whereas in cells expressing activated Akt there is a dramatic decrease in AMP/ATP ratio and a decline in AMPK activity. Currently, the Akt-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 and the inhibition of AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 are viewed as two separate pathways, which activate mTOR. Our results demonstrate that Akt lies upstream of these two pathways and induces full inhibition of TSC2 and activation of mTOR both through direct phosphorylation and by inhibition of AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2. We propose that the activation of mTOR by Akt-mediated cellular energy and inhibition of AMPK is the predominant pathway by which Akt activates mTOR in vivo.

The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B, a downstream effector of phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase, has emerged as a critical mediator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 2The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; S6K1, S6 kinase 1; 4E-BP, 4E-binding protein; TSC1, -2, tuberous sclerosis complexes 1 and 2; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; CA-AMPK, constitutively active AMPK; HA, hemagglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; DN, dominant negative; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; p-ACC, phosphorylated ACC; WT, wild type; 5-TG, 5-thioglucose; 2-DOG, 2-deoxyglucose; TSC2(2D,2E), TSC2(S939D/S1086D/S1088E/T1422E); DKO, double knock-out cells; AICAR, 5-aminoomidazole-4-carboxyamide.2The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; S6K1, S6 kinase 1; 4E-BP, 4E-binding protein; TSC1, -2, tuberous sclerosis complexes 1 and 2; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; CA-AMPK, constitutively active AMPK; HA, hemagglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; DN, dominant negative; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; p-ACC, phosphorylated ACC; WT, wild type; 5-TG, 5-thioglucose; 2-DOG, 2-deoxyglucose; TSC2(2D,2E), TSC2(S939D/S1086D/S1088E/T1422E); DKO, double knock-out cells; AICAR, 5-aminoomidazole-4-carboxyamide. activity. Mammalian cells express three separate Akt proteins (Akt1–3), which share >80% amino acid sequence identity and are encoded by different genes. The rate-limiting step in Akt activation is the binding of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt and the subsequent translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane. Akt is then phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and by another as yet unknown phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase-dependent kinase. Both phosphorylation events are required for full activation of Akt (for reviews see Refs. 1Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp.

Biochemical and genetic data show that Akt is a positive regulator of mTOR that mediates the activation of mTOR by growth factors (reviewed in Ref. 4Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar). mTOR controls mRNA translation by phosphorylating and activating S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and by phosphorylating and inactivating the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), which repress mRNA translation. Thus, the phosphorylation status of S6K1 and one of the 4E-BPs members, 4E-BP1, is often used as readout for mTOR activity in vivo. mTOR is activated by the small GTPase Rheb, which is inhibited by its GAP protein TSC2 that heterodimerizes with tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) (5Castro A.F.

Akt inactivates TSC2 by phosphorylating it on four residues, thereby activating mTOR (9Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol.

However, it is still not clear whether the phosphorylation of TSC2 by Akt is critical or sufficient for the activation of mTOR by Akt (14Dong J. Pan D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2479-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Peng X.D. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). mTOR activity also appears to be dependent on intracellular ATP level (16Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). ATP depletion activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn phosphorylates and activates TSC2 leading to the inhibition of mTOR activity (17Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar). Currently, the activation of mTOR via Akt-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 and via inhibition of AMPK are viewed as two separate pathways leading to the activation of mTOR (4Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar). Here we provided evidence that Akt lies upstream of both pathways.We provide genetic evidence to demonstrate that Akt modulates energy homeostasis by maintaining the level of ATP in cells so as to inhibit AMPK activity. Cells that are deficient for both Akt1 and Akt2 have reduced ATP and elevated AMPK activity and display impaired mTOR activity without a significant effect on Akt-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of AMPK restores mTOR activity in Akt1/Akt2-deficient cells, implying that residual Akt3 activity is sufficient to phosphorylate TSC2 but is insufficient to inhibit AMPK and therefore to fully activate mTOR. We also found that in TSC2-deficient cells that have reduced Akt activity AMPK activity is consistently elevated. However, despite elevated AMPK activity, mTOR activity in TSC2-deficient cells is relatively refractive to ATP depletion, further supporting the conclusion that TSC2 mediates the inhibition of mTOR activity by AMPK. Expression of an Akt-phosphomimetic mutant of TSC2 in TSC2-deficient cells restores the sensitivity of mTOR to ATP depletion, demonstrating that TSC2 phosphorylation by Akt cannot prevent the activation of TSC2 by AMPK. However, co-expression of activated Akt in TSC2-deficient cells expressing the Akt-phosphomimetic TSC2 mutant reduces AMPK activity and renders mTOR activity resistant to ATP depletion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Akt activates mTOR through both direct phosphorylation of TSC2 and by maintaining a high level of ATP with a concomitant decrease in the AMP/ATP ratio and inactivation of AMPK. We suggest that the activation of mTOR by Akt via inhibition of AMPK could be more relevant at the organismal level where cells do not always have access to nutrients for energy metabolism. This pathway by which Akt activates mTOR may also explain recent results showing that in Drosophila, TSC2 mutated in all Akt phosphorylation sites can still rescue the lethality and cell growth defect of TSC2 null mutant (14Dong J. Pan D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2479-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, Akt-phosphorylation mutants of TSC2 can still be activated by AMPK and be inhibited by Akt.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Retroviral Vectors, Antibodies, and Reagents—The plasmid pcDNA3-HA-4E-BP1 has been previously described (18Gingras A.C.

(San Francisco, CA). 5-Thio-d-glucose was from ICN Biochemical Inc.; AICAR was from Toronto Research Chemical Inc.; and 2-deoxy-d-glucose, rotenone, and all other chemicals were from Sigma.Cell Culture, Retrovirus Infection, and Transfection—All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). In certain experiments DMEM lacking glucose was supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and dialyzed FBS. Primary mouse fibroblasts were isolated and cultured as previously described (23Chen W.S. Xu P.Z.

Immortalized MEFs were generated by infection with pBabe-Puro-GSE56 expressing a dominant negative form of p53 (24Ossovskaya V.S. Mazo I.A. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Strezoska Z. Kondratov R.

Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). To generate Akt1/Akt2 DKO polyclonal cell lines expressing DN-AMPK, immortalized Akt1/Akt2 DKO MEFs were infected with high titer pBabe-eGFP-AMPKa2-K45R or control pBabe-eGFP followed by sorting via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. To generate the TSC2–/– polyclonal cell line expressing HA-TSC2(S939D/S1086D/S1088E/T1422E), TSC2–/– MEFs were infected with high titer pLPCX-HA-TSC2(S939D/S1086D/S1088E/T1422E) or control pLPCX retrovirus followed by selection with puromycin. To generate the polyclonal TSC2 cell line expressing both HA-TSC2(S939D/S1086D/S1088E/T1422E) and mAkt, the TSC2–/– MEFs expressing HA-TSC2(S939D/S1086D/S1088E/T1422E) were re-infected with pBabe-eGFP-mAkt retrovirus followed by sorting via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For transient transfection of HEK293-mAkt cells, 1 × 106 cells per 6-cm plate were plated in DMEM with 10% FBS and transfected with increasing concentrations of pcDNA3-Myc-AMPKa1312Thr172D (10, 15, and 20 μg of DNA) and 2.5 μg of pcDNA-4EBP1-HA per 1 × 106 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For serum or insulin stimulation of WT or Akt1/Akt DKO cells, 1.5 × 106 primary MEFs (passage 3) were plated in 15-cm plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS and deprived of serum for 24 h. Cells were stimulated with either insulin (1 μg/ml), or serum for 60 min and intracellular ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations were analyzed by HPLC (see below). For immunoblot analysis cells were stimulated with 10% FBS and 20% FBS for 30 and 60 min. For ATP depletion experiments, Rat1a, TSC2+/– MEFs and TSC2–/– MEFs (1 × 106 per 10-cm plate) were plated in DMEM (5.5 mm glucose) with 10% FBS (dialyzed) and deprived of serum for 24 h, stimulated with insulin (1 μg/ml) for 30 min, and either further stimulated with insulin (1 μg/ml) for 30 min or ATP-depleted by using different concentrations of 5-thio-d-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, or rotenone. Rat1a-mAkt cells (1 × 106 per 10-cm plate) expressing activated Akt were deprived of serum for 24 h in DMEM (5.5 mm glucose) and treated with different concentrations of 5-thioglucose, rotenone, or AICAR.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—For Immunoblotting cell lysates were prepared in 100–200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm Na3 VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 nm okadaic acid, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) by thaw-freeze-cycle extraction. Proteins in cell lysates were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE for 4E-BP1, on 10% SDS-PAGE for other proteins, and 6% or 8% SDS-PAGE for TSC2 and mTOR. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 mm, Schleicher & Schuell, Dot Scientific, Inc., Burton). The phosphospecific antibody was always used in the first round of immunoblotting. After stripping the membrane with stripping buffer (62 mm Tris HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) the membrane was then probed using antibodies that recognize the total amount of a specific protein of interest. For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were prepared in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were incubated overnight with the precipitating antibody anti-TSC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:200, followed by a 2-h incubation with 30 ml of protein A/G plus agarose affinity gel slurry. Immune complexes were then washed 5 times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm β-glycerol-phosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture) and boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The entire sample was used to separate the proteins via 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting with anti-Akt-pS/T substrate (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-TSC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Adenine Nucleotides Analysis—Cultured cells were quickly harvested into phosphate-buffered saline and immediately centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 × g (4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in 150 μlof perchloric acid, 4% v/v, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Within 1 h the lysates were adjusted to pH 6–8 using a solution of 2 m KOH/0.3 M MOPS and incubated for 30 min on ice. Precipitated salt was separated from the liquid phase by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of samples were stored at –80 °C. Adenine nucleotide measurements were conducted using HPLC (HPLC-Pro Star from Varian, Walnut Creek, CA) with a Spherisorb column (ODS II, 5 mm, 0.46 × 25 cm, Z22.697-1, Sigma). The nucleotides analyzed, detected spectrophotometrically at 254 nm, eluted after ∼17 min of isocratic elution at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min–1. The order of eluted nucleotides was ATP, ADP, and AMP. Internal standards (7.5 μm ATP, ADP, and AMP in ddH2O) were used to quantify the samples. The HPLC buffer contained 25 mm Na4P2O7-10H2O, 25 mm H4P2O7, adjusted to pH 5.75 with a saturated solution of Na4P2O7.RESULTSAkt Maintains the Intracellular Level of ATP and Regulates AMPK Activity—Akt was shown to phosphorylate and inactivate TSC2 (9Manning B.D.

Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A), is impaired in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for Akt1 and Akt2. However, this impairment did not correlate with a decrease in TSC2 phosphorylation (see Ref. 15Peng X.D. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar and Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the remaining Akt3 activity in Akt1/Akt2 double knock-out (DKO) cells (Fig. 1A) is sufficient to substantially phosphorylate TSC2 and that TSC2 phosphorylation may not be sufficient for Akt to fully activate mTOR. Thus, these results prompted us to investigate whether there is an additional function of Akt that is required to fully activate mTOR and that is impaired in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells.mTOR activity is also dependent on intracellular ATP level and AMPK activity (16Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 17Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine whether Akt regulates intracellular ATP levels that could affect mTOR activity. We first determined the intracellular ATP level in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells. Basal ATP level was lower in serum-deprived Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells compared with WT cells (Fig. 2A). Following insulin or serum stimulation, the ATP level was increased but it was still retained markedly reduced in DKO cells, 2- to 3-fold lower than WT. Likewise, in cells expressing activated myristoylated Akt (Rat1a-mAkt), intracellular ATP was markedly higher (about 3-fold) than that measured in control cells (Fig. 2B). These results show that Akt mediates the insulin- and serum-dependent increase in intracellular ATP level.FIGURE 2Akt regulates intracellular ATP level and AMPK activity. A, ATP level is reduced in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells. Primary WT and Akt1/Akt2 DKO MEFs were plated in 10% FBS and deprived of serum for 24 h. Cells were stimulated with 10% FBS, 20% FBS, or 1 μg ml–11 insulin for 60 min, and intracellular ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations were analyzed by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results represent the average of three independent experiments. B, ATP level is elevated in cells expressing activated Akt. Proliferating or serum-deprived control Rat1a and Rat1a-mAkt cells were analyzed for intracellular ATP level. Results represent the average of three independent experiments. C, AMP/ATP ratio is elevated in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells. Primary WT and Akt1/Akt2 DKO MEFs were subjected to analysis as described in A, and the AMP/ATP ratio was determined in cells grown in 10% FBS (+serum), or 0.1% FBS (–serum) for 24 h, and following serum and insulin stimulation. D, AMPK activity is elevated in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells. Cell lysates from primary WT and Akt1/Akt2 DKO MEFs grown in 10% FBS (+serum) or 0.1% FBS (–serum) for 24 h were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-pan Akt, anti-p-Akt-S473, anti-p-ACC-S79, anti-p-AMPK-T172, and anti-AMPK. E, AMP/ATP ratio is reduced in cells expressing activated Akt. Rat1a and Rat1a-mAkt cells grown in 10% FBS (+serum) or 0.1% FBS (–serum) for 48 h were subjected to ATP and AMP analysis, and the AMP/ATP ratio was determined. F, AMPK activity is down-regulated in cells expressing activated Akt and is correlated with mTOR activity. Cell lysates from proliferating and serum-deprived Rat1a and Rat1a-mAkt cells were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-p-Akt-S473, anti-pan Akt, anti-p-TSC2-T1462, anti-TSC2, anti-pAMPK-T172, anti-TSC2, anti-AMPK, anti-p-S6K1-T389, and anti-p-4E-BB1-S65, anti-4E-BP1 and anti-β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)AMPK is the sensor of ATP level in cells (27Hardie D.G.

We found that, in the presence of growth factors, this ratio was markedly higher (about 2- to 3-fold) in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells compared with WT cells (Fig. 2C), consistent with the lower ATP level in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells (Fig. 2A). Indeed, AMPK activity, as measured by its phosphorylation at Thr172 (30Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar) and by the phosphorylation of the AMPK target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) at Ser-79 (31Ha J. Daniel S. Broyles S.S. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22162-22168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was significantly higher in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells compared with WT cells in the presence of serum (Fig. 2D). Moreover, introduction of a conditionally active Akt into Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells and modulating its activity decreased AMP/ATP ratio in Akt-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S1).In the absence of serum, the AMP/ATP ratio in WT and Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells was comparable (Fig. 2C). Although p-ACC was substantially increased in WT cells following serum deprivation, it did not reach the level observed in DKO cells (Fig. 2D). One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy between AMPK activity and AMP/ATP ratio is that Akt has an additional impact on AMPK, which is less dependent on AMP/ATP ratio (see “Discussion”). Consistent with the results observed in the Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells, in Rat1a cells expressing activated Akt (Rat1a-mAkt) the AMP/ATP ratio was about 3-fold lower than in control cells (Fig. 2E). When control Rat1a cells were deprived of serum, the AMP/ATP ratio markedly increased, concomitant with an increase in AMPK activity (Fig. 2, E and F). Although the AMP/ATP ratio also increased in serum-deprived Rat1a-mAkt cells, this ratio was comparable to the ratio in control cells in the presence of serum, and thus AMPK activity was not markedly increased in these cells (Fig. 2, E and F). The increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and AMPK activity in control cells correlated with a decrease in mTOR activity, as determined by S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and by 4E-BP1-mobility shift (Fig. 2F). Thus, cells that maintained an AMP/ATP ratio below a certain threshold level also had high mTOR activity (Fig. 2, E and F). Taken together these results provide genetic evidence and demonstrate that Akt is a regulator of energy metabolism, which is required to maintain low AMPK activity in the cells.ATP"

Autophagy is strongly induced by nutrient starvation. Several specific proteins, including amino acid synthesis enzymes and vacuolar enzymes, are increased during nitrogen starvation in wild-type cells but not in autophagy-defective Δatg7 cells despite similar mRNA levels. We further examined deficiencies in these cells. Bulk protein synthesis was substantially reduced in Δatg7 cells under nitrogen starvation compared with wild-type cells. The total intracellular amino acid pool was reduced in Δatg7 cells, and the levels of several amino acids fell below critical values. In contrast, wild-type cells maintained amino acid levels compatible with life. Autophagy-defective cells fail to maintain physiologic amino acid levels, and their inability to synthesize new proteins may explain most phenotypes associated with autophagy mutants at least partly.

Autophagy-defective cells fail to maintain physiologic amino acid levels, and their inability to synthesize new proteins may explain most phenotypes associated with autophagy mutants at least partly. In nature, organisms often encounter conditions in which nutrients are limiting, and they use an array of metabolic changes to survive through these periods. Under nitrogen starvation, cells mobilize stored nitrogen sources such as the vacuolar amino acid pool, express high affinity transporters to facilitate nitrogen uptake, and induce many enzymes controlling amino acid biosynthesis. Alterations in extracellular nutrients are typically most severe for unicellular organisms, and they have evolved mechanisms that respond to environmental changes more rapidly than multicellular organisms. Furthermore, when insufficient amounts of nitrogen are available, cells degrade their intracellular components to maintain essential cellular functions. In mammalian cells, most long lived cytoplasmic proteins are degraded in lysosomes/vacuoles (1Seglen P.O. Glaumann H. Ballard F.J. Lysosome: Their Role in Protein Breakdown. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 371-414Google Scholar), and this process is called autophagy. In autophagy, a portion of the cytoplasm is sequestered into a double-membrane-bound structure, the autophagosome, which then fuses with the lysosome/vacuole, and its inner membrane and contents are degraded. We found that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces autophagy under various nutrient starvation conditions (2Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 3Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). A total of 16 ATG genes (ATG1–10, -12–14, and -16–18) essential for autophagosome formation were characterized in yeast (4Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Most of these genes are well conserved in eukaryotes, and their identification facilitated many recent studies on the physiological significance of autophagy in higher eukaryotes (5Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3159) Google Scholar, 6Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T.

Autophagy degraded cytoplasmic components including a significant amount of proteins, RNA in ribosomes, and phospholipids of organelle membranes (2Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J.

So far, the precise fate and the physiological importance of the recycling of each degradation product generated by autophagy are not known in particular. Recently, we examined changes in protein expression after long term nitrogen starvation and found Ald6p (NADP+-dependent cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase) is preferentially degraded via autophagy (9Onodera J. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16071-16076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Additionally, it became apparent that heat shock proteins and enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis were up-regulated by nitrogen starvation in wild-type cells, but these changes did not occur in atg mutant cells. This observation could help clarify the physiological significance of autophagy in protein turnover. Here we show that protein synthesis in atg mutant cells is far lower than in wild-type cells under nitrogen starvation, and a decreased intracellular free amino acid pool limits protein synthesis in these cells. Yeast Strains, Media, and Culture—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were SEY6210 (MATα his3Δ200 leu2–3,112 lys2–801 trp1Δ901 ura3–52 suc2Δ9) (10Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M.

Standard techniques were used for yeast manipulation (11Bruke D. Dawson D. Stearn T. Method in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, and 2% glucose), SD medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose), SD + CA medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% casamino acid, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose) supplemented with 0.002% adenine sulfate, 0.002% uracil, and 0.002% tryptophan if necessary. For nitrogen starvation, SD(-N) medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and amino acids, and 2% glucose) was used. Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium to A600 = 1.0 at 30 °C and shifted to SD(-N) medium for the indicated times at 30 °C. Plasmid Construction—DNA manipulations were performed using standard methods (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd. Cold Spring HarborLaboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To create the expression vectors for Arg1p- or Hsp26p-3 × hemagglutinin (HA) 1The abbreviation used is: HA, hemagglutinin. epitope-tagged protein, novel XhoI and BamHI sites were added to each promoter region and the open reading frame lacking the stop codon (ARG1/YOL058w 2.2 kb and HSP26/YBR072w 1.6 kb) by genomic PCR amplification using each following primers: ARG1, 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGGTTGCCACATACATGGCCAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCAAAGTCAACTCTTCACCTTTG-3′; HSP26, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGTTGGACTTTTTTTAATATAAC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCGTTACCCCACGATTCTTGAGAAG-3′. Novel SpeI sites were added to the coding sequence of 3 × HA lacking the initiation codon (0.1 kb) by PCR amplification, and novel XbaI sites were added to the terminator sequence of ALD6/YPL061w (0.3 kb) by PCR amplification as described (9Onodera J. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16071-16076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into the pRS316 centrometric plasmid (13Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to yield pJO128 (Arg1pHA) and pJO129 (Hsp26pHA). Immunoblot—Preparations of whole-cell lysates, SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (14Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T.

Anti-alcohol dehydrogenase, anti-aminopeptidase I, and anti-carboxypeptidase Y antibodies have been described previously (3Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J.

Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Northern Blot—Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (5 μg) was separated on 1% agarose containing 2.2 m formaldehyde by electrophoresis and transferred to BIODYNE A membrane (Pall). digoxigenin-labeled probes (0.5 kb) for ARG1, HSP26, and ACT1/YFL039c mRNA were prepared from each open reading frame fragment using PCR digoxigenin probe synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). The mRNA-transferred membrane was incubated with each probe at 50 °C overnight, and signals were detected by anti-digoxigenin-AP (Roche Applied Science), CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science), and LAS-1000 system (Fuji Film). Whole-cell Amino Acid Analysis—Whole-cell free amino acid levels were quantitated as described previously (17Ohsumi Y. Kitamoto K. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kitamoto K. Yoshizawa K. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2683-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Yeast cells (10 A600 units) were washed twice with distilled water, suspended in 500 μl of distilled water, and boiled for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged for 3 min at 5,000 rpm, and the supernatant was collected. This extract was analyzed with an amino acid analyzer (Hitachi L-8500A). In Vivo Protein Synthesis Assay—Yeast cells (1 A600 unit) were suspended in fresh SD(-N) medium, and [14C]valine (Moravec MC277) was added at a final concentration of 10 μm (74 kBq/ml). Cultures were then incubated at 30 °C for 0, 2, and 4 min, and protein synthesis was stopped by adding 10 volumes of 11% w/v trichloroacetic acid solution (for trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction assay) or cold distilled water (for total cell assay). Trichloroacetic acid suspensions were incubated at 90 °C for 10 min and cooled to 4 °C, and precipitates were collected with membrane filters (MFTM-membrane filters, 0.45 μm for HA; Millipore). Cells in cold water were immediately collected with the filter. Incorporated radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard TRI-CARB 2700TR). Induction of Nitrogen Starvation-induced Proteins Requires Autophagy—Using two-dimensional PAGE analysis, we observed that the inability of cells to undergo autophagy blocked the up-regulation of several starvation-induced proteins. 2J. Onodera and Y. Ohsumi, unpublished observations. We chose two proteins for further analysis, Arg1p (argininosuccinate synthetase on arginine biosynthesis) and Hsp26p (heat shock protein of 26 kDa), whose mRNA levels are dramatically up-regulated within the initial 30 min of nitrogen starvation (19Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar). Using immunoblot analysis, we quantified protein levels in wild-type (SEY6210) cells and autophagy-defective Δatg7 (JOY67) mutant cells under nitrogen starvation. In wild-type cells, Arg1pHA and Hsp26pHA levels increased by 10 and 40 fold after 24 h of starvation, respectively (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-5, B, and C). In contrast, protein up-regulation in Δatg7 mutant cells was substantially abrogated (Fig. 1A, lanes 6–10, B, and C). Two vacuolar proteinases, aminopeptidase I and carboxypeptidase Y, which are also known to be markedly induced under nitrogen starvation (19Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar), behaved similarly (Fig. 1, A, D, and E). Levels of these proteins in Δatg7 cells were about 15–25% those seen in wild-type cells after 6 h of nitrogen starvation (Fig. 1, B–E). A similar defect was also observed for Δpep4, vacuolar proteinase A-defective cells (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that up-regulation of these proteins under nitrogen starvation requires autophagic degradation. Since it is possible that protein up-regulation is controlled at the level of gene transcription, we examined ARG1 and HSP26 mRNA levels by Northern blot. Interestingly, in both wild-type (SEY6210) and Δatg7 (JOY67) cells, ARG1 and HSP26 mRNA levels increased dramatically in response to starvation and reached a maximum level within 3 h of starvation (Fig. 2). Even after 12 h of starvation, mRNA levels were elevated compared with growing cells (Fig. 2). These data clearly demonstrate that autophagy-defective cells are able to induce and maintain expression of mRNA encoding starvation-induced genes as well as wild-type cells, which means nucleotide pool does not limit transcription under nitrogen starvation. The decreased protein levels in these cells are due to a post-transcriptional defect. Bulk Protein Synthesis Requires Autophagy under Nitrogen Starvation—Next, we assessed in vivo protein synthesis using [14C]valine under nitrogen starvation. Amino acid uptake was measured by total cellular [14C]valine levels, and protein synthesis was estimated by the degree of [14C]valine incorporation in the 10% w/v trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction. We confirmed these assumptions using cycloheximide (25 μg/ml). In the presence of cycloheximide, [14C]valine uptake was not inhibited, and no radioactivity was detectable in trichloroacetic acid-precipitated material (data not shown). We measured total [14C]valine uptake (Fig. 3A) and incorporation into proteins (Fig. 3B) as well as total valine levels by amino acid analysis (Fig. 3C). Δatg7 cells (gray bars) had greater [14C]valine uptake than wild-type cells (black bars) (Fig. 3A), and this may be due to the overall decreased amino acid levels seen in these cells (Fig. 3C). The degree of protein synthesis was estimated from [14C]valine incorporated in protein and the initial specific activity calculated with cold and radioactive valine contents. Protein synthesis in both wild-type (X2180–1B) and Δatg7 (JOY27) cells was dramatically reduced for the initial 3 h of starvation. After 3 h of nitrogen starvation, however, protein synthesis was restored in wild-type cells (black bars), but Δatg7 cells remained biosynthetically less active (gray bars). The delay in Arg1p, Hsp26p, and carboxypeptidase Y expression correlates with this 3 h period of decreased protein synthesis (Fig. 1, B–D). After 24 h of starvation, total protein synthesis in Δatg7 cells was 17% of wild-type cells (Fig. 3D). This value corresponds to the relative expression levels observed for individual starvationinduced protein in Δatg7 cells compared with wild-type cells (15–25%; Fig. 1). Therefore, the failure of induction of Arg1p and Hsp26p in Δatg7 cells is not specific event, but due to decline of general protein synthesis. We evaluate that protein synthesis under nitrogen starvation requires autophagy, and the products of autophagic degradation are essential for protein synthesis. Autophagy Contributes to the Maintenance of Free Amino Acid Pool—Mutant cells deficient in autophagy cannot survive under long-term nitrogen starvation (20Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar) or sulfur starvation.2 Taken together with the data presented above, we hypothesized that amino acids generated during autophagy were a limiting factor for protein synthesis under starvation conditions. Total amino acid level of wild-type cells decreased dramatically during the first 2 h of starvation. Since autophagic activity measured by the alkaline phosphatase (Pho8Δ60p) assay method shows an apparent lag time of 1 h (16Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), in the early phase of nitrogen starvation consumption of amino acids must far exceed its supply via autophagy, resulting in an abrupt reduction of amino acid pools. But the amino acid level was partly restored during 3–6 h of starvation, and the level of 40.6 nmol/A600 unit was seen after 12 h of starvation (Fig. 4A; Supplemental data, Table SI). The size of the amino acid pool closely corresponded to that of X2180–1B cells growing in amino acid-free synthetic medium (SD) (44 nmol/A600 unit cells). In contrast, the total amino acid levels in Δatg7 cells (JOY27) continued to decrease dramatically during nitrogen starvation throughout the starvation and reached 9.4 nmol/A600 unit cells after 24 h of starvation (Fig. 4A; supplemental Table SI). Other autophagy-defective mutants, atg1 and atg2 cells, also failed to maintain the free amino acid pool under nitrogen starvation (data not shown). Several amino acid levels, such as histidine, methionine, and glutamine/glutamate, of Δatg7 cells fell into much lower levels than those of wild-type cells (Fig. 4, B–D). Exceptionally, the proline content of Δatg7 cells was similar to wild-type cells throughout the starvation period (Fig. 4E). The cysteine content of wild-type cells was dramatically increased at 3 h of starvation (Fig. 4F), and we will discuss about the physiological significance of this finding below. Autophagy appears essential for the maintenance of free amino acid levels during starvation conditions. In the absence of autophagy, several amino acid levels fall below a critical value, and cells may show reduced bulk protein synthesis during nitrogen starvation. Free Amino Acid Contents Limit Protein Synthesis—Decreased protein synthesis in autophagy-defective cells may be due to translation inhibition. When we added [14C]valine to cultures of 6-h starved cells, protein incorporation of [14C]valine occurred with similar kinetics in both Δatg7 cells and wild-type cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the function of translational machinery (e.g. ribosome) in Δatg7 cells is normal. To further demonstrate that protein synthesis is determined by free amino acid levels, we modified the protein synthesis assay somewhat. Nitrogen-starved cells were preincubated in SD + CA medium containing an excess of free amino acids for 5 min at 30 °C, washed with SD(-N) twice, and then cells were immediately subjected to the assay of protein synthesis using [14C]valine. Following incubation in complete medium, the amino acid pool of Δatg7 cells (JOY27) was restored (Fig. 5B, gray and white bars), and protein synthesis occurred comparable with wild-type cells (X2180-1B) (Fig. 5C, dark gray and white bars). Thus, under nitrogen starvation protein synthesis is limited by the size of the free amino acid pool. We previously observed differences in protein expression in autophagy-defective cells, and we investigated these differences in greater detail. Bulk protein synthesis in Δatg7 cells was dramatically lower than that seen in wild-type cells under nitrogen depletion. Furthermore, Δatg7 cells could not maintain intracellular amino acid levels; in several hours after shift to starvation, amino acid levels fell below critical values. Kuma et al. (6Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar) recently reported that Atg5 knock-out mice have reduced plasma and tissue amino acid levels compared with wild-type mice under fasting conditions; however, the reduction was partial (about 20–30% reduction) in tissue of mammals. Our results clearly demonstrated that in yeast the free amino acid pools change more dramatically and become a limiting factor for protein synthesis during cellular starvation without autophagy. As shown in Fig. 4, A and F, after 3 h of starvation, the amino acid levels of wild-type cells were abnormal with cysteine representing 75% of the total amino acids. The reduced protein synthesis observed at 3 h likely arises from the depletion of other amino acids (Fig. 3), and this was confirmed by the result that cells nitrogen-starved for 3 h retained high protein synthesis activity when supplied with exogenous amino acids (Fig. 5). Cysteine content rapidly diminished after 3 h of starvation, and the other amino acids achieved normal representation (Fig. 4F). Protein synthesis was also restored at this time (Fig. 3). Thus, the total amino acid content is less important for protein synthesis than the critical levels of each amino acid. Enzymes involved in both cysteine biosynthesis and sulfur metabolism are highly expressed during the initial 3-h nitrogen starvation (19Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar), and sulfur metabolism consumes a large amount of NADPH (21Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). We previously hypothesized that Ald6p is preferentially degraded (9Onodera J. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16071-16076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) during nitrogen starvation because it is a potent NADPH production enzyme (22Grabowska D. Chelstowska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13984-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and its degradation may reduce NADPH levels under nitrogen starvation. However, this preferential degradation is not enough to eliminate NADPH in the early phase of nitrogen depletion (9Onodera J. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16071-16076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Sulfur metabolism may further reduce NADPH levels during the early stages of nitrogen starvation. The accumulation of cysteine is the natural cellular end point of sulfur metabolism. Zubenko and Jones (23Zubenko G.S. Jones E.W.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar) showed that autophagy is essential for spore formation, and our data suggest that the decreased synthesis of proteins required for meiosis and spore formation may give rise to this phenotype in autophagy-deficient cells (24Kupiec M.

Recent studies of ATG gene knock-out organisms indicate that autophagy is essential for stress-induced differentiation and development; autophagy mutants of Dictyostelium discoideum exhibit defective fruiting body formation (25Otto G.P.

Schuldiner O. Neufeld T.P. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). These developmental defects may also be caused by reduced synthesis of proteins required for intracellular remodeling. Here we clearly demonstrated this new novel phenotype, reduced protein synthesis, for autophagy-defective cells under nitrogen starvation. Atg5 knock-out mice showed that deficiencies in branched-chain amino acids could cause substantial tissue energy deficits under fasting condition (6Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar). Although we also identified a decrease in branched-chain amino acid levels in yeast autophagy mutant (supplemental Table SI), S. cerevisiae has neither branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase nor dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase within the branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway. Thus, free amino acids should not be important as an energy source for yeast cells. In our experiments, sufficient glucose was present; therefore, amino acids may be re-utilized directly for protein synthesis. In Escherichia coli, the Lon protease is activated by starvation-induced polyphosphate, and it degrades ribosomal proteins to provide amino acids under starvation conditions (29Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The reduced protein synthesis observed in Δatg7 cells is not caused by an irreversible inactivation of translational machinery (Fig. 5), but the critical levels of several amino acids should result in uncharged forms of tRNA. The ubiquitin/proteasome system is also involved in protein turnover and degradation. At least in yeast, our results clearly showed that amino acids generated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system are not sufficient for the maintenance of the amino acid pool under nitrogen depletion (Fig. 4). One A600 unit of yeast cells contains about 150–200 μg of total protein (data not shown). After 6 h nitrogen starvation, wild-type cells contain 10 μg of amino acids/A600 unit cells (equivalent to about 77 nmol of amino acids/A600 unit cells; supplemental Table SI); therefore, overall levels are dynamically maintained. Previous biochemical and morphological studies have indicated that autophagy degrades around 2–4% of the total proteins/h in yeast (2Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 3Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J.

A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); therefore, it is likely that intracellular amino acids are primarily supplied by autophagic degradation. In this study, we demonstrated that protein synthesis during starvation is dramatically affected by the intracellular amino acid level, and an inability to undergo protein synthesis may partly explain the loss of viability phenotype of autophagy-deficient cells under nitrogen starvation. This provides new insight into the physiological significance of autophagy in maintaining homeostasis. Amino acid pools reduce the protein synthesis as a whole; however, to adapt nutrient starvation stress, cells must induce the synthesis of several sets of proteins, whose synthesis must be affected more severely than that of constitutively synthesized proteins.

Endothelial cells in particular are maintained in a mesenchymal state during the cell invasion phase of angiogenesis. We show here that tyrosine phosphorylation of the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin at two critical tyrosines, Tyr-658 and Tyr-731, via tyrosine kinase activation or phosphatase inactivation was sufficient to prevent the binding of p120- and β-catenin, respectively, to the cytoplasmic tail of VE-cadherin. In fact, phosphorylation at either site led to the inhibition of cell barrier function. Cells expressing wild-type VE-cadherin showed decreased cell migration compared with cells lacking VE-cadherin, whereas expression of VE-cadherin with a simple phosphomimetic tyrosine-to-glutamic acid mutation of Y658E or Y731E was sufficient to restore the migratory response. These findings demonstrate that a single phosphorylation event within the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail is sufficient to maintain cells in a mesenchymal state.

These findings demonstrate that a single phosphorylation event within the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail is sufficient to maintain cells in a mesenchymal state. Cadherins are important regulators of a number of epithelial cell barriers (1Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E. Cell. 2003; 112: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). While allowing cells to maintain impermeable cell monolayers, cadherins also act to prevent epithelial cell motility. During the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), 1The abbreviations used are: EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; CA, constitutively active; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase; PV, pervanadate; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. epithelial cells acquire an invasive phenotype characterized by breakdown of cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions and increased cell invasive activity (2Hazan R.B. Qiao R. Keren R. Badano I. Suyama K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). EMT has been associated with changes in cadherin cell surface expression, adhesive activity, and/or cytoskeletal linkage (3Berx G. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Nollet F. de Leeuw W.J. van de Vijver M.

Hofler H. Becker K.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4301-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which these processes occur are not entirely understood. VE-cadherin is an endothelium-specific cell-cell junctional protein that plays a critical role in vascular barrier function and angiogenesis (5Dejana E. Bazzoni G. Lampugnani M.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 6Vincent P.A. Xiao K. Buckley K.M. Kowalczyk A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C987-C997Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The breakdown of the endothelial cell barrier leads to vascular permeability and remodeling, which are associated with a number of disease processes including cancer, inflammation, and ischemic injury. Additionally, endothelial cells must be maintained in a mesenchymal state during the invasive stage of angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) is produced in response to ischemic injury and cancer and has a profound influence on VE-cadherin and its capacity to mediate cell-cell adhesion (7Carmeliet P.

Like all cadherin-mediated interactions, the integrity of the endothelial cell-cell junction depends on the adhesive function and cell surface expression of VE-cadherin as well as the ability of VE-cadherin to assemble with the underlying cytoskeleton. Cadherin-cytoskeletal interactions occur through a number of adaptor proteins that interact with the C-terminal portion of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail, including the α-, β-, and γ-catenin (6Vincent P.A.

Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). Additionally, VE-cadherin stability at the plasma membrane may be regulated by the binding of p120-catenin to the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic tail (11Iyer S. Ferreri D.M. DeCocco N.C.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Growth factor- and cytokine-mediated signaling has been linked to the regulation of cadherins and their adhesion mechanisms (14Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Cavallaro U. Christofori G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). In fact, tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail or its catenin binding partners is thought to regulate cadherin adhesion and cell surface expression (16Lampugnani M.G. Corada M.

However, it remains unclear how this process is regulated and which tyrosine sites on cadherins are essential for the regulation of cell-cell junctional activity. To begin to understand the molecular events involved in the regulation of cadherin function, we stably expressed either wild-type or various mutants of VE-cadherin in CHO cells lacking endogenous cadherins. We identified two critical regulatory phosphorylation sites within the tail of VE-cadherin that lead to the disruption of cell-cell junctions. Phosphorylation of Tyr-658 and Tyr-731 leads to uncoupling of p120- or β-catenin, respectively, from the cytoplasmic tail of VE-cadherin. In fact, phosphomimetic mutations of Tyr-658 to Glu-658 or Tyr-731 to Glu-731 are not only sufficient to uncouple cell-cell junctions, but they also promote focal contact assembly and lead to cell migration. This change in biological behavior could not be explained by a simple loss of functional cadherin from the cell surface. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylation of a single tyrosine in a cadherin cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to maintain cells in a mesenchymal, invasive phenotype. Construction of Cell Lines Expressing VE-cadherin—cDNA of human VE-cadherin fused in-frame with GFP at the C terminus was a gift of Dr. Sunil Shaw (Harvard University). VE-cadherin-GFP was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Y-E, Y-F, and Y-A mutants of VE-cadherin were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were transfected into CHO cells using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen). CHO cells were cultured in complete Ham's F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm GlutaMax (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Stable cell lines were selected using 500 μg/ml G418. Resistant cells were pooled and sorted by flow cytometry based on both GFP fluorescence and VE-cadherin cell surface expression. Because uniform flow cytometry gates were used to select the cells, all lines displayed approximately equivalent amounts of cell surface VE-cadherin. Biochemical Characterization of VE-cadherin Complexes—CHO cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 100 μm pervanadate (PV; prepared according to Ref. 16Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2065-2077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of cell extracts were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and VE-cadherin was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of extract using 2 μg of anti-VE-cadherin antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by 10 μl of UltraLink protein A/G beads (Pierce). Beads were washed four times using cold PBS containing 300 μm PV, boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and immunoblotting was carried out using antibodies against a number of proteins including VE-cadherin (C-19, Santa Cruz), p120-catenin (S-19, Santa Cruz), β-catenin (E-5, Santa Cruz), phosphotyrosine (PY99, Santa Cruz), Src (GD11, Upstate), FAK (C-20, Santa Cruz), phospho-Src (Tyr-416, Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-ERK2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204, Cell Signaling), phospho-FAK (Tyr-861, BIOSOURCE), and phospho-VE-cadherin (Tyr-731, BIOSOURCE). The brightness and contrast of immunoblot images were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Where indicated, cells were treated prior to lysis with 100 μm PV for 20 min at 37 °C to inhibit tyrosine phosphatases and increase Src kinase activity. Where indicated, cells were transfected with a constitutively active Src construct (Y527F; CA-Src) 36 h prior to cell lysis. Cell Barrier Assay—1 × 105 CHO cells was plated into Transwell chambers (Costar; 6.5-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pore size, tissue culture-treated polycarbonate membranes). Cells were grown for 3 days. HRP-conjugated IgG was then added to the upper chamber to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml. 10 μl of medium was removed from the lower chamber every 30 min for up to 3 h. The level of HRP-IgG in the lower chamber was measured by mixing the 10 μl of medium with 90 μl of single component 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase enzyme immunoassay substrate (Bio-Rad) for 1 min followed by the addition of 100 μl of 3 m H2SO4 to stop the reaction. The absorbance of the solution at 450 nm was determined and is representative of the amount of HRP-IgG present in the sample. Migration Assay—Transwell chambers (Costar; 6.5-mm diameter, 8.0-μm pore size, tissue culture-treated polycarbonate membranes) were pre-coated with 10 μg/ml collagen on the underside of the membrane and 1 μg/ml collagen on the upper side of the membrane. 3 × 105 cells, pre-cultured in complete Ham's F12 medium, were then plated into the upper Transwell chamber. Following incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the Transwell chambers were incubated for 15 min in 0.1% crystal violet and 20% methanol. Chambers were then rinsed repeatedly in water, and cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes using a cotton swab. Membranes were air-dried, and the crystal violet contained in the migratory cells on the underside of the membrane was extracted using methanol and quantitated by absorbance at 600 nm. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells expressing GFP-tagged VE-cadherin were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. Coverslips were quenched in 30 mm glycine in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C and then blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were incubated in primary antibody (anti-FAK-pY861 (BIOSOURCE) diluted to 2 μg/ml in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 660-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes; diluted to 4 μg/ml in blocking buffer) and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes; diluted to 1 unit/ml in blocking buffer) for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times in PBS and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Labs). Images were captured using a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope with a ×40 objective lens and LaserSharp software. Images were adjusted for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Production of Recombinant VE-cadherin·Fc Fusion Protein—DNA encoding the extracellular portion of human VE-cadherin was placed in front of the Fc portion of human IgG1. Following subcloning into the expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen), DNA was transfected into 293-T cells using Lipofectamine PLUS. Stable transfectants were selected using 300 μg/ml hygromycin B. Following selection, cells were incubated in Advanced Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) with 2 mm GlutaMax and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B for 24 h, during which time the VE-cadherin·Fc protein was secreted into the medium. Recombinant protein was purified using a 1-ml HiTrap protein G column (Amersham Biosciences). Cadherin-dependent Adhesion Assay—48-well, non-tissue culture-treated plates were coated using 10 μg/ml VE-cadherin·Fc fusion protein or human IgG1 overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked using 1% denatured bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 25 °C and then washed with PBS. 5 × 104 cells, suspended in 150 μl of serum-free Ham's F12 medium, were then added to each well. Plates were centrifuged at 5 × g for 1 min and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. 100 μl of 2% paraformaldehyde was added to the wells for 1 min. Wells were incubated for 15 min in 0.1% crystal violet and 20% methanol and then washed twice with water. Crystal violet contained in the adherent cells was extracted using methanol and quantitated by absorbance at 600 nm. Identification of Two Regulatory Tyrosines in the Cytoplasmic Tail of VE-cadherin—Phosphorylation of cadherins or their associated proteins has been linked to changes in cadherin-mediated adhesive function. There are nine tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of VE-cadherin (Fig. 1A), but their specific function remains unclear. To determine whether phosphorylation of one or more of these sites might play a role in cadherin function, wild-type VE-cadherin and VE-cadherin containing phosphomimetic tyrosine-to-glutamic acid mutations were stably expressed in CHO cells lacking endogenous cadherins. Parental CHO cells are phenotypically mesenchymal, displaying high levels of focal contact formation and migration (data not shown). We hypothesized that introduction of wild-type VE-cadherin into CHO cells would force the cells to acquire an epithelial phenotype. Accordingly, we asked whether expression of mutant forms of VE-cadherin in these cells might disrupt the epithelial phenotype. To assess the functional consequences of the phosphomimetic mutations, cells expressing wild-type or mutant cadherins were grown to confluence in Transwell chambers, and the barrier function of the cell monolayers was determined, as measured by permeability to HRP-conjugated IgG. Cells expressing wild-type VE-cadherin showed increased barrier function when compared with GFP-transfected control cells (Fig. 1B). However, cells expressing either the Y658E or Y731E mutations displayed little or no barrier function, and other mutations were without effect (Fig. 1B). These findings reveal that both Tyr-658 and Tyr-731 can regulate VE-cadherin-mediated cell barrier function. Cadherins interact with the actin cytoskeleton via catenins that bind to the cadherin cytoplasmic tail. Experiments were performed to determine whether the Y-E mutations that resulted in disruption of cell barrier function could influence the binding of one or more catenins to VE-cadherin within the cell. Expression of VE-cadherin containing the Y658E or Y731E mutations blocked p120- or β-catenin, respectively, binding to the cadherin, whereas all other Y-E mutations were without effect (Fig. 2). In addition, expression of the more dramatic structural mutations of VE-cadherin, Y658A and Y731A, also resulted in a complete loss of binding to p120- and β-catenin, respectively (data not shown). Together, our findings suggest that structural modulation of these sites (i.e. phosphorylation) can disrupt VE-cadherin junctional activity. Kinase/Phosphatase Regulation of Cadherin Phosphorylation and Function—Previous studies suggest that Src kinases play a significant role in cadherin regulation (8Weis S. Cui J. Barnes L. Cheresh D.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation of the VE-cadherin sites Tyr-658 and Tyr-731 can be mediated by Src, CHO cells expressing wild-type or mutant cadherin were transiently transfected with CA-Src (Y527F). Expression of CA-Src in each cell line resulted in increased total Src expression and phosphorylation of Src substrates such as FAK (Fig. 3). Although wild-type VE-cadherin was phosphorylated robustly in response to CA-Src expression, the Y658F,Y731F double mutant of VE-cadherin was phosphorylated at much lower levels (Fig. 3). These findings reveal that active Src can lead to the phosphorylation of Tyr-658 and Tyr-731 and thus may account for the well known role that Src kinases play in VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctional activity. However, these findings do not distinguish between a direct and indirect role for Src in this case. Tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by a dynamic balance between kinases and phosphatases. In fact, one mechanism of cadherin regulation is known to occur via tyrosine phosphatases (16Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J.

Therefore we suppressed phosphatase activity in CHO cells expressing wild-type or mutant cadherin by treatment with pervanadate, a general tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Pervanadate treatment of cells led to phosphorylation of wild-type VE-cadherin (Fig. 4A), and this was significantly reduced in cells expressing the non-phosphorylatable mutants Y658F and Y731F or the dual Y658F,Y731F mutant (Fig. 4A). Importantly, Src kinase activity was increased in cells treated with pervanadate as measured by Src phosphorylation on tyrosine 416 (Fig. 4A). To confirm the identity of the β-catenin regulatory site on VE-cadherin, we developed a phosphospecific antibody to a peptide derived from this region of the cadherin, containing phosphotyrosine at position 731. The epitope of this antibody depended on phosphorylation at Tyr-731 (data not shown) and was specifically detected in immunoprecipitates from pervanadate-treated CHO cells expressing wild-type VE-cadherin but not in cells expressing the Y731F mutant or GFP (Fig. 4B). Importantly, the antibody recognized the phosphorylated form of VE-cadherin in immunoprecipitates from pervanadate-treated, but not untreated, endothelial cells (Fig. 4B, HUVEC). These findings provide further evidence that Tyr-731 on endogenous VE-cadherin becomes phosphorylated in endothelial cells in response to phosphatase inhibition. Functional Regulation of VE-cadherin by Phosphorylation—We next determined whether the Y658F and Y731F mutations would render VE-cadherin refractory to functional regulation by phosphorylation. CHO cells expressing GFP, wild-type VE-cadherin, or the Y658F,Y731F double mutant of VE-cadherin were grown to confluence on Transwell chambers, and the integrity of cell-cell junctions was assessed in response to phosphatase inhibition. Treatment of cells with pervanadate greatly decreased cell-cell junctional integrity among cells bearing wild-type VE-cadherin (Fig. 4C). In contrast, cells expressing the Y658F,Y731F double mutations maintained their cell-cell junctions in the presence of pervanadate, suggesting that the VE-cadherin in these cells is not subject to regulation by phosphorylation. These findings reveal that either activation of kinases such as Src and/or suppression of phosphatases leading to phosphorylation of VE-cadherin on residues Tyr-658 and/or Tyr-731 can disrupt VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions. Regulation of Cell Biology by Phosphorylation of VE-cadherin on Tyr-658 and Tyr-731—EMT represents a critical reprogramming of the cell that occurs during tissue remodeling associated with wound healing, angiogenesis, and cancer (31Thiery J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). EMT has been linked to loss of cadherin adhesive function, reduction of expression from the cell surface, and/or disruption in its association with the cytoskeleton. In addition, EMT results in the gain of a migratory phenotype. CHO cells lack cadherin expression and thereby display a fibroblastic or mesenchymal appearance (data not shown). In contrast, CHO cells expressing wild-type VE-cadherin exhibited an epithelium-like appearance with intense cadherin expression at cell junctions and very few focal contacts (Fig. 5A, left panel). Cells expressing the VE-cadherin mutants Y658E or Y731E continued to express significant levels of cadherin at cell junctions, but interestingly, these cells displayed increased numbers of focal contacts consistent with a more migratory, invasive phenotype (Fig. 5A, middle and right panels). These focal contacts could be identified with the phosphospecific antibody to tyrosine 861 of FAK, a site normally phosphorylated in migratory cells (32Eliceiri B.P. Puente X.S. Hood J.D. Stupack D.G. Schlaepfer D.D. Huang X.Z. Sheppard D. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). EMT has been linked to a loss of cadherin cell surface expression or a decrease in cadherin-mediated homotypic adhesion. To evaluate whether either of these possibilities might account for the phenotypic change seen in cells expressing VE-cadherins with mutations at sites Tyr-658 or Tyr-731, we measured the adhesive properties of cadherin-expressing CHO cells. Cells expressing either wild-type or mutant VE-cadherins were allowed to attach to immobilized recombinant VE-cadherin. Expression of wild-type VE-cadherin led to robust adhesion of cells to an immobilized VE-cadherin·Fc fusion protein, whereas control cells lacking cadherin failed to adhere (Fig. 5B). To our surprise, none of the Y-E or Y-F mutations suppressed the expression level of cadherin or the adhesivity of these cells to immobilized VE-cadherin·Fc (Fig. 5B). Thus, the phenotypic changes associated with VE-cadherin mutations cannot be attributed to decreased VE-cadherin adhesive function. However, our assay was not designed to measure the tenacity of the VE-cadherin-mediated adhesions and therefore cannot discriminate between subtle effects the mutations may have had upon VE-cadherin adhesive function. Induction of Cell Migration by VE-cadherin Phosphorylation—Mesenchymal cells are characterized by their capacity to undergo migration/invasion. Based on the appearance of increased numbers of focal contacts in the cells expressing the Y658E and Y731E mutants, we suspected that these cells might display increased migration relative to cells expressing wild-type VE-cadherin. To investigate this possibility, cells were placed in migration chambers and allowed to undergo haptotaxis on a collagen substrate. Cells expressing wild-type VE-cadherin showed decreased levels of migration compared with control cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 5C). Cells expressing either Y658E or Y731E showed a marked increase in migration relative to cells expressing wild-type VE-cadherin and displayed migration levels similar to control cells (Fig. 5C). These findings reveal that a single Y-E phosphomimetic point mutation in the tail of VE-cadherin, causing the simple uncoupling of either p120- or β-catenin with no change in cadherin adhesive properties or cell surface expression, is sufficient to initiate a migratory response consistent with the maintenance of a mesenchymal phenotype. Cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions play a critical role in maintaining the epithelial cell phenotype and regulation of cell barrier function. Accordingly, disruption of cell-cell junctions has been associated with the breakdown of cellular barriers and the initiation of EMT (33Peinado H. Portillo F. Cano A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 34Yang J. Mani S.A. Donaher J.L. Ramaswamy S. Itzykson R.A. Come C. Savagner P. Gitelman I. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A.

Growth factors, cytokines, or oncogenes are physiological regulators of cadherin function because they induce intracellular signals that disrupt cell-cell junctions, promote actin reorganization, and induce a migratory phenotype (35Brunton V.G. MacPherson I.R. Frame M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 121-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that disruption of cell-cell junctions depends on intracellular kinases and/or phosphatases that regulate the phosphorylation state of cadherins and their cytosolic binding partners including α-, β-, γ-, and p120-catenin (6Vincent P.A.

Epithelial cells of different histological origins express a distinct repertoire of cadherins. For example, E-cadherin is expressed by a variety of epithelial cells, whereas VE-cadherin is restricted to endothelial cells where it regulates vascular permeability and angiogenesis (7Carmeliet P. Collen D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 23Weis S. Shintani S. Weber A. Kirchmair R. Wood M. Cravens A. McSharry H. Iwakura A. Yoon Y.S. Himes N.

J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 743-748PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, VEGF has been shown to disrupt endothelial barrier function via disruption of VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions (8Weis S. Cui J. Barnes L. Cheresh D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 22Eliceiri B.P. Paul R. Schwartzberg P.L. Hood J.D. Leng J. Cheresh D.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 915-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). This initial disruption of barrier function must then be maintained throughout the process of endothelial cell migration/invasion that takes place during angiogenesis. VE-cadherin becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to VEGF (17Esser S. Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Dejana E. Risau W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet it remains unclear whether this phosphorylation contributes to loss of endothelial barrier function, induction of EMT, or maintenance of a mesenchymal state once angiogenesis is under way. There are nine tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of VE-cadherin, and we sought to understand whether one or several of these sites play a critical role in regulation of VE-cadherin function. To assess the role of phosphorylation in VE-cadherin function we expressed wild-type or mutant forms of VE-cadherin in CHO cells that lack endogenous cadherins. Specifically, each tyrosine was mutated to either glutamic acid (phosphomimetic), phenylalanine (non-phosphorylatable), or alanine (non-conservative). CHO cells expressing wild-type or mutant cadherins were evaluated for cell-cell junctional activity. Two of the nine Y-E mutants (Y658E and Y731E) not only revealed defects in cell barrier function while maintaining VE-cadherin cell surface expression but also failed to bind p120- and β-catenin, respectively. These tyrosines lie at the heart of regions of this protein shown previously to bind p120- and β-catenin (37Navarro P. Ruco L. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 38Ferber A. Yaen C. Sarmiento E. Martinez J. Exp.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1175-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To our surprise, cells expressing either of these two mutants demonstrated additional properties consistent with a mesenchymal phenotype, as characterized by formation of focal contacts and a migratory response. Based on these findings, we conclude that either Tyr-658 or Tyr-731 in VE-cadherin can play a critical role in regulation of VE-cadherin function and that functional VE-cadherin junctions depend on interactions with both β-catenin and p120-catenin. Src family kinase activation has been shown to promote uncoupling of VE-cadherin and E-cadherin. In fact, mice deficient in pp60-Src or pp62-Yes or wild-type mice treated with a Src inhibitor have profound defects in VEGF-mediated vascular permeability associated with the stabilization of VE-cadherin-mediated endothelial cell-cell junctions (8Weis S. Cui J. Barnes L. Cheresh D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 22Eliceiri B.P. Paul R. Schwartzberg P.L. Hood J.D. Leng J. Cheresh D.A. Mol.

Supporting a role for Src in the regulation of VE-cadherin, we found that VE-cadherin mutants containing Y658F and Y731F showed dramatically decreased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in CHO cells expressing constitutively active Src. However, it remains to be determined whether the role of Src in this process is direct or indirect. In addition to kinases, phosphatases such as VE-PTP, PTP1B, PTPμ, and SHP-2 have been shown to influence cadherin function (26Nawroth R. Poell G. Ranft A. Kloep S. Samulowitz U. Fachinger G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5983-5986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For example, VE-PTP is known to associate with VE-cadherin and control its level of phosphorylation (26Nawroth R. Poell G. Ranft A. Kloep S. Samulowitz U. Fachinger G. Golding M. Shima D.T. Deutsch U. Vestweber D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4885-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we showed that phosphatase inhibition was capable of potentiating VE-cadherin phosphorylation at Tyr-658 and Tyr-731, leading to a disruption of cell-cell barrier function. In support of this finding, expression of phosphomimetic mutations also resulted in a loss of VE-cadherin-mediated barrier function. We contend that the observed loss in barrier function was due to the uncoupling of cadherin from the cytoskeleton via the dissociation of β-catenin or p120-catenin and not because of a simple loss of VE-cadherin adhesive function or expression on the cell surface. Of interest, a comparison of cadherin cytoplasmic domains provides insight into the potential mechanisms by which other cadherin family members are regulated (Fig. 6). With the exception of E-cadherin, the Tyr-658 site is well conserved among cadherins, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue may be a general mechanism to disrupt cell barrier function. Conversely, the Tyr-731 site is unique to VE-cadherin, suggesting that regulation of this residue may involve an endothelium-specific mechanism, as would be required for transient vascular permeability responses. Future experiments will aim to address such issues. In addition to the role of p120-catenin in modulating cadherin adhesion and actin dynamics (12Reynolds A.B. Roczniak-Ferguson A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), p120-catenin has also been implicated in the regulation of cadherin expression at the cell surface. Using endothelial cells, several groups have reported that disruption of binding of p120-catenin to VE-cadherin can result in cadherin internalization and degradation (11Iyer S. Ferreri D.M. DeCocco N.C. Minnear F.L. Vincent P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L1143-L1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Xiao K. Allison D.F. Buckley K.M. Kottke M.D. Vincent P.A. Faundez V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 19199-19208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, in our experimental system, VE-cadherin expression at the cell surface of CHO cells appeared constant, regardless of cytoplasmic tail mutations that affected binding to catenins. This could be explained by differences that likely exist between the internalization/degradation machinery of CHO cells compared with endothelial cells. Alternatively, as our cell selection procedures employed the use of flow cytometry to select for cells that did express VE-cadherin, it is possible that those cells with reduced cadherin cell surface expression levels were excluded from our analyses. Together, our findings provide new insight into the regulation of EMT. We define an intracellular pathway that can regulate this process via phosphorylation of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail and thereby provide new insight into the role that cadherins and their associated molecules play in development, tissue remodeling, and various disease states. Furthermore, our findings indicate that kinases capable of phosphorylating specific sites within the cadherin C terminus can direct cells to maintain a mesenchymal phenotype."

During stress and inflammation, mast cells mediate increased mucosal permeability by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesized that mast cell tryptase cleaves protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) on colonocytes to increase paracellular permeability. Colonocytes expressed PAR2 mRNA and responded to PAR2 agonists with increased [Ca2+]i. Supernatant from degranulated mast cells increased [Ca2+]i in colonocytes, which was prevented by a tryptase inhibitor, and desensitized responses to PAR2 agonist, suggesting PAR2 cleavage. When applied to the basolateral surface of colonocytes, PAR2 agonists and mast cell supernatant decreased transepithelial resistance, increased transepithelial flux of macromolecules, and induced redistribution of tight junction ZO-1 and occludin and perijunctional F-actin. When mast cells were co-cultured with colonocytes, mast cell degranulation increased paracellular permeability of colonocytes. This was prevented by a tryptase inhibitor. We determined the role of ERK1/2 and of β-arrestins, which recruit ERK1/2 to PAR2 in endosomes and retain ERK1/2 in the cytosol, on PAR2-mediated alterations in permeability. An ERK1/2 inhibitor abolished the effects of PAR2 agonist on permeability and redistribution of F-actin. Down-regulation of β-arrestins with small interfering RNA inhibited PAR2-induced activation of ERK1/2 and suppressed PAR2-induced changes in permeability. Thus, mast cells signal to colonocytes in a paracrine manner by release of tryptase and activation of PAR2. PAR2 couples to β-arrestin-dependent activation of ERK1/2, which regulates reorganization of perijunctional F-actin to increase epithelial permeability. These mechanisms may explain the increased epithelial permeability of the intestine during stress and inflammation.

TJs are composed of the transmembrane proteins occludin and claudins that interact with the zonula occludens (ZO) proteins, which bind to perijunctional actin and myosin filaments. It is important to understand the mechanisms of assembly and disassembly of TJs because they control paracellular permeability and consequently protect against mucosal inflammation. In the inflamed intestine permeability is increased, and tight junctions are lost (2May G.R. Sutherland L.R. Meddings J.B.

Moreover, cytokines, allergens, and bacterial products induce intestinal inflammation in part by causing redistribution of TJ proteins and increasing permeability (7Chen M.L. Pothoulakis C.

However, the mast cell products that mediate this effect and their mechanism of action are unknown. Mast cells are replete with proteases that may induce alterations in epithelial permeability. The major protease of human mast cells is tryptase (12Miller H.R. Pemberton A.D. Immunology. 2002; 105: 375-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Upon release, tryptase may remain active in tissues for prolonged periods as it is poorly diffusible and resistant to endogenous inhibitors (12Miller H.R. Pemberton A.D. Immunology. 2002; 105: 375-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Antigen challenge of sensitized subjects promotes release of mast cell proteases into the intestinal lumen and vasculature, which correlates with increased permeability (13Scudamore C.L.

However, the effects of these proteases on permeability of the intestinal epithelium and their mechanisms of action are unknown. Proteases can signal to cells by cleaving protease-activated receptors (PARs), a family of four G-protein-coupled receptors (reviewed in Ref. 19Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol.

Injection of trypsin and PAR2-activating peptide (AP, corresponding to the tethered ligand) into the intestinal lumen increases epithelial permeability and promotes infiltration of bacteria (26Cenac N.

However, the mechanisms by which PAR2 activation couples to assembly of TJs and regulates interactions of TJ proteins with the cytoskeleton are unknown. In enterocytes, PAR2 interacts with the multi-adaptor protein β-arrestin (βARR), which mediates receptor endocytosis and recruits activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) to endosomes (29DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Cytosolically retained ERK1/2 may regulate the cytoskeleton to control paracellular permeability (30Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol.

Eye Res. 2004; 78: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that mast cells signal to colonocytes by release of tryptase and activation of PAR2, and that PAR2 couples to ERK1/2 by a βARR-dependent mechanism to regulate TJ assembly, perijunctional filamentous actin (F-actin), and paracellular permeability. Our goals were as follows: 1) to examine expression of PAR2 by colonocytes; 2) to investigate the effects of PAR2 activation on assembly of TJs and permeability; 3) to determine whether mast cells signal to colonocytes to increase permeability by release of tryptase and activation of PAR2; and 4) to investigate the role of ERK1/2 and βARR in this process. PAR2 Agonists and Protease Inhibitors—Sources of pancreatic trypsin, AP (human SLIGKV-NH2 or rat/mouse SLIGRL-NH2), and the inactive reverse peptide (RP) (VKGILS-NH2 or LRGILS-NH2 control) have been described (32Steinhoff M.

Mouse primary antibody isotype control and chromatographically purified rabbit IgG were from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and rabbit IgG isotype control was from Bethyl Laboratories. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Texas Red-, Alexa 488-, and phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Colonic Epithelial Cells—T84 colonic epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 5% FCS, 14 mm sodium bicarbonate, 15 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (5% CO2, 37 °C). NCM460 cells (R. Benya, University of Illinois), a nontransformed human colonocyte line (35Moyer M.P. Manzano L.A. Merriman R.L. Stauffer J.S. Tanzer L.R. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1996; 32: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium with 20% FCS, 0.5 units/ml insulin-transferrin, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 0.58 μg/ml glutamine (5% CO2, 37 °C). T84 and NCM460 cells were plated on plastic for RT-PCR and ERK1/2 assays and on glass coverslips for measurement of [Ca2+]i. T84 cells were plated on transwell polycarbonate filters (0.4 μm pore, 4.7 cm2, 0.5-1.0 × 106 cells/well) for study of permeability and redistribution of junctional proteins (7Chen M.L. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4247-4254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Studies commenced when transepithelial resistance (TER) exceeded 1,000 Ω·cm-2, determined using Millicell ERS apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA). When used, T84 cells were treated with the 10 μm MEK inhibitor UO126 (Calbiochem) for 30 min prior to adding AP or RP, and TER and F-actin localizations were assessed after 24 h. Mast Cells—Cultured human mast cells (CHMC, Rigel Pharmaceuticals, South San Francisco, CA) were derived from CD34+ precursor cells from umbilical cord blood. Cells were cultured for 5 days in Stem-Pro medium (Invitrogen) containing 200 ng/ml stem cell factor, 20 ng/ml flt3 ligand, 200 ng/ml interleukin 6, and 100 ng/ml IgE (all from Cortex Biochem. Inc., San Leandro, CA) to induce differentiation into mucosal type mast cells containing tryptase and not chymase. The human mast cell line HMC1 (J. H. Butterfield, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (36Butterfield J. Weiler D. Hunt L. Wynn S. Roche P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) was cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% iron-supplemented FCS, 1.2 mm α-thioglycerol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (5% CO2, 37 °C). To induce degranulation, CHMC (5 × 106 cells/ml HBSS, 0.1% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, 25 μg/ml heparin, pH 7.4) were challenged with rabbit IgE antibody (1:1,000, 30 min, 37 °C) or vehicle (control). HMC1 (106 cells/ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were challenged with compound 48/80 (5 μg/ml, 15 min, 37 °C) to induce degranulation. After treatments, CHMC and HMC1 were pelleted (14,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and supernatants were assayed for tryptase and effects on [Ca2+]i and permeability of colonocytes. Co-culture of T84 and HMC1 Cells—T84 cells (106 cells/well) were cultured on filters until confluent. HMC1 cells were added to the basal compartment (106 cells in 1.5 ml). Cells were co-cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. To degranulate mast cells, compound 48/80 (5 μg/ml) was added to the basal compartment. Permeability of the T84 monolayers was determined after 24 h. RT-PCR—Total RNA from T84 and NCM460 cells was reverse-transcribed. PCRs used primers specific for PAR2 (forward, 5′-ccctttgtatgtcgtgaagcagac-3′; reverse, 5′-ttcctggagtgtttctttgaggtg-3′), trypsinogens (forward, 5′-gccaagcttcgcgtgtccaccatctgtgtcg-3′; reverse, 5′-cagcggccgcttagctgttggcagctatggtg-3′), βARR1 (forward, 5′-ggacaagaagcccctgacgcg-3′; reverse, 5′-agcctcttccatggcaacagg-3′), and βARR2 (forward, 5′-tcaactcgaacaagatgacca-3′; reverse 5′-gtggcatagttggtatcaaat-3′). Reverse transcriptase was omitted from controls. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis and sequenced. Tryptase Assay—Samples were incubated with 200 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml heparin containing 0.5 mm tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm to assess cleavage. Inhibitors were preincubated with samples for 15 min on ice before assay. Results are expressed as nanomoles of cleaved substrate/min/106 cells. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—T84 and NCM460 cells were incubated in HBSS with 0.1% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2.5-5 μm Fura-2AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30-45 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were mounted in an open chamber (500 μl volume) in HBSS with 0.1% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, and fluorescence of individual cells was measured at 340 and 380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission (22Corvera C.U. Dery O. McConalogue K. Bohm S.K. Khitin L.M. Caughey G.H. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A Fura-2 calcium imaging calibration kit (Molecular Probes) was used to calculate [Ca2+]i according to the manufacturer's directions. A standard curve was generated (0.017-39.8 μm) and used to convert the emission ratio at 340/380 nm excitation to estimate the free [Ca2+]i.AP or proteases were added directly to the chamber in a volume of 50 μl, and maximal increases in [Ca2+]i were determined. In assays of mast cell products, the supernatant was obtained from 5 × 106 CHMC or HMC1, and 50 μl was added to the chamber to a final volume of 500 μl. When used, cells were preincubated with RWJ337842 (10 μm) for 2 min. To assess the contribution of extracellular Ca2+ ions to changes in [Ca2+]i, cells were incubated in Ca2+-free HBSS with 0.1% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For concentration-response analyses, cells were exposed to a single concentration of agonists and then 5 μm ionomycin. Results were normalized and are expressed as percent responses to 5 μm ionomycin. The EC50 was calculated by using Origin Microcal software (Northampton, MA). For desensitization experiments, cells were preincubated with proteases or vehicle (control) for 2-5 min and then challenged with AP, without an intervening wash. Observations were repeated in >4 separate experiments. TER and Paracellular Flux of Macromolecules—Test substances were added to the apical or basal compartments of transwell with confluent T84 cells on filters. TER was determined as described at 0-48 h. Results are expressed as Ω·cm-2 and are normalized as percentage of base-line values. To measure paracellular flux of macromolecules, horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 44 kDa, type II, Sigma, 0.01 mm) was added to the apical compartment at 24 h. After 2 h, samples were obtained from medium in the apical and basolateral compartments and assayed for HRP using a kinetic enzymatic assay as described (9Santos J. Yang P.C. Soderholm J.D. Benjamin M. Perdue M.H. Gut. 2001; 48: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Soderholm J.D. Yang P.C. Ceponis P. Vohra A. Riddell R. Sherman P.M. Perdue M.H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). HRP flux is expressed as percentage of apically added HRP recovered in basolateral compartment over 2 h. Measurements of TER and HRP flux were made from four wells per experiment, and experiments were repeated four times. Immunofluorescence—T84 cells grown to confluence on filters were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated in PBS with 5% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 with primary antibodies to junctional proteins: rabbit ZO-1, mouse occludin, and mouse claudin1 (1:50-200, overnight, 4 °C). Filters were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-IgG or anti-mouse (1:200, 2 h, room temperature). To detect F-actin, fixed, permeabilized cells were incubated with Texas Red-X-phalloidin (5 units/ml, Molecular Probes) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were mounted in Prolong with DAPI (Molecular Probes). To localize IgE receptor and tryptase in CHMC, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with rabbit anti-human IgE (2 μg/ml) and mouse anti-human tryptase (2 μg/ml) antibodies (overnight, 4 °C), washed, incubated with Texas Red- and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and mouse IgG (1:100, 2 h, room temperature), and mounted. In control experiments, the primary antibodies were replaced with isotype control antibodies at the same dilutions. Microscopy—For confocal microscopy, specimens were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with a Bio-Rad MRC1000 confocal microscope using Zeiss Fluar ×20 (NA 1.0), Plan Apo ×40 (NA 1.4), ×100 (NA 1.3) objectives (29DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). For z projections, 125-300 line sections were taken at 0.2-μm intervals to enable observation of the apical and basal membranes of T84 cells on filters. For epifluorescence microscopy, specimens were observed using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope with a Spot digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, McHenry, IL). Images were processed to adjust contrast and brightness using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Flow Cytometry—CHMC, which had been cultured with 100 ng/ml IgE for 5 days, were suspended in 100 mm PBS, pH 7.4, containing 2% fetal bovine serum (0.5 × 106 cells/ml). Cells were incubated with rabbit anti-human IgE antibody (5 μg/ml) or rabbit IgG isotype control (5 μg/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (2 μg/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and suspended in 1 ml of PBS/fetal bovine serum. Cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Fluorophores were excited at 488 nm, and emission was collected at 575/25 nm for phycoerythrin. Cellular Fractionation and Western Blotting—T84 cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and passed 10 times through a 21-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant formed the Triton-soluble or cytosolic fraction. The pellet was ultrasonicated in Triton buffer containing 1% SDS and cleared (15,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) to give the Triton-insoluble or TJ fraction. Samples (5-20 μg of protein determined by Bradford method) were fractionated on 7-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h, and blots were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature: Z-O1, occludin, claudin-1, and E-cadherin (1:100-1:200). Membranes were washed and incubated with goat anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1 h, room temperature), and proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Experiments were repeated four times. ERK1/2 Assays—T84 cells were serum-deprived for 12-16 h. Cells were lysed with 100 μl of RIPA (10 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors. Samples (5-20 μg of protein determined by Bradford method) were fractionated by 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were incubated with antibody to pERK1/2 (1:5,000 overnight, 4 °C) (29DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Membranes were stripped and reblotted for ERK2 (1:5,000 overnight, 4 °C). Signals were detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence. Experiments were repeated four times. βARR siRNA—siRNA duplexes of 21-nucleotide sense and 21-nucleotide antisense strands with 2-nucleotide 3′-dTdT overhangs were designed to target rat βARR1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_012910) and βARR2 (GenBank™ accession number NM_012911.1) by searching for the motif AA(N19) (where N indicates any nucleotide) and selecting unique sequences (determined by blast of NCBI data base) with ∼50% G/C content (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO). Chosen sequences were βARR1 5′-gagcgacucaucaagaagcdTdT-3′ (304-322 from start codon) and βARR2 5′-cucaagcacgaagacaccadTdT-3′ (880-898 from start codon), and control siRNA 5′-aacgaagcaacuaagcucgdTdT-3′ did not target any gene. T84 cells (30-50% confluence for βARR Western blotting and ERK1/2 assays and TER >1,000 Ω·cm-2 for permeability assays) were transfected with siRNA (5 μl of 20 μm stock added apically) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. For βARR Western blotting, cells were lysed at various times after transfection with 100 μl of RIPA (10 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors. Samples (5-20 μg of protein determined by Bradford method) were fractionated by 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. βARR1 and -2 were detected by Western blotting of whole cell lysates using antibodies to βARR1 (1:300, overnight, 4 °C) or βARR2 (1:2,500, overnight, 4 °C). Membranes were stripped and re-blotted for γ-tubulin (1:3,000, overnight, 4 °C). Signals were detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence. Experiments were repeated 3-4 times. The effects of AP on activation of ERK1/2 and on TER and HRP flux were examined 3-4 days after transfection. Densitometry—Western blot signals were quantified using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD), and densitometry data from independent experiments were averaged for statistical analysis.

Here we show that O-GlcNAc is an important regulator of the cell cycle. Increased O-GlcNAc (pharmacologically or genetically) results in growth defects linked to delays in G2/M progression, altered mitotic phosphorylation, and cyclin expression. Overexpression of O-GlcNAcase, the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc, induces a mitotic exit phenotype accompanied by a delay in mitotic phosphorylation, altered cyclin expression, and pronounced disruption in nuclear organization. Overexpression of the O-GlcNAc transferase, the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc, results in a polyploid phenotype with faulty cytokinesis. Notably, O-GlcNAc transferase is concentrated at the mitotic spindle and midbody at M phase. These data suggest that dynamic O-GlcNAc processing is a pivotal regulatory component of the cell cycle, controlling cell cycle progression by regulating mitotic phosphorylation, cyclin expression, and cell division.

Because of the discovery of cyclins 22 years ago (1Evans T. Rosenthal E.T. Youngblom J. Distel D. Hunt T. Cell. 1983; 33: 389-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), a working model of the cell cycle has slowly been constructed. The cell cycle oscillator is composed of protein phosphorylation, timed expression of cyclins, and well orchestrated cell division (2Murray A.M. Cell. 2004; 116: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a detailed mechanism of the cell cycle is still incomplete. Knockouts of proteins thought critical for proper cell cycle function such as cyclin D only partially disrupt the cell cycle, and function can be completely restored by cyclin E knock-in (3Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H. Li T. Weinberg R.A. Sicinski P. Cell. 1999; 97: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, cyclin E knockouts are viable (4Geng Y. Yu Q. Sicinska E. Das M. Schneider J.E. Bhattacharya S. Rideout III, W.M. Bronson R.T. Gardner H. Sicinski P.

Recently, RNA-mediated interference was used to knockdown the Drosophila kinome (7Bettencourt-Dias M. Giet R. Sinka R. Mazumdar A. Lock W.G. Balloux F. Zafiropoulos P.J. Yamaguchi S. Winter S.

One-third of all kinases knocked down in this study caused cell cycle defects. Clearly, many pathways in the cell cycle have redundant features, and other mechanisms of growth control exist. Despite the publication of more than 7000 papers within the last 5 years on the roles of phosphorylation in the cell cycle, the mechanisms regulating cell cycle progression are still not well understood. Although phosphorylation is the molecular mechanism generally associated with the regulation of cell cycle proteins, another potential regulator that has not been studied in this context is the abundant post-translational modification O-GlcNAc 2The abbreviations used are: O-GlcNAc, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine; OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; PUGNAc, phenylurethane of O-GlcNAc; DON, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine; pRB, retinoblastoma protein; YY1, Yin Yang 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; OGlcNAcase, β-N-acetylglucosaminindase. (8Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc is a ubiquitous post-translational modification in which a single β-N-acetylglucosamine molecule is O-linked to serine or threonine residues on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (9Slawson C. Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc is thought to act as a modulator of protein function in a manner analogous to protein phosphorylation; the addition of O-GlcNAc to the protein backbone is dynamic and responds to morphogens (10Kearse K.P.

These data suggest a mechanism by which O-GlcNAc modulates cellular function by competing with phosphorylation. Accumulating evidence suggests O-GlcNAc may function as a global regulator of cell growth and division. Deletion of OGT in mouse embryonic fibroblasts is associated with delayed growth, increased expression of the cyclin inhibitor p27, and death (22O'Donnell N. Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Mol.

In this study we show that global O-GlcNAc protein modification is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, and this dynamic regulation is essential for cell cycle progression. Disruption of O-GlcNAc cycling through pharmacological manipulation or overexpression of OGT or O-GlcNAcase results in major cell cycle defects. Furthermore, we show that the enzymatic processing of O-GlcNAc is critical for proper M-phase progression, cytokinesis, and mitotic protein phosphorylation. These data suggest O-GlcNAc plays a key role in the coordinate regulation of protein function required for correct cell cycle progression and cell division.

Polyclonal anti-O-GlcNAcase was a kind gift from Stewart Whiteheart at the University of Kentucky (1:1000). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences, whereas fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 647, Alexa Fluor 488) were from Molecular Probes. Blots were developed using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) on Amersham Hyper-film. Nocodazole, thymidine, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), RNase A, propidium iodide, insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were from Sigma. PUGNAc was purchased from Carbogen (Switzerland). [6-3H]Thymidine was from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture and Synchronization—Unless otherwise noted, most cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (5 mm glucose, Invitrogen) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Cell Gro) and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). For double thymidine block synchronization, 1 day post-plating (2.0 or 4.0 × 105 cells/10-cm dish) cells were incubated in complete media containing 2 mm thymidine. Cells were returned to normal media for 12 h then placed back into thymidine media for an additional 12 h (at this time 10 μm DON or 100 μm PUGNAc was added). Cells were then released into complete media (with or without DON/PUGNAc) and harvested at various time points. Alternatively, HeLa cells were incubated in nocodazole (400 ng/ml) overnight (12 h) before harvesting. 3T3-L1 cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (5 mm glucose, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Two days post-confluence, cells were released into mitotic clonal expansion by the addition of 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 10 μg/ml insulin (30Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

Adenoviral Constructs and Infection—O-GlcNAcase was subcloned from pcDNA3.1HisA-O-GlcNAcase (NotI/XbaI; Gao et al. (17Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar)) into pShuttle (NheI/XbaI, BD Biosciences Clontech). O-GlcNAcase was subsequently subcloned from pShuttle-O-GlcNAcase into Adeno-X viral DNA (BD Biosciences Clontech), and the resulting adenovirus was propagated and amplified in HEK293A cells according to manufacturer's instructions. Adenovirus was purified from crude viral lysate by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. Adenoviral titer was determined by plaque assay according to manufacturer's instructions. OGT adenovirus was a generous gift from Dillmann (University of California at San Diego) (31Clark R.J. McDonough P.M. Swanson E. Trost S.U. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. Dillmann W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44230-44237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The GFP adenovirus was purchased from the Baylor College of Medicine Vector Development Laboratory (vector.bcm.tmc.edu). HeLa cells were infected at the first thymidine block with O-GlcNAcase, OGT, or control GFP adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection = 50 (vO-GlcNAcase or vOGT). At the second thymidine release, the cells had been infected for 48 h. Analysis of Proteins—Cells were washed and lysed as described previously (11Zachara N.E. O'Donnell N. Cheung W.D. Mercer J.J. Marth J.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30133-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein dye reagent. Protein extracts (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on criterion Tris-glycine gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline, and detected with antibodies listed above. Some blots were stripped at room temperature for 1 h in 200 mm glycine (pH 2.7) and reprobed using different antibodies. YY1 and Sp1 were immunoprecipitated from radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lysates (Tris-buffered saline with 1% Np-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and blotted as described above. Cell Growth Assay—Cells (1.0 × 104 cells/2 cm well) were then incubated with PUGNAc (100 μm in Milli-Q water, Millipore) every 12 h. The alamarBlue proliferative assay was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions (BIOSOURCE Inc.), and the absorbance was read at 630 nm. Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells were plated onto Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma). At the time of harvest, cells were washed in PBS containing 1 mm Mg2+, then fixed in PBS/Mg2+ containing 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Sigma). Next, cells were washed 2 × 10 min in PBS/Mg2+ containing 100 mm glycine (pH 7.4), permeabilized in PBS/Mg2+ containing 1% (v/v) Triton-X100 (Sigma) for 10 min, and washed as before. The cells were blocked in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin Tris-buffered saline with .05% Tween 20 and incubated with various antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing 3 × 10 min in buffered saline with .05% Tween 20 and secondary treatment for 1 h at room temperature, cells were washed again and then incubated for 1 min in PBS/Mg2+ with 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X100 and propidium iodide (1 μg/ml). Cells were washed as before and mounted. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss Ultra View 2 confocal microscope at the Johns Hopkins University microscope core facility. Flow Cytometry and Thymidine Incorporation—HeLa cells were synchronized and released as described above. Cells were harvested after trypsin (Invitrogen) digestion and washed in PBS. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS then fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol (v/v) added dropwise while vortexing. The cells were stored until further use at -20 °C. Fixed cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml RNase A, and 0.2% (w/v) propidium iodide. Next, cells were examined for cell cycle stage at the Johns Hopkins University Flow Cytometry core facility using a BD Biosciences FACScaliber. Data were analyzed using Cell Quest. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was performed according to the method described by Tang and Lane (32Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Dynamic O-GlcNAc Protein Modification Is Required for Cell Growth—To test the hypothesis that dynamic O-GlcNAc protein modification is a control mechanism for cellular growth, we raised global levels of O-GlcNAc using the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor PUGNAc and determined the growth rate of multiple cell lines. Cell number was measured daily; differences between control and PUGNAc-treated cells were evident at 4 days and pronounced at 5 days (Fig. 1A). In almost every cell line studied, elevating O-GlcNAc levels reduced the cells growth rate (Fig. 1A). However, logarithmically growing 3T3-L1 cells showed only a slight inhibition of growth upon chronic PUGNAc treatment. This is most likely due to the low permeability of PUGNAc in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells. O-GlcNAc- and Proline-directed Phosphorylation Are Reciprocal at M Phase—Next, we determined if O-GlcNAc levels were regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner; HeLa cells were mitotically arrested at the metaphase-anaphase transition with nocodazole (400 ng/ml, 12 h) (33Haltiwanger R.S. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in total cell extract were determined by immunoblot with an O-GlcNAc-specific antibody (29Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc staining was decreased compared with asynchronous control (Fig. 1B, right panel). Although the overall O-GlcNAc levels decrease in these cells and O-GlcNAc staining on a few proteins completely disappears (see blue arrows), an increase in O-GlcNAc staining is seen on several proteins (see red arrows). We next determined the level of proline-directed phosphorylation using the antibody MPM-2, whose staining is known to increases during M phase (34Davis F.M. Tsao T.T. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). As expected the M-phase-arrested cells (nocodazole-treated) show a dramatic increase in the levels of MPM-2 reactivity (Fig. 1B, left panel). Sensitive Coomassie Blue staining of gels indicates that the polypeptide levels of most of the O-GlcNAc-modified or M-phase-phosphorylated proteins does not change (data not shown). To determine whether O-GlcNAc and phosphorylation were reciprocal, we measured MPM-2 reactivity in cells treated with PUGNAc. Because PUGNAc inhibits O-GlcNAcase, the enzyme responsible for removing the sugar modification, we expected the increase in overall O-GlcNAc levels in both asynchronous and nocodazole-treated cells. Although PUGNAc increased the extent of 110.6 staining on many proteins in nocodazole-treated cells, PUGNAc treatment did not alter the distribution of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in these cells. Proline-directed phosphorylation is not perturbed. Although no effect of PUGNAc was seen on proline-directed phosphorylation, we cannot rule out changes on specific proteins not resolved at the one-dimensional level. To confirm that O-GlcNAc levels change on individual low abundance proteins and not the levels of the polypeptides themselves, we looked at two regulatory proteins already known to be O-GlcNAc-modified, Sp1 (35Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and YY1 (Fig. 1C) (36Hiromura M. Choi C.H. Sabourin N.A. Jones H. Bachvarov D. Usheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14046-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 37Austen M. Luscher B. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). When YY1 is immunoprecipitated from asynchronous and nocodazole-treated HeLa cells, the levels of O-GlcNAc on this transcription factor change (Fig. 1C). Nocodazole treatment causes an increase in 110.6 staining in a higher molecular weight band of YY1 and a decrease in 110.6 staining in a lower molecular weight band. When YY1 is immunoprecipitated from PUGNAc/nocodazole-synchronized cells, the extent of O-GlcNAc modification significantly increases, but the electrophoretic pattern is similar to untreated cells. The protein expression of YY1 is constant, and the 110.6 staining is completely abolished when 100 mm N-acetylglucosamine is added to the primary antibody mixture (data not shown). The Sp1 also shows an increase in glycosylation at M phase with no change in the protein expression (data not shown). Interestingly, when HeLa cells are treated with PUGNAc, the levels of the O-GlcNAc-processing enzymes change (Fig. 1D). Triplicate samples are shown after 18 h of PUGNAc treatment in which OGT levels decline and O-GlcNAcase samples increase. Pharmacological Modulation of O-GlcNAc Levels Disorganizes Cell Cycle Progression—To delineate the role of O-GlcNAc in cell cycle regulation, we measured the rate of cell cycle progression by flow cytometry in synchronized HeLa cells (double thymidine block). At the second thymidine block cells were treated with PUGNAc (100 μm) to raise O-GlcNAc levels or with 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine, DON, (10 μm) to lower levels. DON reduces O-GlcNAc levels due to its ability to inhibit glutamine fructose-6-amidotransferase, the rate-controlling enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which produces the substrate for OGT (38Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zachara N.E. O'Donnell N. Cheung W.D. Mercer J.J. Marth J.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30133-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Cells with elevated O-GlcNAc (PUGNAc treatment) consistently demonstrate a delay in G2/M progression (Fig. 2A). In control cells almost 50% of the population had progressed through M phase and returned to G1 phase 10 h after release. In contrast, only 20% of PUGNAc-treated cells had returned to G1. Conversely, cells with decreased O-GlcNAc (DON) progress through the cell cycle at an accelerated rate compared with control (Fig. 2B). DON-treated cells moved through S phase faster, and by 14 h post-release 81% of the cells had returned to G1 phase compared with only 53% in controls. Glucosamine is a down-stream metabolite of glutamine fructose-6-amidotransferase and should ablate the effect of DON. When 10 mm glucosamine is added with DON, cells progress at rates similar to control or PUGNAc-treated cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). To determine whether DON treatment accelerated S-phase progression, DNA synthesis was measured in synchronized HeLa cells by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2C). DON-treated cells reached maximal thymidine incorporation at 4 h, whereas control peaked at 5 h, and PUGNAc-treated cells peaked at 6 h. Next, we repeated these experiments in an independent model of cell cycle synchronization that does not relay on chemical block. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes cells when grown to confluency become growth-quiescent. These cells are hormonally induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes. Induction of differentiation is first characterized by two rounds of synchronized cell cycle progression called mitotic clonal expansion (39Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Quiescent preadipocytes cells were treated with 100 μm PUGNAc or 25 μm DON 12 h before induction of mitotic clonal expansion and again at induction. Cells with elevated O-GlcNAc (PUGNAc-treated) consistently showed significant delays in cell cycle progression compared with non-treated controls (Fig. 3A). The delay corresponded with the results seen earlier in the HeLa cells (Fig. 2). Cells treated with DON failed to escape the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The addition of DON to 3T3-L1 cells at the time of mitotic clonal expansion induction or 12 h post-release in late G1 failed to escape G1. However, DON added at 16 h (start of S phase) post-release did not interfere with 3T3-L1 cell growth (data not shown). This is consistent with HeLa cells, which show defects in G1 to S phase transition when treated with DON (data not shown). Similar to HeLa cells, PUGNAc treatment altered the expression of O-GlcNAcase and OGT (Fig. 3B). Elevated O-GlcNAc by PUGNAc treatment caused a decrease in the expression of OGT and an increase in O-GlcNAcase expression. The inverse was seen after DON treatment. OGT and O-GlcNAcase Control G2/M cell Cycle Progression—Next, we decided to modulate the levels of the O-GlcNAc-processing enzymes, O-GlcNAcase (removes O-GlcNAc), and O-GlcNAc transferase (adds O-GlcNAc) using adenoviral infection. Large increases in the expression of vO-GlcNAcase and vOGT are toxic to most cells. 3C. Slawson, N. E. Zachara, K. Vosseller, W. Cheung, M. D. Lane, and G. W. Hart, unpublished information. Therefore, a multiplicity of infection that only caused a slight increase or decrease in O-GlcNAc levels was used. Uninfected (data not shown) and GFP-infected cells exit G1/S and reach G2/M phase between 9 and 12 h, and by 15 h a large majority of the cells had returned to G1 phase (Fig. 4A). In the vO-GlcNAcase-infected cells, a significant defect in M phase progression was observed (Fig. 4A). At 15 h, when more than 65% of control cells had returned to G1 phase, 55% of vO-GlcNAcase-infected cells were still in M phase. This result was repeatedly seen in at least five independent experiments. Interestingly, a slight decrease in the length of S phase was observed in vO-GlcNAcase-infected cells, but the difference to GFP cells was not significant. Similar to vO-GlcNAcase, vOGT-overexpressing cells exhibit a prolonged M phase, but these cells also display severe aneuploidy (Fig. 4B). Upon release from the G1/S block, ∼20% of the cells showed signs of aneuploidy, and the aneuploid nature of the cells increased upwards of 30% as the cells progressed though S and M phase. Uninfected and GPF-expressing cells showed only a small population of aneuploid cells (<2%). Overexpression of O-GlcNAcase and O-GlcNAc Transferase Disrupt Mitotic Phosphorylation—Next, the effect of overexpressing OGT and O-GlcNAcase on O-glycosylation and mitotic phosphorylation was assessed. Overall levels of O-GlcNAc decrease in vO-GlcNAcase-infected cells ∼10–15% (Fig. 5A, left panel), whereas overexpressed vOGT causes a slight increase in O-GlcNAc levels (Fig. 5B, left panel) and a substantial increase on an unidentified 55 kDa protein appears. Proline-directed phosphorylation, as determined by MPM2 staining, is reduced, and maximal phosphorylation lags compared with GFP cells when vO-GlcNAcase is overexpressed (Fig. 5A, right panel). The red box in the right panel of Fig. 5A is a longer exposure showing the dramatic difference in proline-directed phosphorylation after vO-GlcNAcase treatment in the 45–75-kDa range. When vOGT is overexpressed, cells never reach maximal mitotic phosphorylation; however, a 70-kDa band appears phosphorylated throughout the time course and is not present in the uninfected and GFP lanes (Fig. 5B, right panel). At G1/S, vO-GlcNAcase- and vOGT-infected cells are in a higher percentage of M phase than GFP (Fig. 4, A and B, at time 0) as judged by flow cytometry; hence, the level of proline-directed phosphorylation is higher (Fig. 5, A, red panel, and B). Both mitotic kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and 2 were assayed for activity (Supplemental Fig. 2) from vO-GlcNAcase-infected cells, and no dramatic changes in the level of activity during the cell cycle is found, suggesting overexpression is not affecting in vitro cyclin-dependent kinase activity. The expression of the key G1/S phase regulator protein pRb is unaffected by viral infection (Fig. 6). This was not surprising since the levels of this prote"
https://openalex.org/W2040443947,"Members of the Rho family of small GTPases have been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Currently, most of the available information on the function of Rho proteins in malignant transformation is based on the use of dominant-negative mutants of these GTPases. The specificity of these dominant-negative mutants is limited however. In this study, we used small interfering RNA directed against either Rac1 or Rac3 to reduce their expression specifically. In line with observations using dominant-negative Rac1 in other cell types, we show that RNA interference-mediated depletion of Rac1 strongly inhibits lamellipodia formation, cell migration and invasion in SNB19 glioblastoma cells. Surprisingly however, Rac1 depletion has a much smaller inhibitory effect on SNB19 cell proliferation and survival. Interestingly, whereas depletion of Rac3 strongly inhibits SNB19 cell invasion, it does not affect lamellipodia formation and has only minor effects on cell migration and proliferation. Similar results were obtained in BT549 breast carcinoma cells. Thus, functional analysis of Rac1 and Rac3 using RNA interference reveals a critical role for these GTPases in the invasive behavior of glioma and breast carcinoma cells."

Cellular phenotypes of Werner syndrome and Bloom syndrome, including genomic instability and premature senescence, are consistent with telomere dysfunction. RecQ helicases are proposed to function in dissociating alternative DNA structures during recombination and/or replication at telomeric ends. Here we report that the telomeric single-strand DNA-binding protein, POT1, strongly stimulates WRN and BLM to unwind long telomeric forked duplexes and D-loop structures that are otherwise poor substrates for these helicases. This stimulation is dependent on the presence of telomeric sequence in the duplex regions of the substrates. In contrast, POT1 failed to stimulate a bacterial 3 ′–5′-helicase. We find that purified POT1 binds to WRN and BLM in vitro and that full-length POT1 (splice variant 1) precipitates a higher amount of endogenous WRN protein, compared with BLM, from the HeLa nuclear extract. We propose roles for the cooperation of POT1 with RecQ helicases WRN and BLM in resolving DNA structures at telomeric ends, in a manner that protects the telomeric 3 ′ tail as it is exposed during unwinding.

We propose roles for the cooperation of POT1 with RecQ helicases WRN and BLM in resolving DNA structures at telomeric ends, in a manner that protects the telomeric 3 ′ tail as it is exposed during unwinding. Deficiencies in human RecQ helicases, WRN, BLM, and RecQL4, are responsible for genomic instability disorders, namely Werner syndrome (WS) 4The abbreviations used are: WS, Werner syndrome; BS, Bloom syndrome; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ss, single strand; ds, double strand; TRF, telomere repeat binding factors; INV, invading strand; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RPA, replication protein A; OB, oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding; Tel, telomere; nt, nucleotide; NE, nuclear extracts; ALT, alternative pathway for lengthening of telomeres.4The abbreviations used are: WS, Werner syndrome; BS, Bloom syndrome; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ss, single strand; ds, double strand; TRF, telomere repeat binding factors; INV, invading strand; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RPA, replication protein A; OB, oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding; Tel, telomere; nt, nucleotide; NE, nuclear extracts; ALT, alternative pathway for lengthening of telomeres., Bloom syndrome (BS), and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively. WS patients display the early onset of many age-associated pathologies including graying and loss of hair, wrinkling of the skin, cataracts, type II diabetes, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and a high frequency of sarcomas (1Martin G.M.

BS patients exhibit severe growth retardation, immunodeficiency, sun-induced facial erythema, and a greatly increased predisposition to a wide range of cancers that develop early in life (3Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Cells derived from WS and BS patients display increased chromosomal rearrangements and deletions, defects in DNA replication and homologous recombination, and decreased replicative life spans (reviewed in Refs. 2Opresko P.L.

Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Cellular phenotypes of WS and BS include features consistent with telomere dysfunction. Cells deficient in BLM helicase display increased telomere associations between homologous chromosomes (4Lillard-Wetherell K. Machwe A. Langland G.T. Combs K.A. Behbehani G.K. Schonberg S.A.

Cells lacking WRN, or those that express a dominant-negative WRN mutant, exhibit increased telomere loss (5Bai Y. Murnane J.P. Hum.

Science. 2004; 306: 1951-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The forced expression of telomerase rescues both WS and BS primary fibroblasts from premature replicative senescence (7Wyllie F.S. Jones C.J. Skinner J.W. Haughton M.F. Wallis C. Wynford-Thomas D.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice singly null for Wrn appear normal; however, the late generation mice null for both Wrn and Terc have shortened telomeres and develop pathologies resembling human WS (9Chang S. Multani A.S. Cabrera N.G. Naylor M.L. Laud P. Lombard D. Pathak S. Guarente L. DePinho R.A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Mutations in Wrn and Blm in Terc null mice also enhance and accelerate the development of phenotypes associated with telomere dysfunction (10Du X. Shen J. Kugan N. Furth E.E. Lombard D.B. Cheung C. Pak S. Luo G. Pignolo R.J. DePinho R.A. Guarente L. Johnson F.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8437-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies indicate that the RecQ helicases WRN and BLM are important for proper telomere maintenance and function. Telomeres are protein-DNA complexes that protect the ends of linear chromosomes, and consequences of telomere dysfunction include chromosome end fusions and genomic instability, apoptosis, or senescence (reviewed in Ref. 11Campisi J. Kim S. Lim C.S. Rubio M. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1619-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Human telomeres consist of 5–15 kb of TTAGGG tandem repeats and terminate in a 3′ single strand (ss) G-rich tail that serves as the substrate for telomerase-mediated elongation in an open telomere state. In one proposed capped or closed state, this tail loops back and invades the telomeric duplex tract, forming an intra-telomeric D-loop and a large lasso-like t-loop structure (12Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. De Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). This t-loop is stabilized by a protein complex that includes telomere repeat binding factors (TRF) 1 and 2, which bind duplex (TTAGGG)n DNA and regulate telomere length and access of the 3′ tail to telomerase and/or nucleases (13Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B.

POT1 associates with TRF1 and TRF2 through the interaction with other telomeric proteins including TPP1 (formerly termed PIP1, PTOP, or TINT1) and TIN2 (reviewed in Refs. 21De Lange T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar and 22Colgin L. Reddel R. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R901-R902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Collectively, these proteins cooperate with telomeric DNA structure in proper telomere maintenance and capping. The precise roles of RecQ helicases in telomere maintenance are unclear; however, studies suggest they likely function in recombination and/or replication at telomeric ends. In budding and fission yeast, RecQ helicases function in an alternative pathway for lengthening of telomeres (ALT) that occurs via recombination in telomerase-negative cells (23Johnson F.B.

Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R1-R15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WRN and BLM have been found to associate with telomeres in human ALT cell lines (26Opresko P.L. Otterlei M. Graakjaer J. Bruheim P. Dawut L. Kolvraa S. May A. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and WRN was found at telomeres in S-phase human primary fibroblasts (6Crabbe L. Verdun R.E. Haggblom C.I. Karlseder J. Science. 2004; 306: 1951-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). WRN and BLM are 3′–5′ DNA helicases that are capable of dissociating telomeric D-loop structures (4Lillard-Wetherell K. Machwe A. Langland G.T. Combs K.A. Behbehani G.K. Schonberg S.A. German J. Turchi J.J. Orren D.K. Groden J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1919-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Opresko P.L. Otterlei M. Graakjaer J. Bruheim P. Dawut L. Kolvraa S. May A. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The WRN protein also contains a 3′–5′-exonuclease that cooperates with the helicase activity to release the invading tail of a telomeric D-loop (26Opresko P.L. Otterlei M. Graakjaer J. Bruheim P. Dawut L. Kolvraa S. May A. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition, these helicases unwind G-quadruplex DNA structures that form readily in telomeric sequences (27Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., J.R. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Therefore, the RecQ helicases are thought to participate in telomere maintenance by resolving complex structures at telomeric ends to facilitate DNA replication or recombination pathways. The WRN and BLM helicases are poorly processive and likely function with co-factor proteins in a complex at the telomeres. TRF2 protein physically binds to WRN and BLM and stimulates these helicases to unwind relatively short duplex substrates that are telomeric or nontelomeric (4Lillard-Wetherell K. Machwe A. Langland G.T. Combs K.A. Behbehani G.K. Schonberg S.A. German J. Turchi J.J. Orren D.K. Groden J. Hum. Mol.

However, these helicases require replication protein A (RPA) to completely unwind longer duplex substrates in vitro (29Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A.

POT1 resembles RPA in that it also interacts with ssDNA via oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) folds, but it differs in having high specificity for telomeric DNA sequences (15Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 19Lei M. Podell E.R. Cech T.R. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Nature. 2003; 426: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether POT1 could facilitate WRN and BLM unwinding of longer telomeric substrates. We tested two POT1 splice variants: the full-length version (v1) and a less abundant C-terminal truncated version (v2) (19Lei M. Podell E.R. Cech T.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Both POT1 variants stimulated the WRN and BLM helicases to unwind telomeric forked duplex and D-loop structures that were poor substrates for these helicases alone. In contrast to RPA, optimal stimulation was dependent on the presence of telomeric sequence in the duplex regions of the substrates. Furthermore, we observed that WRN and BLM physically interact with POT1. Proteins—Recombinant histidine-tagged wild type WRN protein and the exonuclease-dead WRN mutant (X-WRN, E84A) were purified using a baculovirus/insect cell expression system as described previously (26Opresko P.L.

Splice variant 1 is the full-length protein, and variant 2 comprises the N-terminal half, including the two OB folds responsible for DNA binding (19Lei M. Podell E.R. Cech T.R. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The purity of these protein preparations was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining as shown in Fig. 1A. Human RPA was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Kenny (Albert Einstein Cancer Center, New York). Bacterial UvrD helicase was a generous gift from Dr. Steve Mattson (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill).

The D-loop Tel DS substrate containing the (TTAGGG)4 sequence in the 33-bp duplex portion of the invading strand was constructed by annealing the BT, BB, and invading strand (INV) oligonucleotides as described previously (26Opresko P.L.

Variant D-loops were similarly constructed, and all D-loops contained a 5′-end radiolabeled INV strand. The D-loop Tel SS contained the (TTAGGG)4 sequence in the displaced single strand region of the D-loop instead and was constructed by annealing the BT, BBmx, and INVtel oligonucleotides.

DNA substrate and protein concentrations were as indicated in the figure legends. The reactions were initiated by the addition of WRN or BLM protein and were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. For the reactions containing WRN (total volume = 30 μl), a 10-μl aliquot was mixed with formamide stop dye and run on a 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The remainder of the reactions containing WRN (20 μl) or the reactions containing BLM helicase (20 μl) were added to 10 μl of 3× native stop dye supplemented with 75 μg/ml proteinase K and a 10× molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (28Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C.

The products were deproteinized for 30 min at 37 °C and were then run on 8 or 12% native polyacrylamide gels as indicated in the figure legends. Products were visualized using a PhosphorImager, and quantitation was performed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). For the reactions with WRN on the forked telomeric substrate, the percent of unreacted substrate and the percent of each major product band in the native gels (as defined by displaced oligonucleotide size, Fig. 2, A and E) were calculated as a fraction of the total radioactivity in the reaction lane. For the reactions with WRN and the various D-loop substrates, the percent of displaced near full-length products (longest) was calculated as a function of total displaced products in the lane (sum of the longest product band and the collective shorter product bands) in the native gels (Fig. 3A). For the reactions with BLM helicase or X-WRN, the percent of total product displacement was quantitated as a fraction of total radioactivity in the reaction lane as described previously (28Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C.

The blocking and binding steps were performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. Wells were coated with 75 ng of purified POT1v1 or POT1v2 diluted in carbonate buffer (50 μl) or with BSA as a background control by incubation for 2 h at 37°C. Independent wells were also coated with WRN, BLM, or APE1 as positive controls. After blocking, various concentrations of WRN, BLM, or APE1 (negative control) protein were added (50 μl) to the wells coated with POT1v1 or POT1v2 (see Fig. 5 legend) and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Following washes, primary antibody (1:1,500, anti-rabbit IgG against WRN (Novus); 1:1000, anti-rabbit IgG against BLM (Abcam); or 1:100 anti-rabbit IgG against APE1 (Trevigen)) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed, and secondary antibody (1:10,000, anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase; Vector Laboratories) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washes, bound WRN, BLM, or APE1 was detected with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride followed by termination with 3 m H2SO4. Absorbance was read at 490 nm. Values were normalized to the positive control (signal from wells coated with WRN, BLM, or APE1). To ensure that the interaction was not mediated by DNA, control reactions included either 5 μg/ml DNase I (Calbiochem) or 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide during the binding step. To determine the dissociation constant (Kd) for the WRN-POT1v2 and BLM-POT1v2 complexes, the fraction of immobilized POT1v2 bound by WRN or BLM was calculated, and the data were analyzed by Hill plot and Scatchard binding theory, as described previously (30Brosh Jr., R.M.

Membranes were probed with a mouse monoclonal anti-WRN antibody (1:500, BD Transduction Laboratories) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-BLM antibody (1:1,000, Abcam). POT1 Stimulation of the WRN Helicase Activity—To determine whether POT1 could promote WRN helicase unwinding, we first tested full-length POT1 (splice variant 1). Coomassie-stained gels of the purified proteins used for this study, and the subsequent experiments described in this paper, are shown in Fig. 1A as described previously (19Lei M. Podell E.R. Cech T.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 28Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C. Laine J.P. Harrigan J. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41110-41119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). For the helicase substrate we used a 34-bp forked duplex structure that contained 15-mer ssDNA tails at one end (Fig. 1B). Both the WRN helicase and exonuclease are active on this substrate (31Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first tested an exonuclease-dead WRN mutant (X-WRN) to measure directly the effects on the WRN unwinding activity. X-WRN contains a point mutation (E84A) that inactivates the exonuclease activity (39Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The duplex region of the telomeric fork consists of the (TTAGGG)4 sequence followed by 10 bp of unique sequence, whereas the telomeric sequence is scrambled in the mixed fork (Fig. 1B). Minimal displacement of either the telomeric forked duplex (Fig. 1B, lane 2) or the mixed forked duplex (lane 9) was achieved by X-WRN alone. However, the incubation of X-WRN with increasing concentrations of full-length POT1v1 resulted in up to a 10-fold increase in displacement of the telomeric fork, from 3 to 35% (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–5, and C). However, POT1v1 did not simulate X-WRN to unwind the mixed forked duplex (Fig. 1B, lanes 10–12), in contrast to RPA (lane 21). Time course analyses indicated that an 8-fold molar excess of POT1v1 increased the estimated rate of X-WRN strand displacement dramatically by 10-fold, from 0.01 bp/min/X-WRN (monomer) to 0.1 bp/min/X-WRN (monomer), of the telomeric fork (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that POT1v1 directly stimulates the WRN helicase to unwind the 34-bp telomeric substrate. Next we examined the activity of wild type WRN in the presence of full-length POT1v1. On the 34-bp forked duplex, the WRN helicase initiates unwinding at the forked end, whereas the 3′–5′-exonuclease initiates digestion at the blunt end (31Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7C). Therefore, the reactions were run both on a native gel to visualize the unwound products (Fig. 2A) and on a denaturing gel (Fig. 2B) to better visualize the exonuclease products. As reported earlier (31Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bo"
https://openalex.org/W1981433429,"Viral infections and local production of cytokines probably contribute to the pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes. The viral replicative intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA, tested in the form of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, PIC), in combination with the cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ), triggers β-cell apoptosis. We have previously observed by microarray analysis that PIC induces expression of several mRNAs encoding for genes downstream of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway. In this report, we show that exposure of β-cells to dsRNA in combination with IFN-α, -β, or -γ significantly increases apoptosis. Moreover, dsRNA induces TLR3 mRNA expression and activates NF-κB and the IFN-β promoter in a TRIF-dependent manner. dsRNA also induces an early (1 h) and sustained increase in IFN-β mRNA expression, and blocking IFN-β with a specific antibody partially prevents PIC plus IFN-γ-induced β-cell death. On the other hand, dsRNA plus IFN-γ does not induce apoptosis in INS-1E cells, and expression of TLR3 and type I IFNs mRNAs is not detected in these cells. Of note, disruption of the STAT-1 signaling pathway protects β-cells against dsRNA plus IFN-γ-induced β-cell apoptosis. This study suggests that dsRNA plus IFN-γ triggers β-cell apoptosis by two complementary pathways, namely TLR3-TRIF-NF-κB and STAT-1.

Blackwell Science, Oxford1997: 15.1-15.23Google Scholar). Although a genetic susceptibility is important for disease development, environmental factors such as viruses may also contribute for the initiation and/or progression of T1DM (3Hyöty H. Taylor K.W. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 4Yoon J.W. Textbook of Diabetes. 2nd. Blackwell Science, Oxford1997: 14.1-14.14Google Scholar). In line with this hypothesis, cross-sectional and prospective studies indicate that virus infections are involved in the pathogenesis of T1DM (3Hyöty H. Taylor K.W. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 5Lonnrot M. Korpela K. Knip M. Ilonen J. Simell O. Korhonen S. Savola K. Muona P. Simell T. Koskela P. Hyoty H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and about a dozen viruses have already been reported to be associated with human and animal T1DM (6Haverkos H.W. Battula N. Drotman D.P. Rennert O.M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2003; 57: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed for the deleterious action of viruses on pancreatic β-cells. Thus, viruses may directly infect and destroy pancreatic β-cells or they may trigger (or contribute to) β-cell-specific autoimmunity with or without direct β-cell infection; viruses may also alter some mechanisms of peripheral tolerance (7Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 65-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 8Ylipaasto P. Klingel K. Lindberg A.M. Otonkoski T. Kandolf R. Hovi T. Roivainen M.

For example, mouse infection with a high titer of the D variant of the encephalomyocarditis virus causes β-cell destruction and diabetes as a result of viral replication within β-cells, whereas mouse infection with a low titer of encephalomyocarditis D virus leads to diabetes as a chronic process, induced by the destruction of β-cells by macrophage-produced soluble mediators such as IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α/β, and NO (10Jun H.S. Yoon J.W. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). During viral infection, the pancreatic β-cells themselves initiate antiviral responses but, in this process, may stimulate host immune-mediated and islet-directed damage (11Liu D. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Liu D. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in β-cell damage by viruses, alone or in combination with soluble mediators, remain to be elucidated. During viral infection, the viral replicative intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) accumulates in the infected cell and stimulates antiviral activities (13Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 14Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). These antiviral responses can be mimicked by the synthetic dsRNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PIC) (15Sobel D.O. Ewel C.H. Zeligs B. Abbassi V. Rossio J. Bellanti J.A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In vivo, PIC triggers the development of hyperglycemia in diabetes-resistant BioBreeding rats and accelerates the development of the disease in diabetes-prone BioBreeding rats (17Ewel C.H. Sobel D.O. Zeligs B.J. Bellanti J.A. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1016-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sobel D.O. Newsome J. Ewel C.H. Bellanti J.A. Abbassi V. Creswell K. Blair O. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In vitro, PIC inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin biosynthesis in mouse islets (19Rhodes C.J. Taylor K.W. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and, when used in combination with IFN-γ, decreases rat islet cell function and viability (11Liu D. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12531-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have recently characterized by microarray analysis the global pattern of genes induced by PIC, alone or in combination with IFN-γ, in FACS-purified rat β-cells (21Rasschaert J. Liu D. Kutlu B. Cardozo A.K. Kruhoffer M. Orntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1641-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrated that PIC regulates the expression of several genes that participate in the induction of islet inflammation and β-cell death, such as pro-apoptotic transcription factors and diverse chemokines and cytokines (21Rasschaert J. Liu D. Kutlu B. Cardozo A.K. Kruhoffer M. Orntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1641-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We noticed that several of the PIC-affected genes, such as RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), IP-10, MCP-1 and IRF-7, were shown in other cell types to be downstream of the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway (22Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4745) Google Scholar). Exposure to PIC or to IFN-γ also induced the expression of the transcription factor STAT-1 and of several target genes of STAT-1, such as IRF-1, IRF-7, Mx1, Mx3, and 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (21Rasschaert J. Liu D. Kutlu B. Cardozo A.K. Kruhoffer M. Orntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1641-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) belong to a superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors and is essential for the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Eleven members of the TLR family have already been identified in mammals; each TLR acts as a primary sensor of conserved microbial components, driving the induction of specific biological responses (22Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4745) Google Scholar, 23Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Activation of TLRs by their specific ligands leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines and triggers expression of interferon-inducible genes through the JAK-STAT pathway (24Doyle S.E. Vaidya S.A. O'Connell R. Dadgostar H. Dempsey P. Wu T. Rao G. Sun R. Haberland M. Modlin R. Cheng G. Immunity. 2002; 17: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 25Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6687) Google Scholar). Mammalian TLR3 is specifically involved in the cellular recognition of dsRNA (26Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4925) Google Scholar). Most TLRs share signaling components with the IL-1 receptor, including IL-1 receptor-associated kinase, the cytoplasmic adaptor molecule MyD88, and TRAF6, but TLR3 signals through a MyD88-independent pathway involving the newly described adaptor molecule TRIF (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-β (27Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar, 28Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar)). In other cell types, stimulation of TLR3 by dsRNA leads to a TRIF-mediated activation of the transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-κB, resulting in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (26Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4925) Google Scholar, 29Matsumoto M. Funami K. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Microbiol.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 3565-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Additionally, a dsRNA-induced pathway involving c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation has been recently described (31Matsumoto S. Miyagishi M. Akashi H. Nagai R. Taira K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25687-25696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression of TLRs 2, 3, and 4 has been recently shown in mouse and human pancreatic islets (32Vives-Pi M. Somoza N. Fernandez-Alvarez J. Vargas F. Caro P. Alba A. Gomis R. Labeta M.O. Pujol-Borrell R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2003; 133: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33Wen L. Peng J. Li Z. Wong F.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3173-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TLR4, the lipopolysaccharide receptor, seems to be involved in Coxsackievirus B4-induced cytokine production by pancreatic cells (34Triantafilou K. Triantafilou M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11313-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), whereas TLR3 plays a role in dsRNA-induced diabetes in transgenic mice expressing the B7.1 co-stimulatory molecule under the control of the rat insulin promoter (33Wen L. Peng J. Li Z. Wong F.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3173-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Against this background, the present study was carried out to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in dsRNA plus IFN-γ-induced β-cell dysfunction and death and to examine whether these deleterious effects are mediated via TLR3, STAT-1, and JNK stimulation. For this purpose, experiments were conducted in parallel in FACS-purified primary β-cells and in INS-1E cells, an insulin-producing cell line previously shown to be resistant to the deleterious effects of dsRNA plus PIC (12Liu D. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Animals—Adults male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Brussels, Belgium), C57BL/6 mice (Harlan CBP, Zeist, The Netherlands), and STAT-1 knock-out (STAT-1-/-) mice (35Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) were housed and utilized according to the guidelines of the Belgian Regulations for Animal Care. STAT-1-/- mice were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. All experiments were conducted with the approval of the Animal Ethics Committees of the Université Libre de Bruxelles and of the Katholieke Universiteit van Leuven. Islet Cell Isolation and Culture—Pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion followed by hand picking under a stereomicroscope. They were subsequently dissociated into single cells, and β-cells were purified by autofluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS, FAC-Star, BD Biosciences, Sunnyvale, CA) as previously described (36Pipeleers D.G. In't Veld P.A. Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: (a) pancreatic islets were dissociated into single cells by mechanical dispersion followed by enzymatic dissociation in the presence of dispase (5 mg/ml); (b) after Percoll filtration, dissociated cells were suspended in HEPES-buffered Earles's medium containing 2.8 mm glucose (5 × 105 cells/ml) and incubated for 15 min at 10 °C; (c) the freshly dissociated cells were then immediately submitted to autofluorescence-activated cell sorting using an argon laser illuminating the cells at 488 nm. Light emission at 560–610 nm was taken as sorting criteria; (d) purified β-cells were then cultured in Ham's F-10 medium (Cambrex Bio Science, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 50 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml penicillin (37Ling Z. Hannaert J.C. Pipeleers D. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). During the first 18 h of culture, 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum was added to the culture medium. The insulin-producing INS-1E cells (passages 61–72), a kind gift from Prof. C. Wolheim (Centre Medical Universitaire, Geneva, Switzerland), were cultured in RPMI 1640 (containing Glutamax-1) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml penicillin (38Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). For determination of viability (see below), FACS-purified single β-cells (104 cells per well) or INS-1E cells (6 × 103 cells per well) were cultured for 2 or 6 days in Falcon 96-well microtiter plates (BD Biosciences, New Jersey, NJ) containing 200 μl of medium; for β-cell culture, the plates were pre-coated with poly-l-lysine. Culture medium was changed every 2 days, and recombinant rat IFN-γ (100 units/ml, R&D Systems, Oxon, UK) or PIC (100 μg/ml, Sigma) was added. When required, TAT and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (JNKI) peptides, kindly provided by Prof. C. Bonny (Université de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) were added at a concentration of 1 μm each 1 h before the addition of PIC and IFN-γ. JNKI is a bioactive peptide linked to a TAT-carrier peptide that blocks activation (i.e. phosphorylation of the activation domains) of c-Jun by JNK (39Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that the JNKI, at the concentrations presently utilized, efficiently transfects insulin-secreting cells and protects against IL-1β-induced apoptosis (39Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar); kinase assays indicated that the inhibitor blocks activation of the transcription factor c-Jun by JNK (39Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In some experiments, an antibody raised against rat IFN-β (20 μg/ml, R&D Systems) was added 30 min before PIC plus IFN-γ treatment. For RNA extraction for RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR analysis (see below), single β-cells (105 cells per 2.5 ml) were re-aggregated for 3 h in a rotary shaking incubator (40Ling Z. Chen M.-C. Smismans A. Pavlovic D. Schuit F. Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1540-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), cultured for 14–16 h in suspension, and then exposed for 1, 2, 6, or 24 h to IFN-γ (100 units/ml) or PIC (100 μg/ml). In some experiments, recombinant human IL-1β (10 or 50 units/ml, a kind gift of Dr. C. W. Reynolds from NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was utilized as positive control. The concentrations of cytokines and PIC, and experimental time points, were selected based on our previous studies in β-cells (11Liu D. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Liu D. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and aimed to analyze β-cells at time points that precede nonspecific changes in mRNA expression induced by early apoptosis. Assessment of Cell Viability—The percentage of viable, apoptotic, and necrotic cells was determined after 2 or 6 days of exposure to IFN-γ and/or PIC (11Liu D. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Liu D. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, purified β-cells or INS-1E cells were incubated for 15 min with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) and Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml) (41Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Kloppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This fluorescence assay for single cells is quantitative and has been validated by systematic comparisons with electron microscopy observations (41Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Kloppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 42Ling Z. Van de Casteele M. Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2610-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) β-cells. Viability was evaluated by at least two independent observers, with one of them unaware of sample identity. The agreement between findings obtained by the two observers was always >90%. RT-PCR and Real-time RT-PCR—Poly(A) plus RNA was isolated from β-cells and INS-1E cells using oligo(dT)25-coated polystyrene Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo), and reverse transcribed as previously described (46Cardozo A.K. Kruhoffer M. Leeman R. Orntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the number of cycles was selected to allow linear amplification of the cDNA under study, and the GAPDH housekeeping gene was used as control. The primer sequences used for amplification of rat cDNAs and their respective PCR fragment lengths were as follows: GAPDH (F, 5′-TCCCTCAAGATTGTCAGCAAA-3′; R, 5′-AATGTATCCGTTGTGGATCT-3′; 308 bp); TLR3 (F, 5′-TAGATGCACAGGGTGAGCAG-3′; R, 5′-AGGCGTTTATCCGTTCCTTT-3′; 426 bp); IFN-α (F, 5′-TCTTCACACTCCTGGCACAA-3′; R, 5′-CAGGGCTCTCCAGACTTCTG-3′; 414 bp); and IFN-β (F, 5′-CACTGGGTGGAATGAGACT-3′;R,5′-AAGACTTCTGCTCGGA-3′, 222 bp). The identity of the PCR fragments of each gene was confirmed by size after electrophoretic migration on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels photographed under UV-transillumination using a Digital Science DC120 camera (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). The abundances of the PCR products on the image were quantified by BioMax one-dimensional image analysis software (Kodak) and expressed in pixel intensities (optical density). The target cDNAs present in each sample were corrected for the respective GAPDH values. Expression of the “housekeeping” gene GAPDH is not affected by exposure to IFN-γ or PIC (11Liu D. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Liu D. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a finding confirmed in the present experiments (data not shown). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green fluorescence on a LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), using the standard curve method (47Kharroubi I. Rasschaert J. Eizirik D.L. Cnop M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 48Cardozo A.K. Proost P. Gysemans C. Chen M.-C. Mathieu C. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The primer sequences and their respective PCR fragment lengths were as follows: IFN-α (F, 5′-TCTTCACACTCCTGGCACAA-3′;R,5′-AGCAGATCCAGAAGGCTCAA-3′, 116 bp); IFN-β (F, 5′-GCCTTTGCCATTCAAG-3′; R, 5′-AGACAGAGCTTCTGGA-3′, 131 bp); and GAPDH (F, 5′-AGTTCAACGGCACAGTCAAG-3′; R, 5′-TACTCAGCACCAGCATCACC-3′, 118 bp). The method used for quantification is the standard curve approach (42Ling Z. Van de Casteele M. Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To obtain the standard curve, the primer sequences and their respective PCR fragment lengths were as follows: IFN-α (F, 5′-GGTGGTGGTGAGCTACTGGT-3′; R, 5′-CAGAAGTCTGGAGAGCCCTG-3′, 525 bp); IFN-β (F, 5′-CTGCCCTCTCCATCGACTAC-3′; R, 5′-TCCGAGCAGAAGTCTT-3′, 453 bp); and GAPDH (see above). Promoter Studies—Purified β-cells or INS-1E cells were transfected using Lipofectamine with a plasmid construct containing the firefly luciferase gene under the control of either multiple copies of the NF-κB consensus sequence (BD Biosciences Clontech), or four copies of the STAT consensus sequence (a plasmid kindly provided by Prof. A. Stephanou, University College, London, UK (49Besser D. Bromberg J.F. Darnell J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)) or the mouse IFN-β promoter (27Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). In some experiments cells were co-transfected with one of the plasmids described above and an expression plasmid encoding for a dominant negative form of human TRIF (27Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar) or its empty vector, CMV-Myc (27Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). Of note, co-transfection with the DNhTRIF construct reduced the activity of the internal control pRL-CMV, which then represented 72 ± 10% (n = 11) of the activity measured in β-cells transfected with the DNhTRIF empty vector. Transfected cells were exposed to IFN-γ (100 units/ml) and/or PIC (100 μg/ml) for 18 h. Luciferase activities were assayed with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described (12Liu D. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rasschaert J. Liu D. Kutlu B. Cardozo A.K. Kruhoffer M. Orntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1641-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Test values were corrected for the luciferase activity value of the internal control plasmid, pRL-CMV. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical differences between groups were determined either by paired Student's t test or by ANOVA followed by t test with the Bonferroni correction, as indicated. A p value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Effects of dsRNA and IFN-γ on β-Cell Viability—FACS-purified primary β-cells exposed to PIC plus IFN-γ for 6 days had a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells when compared against control cells (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained after 2 days treatment; thus, there were 17.2 ± 0.9% apoptotic cells following PIC plus IFN-γ treatment, whereas control cells had only 3.4 ± 0.4% apoptosis (n = 4, p < 0.001, ANOVA). Exposure to PIC or IFN-γ alone for 2 or 6 days did not affect β-cell viability indicating the need for a synergistic action of PIC plus IFN-γ to trigger β-cell death (Fig. 1A). There was no significant increase in the percentage of necrotic cells in any of the experimental conditions tested (Fig. 1A). When INS-1E cells, an insulin-producing cell line, were exposed to PIC plus IFN-γ for 6 days, the percentage of apoptotic cells was similar to that obtained in INS-1E cells treated with IFN-γ alone (Fig. 1B), suggesting that PIC does not potentiate the deleterious effect of IFN-γ on INS-1E cells viability. Of note, when combined to the cytokine IL-1β, IFN-γ significantly increases apoptosis in both INS-1E cells and primary β-cells (data not shown (11Liu D. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Liu D. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Altogether, these results indicate that dsRNA, in association with IFN-γ, potentiates apoptosis in primary β-cells but not in the clonal INS-1E cells. dsRNA and IFN-γ Induce Toll-like Receptor 3 and Type I Interferons mRNA Expression—To examine expression of both TLR3 mRNA and of genes downstream of the TLR3 signaling pathway (namely IFN-α and IFN-β), primary β-cells or INS-1E cells were cultured for 2, 6, and 24 h in the presence or absence of PIC and/or IFN-γ. In primary β-cells, exposure to PIC led to an early increase in IFN-β mRNA expression, which was already significant after a 2-h treatment, reached highest levels after 6 h, and then returned to basal levels after 24 h (Fig. 2A).

However, the highly charged nature and pattern of charges in the proximal 36 residues appear incompatible with coiled-coil formation. Circular dichroism, NMR, and analytical ultracentrifugation show that a synthesized peptide containing this region forms a stable single α-helix (SAH) domain in solution and does not dimerize to form a coiled coil even at millimolar concentrations. Additionally, electron microscopy of a recombinant myosin 10 containing the motor, the three calmodulin binding domains, and the full-length predicted coiled coil showed that it was mostly monomeric at physiological protein concentration. In dimers the molecules were joined only at their extreme distal ends, and no coiled-coil tail was visible. Furthermore, the neck lengths of both monomers and dimers were much longer than expected from the number of calmodulin binding domains. In contrast, micrographs of myosin 5 heavy meromyosin obtained under the same conditions clearly showed a coiled-coil tail, and the necks were the predicted length. Thus the predicted coiled coil of myosin 10 forms a novel elongated structure in which the proximal region is a SAH domain and the distal region is a SAH domain (or has an unknown extended structure) that dimerizes only at its end. Sequence comparisons show that similar structures may exist in the predicted coiled-coil domains of myosins 6 and 7a and MyoM and could function to increase the size of the working stroke.

Sequence comparisons show that similar structures may exist in the predicted coiled-coil domains of myosins 6 and 7a and MyoM and could function to increase the size of the working stroke. Myosins make up a diverse superfamily of motor proteins (1Hodge T. Cope M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3353-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human genome alone contains about 40 myosin genes (2Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Of these, about one-third are “conventional” myosins (i.e. the well studied myosin 2), and the rest fall into about 10 different classes. The structure, properties and functions of the majority of myosin classes are poorly characterized and have largely been inferred from sequence comparisons rather than direct experiments on purified proteins (1Hodge T. Cope M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3353-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 3Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Muscle myosin 2 dimerizes through its α-helical coiled-coil tail. Therefore, it is commonly assumed that any myosin will also be dimeric if it contains a region predicted to be coiled coil. This assumption is dependent on the accuracy of coiled-coil prediction programs, such as COILS (4Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar), PAIRCOIL, or MULTICOIL (5Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), which are also used by protein-fold prediction sites on the Web such as SMART (6Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S. Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D142-D144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although myosin 10 contains a region of predicted coiled coil (Fig. 1A), and is predicted to dimerize, this has not been determined experimentally. We noticed that part of the predicted coiled-coil domain of myosin 10 is highly enriched in charged residues (Fig. 1B). The proximal region consisting of 36 residues is particularly enriched in both positively and negatively charged residues, including the a and d positions of the heptad repeat (a-g) that are canonically hydrophobic residues in coiled coils (Fig. 1B). We suspected that this highly charged sequence is unlikely to form a coiled coil (7Offer G. Sessions R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 967-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that this part of myosin 10 may not be able to dimerize. To determine the properties of the predicted coiled-coil domain of myosin 10, we studied a purified synthetic peptide containing the proximal highly charged region to determine its structure in solution. We then went on to determine the structure of the full-length predicted coiled coil of myosin 10 by electron microscopy, using a recombinant expressed myosin 10 containing the motor, calmodulin binding domains, and full-length predicted coiled coil. Peptide Purification—The peptide YRQLLAEKRELEEKKRREEEKKREEEERERERAQREC, which corresponds to residues 808-843 of murine myosin 10 with an additional C-terminal Cys, calculated mass 4,876.5 Da, was made commercially (Pepceuticals) and further purified using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (University of Leeds). Major peaks that were likely to contain the peptide were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry to identify the correct peak. Fractions containing the purified peptide in 30% acetonitrile/70% H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were combined and freeze dried. Circular Dichroism—Spectra were recorded using a Jasco J715 from 260 to 190 nm at 10 °C in a 1-mm cuvette at 46 μm peptide (0.2 mg/ml) in 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Spectra were also recorded from a solution of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin subfragment 2 (S2) 2The abbreviations used are: S2, subfragment 2; SAH, single α-helix; HMM, heavy meromyosin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. at the same mass concentration and in the same buffer. To determine the effect of temperature on helical content, we took measurements at a wavelength of 222 nm during a series of temperature steps to 80 °C for the peptide and S2, after which the temperature was returned to 10 °C to observe refolding. The peptide was allowed to equilibrate at each temperature until the average ellipticity measurement from a 1-min scan remained constant between observations. To determine the effect of peptide concentration, we compared data from solutions containing 225 or 22.5 μm peptide dissolved in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, at 10, 25, 50, and 70 °C. The effect of salt concentration on helical content was determined from the value at 25 °C of the ellipticity measurement at a wavelength of 222 nm for the peptide in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and a range of NaCl concentrations from 0 to 4.5 m. Spectra were analyzed using the CDSSTR program, available on DICHROWEB (8Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), and reference set 4 in order to calculate the mean residue ellipticity in degrees cm2 dmol-1 and therefore calculate the fraction of α-helix. The fittings to the data were good, with normalized root mean square deviations of 0.033-0.037 for the peptide at 10 °C. The actual concentration of the peptide used was determined spectrophotometrically at the end of the experiments using an absorption coefficient of 1,690 m-1 cm-1 at 275 nm arising from the N-terminal Tyr and correcting for light scatter using data between 310 and 400 nm. The ellipticity value at 222 nm for myosin 10 peptide in 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium phosphate at 10 °C was -26,300° cm2 dmol-1. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Equilibrium runs were performed using 12-mm path length cells in a Beckman Optima XL I at 60,000 rpm, 10 °C for 72 h. The peptide was dissolved in 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Data were gathered by radial scanning at 275 nm (the absorption peak of the peptide). WinMatch was used to determine that the solution column had reached equilibrium. Nominal loading concentrations covered 0.1 to 1 mg/ml. A value for the partial specific volume of 0.719 cc/g was computed from the amino acid composition using the method of Perkins (9Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Fitting was performed using the equilibrium fitter now part of SedAnal (10Stafford W.F. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and error bars were obtained using bootstrap with replacement. Proton NMR—The sample contained 1 mm peptide in 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Data were recorded at 10 °C on 500- and 750-MHz Varian Inova NMR spectrometers equipped with a z-axis gradient triple resonance probe. A 500-MHz 90-ms Watergate TOCSY and 200-ms Watergate NOESY experiment was recorded with 1024 × 256 complex points, spectral windows of 5006.3 Hz, and 64 transients/increment. A 750-MHz 150-ms Watergate NOESY was recorded with 2,048 × 512 complex points, spectral windows of 8,000 Hz, and 48 transients/increment. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe using 30° shifted cosine window functions in both dimensions and analyzed in NMRView. Chemical shifts were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid. Deviations from random coil chemical shifts were calculated with corrections for the sequence (11Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J. Foss T.R. Chung J. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2970-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 12Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Protein Preparations—Myosin 10 “HMM” was expressed using the baculovirus system. Bovine smooth muscle myosin 10 cDNA clones were a gift from Dr. David Corey (Harvard Medical School). Sequences encoding the first 953 amino acids including the motor domain, the three IQ motifs, and all of the predicted coiled-coil-forming residues (120 residues; the predicted coiled-coil domain ends at amino acid 934) were ligated into pVL1932 (Invitrogen) between the BglII and the XbaI sites. A FLAG epitope was engineered before the stop codon to facilitate purification. Mouse myosin 5a HMM heavy chain (ID NM_010864; residues 1-1090 plus FLAG sequence), and a mutant lacking IQ motifs 3 and 4 (called M5-4IQ) were expressed together with calmodulin and purified as described by Sakamoto et al. (13Sakamoto T. Wang F. Schmitz S. Xu Y. Xu Q. Molloy J.E. Veigel C. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29201-29207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—For metal shadowing, proteins at about 0.1 mg/ml in 0.5 m NaCl were diluted 1× with glycerol as described previously (14Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer J.A. II I Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), sprayed onto mica, dried under vacuum at room temperature, and rotary-shadowed with platinum. Fields of molecules were recorded on film at ×20,000 magnification and scanned into computer at a specimen resolution of 1 nm/pixel. For negative staining, myosin 10 HMM was diluted to 56 nm protein with 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, at 20 °C, applied to UV-treated carbon-coated grids, and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate as described previously (15Burgess S.A. Walker M.L. Thirumurugan K. Trinick J. Knight P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Micrographs were recorded at ×40,000 on a JEOL 1200ex microscope at moderate dose (∼100 e/Å2) and digitized at a step size corresponding to 0.5 nm/pixel. The head length was measured as the linear distance from one end of the molecule to the other for monomers or up to the junction point of the two heads for dimers. Model Building—The highly charged region of the predicted coiled coil of myosin 10 (37-amino acid peptide) was modeled as an α-helix with energy minimization of side chain conformation in vacuo using a Swiss-Pdb Viewer. This model was then combined with a model structure of a 32-residue IQ motif plus calmodulin (16Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Using the Swiss-Pdb Viewer, we superimposed the backbone atoms of the first 12 N-terminal residues of the myosin peptide on those of the homologous residues of the IQ motif. The peptide was then ligated to the IQ motif after removing overlapping residues. We suspected that the proximal 36 residues of the predicted coiled coil of myosin 10 formed a single α-helix (a SAH domain). Displaying these residues as an α-helical net shows a large number of potential intrahelical ionic interactions that would stabilize formation of a single α-helix (Fig. 1C). An atomic α-helical model of this sequence (Fig. 1D) further demonstrates that the alternately positive and negative charged side chains found in this sequence in successive turns of the helix line up to form three left-handed helices by alternate (i, i+3) and (i, i+4) interactions (Fig. 1, C (solid lines) and D). SAH domains are rare but have been described for a small number of proteins including smooth muscle caldesmon (17Wang E. Wang C.-L. A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and the ribosomal protein L9 (18Kuhlman B. Yang H. Bolce J. Fairman R. Raleigh D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The heptad repeat in the predicted SAH domain in myosin 10 has the novel general form ((R/K)XXXEXX)n. The interaction between the distributed positive charge of the guanidinium group of Arg and the distributed negative charge of the carboxylic group of Glu are particularly favorable for helix stabilization (Fig. 1D, space-filled). The Highly Charged Sequence Forms a Very Stable SAH Domain in Solution—To test these ideas, a peptide was synthesized consisting of the first 36 residues of the predicted coiled coil of myosin 10. Its ability to form a SAH domain in solution was measured by a combination of three different techniques. First, UV circular dichroism (Fig. 2A) showed that that this peptide is largely α-helical, as shown by the strong double minima at 208 and 222 nm, and a stronger maximum at 191-193 nm. Fitting of the spectrum using CDSSTR (DICHROWEB (8Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar)) showed that the peptide is ∼75% α-helical at 10 °C, the remainder being assigned between β-strands and unstructured conformations. These values did not change as the peptide concentration varied between 22.5 and 225 μm, indicating that the peptide is monomeric (19Lyu P.C. Gans P.J. Kallenbach N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). We also found that the thermal and salt stability of this peptide is similar to that described for other single stable α-helices (17Wang E. Wang C.-L. A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Kuhlman B. Yang H. Bolce J. Fairman R. Raleigh D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Lyu P.C. Gans P.J. Kallenbach N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Heating to 80 °C reduced the helical content in a non-cooperative manner (Fig. 2B), and this effect was completely reversed on cooling to 10 °C (Fig. 2A). This temperature dependence was markedly different from the cooperative melting of the monomeric S2 region of the coiled-coil tail of muscle myosin 2 (Fig. 2B). The helical content of the peptide falls progressively with increasing salt concentration (Fig. 2C). This is thought to be due to competition from ions in solution with the intrahelical ionic bonds that stabilize single α-helices. The helical nature of the myosin 10 peptide is even more resistant to salt than the single α-helix formed by the E4K4 peptide (amino acid sequence, YSEEEEKKKKEEEEKKKK) under similar conditions (19Lyu P.C. Gans P.J. Kallenbach N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), indicating that the intrahelical ionic bonds are unusually strong. Second, proton NMR confirmed that the peptide is highly helical and that only the first few N-terminal residues are non-helical. The data show that the N-terminal 6 residues are random coil or extended, and the remainder of the peptide, beginning at around residue 7, forms α-helix. From an analysis of the 750-MHz NOESY spectrum (proton NMR) assignments could be obtained for the N-terminal residues 3-7 and the C-terminal residues 30-37 (Fig. 3, A and B). The N-terminal residues show weak amide-amide and strong NH-Hα(i-1) nuclear Overhauser effects consistent with a more extended or random coil structure (21Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986: 162-175Google Scholar). The C-terminal residues show strong amide-amide and weak NH-Hα(i-1) nuclear Overhauser effects, which is consistent with an α-helical structure. This is in good agreement with the chemical shift deviations from random coil values (Fig. 3, C and D) that show significant upfield shifts for both the NH and Hα protons in the C-terminal region. The intermediate residues are difficult to assign because of the repetitive pattern of the residues Arg, Lys, and Glu in this region. However, the resonance positions for the middle region of the peptide, although heavily overlapped in the spectra, are also consistently shifted upfield from the random coil chemical shifts, indicating that the Lys-Arg-Glu-rich sequence is most likely α-helical throughout. Third, equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed that the peptide is monomeric (Fig. 4). The data show that the peptide is mono-disperse with a molecular mass of 4,850 ± 20 (S.E.) Da, which agrees closely with the sequence molecular mass of 4,876 Da. These experiments were performed under the same solution conditions as the circular dichroism and NMR. Fitting with SedAnal gave a good fit to the data over a wide range of concentration (Fig. 4). Attempts to fit the data using any fixed ratio of monomer and dimer or a monomer-dimer equilibrium showed there was no detectable dimer over the range of loading concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/ml with an upper limit of 3.4 mg/ml (0.7 mm) in the solution column at equilibrium. Taken together, these data show that the highly charged region of myosin 10 is stable SAH domain as we predicted. The highly helical nature of this peptide suggests that it is unlikely to have failed to dimerize because it was too short. Short sections of coiled coil that do not dimerize also fail to form an α-helix (22Litowski J.R. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 58: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas peptides that have an optimum sequence for formation of coiled coil only need to be 2 heptads long to dimerize (23Burkhard P. Ivaninskii S. Lustig A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Other peptides that are only 4 heptads long and rich in either Lys or Glu residues form stable heterodimers when mixed but random coil monomers when kept separate (22Litowski J.R. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 58: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Entire Predicted Coiled Coil Is Extended and Only Weakly Dimeric—The next question was whether this region of myosin 10 formed a SAH domain in the intact myosin rather than dimerizing to form a coiled coil. We suspected that the SAH domain would not dimerize via coiled-coil formation, as the SAH domain sequence (Fig. 1B) does not have any hydrophobic residues in the a and d positions that would favor dimerization (24Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Aebi U. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, it was possible that in the intact molecule this region could be induced to dimerize through charged interactions following dimerization by the rest of the predicted coiled coil, by analogy with the GCN4 zipper-induced dimerization of a similarly charged region in myosin 6 (25Rock R.S. Ramamurthy B. Dunn A.R. Beccafico S. Rami B.R. Morris C. Spink B.J. Franzini-Armstrong C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To address this question, we used electron microscopy to investigate the structure of the entire coiled-coil domain in a recombinant fragment of myosin 10 that contained the motor, the three calmodulin binding domains, and the full-length (120 residues) predicted coiled coil. The concentrations used in these studies were similar to those in vivo (i.e. nanomolar (26Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). It is worth noting that we used this recombinant fragment rather than the full-length native myosin 10 because this myosin is not abundant (26Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus has not been successfully purified from tissue samples. In addition, we did not use recombinant full-length myosin 10 because this protein is highly subject to degradation in the Sf9 cells, possibly because it contains three PEST sequences in its tail, just after the predicted coiled-coil domain. 3J. R. Sellers, unpublished data. Both rotary-shadowed and negative-stained images show that about 90% of the molecules of this myosin 10 construct are monomeric (Fig. 5). The remainder of the molecules were dimers, and this low proportion suggests that there could be a weak equilibrium between monomers and dimers, with a binding constant in the micromolar range. In contrast, the majority of molecules of two different myosin 5 constructs containing the full-length coiled coil of 182 residues were dimers. These specimens of myosin 5 and myosin 10 constructs were prepared for microscopy at the same time under the same conditions. One construct (M5-6IQ) contained six calmodulin binding sites/heavy chain, as found in the wild type myosin 5, and the other (M5-4IQ) contained only four, which is more directly comparable with myosin 10 (which has three). A few single-headed myosin 5 HMM molecules are seen (Fig. 5, D and E) that are probably the consequence of the loss of one head by proteolysis in the Sf 9 cells. A comparison of myosin 5 dimers with those of myosin 10 shows that they have a very different structure (Fig. 5). In myosin 10 dimers, the heads (motor domain and neck) taper toward a narrow neck, and the molecules associate only at the extreme distal ends. The predicted 18-nm coiled-coil tail is not visible, even though many molecules are V-shaped (Fig. 5C). This appearance suggests that these molecules could be tethered together by parallel association rather than antiparallel, although we cannot definitely decide between these two alternatives (Fig. 5G). We do not know the basis of this dimerization, but if it were due to coiled coil this would be only a few heptads long. In contrast, in myosin 5 the heads do not taper toward a narrow neck and are thicker than the tail, as noted previously for shadowed myosin 2 (27Elliott A. Offer G. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the short coiled-coil tail of myosin 5 can be easily identified, and its length is close to the 27-nm length expected for the 182 residues predicted to be coiled coil (Fig. 5, D and E). Both a simple visual inspection and a measurement of the lengths of the shadowed molecules show that the myosin 10 heads are much longer than expected. The images show that myosin 10 heads are obviously longer than those of M5-4IQ and also longer than those of M5-6IQ, which has twice as many calmodulins per head as myosin 10 (Fig. 5, D and E). To quantify this observation, we measured the head lengths for myosin 5 and myosin 10 and compared them with the expected head lengths based on the motor domain and number of calmodulins. For myosin 10, the mean head lengths were 34.7 ± 4.4 (S.D.) nm (n = 27) and 32.7 ± 3.9 nm (n = 28) for monomers and dimers, respectively. These values are much longer than the expected head length of 18.4 nm, based on 8 nm for the motor domain and 10.4 nm for the three calmodulins. For myosin 5, the mean head lengths were 26.0 ± 4.2 nm (n = 20) and 30.9 ± 4.1 nm (n = 21) for M5-4IQ and M5-6IQ, respectively. These values are close to those expected, 22.4 and 29.6 nm for M5-4IQ and M5-6IQ, respectively. Both metal grain and orientation of the heads can cause a spread in measured values. However, the fact that the myosin 5 data are close to expected values indicates that these effects are minor and that the measured lengths of myosin 10 heads are reliable. The proximal region of the predicted coiled-coil domain of myosin 10 is highly charged with alternate positively and negatively charged regions, and we predicted that it would form a stable SAH domain rather than a coiled coil. The data presented here confirm this prediction. Our electron microscopy further shows that the majority of the predicted coiled-coil domain does not dimerize to form a tail, but it forms a novel structure that acts to lengthen the head by about 15 nm. We suspect that the whole of this novel elongated structure is a SAH domain, even though we have so far shown only that the proximal region has this structure, and this is despite the distal region containing hydrophobic residues in a and d positions that might have been expected to stabilize the coiled coil (Fig. 1B). There are two lines of evidence that support this suspicion. First, the heads are longer than can be accounted for by the number of calmodulins and the short SAH domain. Second, the electron microscopy did not show the expected coiled-coil tail. Furthermore, a SAH domain consisting of all 120 residues would be 18 nm long, which is remarkably similar to the ∼15-nm difference between measured and expected head lengths. It should be noted that the presence of hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions (Fig. 1B) is not necessarily a good predictor of coiled coil formation, because segments of myosin 2 tails up to about 100 residues long can be monomeric and largely unstructured in solution (28Turbedsky K. Pollard T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The SAH domain is found immediately adjacent to the last IQ motif in the neck of the myosin 10 (Fig. 1B), suggesting the intriguing possibility that the SAH domain extends the length of the lever, which is supported by the electron microscopy data. An atomic model of the relationship of the third IQ domain to the SAH domain (Fig. 6A), shows that the non-helical N-terminal residues of the myosin 10 peptide can be stabilized in the α-helical conformation by interaction with the N-terminal lobe of the third calmodulin of the myosin 10 neck in the intact molecule (Fig. 6A). Therefore, the SAH domain can be connected directly to the neck without an intervening flexible region and thus can contribute directly to lever action. Our electron microscopy supports this idea, as the long heads of myosin 10 were no more diverse in shape than those of myosin 5 (Fig. 5), suggesting that they are no more flexible. The length of the lever is important for defining the size of the working stroke of a myosin. The working stroke is the distance that the end of the lever moves through during a cycle of interaction with actin and is a fundamental property of the myosin. According to the current dogma, the number of light chain binding motifs (IQ motifs) in the neck determines the length of the lever. If the proximal 36-residue SAH domain forms part of the lever it would extend its length from 10.4 nm contributed by the three IQ motifs by an extra 5.4 nm, increasing the effective lever length by 50%. If the entire elongated region of ∼15 nm contributed to the lever, this would increase the effective lever length by 140% (Fig. 6B). As we had demonstrated the presence of a SAH domain in myosin 10, we wondered whether the predicted coiled-coil domains of other classes of myosin were more likely to be SAH domains instead. Therefore, we looked for the presence of highly charged regions in the predicted coiled-coil domains in other classes. We found that the entire sequences of the predicted coiled coil of myosins 7a and MyoM are highly charged, show a pattern of alternating positive and negative charges that is similar to the pattern found in myosin 10, and are found next to the last IQ motif (Fig. 7). This suggests that these myosins also contain a SAH domain in place of the coiled coil that will extend the lever. For myosin 7a, which has five IQ domains (16.8 nm), the SAH domain (75 residues, 11.7 nm) would increase the effective lever length by 70%. In MyoM, which has two IQ domains (7.8 nm), the predicted SAH domain (∼90 residues), would be 14 nm long and therefore would increase the effective lever length by 180%. In addition, we predict that these myosins should be monomeric and not dimeric as proposed originally. In addition, we found that myosin 6 also contains a highly charged domain in its predicted coiled coil, as noted previously (29Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this is also the region with the highest score in coiled-coil prediction programs. However, in this myosin, the highly charged region of the predicted coiled-coil domain is distal rather than proximal to the motor domain as it is separated from the single IQ motif by ∼75 residues. It begins at residue 916 and is composed of 67 residues (10 nm of α-helix). This region has been seen to self-associate when a leucine zipper ties the two chains together (25Rock R.S. Ramamurthy B. Dunn A.R. Beccafico S. Rami B.R. Morris C. Spink B.J. Franzini-Armstrong C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that this is unlikely to happen in the absence of the zipper as the charged nature of this region and the pattern of intrahelical ion pairs is similar to that for myosin 10 (Fig. 7B). We have shown here that the highly charged proximal region of the predicted coiled coil of myosin 10 does not self-associate even at concentrations a million times higher than in vivo. In agreement with this, full-length myosin 6 was recently shown to be monomeric (29Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Could the SAH domain contribute to the lever in myosin 6? Myosin 6 has a large working stroke (18 nm) that is difficult to explain on the basis of the classic lever mechanism, as its neck is only 8 nm long (29Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A solution to this difficulty has been proposed by combining a large angle of swing of the lever with an extension of the lever beyond the IQ domains into the first part of the putative coiled-coil domain (29Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, if the entire predicted coiled-coil domain (residues 892-1013 in human myosin 6, which have a cut-off score of >0.5 using the COILS prediction program) was a SAH domain, it could extend the lever by 18.2 nm. This could then explain the large working stroke of this myosin without having to invoke a particularly large angle of swing. Furthermore, it could also explain the long strides of the processive myosin 6 HMM construct that is artificially dimerized (30Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our data indicate that myosins 6, 7a, 10, and MyoM contain SAH domains instead of the predicted coiled coil. This raises the possibility that all of these myosins are monomeric and that the SAH domain may lengthen their levers. These are important concepts to test, as monomers will function differently in cells to dimers. For example, native monomeric myosin 6 is not a processive motor (29Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), whereas forcible dimerization of myosin 6 converts it to a processive motor (30Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It is possible that functional oligomerization in cells by accessory proteins could exploit this property to favor processivity when required. In addition, an increase in the length of the lever will increase the size of the working stroke. It will be important in the future to test whether the predicted SAH domains in other myosins actually adopt that conformation and to establish the contribution they might make to the properties of the lever.

Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 1742-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Cell surface CS is regarded as an auxiliary receptor for herpes simplex virus (HSV) that in the absence of HS chains can support initial interaction of HSV with cells (3Banfield B.W. Leduc Y. Esford L. Visali R.J. Brandt C.R. Tufaro F. Virology. 1995; 208: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Mardberg K. Trybala E. Tufaro F. Bergström T. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A major CS-binding domain of HSV-1 attachment glycoprotein C (gC) has been shown to overlap with the HS binding site of this protein, except for residues Lys-114, Arg-117, Lys-120, and Ile-142, which supported gC binding to CS but not to HS (4Mardberg K. Trybala E. Tufaro F. Bergström T. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CS chains are composed of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) at alternating positions. The former residue can be ester O-sulfated at C2 or rarely at C3, whereas the latter can carry sulfate groups at C4 and/or C6. Several types of CS chains can be distinguished based on the disaccharide units characterized by sulfate groups at specific position(s). In particular, CS-A comprises GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S) as a typical unit, whereas disaccharides L-iduronic acid(2S)β1–3GalNAc(4S), GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6S), GlcA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S), and GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) predominate in CS-B (dermatan sulfate; DS), CS-C, CS-D, and CS-E, respectively, where 2S, 4S, and 6S stand for 2-O-, 4-O-, and 6-O-sulfate. Combination of disaccharide units with different sulfation patterns may form functional domain sequences as observed in HS chains (for review, see Ref. 5Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar).CS chains that contain di-sulfated disaccharide units are frequently isolated from marine organisms. Of these, CS-E has been purified from squid cartilage; its chains comprising ∼61% of the E-disaccharide unit can also be sulfated at C3 of GlcA (6Kinoshita A. Yamada S. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19656-19665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), although it should be emphasized that the GlcA(3S)-containing CS disaccharides have never been reported for mammalian cells or tissues. Such extensively sulfated chains may interact with heparin-binding proteins and/or interfere with the binding of these proteins to cell surface CS or HS. Indeed, recent functional studies have demonstrated that CS-E was capable of binding to a variety of brain-expressed heparin binding growth/differentiation factors with affinities comparable with that of heparin (7Deepa S.S.

In addition, CS-E inhibited neuronal cell adhesion by binding to neuroregulatory growth factor molecule midkine (8Ueoka C. Kaneda N. Okazaki. I. Nadanaka S. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

Virol. 1991; 72: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In light of these data, it was surprising to learn that CS-E blocked HSV invasion of cells at substantially lower concentrations than the standard HS-related compound heparin. This intriguing finding implied that certain structures present in CS-E may fit better than heparin to the attachment/entry domains of viral components. Here, we describe a CS-E-like structure as the gro2C cell surface receptor for HSV and an anti-HSV potential of exogenous CS-E derived from squid cartilage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4 from Proteus vulgaris) and chondroitinase AC-I (EC 4.2.2.5 from Flavobacterium heparinum) were obtained from Sigma and from Seikagaku Corp.

Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 48-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), HSV-1 KOS 321 strain (14Holland T.C. Marlin S.D. Levine M. Glorioso J. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 672-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its gC-negative derivative designated gC–39 (15Holland T.C. Homma F.L. Marlin S.D. Levine M. Glorioso J. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 566-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used.Preparation of GAGs from gro2C Cells—CS chains were prepared from gro2C cells by the method of Lyon et al. (16Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, to facilitate identification of GAG fractions the cells were cultured in the presence of trace amounts of Na2[35S]O4 for 3 days at 37 °C. The culture medium was aspirated and soluble proteoglycans concentrated by adsorption-elution on DEAE-Sephacel beads while the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested by scraping. Approximately 109 cells or the soluble proteoglycan fraction were digested with 25 mg of Pronase (Sigma) for 4 h at 37 °C and then for a further 20 h with an additional 25 mg of the enzyme. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant medium was boiled for 15 min to inactivate the enzyme and centrifuged again at 5,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and applied onto a column containing 5 ml of DEAE-Sephacel beads. The beads were washed with 0.02 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton, then with 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton, and finally with the detergent-free phosphate buffer/0.3 M NaCl. The adsorbed material was eluted with 1.5 m NaCl and precipitated with ethanol. The amount of isolated GAGs was determined by quantification of hexuronic acid using the meta-hydroxydiphenyl method (17Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (5843) Google Scholar) with commercial preparation of CS-C as a standard.Preparation of 2-Aminobenzamide-derivatized GAGs from gro2C Cells—Gro2C cells were homogenized in acetone and air-dried. The dried materials were digested with heat-activated (60 °C, 30 min) actinase E in 200 μl of 0.1 m boric acid-NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm calcium acetate. The incubation was carried out at 60 °C for 24 h. Following incubation, trichloroacetic acid was added to the sample to give 5%, and the resultant precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The soluble fraction was extracted with ether to remove trichloroacetic acid. The aqueous phase was neutralized with 1 m sodium carbonate and adjusted to 80% ethanol. The resultant precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm pyridine acetate, pH 5.0, and subjected to gel filtration on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) using 50 mm pyridine acetate, pH 5.0, as an eluent. The flow-through fractions were collected and evaporated to dryness. The dried materials were dissolved in water and then digested with chondroitinase ABC as described previously, using 5 mIU of chondroitinase ABC for 1 h at 37°C in a total volume of 10 μl (18Sugahara K. Ohkita Y. Shibata Y. Yoshida K. Ikegami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7204-7212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min. The digests were derivatized with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as reported previously (19Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Preparation of Size-defined CS-E Oligosaccharides—Even-numbered CS-E oligosaccharides were prepared by enzymatic fragmentation of commercial squid cartilage CS-E with sheep testicular hyaluronidase, followed by fractionation using gel filtration column chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10 as described previously (6Kinoshita A. Yamada S. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19656-19665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Preparation and Binding Assays of Purified Virions and Viral gC to Cells—[methyl-3H]Thymidine-labeled virions of HSV were purified from infectious culture medium of GMK AH1 cells by centrifugation through a three-step discontinuous sucrose gradient as described (20Karger A. Mettenleiter T.C. Virology. 1993; 194: 654-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Trybala E. Liljeqvist J-A. Svennerholm B. Bergstrom T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9106-9114Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The viral gC was purified from lysates of extracellular virus particles and virus-infected cells by immunoaffinity chromatography as previously described (21Trybala E. Liljeqvist J-A. Svennerholm B. Bergstrom T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9106-9114Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The effect of CS-E on the binding of purified virions to cells was tested by the HSV attachment-inhibition assay described previously (22Nyberg K. Ekblad M. Bergstrom T. Freeman C. Parish C.R. Ferro V. Trybala E. Antivir. Res. 2004; 63: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The effect of CS-E on the binding of purified gC to cells was tested as follows. Purified gC (0.2 μg) was preincubated for 15 min at 4 °C with serial dilutions of CS-E prior to the addition to GMK AH1 cells growing in 96-well cluster plates. Following an adsorption period of 1 h at 4 °C, the bound gC was detected by immunoassay with the use of an anti-gC monoclonal antibody C4H11B6, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment of goat antimouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) as the secondary antibody, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate (10Lycke E. Johansson M. Svennerholm B. Lindahl U. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).An Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent-based Assay of Binding of Viral gC to Immobilized CS-E—Commercial squid cartilage CS-E was biotinylated as previously reported (7Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Biotinylated CS-E (4 μg each) was immobilized on 96-well streptavidin-coated microtiter plates (BD Biocoat Assay Environments; BD Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. The wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, HSV-1 gC (0.1 μg each) was added, and the plate was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Bound gC protein was detected using mouse anti-gC monoclonal antibody B1C1B4, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG/IgM. Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate, and the absorbance was measured at 415 nm. Reactivity of the commercial CS-E with the gC protein was evaluated by inhibitory enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay where the gC component was preincubated with test CS-E oligo- or polysaccharides for 30 min at room temperature, and then the mixture was added to the CS-E-immobilized microtiter plates.Viral Plaque Assays—The effect of CS-E on HSV infectivity was tested by the plaque number reduction assay as previously described (22Nyberg K. Ekblad M. Bergstrom T. Freeman C. Parish C.R. Ferro V. Trybala E. Antivir. Res. 2004; 63: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The effect of CS-E on cell-to-cell spread of HSV was tested by the plaque size reduction assay (22Nyberg K. Ekblad M. Bergstrom T. Freeman C. Parish C.R. Ferro V. Trybala E. Antivir. Res. 2004; 63: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and by the infectious center assay (23Sinha S. Cheshenko N. Lehrer R.I. Herold B.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, for plaque size reduction assay, CS-E was diluted in an overlay medium composed of EMEM and 1% methylcellulose or 0.5% pooled human γ-globulin. The experiments were carried out in monolayer cultures of densely growing GMK AH1 cells. The overlay medium was added to cells after their infection with HSV and left on the cell monolayer throughout the entire period of the development of viral plaques. Images of 20 neighboring plaques were captured and subjected to plaque area determination by using a Leica DC300 digital camera and IM500 image software. For the infectious center assay, infected cells, prepared by their dissociation with trypsin-versene solution at 4–5 h after infection with HSV, were added to monolayer cultures of GMK AH1 cells in the medium comprising 0.5% human γ-globulin and specific concentrations of CS-E. The viral plaques were visualized by staining the cells with 1% solution of crystal violet after 2 (HSV-2) or 3 (HSV-1) days of incubation at 37 °C.Chondroitinase Digestion Assays—The anti-HSV activity of chondroitinase-treated CS-E was assayed as follows. CS-E (100 μg) in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 0.1% BSA (PBS-BSA) was digested for 10 min at 37 °C with different numbers of chondroitinase ABC units. Immediately afterward, the mixture was boiled for 1 min to inactivate the enzyme and then tested in the viral plaque assays for residual CS-E activity. The susceptibility of chondroitinase-treated gro2C cells to HSV was tested as follows. Gro2C cells seeded in 6-well cluster plates were washed with warm Dulbecco's-modified EMEM, and 1-ml volumes of PBS-BSA supplemented with different numbers of chondroitinase ABC, AC-I, B, or C units were added. Following incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were left at 4 °C for 30 min, washed twice with cold PBS-BSA, and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 ml of PBS-BSA containing ∼200 plaque-forming units (pfu) of HSV-1. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS-BSA and overlaid with 3 ml of 1% methylcellulose solution in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. Following incubation for 4 days at 37 °C, the viral plaques were visualized by staining with 1% solution of crystal violet.RESULTSAntiviral Potency of CS-E—The squid cartilage-derived CS-E was examined for its effect upon HSV infection of GMK AH1 cells. For comparative purposes, two other types of CS chains, CS-A and CS-D, and the standard HS-related polysaccharide heparin were included. In CS-E chains the number of sulfate groups/disaccharide unit averages 1.7, which is almost twice that of CS-A but only approximately two-thirds that of heparin. According to the manufacturer's data CS-D contains 23% of di-sulfated disaccharides and its degree of sulfation is 1.2. The effect of CS-E on HSV-1 or HSV-2 infectivity was assayed by incubating the CS-E with the virus for 15 min prior to addition to cells and during the 1-h period of virus infection of cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The concentrations of CS-E that reduced the number of viral plaques by 50% (IC50) were 0.2 μg/ml for HSV-1 and 0.06 μg/ml for HSV-2, thus substantially exceeding the antiviral potency of heparin. In contrast, within the concentration range tested, CS-A and CS-D showed no anti-HSV activity. CS-E exerted no cytotoxic effect when incubated with GMK AH1 cells for 24 h at concentrations of up to 500 μg/ml (data not shown).Two different assays were used to investigate the effect of CS-E on cell-to-cell spread of HSV. An infectious center assay evaluates virus transmission from an exogenously added infected cell to a non-infected cell of the cell monolayer and may reflect the host-to-host transmission of HSV via infected cells. The plaque size reduction assay assesses the virus spread between the densely growing cells of the monolayer culture and may indicate the capability of the compound to penetrate into the narrow intercellular spaces. Both assays were carried out in the presence of either pooled human γ-globulin or methylcellulose to exclude virus transmission by routes other than the direct cell-to-cell spread. CS-E inhibited HSV-2, and to some extent HSV-1, transmission from exogenously added infected cells to non-infected cells (Fig. 2A), although it had no effect on the size of HSV-1 and HSV-2 plaques developed (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Interference of CS-E with the cell-to-cell spread of HSV. A, HSV-infected cells (∼200), prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were added to and co-incubated with a confluent monolayer of GMK AH1 cells for 2–3 days at 37 °C in the presence of pooled human γ-globulin and different concentrations of CS-E. The results are expressed as a percentage of the number of viral plaques (pfu) found with compound-treated cells relative to mock-treated controls. Two separate experiments were carried out in duplicate for each virus. B, GMK AH1 cells were infected with ∼200 pfu of either HSV-1 KOS321 or HSV-2 333 and then overlaid with EMEM supplemented with 1% methylcellulose and different concentrations of CS-E. The results are expressed as a percentage of the average area of viral plaques developed in drug-treated cells relative to mock-treated controls. Images of 20 viral plaques per each dilution of the compounds were captured and subjected to area determinations using the IM500 software. The average area of HSV-1 plaques in control wells was 0.14 mm2 ± 0.09 and of HSV-2 plaques was 0.30 mm2 ± 0.17.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mechanism of Antiviral Activity of CS-E—A potent inhibition of HSV by CS-E raised questions about the nature of both the cellular GAG receptor, with which the compound competed, and the viral component targeted by CS-E. To clarify these issues, CS-E was tested for an anti-HSV activity in mutant gro2C cells that express CS but not HS (12Gruenheid S. Gatzke L. Meadows H. Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 93-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CS-E exhibited unusually high anti-HSV potency in these cells with IC50 values of 0.5 ng/ml for HSV-1 and 0.2 ng/ml for HSV-2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Note that the IC50 values for CS-E in GMK AH1 cells, which express both HS and CS, were more than 100-fold higher than the corresponding values in gro2C cells (compare Figs. 1 and 3; note differences in scale). In addition to CS-E, heparin exhibited a high antiviral activity in gro2C cells that significantly exceeded that observed in GMK-AH1 cells. These results suggest that in the absence of HS receptor, sulfated polysaccharides such as CS-E or heparin very effectively competed out the available cellular receptor in forms of CS. To identify the type of receptor molecule, gro2C cell surface GAGs were digested with chondroitinases ABC, AC-I, B, and C, which predominantly cleave the corresponding types of CS; some of them may also digest heterologous types, e.g. chondroitinase ABC can cleave most CS types, including CS-E and DS (the isomeric form of CS). Cells treated with chondroitinases ABC and AC-I, but not with B or C, were less susceptible to HSV-1 infection (Fig. 4A), suggesting that a certain specific structure of CS or DS is the cell surface receptor for HSV on gro2C cells.FIGURE 3Interference of CS-E with HSV infectivity in mutant gro2C cells expressing CS but not HS. CS-E or heparin at specific concentrations was incubated with ∼200 pfu of HSV-1 KOS321 (A) or HSV-2 333 (B) for 15 min prior to and during a 1-h period of virus infection of gro2C cells.

A, gro2C cells were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with an excess of chondroitinase ABC (2 units), AC-I (1 unit), B (15 units), or C (17 units) prior to their infection with HSV-1 KOS321 strain. Activities of all enzymes are shown in Sigma units. One IU corresponds to ∼600 Sigma units. The results are expressed as a percentage of the number of viral plaques (pfu) found in enzyme-treated cells relative to mock-treated controls. B, CS-E at different concentrations was incubated with [methyl-3H]thymidine-labeled particles of HSV-1 KOS321 or its gC-null derivative gC–39 for 15 min prior to and during a 1-h period of virus binding to gro2C cells. The results are expressed as a percentage of the attached viral cpm found with compound-treated virions relative to mock-treated controls. The mean number of cell-associated cpm in control wells was 6,858 for KOS321 and 5,723 for the gC–39 strain. C, CS-A, CS-D, CS-E, or heparin at different concentrations was incubated with purified gC of HSV-1 for 15 min prior to and during a 1-h period of gC adsorption to gro2C cells. The results are expressed as a percentage of the absorbance of attached viral gC found with CS-E-treated protein relative to mock-treated controls. Two separate experiments were carried out in duplicate or in triplicate (C) for each agent tested.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the viral component targeted by CS-E, the effect of this compound on binding to cells of radiolabeled HSV-1 wild-type strain (Fig. 4B), HSV-1 gC-deficient mutant designated gC–39 (Fig. 4B), and an isolated gC component of HSV-1 (Fig. 4C) was tested. CS-E reduced the binding to gro2C cells of wild-type HSV-1 and its attachment protein gC, whereas HSV-1 gC-null mutant was only marginally affected. Altogether the results shown in Fig. 4 indicate that CS-E inhibited HSV infection of gro2C cells by competing with cell surface CS or DS for binding to viral gC.Knowing that CS-E interfered with interaction between the viral gC and the cell surface CS chains, our further studies focused on these two components. First, we investigated whether viral gC was capable of binding to CS-E chains. To this end the gC component, derived from HSV-1 particles, was added to CS-E chains immobilized at the plastic surface. The viral gC bound to CS-E, and this interaction was substantially inhibited by soluble CS-E polymers at concentrations of ≥0.03 μg and by CS-E"
https://openalex.org/W2055933325,"ClC proteins are a family of chloride channels and transporters that are found in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell types. The mammalian voltage-gated chloride channel ClC-1 is important for controlling the electrical excitability of skeletal muscle. Reduced excitability of muscle cells during metabolic stress can protect cells from metabolic exhaustion and is thought to be a major factor in fatigue. Here we identify a novel mechanism linking excitability to metabolic state by showing that ClC-1 channels are modulated by ATP. The high concentration of ATP in resting muscle effectively inhibits ClC-1 activity by shifting the voltage gating to more positive potentials. ADP and AMP had similar effects to ATP, but IMP had no effect, indicating that the inhibition of ClC-1 would only be relieved under anaerobic conditions such as intense muscle activity or ischemia, when depleted ATP accumulates as IMP. The resulting increase in ClC-1 activity under these conditions would reduce muscle excitability, thus contributing to fatigue. We show further that the modulation by ATP is mediated by cystathionine β-synthase-related domains in the cytoplasmic C terminus of ClC-1. This defines a function for these domains as gating-modulatory domains sensitive to intracellular ligands, such as nucleotides, a function that is likely to be conserved in other ClC proteins.

This defines a function for these domains as gating-modulatory domains sensitive to intracellular ligands, such as nucleotides, a function that is likely to be conserved in other ClC proteins. Skeletal muscle has a high and variable demand for energy, in the form of ATP, and has elaborate systems to maintain the ATP supply. During intense exercise, however, ATP supply may not keep up with demand, and ATP concentration can decrease rapidly. In fast twitch fibers ATP can drop to below 25% of resting concentration within 25 s (1Karatzaferi C. de Haan A. Ferguson R.A. van Mechelen W. Sargeant A.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), a rate of ATP consumption that, if it continued, would deplete all ATP within a further 10 s. As the majority of ATP is consumed by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 5The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; KATP, ATP-sensitive K+ channels; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); IMPDH, inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase.5The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; KATP, ATP-sensitive K+ channels; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); IMPDH, inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase. Ca2+-ATPase pumping Ca2+ back into the SR after each Ca2+-activated contraction (2Szentesi P. Zaremba R. van Mechelen W. Stienen G.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), complete ATP depletion would lead to a rise in cytoplasmic calcium, rigor, and calcium-dependent damage (3Westerblad H. Allen D.G. Bruton J.D. Andrade F.H. Lannergren J. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 162: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 4Lamb G.D. Junankar P.R. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1995; 489: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This does not normally occur because force generation and ATP consumption decrease during exercise, compromising short term function but protecting cells from complete metabolic exhaustion. This process is well known as fatigue, but the factors contributing to fatigue remain controversial. A direct reduction in force generation by the contractile apparatus is thought to be a factor early in fatigue (3Westerblad H. Allen D.G. Bruton J.D. Andrade F.H. Lannergren J. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 162: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Debold E.P. Dave H. Fitts R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C673-C681Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but a significant reduction in ATP consumption only occurs with a reduction in SR Ca2+ release (and consequent reuptake) that occurs late in fatigue, correlating with ATP depletion (3Westerblad H. Allen D.G. Bruton J.D. Andrade F.H. Lannergren J. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 162: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Indeed, ATP depletion and the concomitant increase in cytoplasmic Mg2+ directly reduce the activity of the SR Ca2+ release channel and may contribute to fatigue (6Dutka T.L. Lamb G.D. J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 451-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A reduction in the electrical excitation that stimulates SR Ca2+ release is also thought be a major contributor to fatigue (7Sejersted O.M. Sjogaard G. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1411-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar).Activation, or excitation, of skeletal muscle is initiated at the neuromuscular junction by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated postsynaptic Na+ currents leading to membrane depolarization. These currents are large, so the threshold potential for voltage-gated Na+ channels is reached with high probability, leading to action potential initiation. Membrane repolarization following an action potential is mediated by voltage-gated K+ channels and the voltage-gated Cl- channel, ClC-1 (8Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), both of which are activated by membrane depolarization. A significant proportion of ClC-1 channels remain open in resting muscle, acting as a barrier to depolarization that must be overcome for successful action potential generation. Action potentials are propagated along the surface membrane and into the internal network of membrane tubes (T-tubules) where they activate voltage sensors in the dihydropyridine receptor, stimulating Ca2+ release from the SR and muscle contraction. During intense exercise, run down of Na+ and K+ gradients in the restricted volume of the T-tubules is thought to reduce action potential propagation and contribute to fatigue (7Sejersted O.M. Sjogaard G. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1411-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels (9Noma A. Nature. 1983; 305: 147-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar) provide a mechanism for linking excitability to metabolic state, and although KATP channels reduce excitability and protect cardiac muscle cells during ischemia (10Suzuki M. Sasaki N. Miki T. Sakamoto N. Ohmoto-Sekine Y. Tamagawa M. Seino S. Marban E. Nakaya H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), they do not appear to contribute significantly to force reduction during fatigue in skeletal muscle (11Gong B. Miki T. Seino S. Renaud J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1351-C1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ClC-1 channels are important regulators of skeletal-muscle excitability, as highlighted by muscle hyperexcitability due to mutations in ClC-1 in congenital myotonia (12Pusch M. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and aberrant splicing of ClC-1 in myotonic dystrophy (13Charlet B.N. Savkur R.S. Singh G. Philips A.V. Grice E.A. Cooper T.A. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). To date there is no evidence, however, that ClC-1 differentially regulates excitability during metabolic stress.Like other ClC family members, the ClC-1 protein comprises a large membrane-embedded channel domain followed by two cytoplasmic cystathionine β-synthase-related (CBS) domains (15Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 12-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1) and is thought to form homodimers with an ion-conducting pore within each monomer, as revealed by the structure of a bacterial ClC (16Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Voltage-dependent gating of ClC-1 has two components that are both activated by depolarization, fast or protopore gating that occurs independently in each pore and slow or common gating that operates on both pores simultaneously (17Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism of common gating, but its temperature dependence (18Pusch M. Ludewig U. Jentsch T.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Bennetts B. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Rychkov G.Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) indicates that it involves substantial conformational changes. Perhaps not surprisingly, mutations of ClC-1 that lead to dominantly inherited myotonia (Thomsen disease) tend to affect the voltage dependence of common gating and cluster at the dimer interface (12Pusch M. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). More surprisingly, modifications of the cytoplasmic CBS domains also affect common gating or in some cases abrogate channel function (20Fong P. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C966-C973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Estevez R. Pusch M. Ferrer-Costa C. Orozco M. Jentsch T.J. J.

Although the functional role of CBS domains in ClC proteins remains unclear, their importance to channel function is underlined by disease causing mutations. In humans mutations in the CBS domains of ClC-1 underlie congenital myotonia (23Deymeer F. Cakirkaya S. Serdaroglu P. Schleithoff L. Lehmann-Horn F. Rudel R. Ozdemir C.

Furthermore, we show that the regulatory effect of ATP on channel gating is mediated by the CBS domains of ClC-1, defining a functional role for these domains.MATERIALS AND METHODSChannel Expression and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human ClCN1 was expressed using a pCIneo (Promega) mammalian expression vector, as detailed previously (19Bennetts B. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Rychkov G.Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Aromataris E.C. Rychkov G.Y. Bennetts B. Hughes B.P. Bretag A.H. Roberts M.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were transiently transfected with a mixture of the ClCN1 construct and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) reporter plasmid at a molar ratio of 3:1 using Effectene (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Transfected cells were later identified by reporter plasmid-driven expression of the green fluorescent protein. Mutations were introduced into ClCN1 using the QuikChange (Stratagene) mutagenesis technique. The mutagenic primers were designed to incorporate silent restriction sites to aid in the identification of successfully mutated plasmid DNA. Mutant clones that were identified using restriction analysis were subsequently verified by sequencing.Electrophysiology—Patch-clamp experiments were conducted at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C) in the whole-cell configuration using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and associated standard equipment. Cells were continuously superfused with bath solution containing 140 mm NaCl; 4 mm CsCl; 2 mm CaCl2; 2 mm MgCl2; 10 mm Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The standard pipette solution contained 40 mm CsCl; 80 mm cesium glutamate; 10 mm EGTA-Na; 10 mm Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. Stock solutions of the following nucleotide salts, ATP disodium, ATP magnesium, ADP disodium, AMP disodium, IMP disodium, GTP lithium, and cAMP Tris, were stored at -20 °C and diluted in pipette solution on the day of each experiment. Solutions of 5 mm adenine and adenosine in pipette solution were made fresh on the day they were used. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and typically had a resistance of 1–2 megohms when filled with the above pipette solution. Series resistance did not exceed 4 megohms and was 85–95% compensated. After rupturing the cell membrane and achieving the whole-cell configuration, no less than 5 min was allowed for the pipette solution to equilibrate with the intracellular solution before current recordings were made. Currents obtained at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz were filtered at 5 kHz and collected using Axograph (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) software.Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using Axograph 4.9 and GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA) software. The voltage dependence of channel inactivation was determined by measuring tail-current relaxation at a constant voltage of -100 mV for a period of 75 ms, after a test pulse at voltages ranging from -140 to +120 mV. Under certain conditions (for example in the presence of intracellular ATP) and for certain mutations current activation at positive potentials was slowed. For this reason the time of the test pulse was varied between 300 and 800 ms, depending on the degree of channel activation; a manipulation that in itself has previously been shown to have little effect on the determination of channel open probability (29Duffield M. Rychkov G. Bretag A. Roberts M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Between test sweeps the cell membrane was clamped at a holding potential of -30 mV for a period of 2 s. Current relaxations during the -100 mV tail pulse were fit with an equation of the form, I(t)=A1exp(t/τ1)+A2exp(t/τ2)+C(Eq. 1) where I is the whole-cell current, t is time, τ1 and τ2 are the time constants of the fast and slow components of current relaxation, respectively, and A1, A2, and C are the amplitudes of the fast, slow, and steady-state components of the current, respectively. Instantaneous current amplitudes at the start of the -100 mV pulse (I(0)) were determined by extrapolation of this function. To obtain the voltage dependence of the apparent channel open probability (Po), normalized instantaneous current amplitudes were fit with a modified Boltzmann distribution of the form, PO(V)=Pmin+1-Pmin1+exp((V1/2-V)/k)(Eq. 2) where Pmin is an offset, or a minimal open probability at very negative potentials, V is the membrane potential, V1/2 is the half-maximal activation potential, and k is the slope factor. To determine the voltage dependence of the slow or common gate that acts simultaneously on both protopores of a ClC-1 dimer, a 400-μs pulse to +170mV was inserted before the -100 mV tail pulse, to maximally activate the fast or protopore gate. Instantaneous tail-current amplitudes, determined as described above were fit with Equation 2 to yield Po(V) for the common gate. Open probability of the protopore gate was determined by dividing the apparent channel open probability by the open probability of the common gate. This data were fit with Equation 2 to yield Po(V) curves for the protopore gate. All data are expressed as means ± S.E.Homology Modeling and Nucleotide Docking—The CBS domains from ClC-1 were individually modeled on the crystal structure of inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) from Streptococcus pyogenes (PDB entry 1ZFJ) using COMPOSER, a component of Sybyl 6.92 (Tripos, Inc.). The individual domain models were then assembled with reference to the atomic coordinates of the IMPDH CBS dimer to form CBS 1/2 dimers in SwissPDB viewer (30Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9466) Google Scholar), followed by energy minimization using Sybyl6.92. Two alternative models were built based on different alignments in one strand of CBS 2. The quality of both models was assessed and found to be satisfactory using Verify3D (31Eisenberg D. Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). The model with the best Verify3D score was chosen as the preferred model for in silico docking studies and is presented here. AutoDock 3.0 (32Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olsen A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8954) Google Scholar) was used to explore the interaction of AMP and ATP with the entire surface of this ClC-1 CBS model. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used to produce 100 conformations of each ligand, which were clustered within a root mean square deviation of 1.8 Å. Docked conformations of the ligands were inspected using VMD version 1.8 (33Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36824) Google Scholar).RESULTSIntracellular ATP Regulates ClC-1 Common Gating—During whole-cell patch clamp measurements of heterologously expressed ClC-1 channels, we observed that the voltage dependence of ClC-1 gating shifts to more negative potentials over the first few minutes after rupturing the cell membrane, indicating that ClC-1 gating might be modulated by a diffusible factor present in the cytoplasm that is diluted upon membrane rupture. Given the high ATP turnover of active skeletal muscle, we postulated that this factor might be ATP or one of its metabolites, perhaps linking excitability to metabolic state via regulation of ClC-1 channels in a similar manner to regulation of KATP channels (9Noma A. Nature. 1983; 305: 147-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar, 34Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found that ATP did indeed have a marked effect on the voltage dependence of ClC-1 gating, predominantly affecting common gating with little effect on protopore gating (Fig. 2). Inclusion of 5 mm ATP, similar to the concentration in resting muscle, in the intracellular solution during whole-cell patch clamp recordings altered common gating such that the midpoint of the voltage sensitivity curve (V1/2) shifted to less negative potentials by ∼50 mV, and the fraction of channels that remained open at strongly negative potentials (Pmin) was reduced ∼6-fold (Fig. 2). The non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, ATPγS had a similar effect to ATP on common gating, indicating that this effect does not involve ATP hydrolysis and is likely to be due simply to ATP binding. Although ATP is often complexed with Mg2+, equimolar Mg2+ did not influence the effect of ATP on common gating. The effect of ATP on the voltage-dependence of ClC-1 common gating was concentration-dependent, with a half-saturation concentration of ∼1 mm (Fig. 2B), similar to the concentration reached in fast twitch fibers after 25 s of intense exercise (1Karatzaferi C. de Haan A. Ferguson R.A. van Mechelen W. Sargeant A.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). During moderate exercise, although ATP turnover increases markedly, a variety of systems maintain ATP at close to resting levels of 5–7 mm, minimizing any effect on ClC-1 voltage sensitivity.FIGURE 2Nucleotide dependence of ClC-1 gating.

In all panels data points are means from n = 4–6 cells, error bars are S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Slight ATP depletion during exercise does, however, show up as proportionally larger increases in its metabolites ADP and particularly AMP. Differential regulation by these metabolites could be a factor in ClC-1 regulation as it is in other systems (34Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found, however, that AMP had a similar effect to ATP on ClC-1 common gating (Fig. 2), as did ADP. Furthermore 1 μm AMP, a high level physiologically, had no influence on the effect of 5 mm ATP on common gating indicating that the ClC-1 common gating is not sensitive to the AMP:ATP ratio. We also investigated the effect on ClC-1 common gating of the metabolic breakdown products of AMP, adenosine, and adenine. The effect of adenosine on common gating was similar to that of ATP or AMP, at both 5 and 1 mm (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that the presence of phosphates attached to adenosine are not important for the effect on common gating and reiterate that hydrolysis of a nucleotide high energy phosphate bond is not necessary for this effect. The effect on common gating of 5 mm adenine was much less than that of adenosine, ATP, or AMP (Fig. 2D), indicating that the ribose ring of adenosine is important for this effect. Although these data are useful in understanding ligand specificity, they do not indicate a physiological role for adenosine and adenine in regulating ClC-1, as the concentrations in skeletal muscle are well below the millimolar levels used here. Furthermore, their concentrations do not increase greatly during metabolic stress, because of the very high AMP deaminase activity that directs AMP breakdown to IMP rather than adenosine (35Idstrom J.P. Soussi B. Elander A. Bylund-Fellenius A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H1668-H1673PubMed Google Scholar, 36Morisaki T. Gross M. Morisaki H. Pongratz D. Zollner N. Holmes E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6457-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that although ClC-1 common gating is clearly modulated by adenosine nucleotides it is unlikely to be affected by the small changes that occur in the concentration of these nucleotides during moderate exercise.Under the anaerobic conditions of severe metabolic stress such as intense sprint exercise or ischemia, however, ATP can be depleted to less than 1 mm (1Karatzaferi C. de Haan A. Ferguson R.A. van Mechelen W. Sargeant A.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Idstrom J.P. Soussi B. Elander A. Bylund-Fellenius A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H1668-H1673PubMed Google Scholar), accumulating as IMP, the product of AMP deamination (37Hellsten Y. Richter E.A. Kiens B. Bangsbo J. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 38Tullson P.C. Terjung R.L. Exerc. Sport Sci. Rev. 1991; 19: 507-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that 5 mm intracellular IMP had no effect on ClC-1 common gating (Fig. 2A). Furthermore the effect of a mixture of 2.5 mm IMP and 2.5 mm ATP on common gating was essentially indistinguishable from 2.5 mm ATP alone. These data indicate that under conditions of severe metabolic stress when ATP is broken down to IMP, the drop in ATP concentration would lead to a shift in the voltage dependence of ClC-1 common gating toward more negative potentials.We also investigated the potential role of other nucleotides. As for IMP, inclusion of 5 mm GTP in the intracellular solution did not affect the voltage dependence of ClC-1 common gating (Fig. 2A), indicating some specificity for adenosine nucleotides. Inclusion of 5 mm cAMP in the intracellular solution reduced Pmin slightly, similar to submillimolar AMP, suggesting that AMP cyclization reduces binding affinity (Fig. 2A).ATP Modulation Is Mediated by CBS Domains of ClC-1—Having shown that intracellular ATP regulates ClC-1 activity, we then investigated whether this might occur by direct binding to the intracellular side of ClC-1. Tandem CBS domains in the C terminus of ClC-1 (15Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 12-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 39Ponting C.P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) seemed to be the best candidates for a potential ATP-binding site, as they are the only defined cytoplasmic domains, modification of them affects common gating (20Fong P. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C966-C973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Estevez R. Pusch M. Ferrer-Costa C. Orozco M. Jentsch T.J. J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and CBS domains occur in a number of nucleotide-sensitive proteins. Consistent with this postulate, Scott et al. (40Scott J.W. Hawley S.A. Green K.A. Anis M. Stewart G. Scullion G.A. Norman D.G. Hardie D.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) have shown recently that CBS domains of AMP-activated protein kinase and IMP dehydrogenas-1 bind nucleotides and regulate enzyme activity and that a piece of the C-terminal tail of ClC-2, including the two CBS domains, is able to bind ATP. To examine the possibility that CBS domains of ClC-1 might bind ATP we built homology models based on the structure of a CBS dimer from bacterial IMPDH (41Zhang R. Evans G. Rotella F.J. Westbrook E.M. Beno D. Huberman E. Joachimiak A. Collart F.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4691-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The validity of this structure as a modeling template is supported by the observation that CBS domains from mammalian IMPDH can substitute for those of ClC-1 while retaining channel function (21Estevez R. Pusch M. Ferrer-Costa C. Orozco M. Jentsch T.J. J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 363-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In silico docking of AMP and ATP to this model identified a putative binding pocket between CBS 1 and 2 (Fig. 3B) lined by residues Thr-636, Pro-638, and Ser-651 from CBS 1 and His-847, Leu-848, and Val-860 from CBS 2. The adenine base is predicted to bind deep within this pocket, close to Leu-848, with the ribose ring at the top of the pocket, close to Thr-636 and His-847.FIGURE 3Homology modeling of ClC-1 CBS domains.

https://openalex.org/W2050673616,"Transmembrane proteins BRI2 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) co-localize with amyloid β (Aβ) lesions in sporadic Alzheimer disease and mutations in both precursor proteins are linked to early-onset familial cases of cerebral amyloidosis associated with dementia and/or cerebral hemorrhage. A specific interaction between BRI2 and APP was unveiled by immunoprecipitation experiments using transfected and non-transfected cells. The use of deletion mutants further revealed that stretches 648–719 of APP751 and 46–106 of BRI2, both inclusive of the full transmembrane domains, are sufficient for the interaction. Removal of most of the APP and BRI2 extracellular domains without affecting the interaction implies that both proteins interact when are expressed on the same cell membrane (<i>cis</i>) rather than on adjacent cells (<i>trans</i>). The presence of BRI2 had a modulatory effect on APP processing, specifically increasing the levels of cellular APP as well as β-secretase-generated COOH-terminal fragments while decreasing the levels of α-secretase-generated COOH-terminal fragments as well as the secretion of total APP and Aβ peptides. Determining the precise molecular pathways affected by the specific binding between APP and BRI2 could result in the identification of common therapeutic targets for these sporadic and familial neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2075261522,"Human Spα is a soluble protein belonging to group B of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily for which little functional information is available. It is expressed by macrophages present in lymphoid tissues (spleen, lymph node, thymus, and bone marrow), and it binds to myelomonocytic and lymphoid cells, which suggests that it may play an important role in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. In the present study we show that recombinant human Spα (rSpα) binds to the surface of several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Competition studies indicated that such binding is mediated by the recognition of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively, through nonoverlapping sites on the Spα molecule. The most conserved part of LPS (2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid and lipid A) was shown to be involved in the recognition by Spα. Bacterial binding studies using the SRCR domain 1 of Spα showed that this domain retains both the LPS and LTA binding activities, indicating that both bacterial interacting sites are retained in a single SRCR domain. Furthermore, rSpα induced aggregation of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria strains. On the other hand, rSpα inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α secretion by human monocytes stimulated with LPS or LTA.

Macrophages play a major role in host innate defense. They are found in many tissues, particularly in those that function in the filtration of blood or lymph fluids, such as liver, spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. They recognize, internalize, and destroy harmful endogenous and foreign substances. Such recognition occurs through the direct binding to macrophage receptors or upon antibody or complement coating. Macrophage receptors are fixed germ line-encoded proteins that can directly recognize pathogen-associated common structures, hence their name, pattern recognition receptors (1Janeway C.A.

They include host components such as collagen and thrombospondin by CD36, and altered self-like oxidized low density lipoprotein by most SR (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev.

Some SR belong to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich superfamily (SRCR-SF), which is an ancient and highly conserved family of receptors characterized by the presence of one or several repeats of a cysteine-rich extracellular domain named SRCR (8Freeman M. Ashkenas J. Rees D.J. Kingsley D.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8810-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This domain consists of ∼100 residues containing 6–8 cysteines with a well conserved disulfide bond pattern. The SRCR-SF has been divided into two groups based on the position and number of cysteine residues in each SRCR domain, as well as on its intron-exon organization. Thus, group A includes members possessing 6 cysteines in their SRCR domains, each of which is encoded by at least two exons. In contrast, the SRCR domains of group B proteins mostly contain 8 cysteine residues and are encoded by a single exon. Members of either group can contain the SRCR as a single domain, as tandem repeats or as part of multidomain mosaic proteins (in combination with e.g. epidermal growth factor domains, serine protease domains, collagenous regions, or other domains) (9Sarrias M.R. Gronlund J. Padilla O. Madsen J. Holmskov U. Lozano F. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 24: 1-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the high conservation of the SRCR domains throughout evolution, there is no evidence for common functions and/or ligands among the members of the SRCR-SF. This protein family currently includes about 25 members expressed on cells associated with the immune system such as macrophages (e.g. SR-AI, MARCO, CD163, and Mac2-binding protein) (5Elomaa O.

Some of them have been implicated in the development of the immune system and in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses (18Aruffo A. Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Starling G.C. Gebe J.A. Bajorath J. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 498-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Human Spα (hSpα) is an SRCR-SF group B protein for which limited functional information is available. It is a soluble 38-kDa glycoprotein composed of three SRCR domains, and it is expressed by macrophages present in lymphoid tissues (spleen, lymph node, thymus, bone marrow, and fetal liver). Cell binding studies showed the existence of putative receptors for Spα on peripheral monocytes but not on T and B lymphocytes (19Gebe J.A. Kiener P.A. Ring H.Z. Li X. Francke U. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6151-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, hSpα bound to certain myelomonocytic (THP-1 and K562) cell lines as well as to some T (HUT78) and B (Raji) cell lines. The expression of hSpα in lymphoid organs involved in the development and maintenance of the lymphoid compartment as well as in immune surveillance further suggests that this protein may play an important role in regulating the immune system (19Gebe J.A. Kiener P.A. Ring H.Z. Li X. Francke U. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6151-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Spα may also play a role in the homeostasis of IgM, because it has been found present in IgM but not IgG or IgA fractions from human serum (20Tissot J.D. Sanchez J.C. Vuadens F. Scherl A. Schifferli J.A. Hochstrasser D.F. Schneider P. Duchosal M.A. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 1203-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A mouse protein that shares 73% amino acid identity with hSpα has been described (21Gebe J.A. Llewellyn M. Hoggatt H. Aruffo A. Immunology. 2000; 99: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Miyazaki T. Hirokami Y. Matsuhashi N. Takatsuka H. Naito M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This protein is named AIM (for apoptosis inhibitory factor secreted by macrophages) and is considered the mouse homologue of hSpα (mSpα), although discrepancies on the expression pattern of both proteins have been reported (22Miyazaki T. Hirokami Y. Matsuhashi N. Takatsuka H. Naito M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). AIM function has been analyzed using two different mouse models. Work with mice deficient for AIM (AIM-/-) shows that this protein prevents apoptosis of double-positive thymocytes induced by dexamethasone and γ-irradiation (22Miyazaki T. Hirokami Y. Matsuhashi N. Takatsuka H. Naito M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), as well as apoptosis of T and NKT cells from Corynebacterium parvum-induced liver granulomas (23Kuwata K. Watanabe H. Yamamoto T. Miyazaki T. Naito M. Comp. Hepatol. 2004; 3: S44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, results from transgenic mice overexpressing AIM indicate that this molecule supports the survival and the phagocytic activity of macrophages in liver inflammatory (hepatitis) lesions (24Haruta I. Kato Y. Hashimoto E. Minjares C. Kennedy S. Uto H. Yamauchi K. Kobayashi M. Yusa S. Muller U. Hayashi N. Miyazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22910-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, a study on mice lacking the nuclear liver X α receptor (LXRα-/-) has shown that AIM is responsible for the resistance to infection with the intracellular bacteria Listeria monocytogenes (25Joseph S.B. Bradley M.N. Castrillo A. Bruhn K.W. Mak P.A. Pei L. Hogenesch J. O'Connell R.M. Cheng G. Saez E. Miller J.F. Tontonoz P. Cell. 2004; 119: 299-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). It was shown that LXRα up-regulates the expression of AIM, which in turn supports macrophage survival and bacterial clearance in the setting of L. monocytogenes infection (25Joseph S.B. Bradley M.N. Castrillo A. Bruhn K.W. Mak P.A. Pei L. Hogenesch J. O'Connell R.M. Cheng G. Saez E. Miller J.F. Tontonoz P.

In the present study we have used a previously characterized recombinant form of human Spα (rSpα) (26Sarrias M.R. Padilla O. Monreal Y. Carrascal M. Abian J. Vives J. Yelamos J. Lozano F. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 63: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to show that it is able to bind to the surface of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (namely, LPS and LTA). Reagents and Buffers—Unless indicated, all cells used in this study were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS (Invitrogen) (referred to as culture medium below). The human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line HEK 293-EBNA (Invitrogen) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml geneticin (G418), and 10% FCS. Purified LPS, LTA, KDO, and lipid A were purchased from Sigma. PBS (Roche Diagnostics) is 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4; TBS is 140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. hSA was purchased from Grífols (Grífols, Barcelona, Spain). Re-LPS is a Re595 mutant of lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella minnesota, purchased from Sigma. Fluorescein and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC, isomer I) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Methanol and chloroform used to dissolve Re-LPS were high pressure liquid chromatography grade (Scharlau, Barcelona, Spain). Bacterial Strains—The Escherichia coli strains serovar O26:K60(B6): H11 (CECT 351), serovar:O rough H48 (CECT 433), and serovar O26: K60(B6): H-(CECT 732) were purchased from the Spanish Collection of Type Cultures (CECT, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain). Staphylococcus epidermidis was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The rest of the bacterial strains used in this study are clinical strains isolated from patients of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Spain. They were characterized by the Department of Microbiology of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona using standard biochemical procedures. Bacteria were grown in Luria Bertoni broth (LB) at 37 °C with aeration, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, which was grown in Todd Hewitt broth at 37 °C. Bacterial strains were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 10 min and resuspended in TBS to a final density of 1010 bacteria per ml. Quantification was done by plating bacteria dilutions on agar plates. Proteins and Antibodies—The expression and purification of a rSpα has been reported elsewhere (26Sarrias M.R. Padilla O. Monreal Y. Carrascal M. Abian J. Vives J. Yelamos J. Lozano F. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 63: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The same expression system was used to generate the recombinant form of Spα SRCR domain 1 (rSpαD1). The latter protein was generated as follows. Specific cDNA encompassing amino acids Ser-1 to Gly-137 (mature protein numbering) was amplified from the pCEP-Pu vector carrying the Spα full-length cDNA, by PCR amplification with the 5′-GCCCGGCTAGCGTCTCCATCTGGAGTGCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTAACCCTCTGGGACTG-3′ (reverse) Spα-specific primers, as described previously (26Sarrias M.R. Padilla O. Monreal Y. Carrascal M. Abian J. Vives J. Yelamos J. Lozano F. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 63: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The forward primer incorporated the NheI restriction site (underlined), whereas the reverse primer incorporated a stop codon followed by the BamHI restriction site (underlined). The amplified PCR product was NheI/BamHI-restricted and cloned into appropriately digested pCEP-Pu vector. As a consequence of the cloning process, the natural signal peptide was replaced by the BM-40 leader sequence, which resulted in the addition of amino acids Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala to its N-terminal sequence (26Sarrias M.R. Padilla O. Monreal Y. Carrascal M. Abian J. Vives J. Yelamos J. Lozano F. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 63: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Nischt R. Pottgiesser J. Krieg T. Mayer U.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Then, semi-confluent HEK 293-EBNA cells grown in 6-well culture dishes were transfected with 4 μg of the resulting plasmid construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfectants were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) in the culture medium. Cell transfectants expressing rSpα D1 were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/FCS. The medium was collected every 48–72 h over a period of 15 days. The recombinant proteins rSpα and rSpαD1 were affinity-purified over two different CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B columns (Amersham Biosciences) covalently coupled to the anti-Spα mAb 3B1a (26Sarrias M.R. Padilla O. Monreal Y. Carrascal M. Abian J. Vives J. Yelamos J. Lozano F. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 63: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Unbound protein was washed off with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40. rSpα or rSpαD1 were eluted with PBS containing 3.5 m MgCl2 and exchanged to PBS, using HiTrap™ desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and their purity was assessed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The yield was approximately of 2 mg of purified rSpα and 500 μg of rSpαD1 per liter of culture medium. Protein Biotinylation—EZ-Link PEO-maleimide-activated biotin (Pierce) was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 10 mm and then added to rSpα or rSpαD1 solution at a 5:1 molar ratio. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then desalted and exchanged into PBS over a HiTrap™ desalting column to remove the free biotin. Monitoring of the biotinylation reactions was performed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. ELISAs—12 μg of LPS purified from E. coli O55:B5, O111:B4, or O26:B6 (Sigma) was used to coat 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in PBS, overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding to the wells was prevented by the addition of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Several concentrations of rSpα were then added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Bound rSpα was detected with the addition of biotinylated mAb 3B1a (1.8 μg),for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a 30-min incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of HRP-labeled streptavidin (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Between each incubation step, unbound protein, antibody, or HRP-streptavidin was washed off three times with PBS, 0.01% Tween 20. Color was developed by adding 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate (Sigma), and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. The assay was repeated twice with similar results. Bacterial Binding Studies—Binding of Spα to bacteria was studied following a method described previously (4Dunne D.W. Resnick D. Greenberg J. Krieger M. Joiner K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1863-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) although with slight modifications. For direct binding studies, ∼5 × 107 bacteria (in 30 μl) were incubated with 1 μg of biotinylated rSpα,1 μg of cold rSpα,or0.7 μgof rSpαD1, in 400 μl of TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5 mm Ca2+ (binding buffer), by gentle orbital rotation for 1 h at 4°C. In some experiments 5 mm Ca2+ was replaced by 5 mm EDTA in the binding and washing steps. For competition studies, 1 μg of biotinylated rSpα was incubated for 30 min on ice with several amounts of LPS, LTA, KDO, or lipid A in 100 μl of binding buffer. Then a suspension containing 5 × 107 bacteria (30 μl) was added and incubated on an orbital rotator for 1 h at 4°C. In all cases, bacteria were pelleted and washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer and twice with 0.5 ml of TBS, 5 mm Ca2+. The washed pellets were then resuspended in SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer and denatured by heating at 100 °C for 15 min. Protein binding was analyzed by Western blotting, as follows. Proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis through 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding to the membrane was blocked with PBS, 10% nonfat milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. For rSpα or rSpαD1 detection, a 2 μg/ml solution of mAb 3B1a in blocking buffer was added and incubated for 1 h. Then a 1:1000 solution of HRP-labeled protein G (DAKO), for bound mAb detection, or HRP-labeled streptavidin (DAKO), for biotinylated protein detection, were added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times for 15 min with PBS, 0.01% Tween 20 between incubation steps. Finally, the blots were developed by chemiluminescence (Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate, Pierce). Determination of the Apparent Dissociation Constant of FITC-Re-LPS/rSpα Complexes—Re-LPS was labeled with FITC by binding the phosphoethanolamine groups of Re-LPS to FITC as described previously (29Tobias P.S.

Tobias P.S. Casals C. Biochem. J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The Re-LPS concentration of the fluorescent derivative was determined by quantification of the KDO, and the content of fluorescein was determined spectrophotometrically at 493 nm, using a molar absorption coefficient of 77,000 m-1 cm-1 (29Tobias P.S.

Fluorescence measurements were carried out using an SLM-Aminco AB-2 spectrofluorimeter with a thermostated cuvette holder (±0.1 °C), using 5 × 5 mm path length quartz cuvettes. Fluorescent emission spectra of FITC-Re-LPS (0.5 μg/ml) were measured in the absence or presence of rSpα in 5 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 nm EDTA at 25 °C. The blanks (protein alone) and FITC-Re-LPS samples (with and without protein) were excited at 470 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 500 to 650 nm. The apparent dissociation constant (KD) for FITC-Re-LPS/rSpα complexes was obtained by analyzing the time dependence of the fluorescence change when 0.5 μg/ml M FITC-Re-LPS reacted with various concentrations of rSpα at 25 °C. Fluorescence emission was monitored at 520 nm for 30 min. These experiments were performed twice and in duplicate, exactly as described previously for KD determination for Re-LPS interaction with LBP, CD14, and surfactant protein A (29Tobias P.S. Soldau K.

Bacteria Aggregation Assays—A fresh overnight culture of bacteria was harvested by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 10 min and resuspended in PBS to a final density of 1010 bacteria per ml. FITC (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 10 mm and then added to the bacterial suspensions to a final concentration of 2 mm. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and excess unbound FITC was removed by extensive washing with PBS. 10 μl of FITC-labeled bacterial suspension (5 × 108 bacteria) in TBS containing 5 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EDTA were mixed with 10 μl of protein solution (rSpα, hSA, or rSpαD1) or peptide SRCR2P (QGRVEVLYRGSWGTVC) (31Bikker F.J.

Our results show that Coronin 1B is a ubiquitously expressed member of the mammalian Coronin gene family that co-localizes with the Arp2/3 complex at the leading edge of fibroblasts, and co-immunoprecipitates with this complex. Pharmacological experiments show that the interaction between Coronin 1B and the Arp2/3 complex is regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation. Coronin 1B is phosphorylated by PKC both in vitro and in vivo. Using tryptic peptide mapping and mutagenesis, we have identified serine 2 (Ser-2) on Coronin 1B as the major residue phosphorylated by PKC in vivo. Rat2 fibroblasts expressing the Coronin 1B S2A mutant show enhanced ruffling in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and increased speed in single cell tracking assays. Cells expressing the Coronin 1B S2D mutant have attenuated PMA-induced ruffling and slower cell speed. Expression of the S2A mutant partially protects cells from the inhibitory effects of PMA on cell speed, whereas expression of the S2D mutant renders cells hypersensitive to its effects. These data demonstrate that Coronin 1B regulates leading edge dynamics and cell motility in fibroblasts, and that its ability to control motility and interactions with the Arp2/3 complex are regulated by PKC phosphorylation at Ser-2. Furthermore, Coronin 1B phosphorylation is responsible for a significant fraction of the effects of PMA on fibroblast motility.

The dynamic re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton is required for many processes including migration, endocytosis, and intracellular junction formation. Coronins are a conserved family of WD repeat-containing, actin-binding proteins that regulate migration and other actin-dependent processes in model organisms. Mammalian genomes contain at least six Coronin genes, however, little is known about the molecular function or regulation of Coronins in mammalian cell motility. The founding member of the Coronin protein family was discovered in Dictyostelium as an F-actin-binding protein present in a contracted myosin-actin preparation (1de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Subsequent gene knock-out studies showed that this protein was involved in cell motility and cytokinesis (2de Hostos E.L. Rehfuess C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Dictyostelium cells deficient in Coronin move at about half the rate of the wild-type controls and have a high frequency of failed cytokinesis. The protein is localized at the leading edge of motile cells. In addition to motility defects, Coronin null cells also have strong defects in fluid phase endocytosis (3Hacker U. Albrecht R. Maniak M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 105-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast also has a Coronin protein that binds to F-actin in vitro and localizes in vivo to dynamic actin structures such as actin patches (4Heil-Chapdelaine R.A. Tran N.K. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Goode B.L. Wong J.J. Butty A.C. Peter M. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Unlike Dictyostelium, disruption of the single Coronin gene (CRN1) in yeast does not lead to gross defects in growth or cytoskeletal organization. However, when a crn1 mutation is combined with a mutation in the gene encoding Cofilin (cof1-22), a protein involved in actin filament turnover, synthetic defects in growth and cytoskeletal organization are observed (5Goode B.L. Wong J.J. Butty A.C. Peter M. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Coronin in yeast induces the formation of aberrant actin loops and causes lethality (6Humphries C.L. Balcer H.I. D'Agostino J.L. Winsor B. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Andrews B.J. Goode B.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Purified yeast Coronin binds directly to the Arp2/3 complex via its coiled-coil domain and inhibits Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation in vitro. In support of these in vitro studies, mutations in the CRN1 gene genetically synergize with mutations in the subunits of the Arp2/3 complex. Coronin has also been studied in other model organisms. In Drosophila, mutations in Coronin cause disruptions in the actin cytoskeleton of the embryonic imaginal disks and an early pupal lethal phenotype, indicating that this gene is essential for morphogenesis in this organism (7Bharathi V. Pallavi S.K. Bajpai R. Emerald B.S. Shashidhara L.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, Coronin localizes to the periphery of fibroblastic cells and, like Dictyostelium and yeast Coronins, co-sediments with F-actin in vitro (8Mishima M. Nishida E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2833-2842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the coiled-coil region at the C terminus of Xenopus Coronin has been shown to mediate oligomerization (9Asano S. Mishima M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression of a putative dominant negative construct containing the five canonical WD repeats from Xenopus Coronin leads to defects in cell spreading and Rac-induced lamellipodial formation (8Mishima M. Nishida E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2833-2842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several mammalian members of the Coronin family have been described (10de Hostos E.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For clarity, we have adopted the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) nomenclature for mammalian Coronin genes (www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/genefamily/coronin.html). Coronin 1A (also known as p57 or Coronin-1) was the first Coronin to be identified in mammals and is highly expressed in cells of the hematopoietic lineage as well as parts of the nervous system (11Nal B. Carroll P. Mohr E. Verthuy C. Da Silva M.I. Gayet O. Guo X.J. He H.T. Alcover A. Ferrier P. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This protein is a substrate for PKC both in vitro and in vivo; however, the sites that are phosphorylated are unknown and the functional significance of phosphorylation has not been well characterized (12Itoh S. Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Iwasa M. Oku T. Nakajin S. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Coronin 1B (also known as CoroninSE or Coronin-2) was discovered as a carbachol-stimulated phosphoprotein in rabbit parietal cells (13Parente Jr., J.A. Chen X. Zhou C. Petropoulos A.C. Chew C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3017-3025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Carbachol acts via a protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; IP, immunoprecipitation; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. pathway in this cell type to regulate secretion. Recently, this gene was identified in a microarray-based screen for genes up-regulated in a neural regeneration model (14Di Giovanni S. De Biase A. Yakovlev A. Finn T. Beers J. Hoffman E.P. Faden A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2084-2091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Coronin 1B induced neurite extension in several neuronal cell lines, whereas reduced expression via RNA interference caused a reduction in outgrowth. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis studies suggest that Coronin 1C (Coronin-3) is also phosphorylated in vivo (15Spoerl Z. Stumpf M. Noegel A.A. Hasse A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48858-48867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The potential PKC regulation of mammalian Coronins is intriguing because this family of Ser/Thr kinases regulates migration in many cell types. Activation of classic and novel isoforms of PKC by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in some cell types increases cell migration, whereas in other cell types, it is inhibitory (16Fridman R. Lacal J.C. Reich R. Bonfil D.R. Ahn C.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These opposing effects are likely because of the complement of PKC isoforms and/or substrate proteins expressed in a given cell type (17Jackson D. Zheng Y. Lyo D. Shen Y. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Humphries M.J. Reyland M.E. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PMA is thought to exert its effects on migration by changing adhesiveness and/or actin architecture at the leading edge (18Ng T. Shima D. Squire A. Bastiaens P.I. Gschmeissner S. Humphries M.J. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3909-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 19Dugina V.B. Svitkina T.M. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4122-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PMA also regulates other actin-based motility events such as neurite outgrowth and endosome rocketing (20Glowacka D. Ginty D.D. Wagner J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Taunton J. Rowning B.A. Coughlin M.L. Wu M. Moon R.T. Mitchison T.J. Larabell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Despite the clear importance of PKC in cell motility, a relatively small number of PKC substrate proteins have been thoroughly characterized in terms of the residues phosphorylated and functional significance of their phosphorylation in the control of motility. In this work, we have identified serine 2 as the major in vivo PKC phosphorylation site on Coronin 1B, and demonstrate that phosphorylation regulates the interaction between Coronin 1B and the Arp2/3 complex. Furthermore, we show that Ser-2 phosphorylation of Coronin 1B regulates PMA-induced ruffling and cell migration. Materials—Commercial antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (pSerPKC), Upstate Biotechnology (p34-Arc), Roche (GFP), and Sigma (9E10/Myc). Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin was from Molecular Probes. Cell lines were from ATCC. PKC inhibitors Ro32-0432 and Gö6976 were from Calbiochem. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1,10-phenanthroline, aprotinin, leupeptin, sodium fluoride, and sodium orthovanadate) were from Sigma. All other materials were from Fisher Scientific unless otherwise indicated. TaqMan Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from murine tissues using a Qiagen RNeasy Isolation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription into cDNA was done in a 20-μl volume using oligo(dT)12-18 Primer, 10 mm dNTP mixture, and Improm-II Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR were carried out in a 20-μl volume consisting of 10 μl of Universal Master Mix No AmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems), 0.25 μg of fluorogenic probe (Mm00486998_m1[1A], Mm00488552_g1[1B], Mm00488558_m1[1C], Mm00619135_m1[2A], Mm00558512_m1[2B], Mm00504152_m1[POD], Applied Biosystems), and 8 μl of diluted cDNA (∼80 ng of total RNA/reaction). The PCRs were carried out under standard conditions in a 20-μl volume in duplicate for each sample in the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The number of PCR cycles needed to reach the fluorescence threshold was determined in duplicate for each cDNA, averaged, and then normalized against a reference gene, 18 S (4333760-0311007 Applied Biosystems), to yield the cycle number at which fluorescence was reached (Ct). For the absolute copy number of Coronin 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, and POD, 4-fold dilutions of the respective mouse full-length cDNAs were used to generate a standard curve (22Overbergh L. Giulietti A. Valckx D. Decallonne R. Bouillon R. Mathieu C. J. Biomol. Tech. 2003; 14: 33-43PubMed Google Scholar). All tissue samples tested were within the linear range (19-38 cycles) of the assay. Molecular Cloning—PCR and subcloning were performed using standard methods. Detailed methods and primer sequences are available upon request. WT1B-EGFP was constructed by amplifying the coding sequence of human Coronin 1B and cloning it into a pMSCV-based retroviral vector (23Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Libova I. Fassler R. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). S2A-EGFP and S2D-EGFP were generated from WT1B-EGFP by site-directed mutagenesis using mutation-encoding primers. Coronin 1B-Myc was generated by subcloning the Coronin 1B coding sequence into a pMSCV vector containing a C-terminal Myc tag. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Retroviral Transduction—HEK293 and Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 292 μg/ml glutamine. Rat2 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in the same media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum or 10% calf serum (HyClone), respectively. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Retroviral packaging, infections, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were performed as described previously (23Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Libova I. Fassler R. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with a KCl buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were cleared at 13,000 × g for 5 min and incubated with 0.5 μg of primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of 50% slurry of ImmunoPure-immobilized protein A/G beads (Pierce) and further incubation at 4 °C for an additional hour. Beads were pre-blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and washed extensively with the KCl buffer prior of usage. The immune complexes were collected, washed with the KCl buffer three times, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) for Western blotting. Recombinant Protein Production—His6-tagged Coronin 1B (His1B) was generated by PCR cloning the coding sequence of human Coronin 1B into pQE-80L (Qiagen). GST-tagged full-length (GST1B) or the C-terminal fragment of Coronin 1B were cloned by PCR into pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Biosciences). For protein production, cells were grown to mid-log and expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at room temperature. Bacteria was harvested and sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm imidazole). His1B was purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-chelated agarose (Pierce). Lysate, cleared at 20,000 × g for 20 min, was applied to a nickel-chelated agarose column, and washed using the lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. His1B was eluted with 500 mm imidazole in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl. GST-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using immobilized glutathione beads (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the GST tag was on-column removed by Pre-Scission protease (Amersham Biosciences). The C-terminal region of mouse Coronin 1B (394-484 amino acids) was PCR cloned into pMAL-c2g vector (New England Biolabs). Maltose-binding protein was purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In Vitro Phosphorylation—2 μg of recombinant protein was incubated with ∼0.5 μg of PKCα (Panvera or Sigma) in 100 μl of kinase assay buffer (7.2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3.6 mm MgCl2, 0.18 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.63 mm CaCl2, 0.1 μm ATP, 0.5 μm PMA, 120 μm phosphatidylserine) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C (24Ziegler W.H. Tigges U. Zieseniss A. Jockusch B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7396-7404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for autoradiography and peptide mapping. In Vivo Phosphorylation—Cells were serum starved for 12 h before metabolic labeling, and then incubated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-free minimum essential medium (Sigma). After 8 h, cells were treated with or without 100 nm PMA for 30 min and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IPEGAL, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm α-naphthyl acid phosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The 13,000 × g cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated as described above. The immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for autoradiography and peptide mapping. Peptide Mapping—Peptide mapping was performed as described previously (25Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 26Luo K.X. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, appropriate protein bands were cut from the nitrocellulose membrane and digested with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (95%, 284 units/mg; Worthington) in 0.05 m NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, at 37 °C for 24 h. The peptides were washed and dried using a speed vacuum centrifuge, and spotted onto cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (Merck KGaA, Germany) for two-dimensional mapping using pH 8.9 buffer (ammonium carbonate, 10 g/liter) for electrophoresis in the first dimension and phosphochromatography buffer (n-butanol:pyridine:glacial acetic acid:deionized water, 75:50:15:60) for chromatography in the second dimension. After that the thin layer chromatography plates were dried completely for autoradiography. Coro1B Antibody Production and Affinity Purification—Rabbits were immunized with a GST fusion protein containing the human Coronin 1B C-terminal region (394-489 amino acids) by Covance. Serum was affinity purified against maltose-binding fusion protein containing the equivalent region of mouse Coronin 1B to ensure cross-reactivity. This myelin basic fusion protein was purified in a buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, and 60 mm sodium citrate, which was used for direct coupling to UltraLink biosupport media (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The column was washed extensively with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and 100 mm triethylamine, pH 11.5, with neutralizing washes between. Crude serum was diluted 10-fold in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and passed through the column three times. The column was washed with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and then with 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Antibodies were eluted sequentially with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, followed by 100 mm triethylamine, pH 11.5. The antibody-containing fractions were neutralized, combined, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescent staining, the cells were fixed, stained, and mounted as described previously (23Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Libova I. Fassler R. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Cells were stained in various combinations with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin for F-actin (1:400 dilution), p34-Arc (1:400 dilution), or affinity purified Coro1B antibody (1:200 dilution). Images were captured using a Nipkow-type spinning disk confocal scan head (Yokogawa CSU-10) attached to an inverted microscope (model IX-81, Olympus) equipped with a ×60 1.45 NA objective, a CCD camera (model C4742-80-12AG, Hamamatsu), and controlled by AQM Advance 6 software (Kinetic Imaging, Ltd.). The extended depth of focus plugin (bigwww.epfl.ch/demo/edf/) for ImageJ was used to combine multiple images from a z-stack (8 slices, 150 nm interval) into a single in-focus image. Images were combined and annotated in Photoshop for presentation. PMA-induced Ruffling Assay—To quantify ruffling, Rat2 cells were serum-starved overnight, stimulated with 100 nm PMA, fixed at various times as indicated, and stained with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin to visualize membrane ruffles. At least 200 cells were counted for each time point. Single Cell Tracking—Tracking was performed as described previously (23Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Libova I. Fassler R. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). To increase data throughput, 10 different fields (containing ∼10-20 cells per field) were simultaneously recorded using an automated X-Y stage (Prior). To avoid bias in the analysis, every cell in each movie that met the tracking criteria (did not divide, was completely within the field of view for the entire experiment, and did not touch another cell for more than two frames) was tracked using Tracking Analysis software (Kinetic Imaging, Ltd.) with the point-click mode. Cell speed was calculated using the Tracking Analysis software and directional persistence was calculated using custom Matlab macros (a kind gift of B. Harms, MIT). Data were analyzed using PRISM (Graph-Pad, Inc.) for statistical analysis. As a first step in understanding the role of mammalian Coronins in cell motility, we used quantitative real-time PCR to compare expression patterns of the genes across mouse tissues. An advantage of this technique is the ability to quantitatively compare expression between genes, as well as across tissues. Our data indicate that the most widely expressed mammalian Coronin gene is CORONIN 1B, which is expressed at high levels across most tissues (Fig. 1B). A full characterization of mammalian Coronin gene expression using this technique will be presented elsewhere. 2L. Cai, N. Holoweckyj, and J. E. Bear, unpublished observations. To study Coronin 1B at the protein level, a polyclonal antibody was raised against the unique region and the coiled-coil region of human Coronin 1B (Fig. 1A). HEK293 cells were transient transfected with all six Coronin genes tagged with GFP at the C terminus. The different Coronins were enriched by immunoprecipitation (IP) using a GFP antibody and blotted with the affinity purified Coro1B antibody. This antibody specifically recognizes Coronin 1B and does not cross-react with the other related Coronins (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the endogenous Coronin 1B was co-immunoprecipitated (co-IP) with Coronin 1B-GFP. The endogenous protein was co-immunoprecipitated only from cells transfected with Coronin 1B-GFP and not with any of the other Coronin constructs, suggesting only homo-oligomerization had occurred. To confirm this result, we co-transfected cells with the complete set of Coronin genes tagged with GFP and Coronin 1B-Myc. Immunoprecipitation with a Myc antibody co-precipitated only Coronin 1B-GFP and none of the other Coronins (Fig. 1D). Together, these experiments strongly suggest that Coronin 1B exclusively homo-oligomerizes and does not form complexes with the other Coronins. Whereas other Coronins have been shown to homo-oligomerize via their coiled-coil motif in vivo (27Oku T. Itoh S. Ishii R. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Tsuji T. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), these data are the first to address the specificity of oligomerization between members of this protein family. To examine the localization of Coronin 1B, we used our affinity purified antibody for immunofluorescent staining and compared the localization of the endogenous protein to the GFP-tagged form in Rat2 fibroblasts (Fig. 1E). Coronin 1B is localized to the leading edge in fibroblasts, as well as weakly along actin stress fibers. The localization of the GFP-tagged form is indistinguishable from the endogenous protein. This observation, along with the co-IP experiment described above, suggests that Coronin 1B can tolerate tagging with GFP at the C terminus. In yeast, Coronin and the Arp2/3 complex biochemically and genetically interact, but this interaction has not been demonstrated in mammalian systems (6Humphries C.L. Balcer H.I. D'Agostino J.L. Winsor B. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Andrews B.J. Goode B.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To examine this interaction, we first performed immunofluorescent co-localization between Coronin 1B and p34-Arc (a component of the Arp2/3 complex). These two proteins strongly and completely co-localize at the leading edge of fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). To test for a biochemical interaction between Coronin 1B and the Arp2/3 complex, we performed a reciprocal co-IP between Coronin 1B and the p34-Arc subunit of the Arp2/3 complex. We saw a robust, reciprocal co-IP between the endogenous Coronin 1B and p34-Arc in Rat2 fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). This result was also obtained in HEK293, Swiss 3T3, and NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that this interaction is generally observed in many cell types (data not shown). Control rabbit antibodies did not IP either protein (Fig. 2, B and C). We also detected co-IP between Coronin 1B and the Arp2 and p41Arc subunits of the Arp2/3 complex (data not shown), suggesting that our results are not specific for p34-Arc, but reflect an interaction between Coronin 1B and the Arp2/3 complex. As an additional control, we were also able to show co-IP between GFP-tagged Coronin 1B and p34-Arc using GFP antibodies (Fig. 6B). We could not detect actin in the immunocomplex by blotting, but to exclude the possibility that this interaction is simply bridged through F-actin, we pretreated cells with Latrunculin B to disrupt F-actin prior to making the lysate for IP and saw no change in the interaction (data not shown).Fig. 6Ser-2 mutants affect the interaction between Coronin 1B and the Arp2/3 complex, but not subcellular localization. A, transient transfection of Ser-2 mutants into HEK293 cells. Samples were immunoprecipitated with GFP antibody and blotted with Coro1B or p34-Arc antibodies. The arrowhead indicates GFP-tagged Coronin 1B, and the arrow indicates endogenous Coronin 1B. B, lysates from Rat2 stable cell lines expressing GFP-tagged wild-type, S2A, or S2D mutant Coronin 1B blotted as indicated. C, GFP IPs of samples in B blotted as indicated. Note the lack of cross-reactivity of pSerPKC antibody with either Ser-2 mutant. D, GFP-tagged Ser-2 mutants have the same localization pattern as the wild-type Coronin 1B in Rat2 cells. Cells were stained with antibodies to p34-Arc to label Arp2/3 and phalloidin to label F-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because Coronins have been shown to be PKC substrates in vitro and in vivo (12Itoh S.

https://openalex.org/W2050669612,"Amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) are widely presumed to play a causal role in Alzheimer disease. Release of Aβ from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) requires proteolysis by the β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1). Although increased BACE1 activity in Alzheimer disease brains and human (h) BACE1 transgenic (tg) mice results in altered APP cleavage, the contribution of these molecular alterations to neurodegeneration is unclear. We therefore used the murine Thy1 promoter to express high levels of hBACE1, with or without hAPP, in neurons of tg mice. Compared with hAPP mice, hBACE1/hAPP doubly tg mice had increased levels of APP C-terminal fragments (C89, C83) and decreased levels of full-length APP and Aβ. In contrast to non-tg controls and hAPP mice, hBACE1 mice and hBACE1/hAPP mice showed degeneration of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus and degradation of myelin. Neurological deficits were also more severe in hBACE1 and hBACE1/hAPP mice than in hAPP mice. These results demonstrate that high levels of BACE1 activity are sufficient to elicit neurodegeneration and neurological decline in vivo. This pathogenic pathway involves the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments but does not depend on increased production of human Aβ. Thus, inhibiting BACE1 may block not only Aβ-dependent but also Aβ-independent pathogenic mechanisms. Amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) are widely presumed to play a causal role in Alzheimer disease.

In contrast to non-tg controls and hAPP mice, hBACE1 mice and hBACE1/hAPP mice showed degeneration of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus and degradation of myelin. Neurological deficits were also more severe in hBACE1 and hBACE1/hAPP mice than in hAPP mice. These results demonstrate that high levels of BACE1 activity are sufficient to elicit neurodegeneration and neurological decline in vivo. This pathogenic pathway involves the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments but does not depend on increased production of human Aβ. Thus, inhibiting BACE1 may block not only Aβ-dependent but also Aβ-independent pathogenic mechanisms.

However, diverse lines of evidence suggest that alterations in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the accumulation of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ), play a key role in the pathogenesis of AD (1Sinha S.

Cleavage of APP by α-secretase results in the secretion of a large N-terminal ectodomain. In an alternative pathway, β-secretase generates a shorter secreted N-terminal fragment and APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) C89 and C99, which remain membrane-bound. The latter fragments are then further cleaved by γ-secretase, resulting in the production of Aβ peptides. The β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) accounts for most of the β-secretase activity in the brain (1Sinha S. Anderson J. John V. McConlogue L. Basi G. Thorsett E. Schenk D. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

These studies have shown that expression of hBACE1 at moderate levels in hAPP tg models results in increased generation of hAPP CTFs and Aβ, which in some cases was associated with enhanced amyloid deposition. These studies have confirmed the importance of hBACE1 in APP processing in vivo. However, the relationship between high levels of hBACE1 activity, APP processing, and neurodegeneration remains to be established. To address this issue, we used the strong Thy1 promoter to express hBACE1 in neurons of tg mice, either alone or in combination with hAPP. High levels of BACE1 activity significantly increased the cerebral accumulation of hAPP CTFs, but not of Aβ, and caused prominent age-related neurodegeneration and neurological decline. Generation of hBACE1 and hBACE1/hAPP tg Mice and Tissue Processing—A cDNA encoding wild-type hBACE1 was produced by reverse transcription-PCR from human brain mRNA as described previously (23Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Song D. Shults C.W. Lang I. Masliah E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This cDNA includes a Kozak consensus sequence (GCC ACC ATG) at the 5′-end to enhance expression. The hBACE1 cDNA was inserted between exons 2 and 4 into the mThy1 expression cassette (kindly provided by Dr. H. van der Putten, Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland), purified, and microinjected into one-cell embryos (C57BL/6 × DBA/2 F1). Transgenic founder mice were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from tail biopsies. Doubly tg mice were generated by crossing heterozygous hBACE1 mice from lines 1 or 39 with the hAPP tg line 41 we described previously (23Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Song D. Shults C.W. Lang I. Masliah E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). hAPP line 41 expresses mutant hAPP751 under the direction of the mThy1 promoter and produces high levels of Aβ1–42 resulting in plaque formation by 3 months of age. All tg lines were maintained by crossing heterozygous tg mice with non-tg C57BL/6 × DBA/2 F1 breeders. All tg mice analyzed in this study were heterozygous with respect to individual transgenes, and non-tg littermates were used as controls. At different ages, mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and flush-perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline. Brains and peripheral tissues were removed and brains divided sagittally. One hemibrain was postfixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 48 h for neuropathological analysis. The other was snap frozen and stored at -70 °C for RNA and protein analyses. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) from snap frozen hemibrains or dissected brain regions (neocortex and hippocampus) and stored in formazol buffer (Molecular Research) at -20 °C. RNA was analyzed by solution hybridization ribonuclease protection assay (RPA), essentially as described previously (24Rockenstein E. McConlogue L. Tan H. Power M. Masliah E. Mucke L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28257-28267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Samples were separated on 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea Tris borate, EDTA gels, and dried gels were exposed to Kodak XAR film (Eastman Kodak). mRNA levels were quantitated from PhosphorImager readings of probe-specific signals corrected for RNA content/loading errors by normalization to β-actin signals (24Rockenstein E.

The following 32P-labeled antisense riboprobes were used to identify specific mRNAs (protected nucleotides and GenBank accession numbers): hBACE1 (nucleotides 1305–1599, accession number AF190725); mouse (m) BACE1 (1280–1574, accession number AF190726)); mAPP770 (811–1314, accession number XM_128362 of mAPP exon 6–9; and mβ-actin (480–565, accession number X03672). Western Blot Analysis of hBACE1, hAPP, APP CTFs, and Aβ—After determination of the protein content by the Lowry method, frontal cortex homogenates were loaded (15 μg of protein/lane), separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Blots were labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against hBACE1 (ProSci, Inc., Poway, CA; 1:1,000), a mouse monoclonal antibody against the N terminus of APP (22C11; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA; 1:1,000), a mouse monoclonal antibody against hAPP (8E5; Elan; 1:20,000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against C99 and C89 of APP (CT15; courtesy of Dr. Edward Koo; 1:20,000), or a mouse monoclonal antibody against Aβ (4G8; Senetek PLC, Napa, CA; 1:1,000) followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. The blots were incubated with 125I-protein A (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) and exposed to PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ) screens, or incubated with Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposed to film. Further details regarding the antibodies utilized are described in TABLE ONE. To control for variations in loading, blots were stripped and incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against actin (Chemicon; 1:500).

For this, neocortical tissues were homogenized in 98% formic acid (80% final concentration, ICN) with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 30 min at 50,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and used for highly denaturing acetic acid/urea-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Briefly, 1.0 mg (for mice without plaques) or 50 μg (for mice with plaques) of total protein (determined by the micro-Lowry assay) was loaded per lane on a 4/10/22% step gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 6 m urea and 10% acetic acid, and electrophoresed anode (+) to cathode (–) in 6.25% acetic acid running buffer overnight at 4 °C. The gel was then neutralized by five 15-min incubations in Tris/glycine transfer buffer (20% methanol), pH 8.4, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm pore size). The membrane was boiled in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS/T) for 1 h, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-Aβ antibody 266 (5.7 μg/ml) (25DeMattos R.B.

Membranes were then washed three times for 8 min in 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS/T and incubated in anti-mouse IgG/horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody for 3 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times for 8 min in TBS/T, and detection was carried out with Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Synthetic Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides (750 pg each; Biopeptide, San Diego, CA) were run as standards. Analysis of APP Metabolism and Related Pathways—Human Aβ peptides were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) as described previously (26Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The Aβ1–42 ELISA detects only Aβ1–42, whereas the Aβ1–x ELISA detects both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, as well as other forms of Aβ containing amino acids 1–28. For analysis of APP CTFs, cortex homogenates were analyzed with the Lowry method to determine protein concentration, loaded at 75 μg of protein/lane (or 25 and 50 μg/lane for J20 and I5 mice, respectively) onto 14% Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies against APP CTFs (CT15; 1:1,000), phospho (p) APP (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA; 1:1,200), or tubulin (loading control; 1:500,000). To evaluate the effects of hBACE1 expression on related pathways, Western blots were probed with antibodies against neprilysin (CD10, mouse monoclonal; Abcam, Cambridge, MA; 1:1000), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE, rabbit polyclonal; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA; 1:1,000), or Notch4 (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:1,000). Analysis of BACE1 Enzymatic Activity—BACE1 activity was determined by adapting the BACE1 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay kit (Panvera, Madison, WI), which uses a red FRET peptide derived from the Swedish (Sw) mutant APP as the substrate sequence as described previously (6Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T.

Briefly, brain homogenates from the tg mice were incubated with the BACE1 substrate, for a final concentration of 1 × for each of the reagents. Then stop buffer (containing a 2.5 m sodium acetate) was added, and the signal was determined at 545 nm with a spectrofluorometer. Control experiments were performed, and standard curves were generated using the baculovirus-expressed BACE1 and the BACE1 product standard (Rh-EVNL, a BACE1 inhibitor) provided with the kit. To confirm BACE1 activity levels by an independent method, extracted supernatants from homogenized samples were neutralized with Tris and assayed for BACE1 activity utilizing as a substrate the bacterial maltose-binding protein (MBP) fused to the C-terminal 125 amino acids of APP (MBP-APPC125) as described previously (27Roberds S.L.

Reaction mixtures were diluted 1:5, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the quenched reaction mixtures were then loaded onto 96-well plates coated with a polyclonal antibody raised to MBP. Cleaved products were detected using biotinylated Sw192 as specific reporter antibodies, and purified hBACE1 was used as a standard for both activity assays. Behavioral Analysis—Mice had free access to food and water, and all experiments were carried out during the light cycle. Experimental and control groups contained similar proportions of males and females. The water maze test was carried out as described previously (28Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Sagara Y. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Mucke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12245-12250Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pool (diameter 180 cm) was filled with opaque water (24 °C) and mice were first trained to locate a visible platform (days 1–3) and then a submerged hidden platform (days 4–7) in three daily trials 2–3 min apart. Mice that failed to find the hidden platform within 90 s were placed on it for 30 s. The same platform location was used for all sessions and all mice. The starting point at which each mouse was placed into the water was changed randomly between two alternative entry points located at a similar distance from the platform. On day 8, another visible platform trial was performed to exclude differences in motivation and fatigue. Time to reach the platform (latency), path length, and swim speed were recorded with a Noldus Instruments EthoVision video tracking system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego) set to analyze two samples/s. Immunohistochemistry—Vibratome sections (40 μm) of brain tissues were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against hBACE1 (ProSci, Inc.; 1:500) or hAPP (8E5; Elan; 1:20,000, TABLE ONE). Binding of primary antibody was detected with the Vector ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, and 0.001% H2O2. Double labeling studies were performed essentially as described previously (28Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Sagara Y. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Mucke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12245-12250Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Briefly, vibratome sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-hBACE1 (1:500) and developed with the Tyramide Signal Amplification-Direct (Red) system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 1:100). Sections were then incubated overnight with an antibody against APP CTFs (CT15; 1:100), followed by incubation with FITC-tagged secondary goat anti-rabbit (Vector; 1:75) and imaging by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM, MRC 1024, Bio-Rad). Neuropathological Analysis—Vibratome sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibodies against the neuronal dendritic marker microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2; Chemicon; 1:100), the axonal neurofilament marker SMI312 (Sternberger Immuocytochemicals, Baltimore, MD; 1:200), or the astroglial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Chemicon; 1:500) as described previously (29Mucke L.

Binding of primary antibodies was detected with the Vector Elite kit and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride/H2O2, or with FITC-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies (Vector; 1:75).

For ultrastructural analysis, blocks of neocortex and hippocampus were postfixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and 0.1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer and embedded in epoxy. Blocks were sectioned with an Ultracut E ultramicrotome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) and analyzed with a Zeiss EM10 electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) (31Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Mante M. Sisk A. Masliah E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Analyses were carried out with the StatView 5.0 program (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Differences among means were assessed by student's t test or by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's or Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests as indicated. Learning curves were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. The null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level. Expression of BACE1 in Brains of mThy1-hBACE1 tg Mice—Micro-injection of the mThy1-hBACE1 construct yielded four tg lines, three of which were selected for further analysis based on levels of hBACE1 mRNA determined by RPA. hBACE1 mRNA levels in whole hemibrains of these tg lines were 3–8-fold higher than in frontal cortex of humans without AD, with the highest levels detected in line 1 (Fig. 1, A and B). In all three lines, levels of endogenous mBACE1 were decreased by 30–50% compared with non-tg controls (F"

Here, we report a new gene designated COQ9 that is also required for the biosynthesis of this lipoid quinone. The respiratory-deficient pet mutant C92 was found to be deficient in coenzyme Q and to have low mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity, which could be restored by addition of coenzyme Q2. The mutant was used to clone COQ9, corresponding to reading frame YLR201c on chromosome XII. The respiratory defect of C92 is complemented by COQ9 and suppressed by COQ8/ ABC1. The latter gene has been shown to be required for coenzyme Q biosynthesis in yeast and bacteria. Suppression by COQ8/ABC1 of C92, but not other coq9 mutants tested, has been related to an increase in the mitochondrial concentration of several enzymes of the pathway. Coq9p may either catalyze a reaction in the coenzyme Q biosynthetic pathway or have a regulatory role similar to that proposed for Coq8p.

This may indicate that 1) most intermediates of the pathway are unstable and degraded; 2) the pathway is highly regulated; or 3) the enzymes are organized in a complex, which is highly sensitive to mutations in any one of its components.

This gene is defined by complementation group G61 of our pet mutant collection (1Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been named COQ9.

Open table in a new tab Cloning of COQ9 and COQ8 —Recombinant plasmids containing COQ9 (pG61/T2) and COQ8/ABC1 (pG61/T3) were isolated by transformation of C92/UL1 with a yeast genomic library consisting of partial Sau3A fragments of yeast nuclear DNA cloned in the yeast/Escherichia coli shuttle plasmid YEp24 (18Botstein D. Davis R.W. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 607-636Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 108 cells were transformed with 50 μg of the library DNA by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (19Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar).Disruption of COQ9 —The linear KpnI fragment containing COQ9 was transferred to YEp352K. This plasmid is identical to YEp352 (20Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) except that it has only the KpnI site of the multiple cloning sequence. This construct was linearized at the SacI site inside the COQ9 coding sequence and ligated to a 1-kb SacI fragment containing the yeast URA3 gene. The linear KpnI fragment with the disrupted allele was substituted for the wild-type gene in strain W303 by the one-step gene replacement procedure (21Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar).Construction of Hybrid Genes Expressing Coq9p Tagged with Hemagglutinin (HA) and Coq8p Tagged with Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) at Their C Termini, Respectively—The COQ9 coding sequence plus 359 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region was amplified with primers 5′-ggcggatccgggaggccatgcccaactttc and 5′-ggcaagctttcaagcgtagtctgggacgtcgtatgggtaccctcctccacccctaactaattgagatttg. The product was digested with a combination of BamHI and HindIII and cloned in YIp351 (20Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), yielding pG61/ST8. Following linearization at the ClaI site of the LEU2 gene, the plasmid was used to transform the W303ΔCOQ9 mutant containing the disrupted coq9 allele. Insertion of the plasmid into the chromosomal leu2 locus of the mutant yielded leucine-independent and respiratory-competent transformants (W303ΔCOQ9/ST8).Similarly, COQ8 was amplified with primers 5′-ggctctagactcaatcgcatccccgtaaacg and 5′-ggcctgcag-aactttataggcaaaaatctc. The resultant 2-kb product containing 446 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region and the entire coding sequence minus the termination codon was digested with a combination of XbaI and PstI and cloned in YIp352-GST. (This plasmid was made by cloning the sequence coding for glutathione reductase into YIp352 (20Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar).) The plasmid obtained from this ligation (pG75/ST3) contained COQ8 fused in-frame to the GST sequence at the 3′-end of the gene. pG75/ST3 was linearized at the NcoI site in the URA3 gene of the plasmid and targeted (21Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) to the ura3 allele in the chromosomal DNA of aW303ΔCOQ8. The resultant strain (aW303ΔCOQ8/ST3) was respiratory-competent, indicating that the presence of the GST tag does not interfere with the activity of the protein.Lipid Extraction and Reverse-phase HPLC with Electrochemical Detection—Lipid extracts were prepared from 1 mg of mitochondrial protein in 350 μl of water in borosilicate centrifuge tubes (50 ml, polytetrafluoroethylene-lined caps). Coenzymes Q4 and Q6 were obtained from Sigma. Coenzyme Q4 (750 ng in 25.9 μl of ethanol) was added to provide an internal standard; glass beads (1 g) were added; and the sample was vortexed for 2 min. Methanol (9 ml) and petroleum ether (6 ml) were added, the sample was vortexed 30 s and then incubated on a rotary shaker for 12–16 h in the dark (4 °C, 220 rpm). Following centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min, the upper organic layer was transferred to a 10-ml glass tube and dried under a stream of N2. The remaining pellet and lower phase were re-extracted by vortexing two additional times with 4 ml of petroleum ether for 30 s and shaking at 220 rpm for 1 h in the dark at 4 °C. The organic phases obtained by centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min were pooled and dried under N2, and the lipid residue was resuspended in 300 μl of 9:1 (v/v) methanol/ethanol. Aliquots of 10 μl were injected with a Gilson Model 234 autosampler (samples maintained at 6 °C) and separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a BetaBasic 18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, Thermo Electron Corp.) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with 98:2 methanol/water and 10 mm lithium perchlorate. Quinones were quantified with a Coulochem II electrochemical detector (ESA Biosciences, Inc.), a pre-column electrode (E, +700 mV), a 5010 analytical cell with two electrons (E1, –700 mV; and E2, +650 mV), and Gilson Unipoint Version 1.71 software by measuring the area under the peaks with coenzyme Q4 and Q6 standards. Three-point external standard curves were created for coenzymes Q4 (168.7, 84.4, and 21.1 ng) and Q6 (123.2, 61.6, and 15.4 ng). Each sample and standard were injected three times, and the peak areas were calculated to obtain the mean ± S.D. The amount of coenzyme Q6 was corrected for recovery of the coenzyme Q4 internal standard.Labeling, Lipid Extraction, and HPLC Separation of Yeast Whole Cell Extracts—These procedures were modified from those described previously (13Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Yeast cells (4–6 g, wet weight) were collected after overnight growth in 600 ml of minimal medium (2% galactose and 0.1% dextrose) containing 6.34 μCi of 4-[U-14C]hydroxybenzoic acid (450 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. St. Louis, MO). Lipid extracts of cell pellets were prepared as described (13Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), dried completely under N2 gas, and stored at –20 °C. The dried lipids were resuspended in 50 μl of 100% acetonitrile and vortexed vigorously, and the tubes were centrifuged briefly to remove a small amount of a white precipitate. The clear supernatant (25 μl) was injected into an HPLC system as described (13Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A reversephase BetaBasic column (2.1 × 100 mm, Thermo Electron Corp.) was developed with a gradient of solvent A (50:50 acetonitrile/H2O and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (99:1 acetonitrile/H2O and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 400 μl/min. At the time of injection, solvent A/B was 50:50; and at 2 min, the percentage of solvent B was altered linearly so that solvent B was 100% at 9 min and remained at 100% until 25 min. The retention time for coenzyme Q6 measured at 272 nm was 22 min, with a delay time of 0.37 min due to the fraction collector. Fractions were collected every minute, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting in 10 ml of ScintiVerse (Fisher).Miscellaneous Methods—Standard methods were used for plasmid manipulations (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and DNA sequencing (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52357) Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondria were prepared by the method of Faye et al. (24Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) except that Zymolyase 20T (MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) instead of Glusulase was used to obtain spheroplasts. Spectral analyses of mitochondrial cytochromes and measurements of respiratory enzymes were performed as described previously (25Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSPhenotype of coq9 Mutants—C92 is one of seven independent isolates assigned to complementation group G61 of a pet mutant collection (1Tzagoloff A.

The respiratory deficiency of G61 mutants stems from recessive mutations in a nuclear gene, as they are complemented by a ρ0 strain with a normal complement of nuclear genes but lacking mitochondrial DNA.The spectra of mitochondria from C92 indicated reduced concentrations of cytochromes b and a (Fig. 1). This is also evident from the NADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome oxidase activities of the mitochondria, both of which were reduced in the mutants (Table II). The NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity in the mutant was <10% of that measured in the wild-type strain, even though the presence of cytochrome b in the spectrum of the mutant mitochondria indicated a substantial amount of the cytochrome bc1 complex. This phenotype could be explained by a defect in NADH dehydrogenase, the cytochrome bc1 complex, or coenzyme Q6, all of which participate in the reduction of cytochrome c. The restoration of NADH-cytochrome c reductase by addition of exogenous coenzyme Q2 (Table II) excluded a defect in either NADH dehydrogenase or the cytochrome bc1 complex; rather, it pointed to a deficiency in coenzyme Q as the explanation for the respiratory defect.Table IINADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome oxidase activities of mitochondriaStrainNADH-cytochrome c reductaseCytochrome oxidase-Coenzyme Q2+Coenzyme Q2μmol cytochrome c oxidized or reduced per min/mg proteinW303-1A2.15 ± 0.082.21 ± 0.072.23 ± 0.07C920.21 ± 0.021.90 ± 0.050.51 ± 0.04aW303ΔCOQ90.14 ± 0.011.67 ± 0.020.87 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab This was further tested by analyzing the coenzyme Q6 content of mitochondria from the wild-type and mutant strains. Lipid extracts of mitochondria were separated by reversephase chromatography on a C18 column. On this column, coenzyme Q6 eluted as a symmetric peak at 15.7 min. The coenzyme Q6 content of mitochondria from the wild-type W303-1A strain was determined to be 3.33 μg/mg of protein (Fig. 2A). No coenzyme Q6 peak was detected in similar extracts from the point mutant C92 or the coq9 null mutant aW303ΔCOQ9 (see below). The absence of coenzyme Q6 in C92 and aW303ΔCOQ9 is consistent with the requirement of exogenous coenzyme Q2 for the NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity of their mitochondria (Table II).Fig. 2Assays of coenzyme Q6 in wild-type and mutant mitochondria. A, mitochondria were prepared from the wild-type strain W303-1A, the coq9 null mutant aW303ΔCOQ9, the point mutant C92, and the C92 point mutant harboring COQ8/ABC1 on a multicopy plasmid (C92/UL1/T3). Lipid extracts were obtained from 1 mg of mitochondria and mixed with coenzyme Q4 (750 ng) as an internal standard prior to extraction, and one-thirtieth of the extract was analyzed by HPLC/electrochemical detector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The elution of coenzymes Q4 and Q6 and demethoxy-coenzyme Q4 (DMQ6) is indicated.

The wild-type strain incorporated the precursor mainly into coenzyme Q6, although some of the label was also present in a polar material eluting at 16 min. This radiolabeled compound was presumed to be HHB based on our previous characterization of lipid extracts from cells labeled under these conditions (13Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In that study, HHB was identified by purification, chemical derivation, and confirmation of its structure by mass spectrometry analyses. HHB is an early intermediate in coenzyme Q biosynthesis and has been shown to be a predominant intermediate in wild-type yeast (13Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, there was no detectable radioactivity at the position of coenzyme Q6 in the coq9 mutant, and the elution of radiolabeled material at 16 min is consistent with the presence of HHB, indicating that the lesion occurs after the prenylation step (Fig. 2B).Cloning of COQ9 —C92/UL1, a derivative of C92 with the leu2 and ura3 markers, was transformed with a yeast genomic plasmid library. Restriction analysis of the nuclear DNA inserts in plasmids isolated from respiratory-competent transformants indicated three distinct and non-overlapping regions of DNA. The genes responsible for conferring respiration in C92/UL1 were identified by testing the ability of different regions of the cloned nuclear DNA inserts to restore the ability of the mutant to grow on glycerol. The results of the subcloning indicated that rescue of the mutant by the plasmid designated pG61/T2 depended on the unknown reading frame YLR201c (Fig. 3), whereas in pG61/T3, the gene responsible for conferring respiration is COQ8/ABC1 (8Do T.Q.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2023-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Complementation tests with subclones from the third plasmid, pG61/T4, identified the multicopy suppressor as DTD1 (data not shown), the gene for d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase (27Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which was previously shown to counter the suppressor activity of sup45-2 in yeast (28Benko A.L. Vaduva G. Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which DTD1 rescues the coq9 mutant has not been further studied. Two other mutants from complementation group G61 (E40 and E270) were also tested and found to be complemented by YLR201c. However, the respiratory deficiencies of E40 and E270 were not rescued by either COQ8/ABC1 or pG61/T4 (Fig. 4). The ability of C92/UL1 to grow normally on non-fermentable substrates when transformed with YLR201c and the lack of complementation of C92/UL1 by W303ΔCOQ9, a mutant carrying a deletion of YLR201c, strongly suggest that the restoration of respiration by this gene is due to complementation. In contrast to YLR201c, COQ8/ABC1 was ascertained to be a suppressor based on its specificity for only one of the three mutant alleles tested and complementation of C92 and W303ΔCOQ9 by a coq8/abc1 mutant. These observations imply that the growth defect of C92 and other G61 mutants stems from mutations in reading frame YLR201c. This reading frame has been named COQ9 in keeping with the earlier convention for naming genes involved in coenzyme Q biosynthesis in yeast (1Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 3Restriction maps of the nuclear DNA inserts in pG61/T2 and pG61/T3. E, EcoRI; B, BamHI; G, BglII; K, KpnI; S, SacI; H, HindIII; X, XbaI.

However, much less is known about the role of the IR in α-cells. To assess the role of the IR in glucagon and insulin secretion, we engineered adeno-viruses for high efficiency small interference RNA (siRNA)-IR expression in isolated mouse pancreatic islets and lentiviruses for siRNA-IR expression in pancreatic α- and β-cell lines (α-TC6 and MIN6) with specific, long term stable IR knockdown. Western blot analysis showed that these strategies resulted in 60-80% reduction of IR protein in islets and α- and β-cell lines. Cell growth was reduced by 35-50% in α-TC and MIN6 cells stably expressing siRNA-IR, respectively. Importantly, glucagon secretion, in response to glucose (25 to 2.8 mm), was completely abolished in islets expressing siRNA-IR, whereas secretion increased 1.7-fold in islets expressing control siRNA. In contrast, there was no difference in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion when comparing siRNA-IR and siRNA control, with both groups showing a 1.7-fold increase. Islet glucagon and insulin content were also unaffected by IR knockdown. To further explore the role of the IR, siRNA-IR was stably expressed in pancreatic cell lines, which dramatically suppressed glucose-regulated glucagon secretion in α-TC6 cells (3.4-fold) but did not affect GSIS in MIN6 cells. Defects in siRNA-IR-expressing α-cells were associated with an alteration in the activity of Akt and p70S6K where insulin-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase B/AKt was greatly reduced while p70S6K activation was enhanced, suggesting that the related pathways play important roles in α cell function.

This study provides direct evidence that appropriate expression of the IR in α-cells is required for glucose-dependent glucagon secretion. The pathology of diabetes involves a combination of insulin resistance, defects in pancreatic β-cell function and mass, and serious abnormalities in glucagon secretion (1Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S.

The β-cell is the predominant cell type in the pancreatic islet (∼70%) and plays an essential role in glucose homeostasis through its secretion of insulin in response to nutrients (3Baetens D. Malaisse-Lagae F. Perrelet A. Orci L. Science. 1979; 206: 1323-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).

Ablation of IR, IGF-IR, and their main substrates (i.e. IRS1 and IRS2) impairs β-cell function, suggesting that insulin signaling is involved in insulin secretion and β-cell compensation in response to insulin resistance (4Kitamura T.

Pancreatic α-cells, which constitute ∼20% of the islet, release glucagon to stimulate the production of glucose from the liver when blood glucose is low (3Baetens D. Malaisse-Lagae F. Perrelet A. Orci L. Science. 1979; 206: 1323-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the liver, glucagon binds to its receptor and activates signal transduction networks and transcription factors, leading to fine regulation of glucose homeostasis through enhanced synthesis and mobilization of glucose (9Gerich J. Cryer P. Rizza R. Metabolism. 1980; 29: 1164-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Poor regulation of glucagon secretion and biosynthesis is often found in patients with diabetes (type 1 and advanced type 2) and pancreatic tumors (glucagonoma) (10Segel S.A. Paramore D.S. Cryer P.E. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11Bolli G. de Feo P. Compagnucci P. Cartechini M.G. Angeletti G. Santeusanio F. Brunetti P. Gerich J.E.

Diabetic patients often display elevated levels of circulating glucagon despite hyperglycemia and become unresponsive to the stimulation of glucagon release by low glucose, suggesting that α-cell dysfunction occurs during the pathogenesis of diabetes (13Gerich J.E.

Nature. 1989; 341: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this functional defect is unknown but involves selective failure in cell signaling by glucose, because the glucagon secretory response to other stimuli, such as amino acid administration, remains intact (17Caprio S. Tamborlane W.V. Zych K. Gerow K. Sherwin R.S. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions, glucose stimulates insulin secretion from β-cells but suppresses the release of glucagon from α-cells in pancreatic islets. In addition, the islet microcirculation flows from β-cells to α-cells (18Samols E. Stagner J.I. Ewart R.B. Marks V. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, substances released from the neighboring β-cells, such as insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide, Zn2+, ATP, γ-aminobutyric acid, and possibly glutamate may suppress glucagon secretion (15Wendt A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Among all these molecules, insulin is one of the most prominent, based on supporting reports from islet perfusion and in vivo studies (20Raskin P. Fujita Y. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1132-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Asplin C.M. Paquette T.L. Palmer J.P. J. Clin.

Recent evidence suggests that islets require insulin prior to responding to glucose deprivation by releasing glucagon (23Hope K.M. Tran P.O. Zhou H. Oseid E. LeRoy E. Robertson R.P.

However, little is known about the mechanism of insulin action or its signaling effects on glucagon secretion from α-cells. In the present study, to more clearly define the role of the insulin/IR-signaling pathway in the α-cell, we suppressed insulin signaling by IR silencing through a siRNA strategy. It was found that appropriate expression of the IR in isolated islets and clonal α-cells was required for glucose-regulated glucagon secretion. We also found that the IR may play an important role in α-cell growth. Interestingly, the biological changes in α-cells with suppressed insulin action were associated with an alteration in the activity of important multiple signaling kinases, including Akt and p70S6K. This implies that not only the IR-PI3K-Akt pathway but also other pathways, especially the nutrient-related mTOR-signaling pathway, modulate α-cell function. This study reveals the importance of the IR in α-cell function and suggests that the insulin-related pathway in the α-cell could be a potential target for controlling glucagon secretion and glucose counter-regulation. Reagents—Antibodies against IRβ and p70S6K were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Akt, phospho-Akt (Thr-308), AMPK, phospho-AMPK-α (Thr-172), p70S6K, and phospho-p70S6K (Thr-389) antibodies and cell lysis buffer (10×) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).

To achieve consistent glucose-dependent glucagon secretion, the α-TC6 cells with compact oval morphology and not broad flattened morphology were assayed. In addition, for the secretion assay, a 70-80% confluence was maintained, and the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, catalog no. 12430-054, Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) containing 25 mm glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air). Pancreatic Islet Isolation and Islet Dispersion—Pancreatic islets were isolated as described previously (30Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Saleh M.C. Sivitz W.I. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B.

The pancreas was then cut into 2-mm pieces and digested for 15-20 min at 37 °C. Islets were partially isolated by sedimentation, hand-picked from the acinar tissue debris, and then transferred into RPMI islet culture medium containing 20 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 20 g/ml streptomycin sulfate, 5.6 mm glucose, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Islet culture was carried out at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To obtain isolated single cells, islets were dispersed with 0.25% trypsin for 30 min with gentle mixing every 5 min, as described previously (29Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C.

Cells were then washed with culture medium and plated onto glass coverslips for fluorescence microscopy. Construction of siRNA Expression Vectors—Expression of hairpin siRNA was based on pSUPER vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) with H1 promoter (32Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.

Briefly, 19-nucleotide sequences for targeting specific genes were designed based on the siRNA program provided by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Then the 64-oligonucleotides for hairpin siRNA were designed containing sense and anti-sense targeting sequences with loop (TTCAAGAGA) in the middle and BglII/HindII overhangs (Fig. 1A). The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, annealed, and ligated into BglII/HindIII-linearized pSUPER. The hairpin siRNA expression cassettes from pSUPER plasmids were cloned into adenoviral vector ADLOX.HTM and lentiviral vector pHR′-EF-GW-SIN through XbaI/KpnI and EcoRI/SalI sites, respectively (Fig. 1A). The target sense sequences were: ACACAACCTCACCATCACT (GI: 6754359) (siRNA-IR-1) and AGATGACAACGAGGAATGT (GI: 6754359) (siRNA-IR-2) for insulin receptor (IR). A control sequence (GAAGAAGTCGTGCTGCTTCAT) was designed based on the sequence of an enhanced green fluorescence protein gene (pEGFP-N1, GI: 1377911) with two nucleotides missing (underlined letters). Another control vector containing a hairpin siRNA expression cassette without target sequence was also used. Adenovirus Preparation—Adenoviruses (vector ADLOX.HTM) used in these studies are described elsewhere (33MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Adenovirus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein driven by a CMV promoter (AdEGFP) has been reported before (29Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C. Marban E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Generally, viral production was generated by transfection of CRE8 with the expressing constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and the manufacturer's suggested method, followed by infection of the cells with helper virus (ψ5) (34Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then, the crude adenoviruses were propagated by re-infection of CRE8 cells. Preparation of purified adenovirus with high titer was performed by standard CsCl gradient centrifugations. Viral titers were determined by the end-point titration method (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Lentivirus Preparation—The lentiviral transfer and packaging vectors were a generous gift from Dr. J. Medin (Ontario Research Institute, Toronto, Canada) (35Yoshimitsu M. Sato T. Tao K. Walia J.S. Rasaiah V.I. Sleep G.T. Murray G.J. Poeppl A.G. Underwood J. West L. Brady R.O. Medin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16909-16914Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Lentivirus production was conducted by cotransfection of HEK293T cells with three plasmids, i.e. a packaging-defective helper construct (pCMV-ΔR8.91, 4 μg), a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein envelop-coding construct (pMD.G, 0.4 μg), and a transfer vector (pHR′EF-GW-SIN, 3.2 μg) harboring a specific hairpin siRNA sequence under control of the H1 RNA polymerase III promoter. A control vector (pHR′EF-GW-SIN, without insertion of the hairpin siRNA expression cassettes) expressing EGFP was also used in this study. Transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine 2000 and the manufacturer's suggested method. At 48 h, supernatants containing the lentiviral recombinants were harvested and centrifuged twice or passed through 45-μm filters to eliminate transfer of cells. The viruses obtained were either used directly for cell infection or stored at -80 °C. Viral titers were assessed by transducing 293T cells with the control GFP-expressing virus and measuring the percentage of EGFP-positive cells. Viral Infections—For islets, adenovirus infection was carried out on the same day as isolation. Briefly, freshly isolated islets were plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates, 50-100 islets/plate, with 2 ml of RPMI islet culture medium containing 5.6 mm glucose for 1-2 h at 37 °C. Purified adenovirus was then incubated with islets at 1010 virus particles/ml overnight at 37 °C. The next day, islets were transferred to new plates, washed twice, and further cultured at 37 °C with medium changed on a daily basis. At 72 h, islets were assayed as specified elsewhere. For generating stable cell lines expressing siRNA, MIN6 and α-TC6 cells were infected with lentiviruses. Cells were plated 16 h prior to viral infection, and then incubated with lentivirus in the present of protamine sulfate (4 μg/ml) for overnight. Cells were kept in culture for at least 1 week before performing any functional experiments. The amount of the siRNA lentivirus used was roughly calculated using a control lentivirus expressing GFP. Normally, the transduction of MIN6 and α-TC6 cells by control GFP lentivirus resulted in 50-60% of the cells expressing GFP initially (48-72 h post-infection). Approximately 7 days later, over 90% of cells were GFP-positive. In some cases, the cells were re-infected to maintain a high efficiency of transduction. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Islets and cells were mounted on slides in a fading retarder solution (0.1% p-phenylenediamine in glycerol). Laser confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis was performed, and images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-410 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Cell Viability Assay—Cell proliferation and viability were measured by an XTT-based colorimetric assay (Cell Proliferation Kit II (XTT), Roche Applied Science). For cultured cell lines, cells were seeded into three 96-well plates starting with concentrations of 5 × 104 cells per well followed by serial dilutions on the plate to evaluate cell growth at different starting concentrations. One plate was subjected to an XTT assay at days 0, 2, or 4. For islets, cell viability was measured using 10-20 islets per sample 72 h post-infection. Generally, 150 or 200 μl of the XTT medium was applied to cell or islet samples for 4- or 6-h incubation at 37 °C, respectively. The XTT assay results were detected by spectrophotometric absorbance at 490 nm (A490). Islet Secretion Assay—Islet secretion experiments were designed to optimize glucagon secretion, based on the concept reported by Hope et al. (23Hope K.M. Tran P.O. Zhou H. Oseid E. LeRoy E. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At 72-h post-islet isolation and viral infection, islets were used in secretion assays using Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) containing 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2,10mm HEPES, and 2% bovine serum albumin. Islets were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in KRB supplemented with 5.6 mm glucose and then transferred to 1.5-ml tubes for assay (10-20 islets per sample). The islets were first incubated in 500 μl of KRB with 25 mm glucose for 1 h at 37 °C, and then in 500 μl of KRB with 2.7 mm glucose for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. Aliquots (450 μl) from each sample were taken at the end of the incubation period and stored at -20 °C until assayed for glucagon and insulin. After the secretion assay, islets were washed with RPMI medium, and cell viability was measured with the XTT assay. At the end of the XTT assay, islet protein was extracted in 75% ethanol containing 0.09 n HCl and then vacuum dried. Insulin and glucagon were then extracted from the protein pellet by adding H2O and heating to 60 °C for 10 min. Samples were stored at -20 °C before being assayed for total DNA (micrograms as measured by A260), insulin, and glucagon content. Insulin content was measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA) described previously (36Brubaker P.L. Lee Y.C. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20728-20733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucagon content was measured using an RIA kit (Linco Research, Inc.). Cell Secretion Assays—To measure glucagon secretion, α-TC6 cells were plated in 24-well culture plates at 3 × 105 cells/well. The following day, cells were washed twice and preincubated in KRB with 25 mm glucose for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 500 μl of KRB containing either 25 mm glucose or 2.8 mm glucose for 1 h at 37 °C. Aliquots (450 μl) from each treatment were taken at the end and stored at -20 °C until assayed for glucagon by RIA. Following the secretion assay, cells were collected for the measurement of total glucagon content by RIA and total DNA by A260. Secretion data from the assays were normalized by the total glucagon content. For the insulin secretion measurements, MIN6 cells were plated in 24-well culture plates at 2-5 × 105 cells/well overnight. Cells were then washed twice and preincubated in KRB containing 2.8 mm glucose for 30 min at 37 °C. After the preincubation period, cells were washed thoroughly with KRB and incubated with 500 μl of KRB supplemented with glucose at 2.8 mm or 25 mm for 1 h at 37°C. Aliquots (450 μl) were taken at the end of the incubation period and stored at -20 °C until assayed. Western Blot Analysis of Protein Expression—For extraction of total protein, cell or islet samples were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). Protein samples were mixed with electrophoresis sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immun-Blot PVDF Membrane, BioRad), incubated with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, and then probed with specific primary antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies that had been conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and ECL (Roche Applied Science). Band density was measured by densitometry, analyzed by using image analysis software (Scion Image version 4.02, Scion, Frederick, MD), and normalized to β-actin content in parallel samples. Kinase Activation Assays—MIN6 and α-TC6 cells were serum-starved for 6 h or overnight in DMEM containing 0.05% FBS with 0 mm or 5.6 mm of glucose and subsequently stimulated in medium containing 25 mm of glucose with 10% FBS or 100 nm insulin for 15 min. Cell lysates were prepared as described above for Western blot analysis. Protein Phosphorylation Profiling—α-TC6 cells stably expressing siRNA-IR and siRNA control were serum-starved for overnight in DMEM containing 0.05% FBS with 5.6 mm of glucose and subsequently stimulated in medium containing 25 mm of glucose with 100 nm insulin for 15 min. Whole cell proteins were extracted using lysis buffer provided by Kinexus Bioinformatics (Vancouver, Canada). Kinetworks KPSS-4.1 analysis was performed to track 41 phosphorylation sites in phosphoproteins with antibodies that recognize phosphorylated epitopes (Kinexus Bioinformatics). Statistical Analysis—Data points represent means ± S.E. One-way or two-way analysis of variance tests were used to compare control values and treated groups. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effectiveness of siRNA Transfer Using Adenoviral and Lentiviral Vectors—An adenovirus was used to achieve high efficiency siRNA expression in isolated islets. To verify the efficiency of viral transduction, a GFP-expressing adenovirus (ADLOX.HTM, the same vector for generating siRNA in this study) was used to infect islets isolated from CD-1 mice, employing the same protocol used for other islet experiments in this study. Intact islets were examined for GFP protein expression by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Sections 4.3-8 μm thick (whole islet thickness, 110-250 μm) revealed that most of the cells in the outer layer of the islet expressed GFP (at least 95%, Fig. 1B). This indicates that the outer layer of the islet, where most of the α-cells are located, can be efficiently infected by adenovirus. Greater than 50% of the cells from dispersed islet cells examined under fluorescence microscopy expressed GFP, amounting to an average adenoviral infection of 70-80% in isolated islets. To achieve stable expression of siRNA in cultured cell lines, a lentivirus vector was used to transduce MIN6 and α-TC6 cells. The efficiency of viral transduction was evaluated by a control virus expressing GFP (i.e. the same amount of virus with the same viral vector was used to infect cells to generate stable cell lines and the same cell passage). Expression of GFP in the control cell lines was consistently monitored by imaging. The effectiveness of the knockdown in stable cell lines was also confirmed by Western blot analysis using cells 6-9 passages post-infection (2-3 weeks) (Fig. 2). In all functional experiments, control and siRNA-IR cell lines from the same passages were used. Virus-mediated Specific RNA Interference Silencing in Isolated Mouse Islets and in Cultured Cells—Based on results from cultured cells, significant IR knockdown by siRNA-IR infection was seen as earl"
https://openalex.org/W2026132650,"Filamin A (FLNa) cross-links actin filaments (F-actin) into three-dimensional gels in cells, attaches F-actin to membrane proteins, and is a scaffold that collects numerous and diverse proteins. We report that Ca2+-calmodulin binds the actin-binding domain (ABD) of FLNa and dissociates FLNa from F-actin, thereby dissolving FLNa·F-actin gels. The FLNa ABD has two calponin homology domains (CH1 and CH2) separated by a linker. Recombinant CH1 but neither FLNa nor its ABD binds Ca2+-calmodulin in the absence of F-actin. Extending recombinant CH1 to include the negatively charged region linker domain makes it, like full-length FLNa, unable to bind Ca2+-calmodulin. Ca2+-calmodulin does, however, dissociate the FLNa ABD from F-actin provided that the CH2 domain is present. These findings identify the first evidence for direct regulation of FLNa, implicating a mechanism whereby Ca2+-calmodulin selectively targets the FLNa·F-actin complex.

Filamin A (FLNa) 2The abbreviations used are: FLNa, filamin A; ABD, actin-binding domain; ABS, actin-binding site; CaM, calmodulin; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; CH, calponin homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; N-ABD, N-terminal actin-binding domain; C-ABD, C-terminal actin-binding domain. is the dominant mammalian nonmuscle isoform of a widely distributed family of actin-binding proteins. FLNa, originally named “actin-binding protein” or ABP-280, is the most potent actin filament (F-actin) cross-linking protein known, and its power resides in its ability to promote perpendicular branching of actin filaments into three-dimensional gelled networks. The physiological relevance of this actin gelation property of FLNa is manifest by the surface instability and the lack of translational locomotion capacity of cells lacking the protein. FLNa is also a scaffold for numerous binding partners that include transmembrane proteins, components of intracellular signal transduction pathways, and other cellular constituents (1Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 2Feng Y. Walsh C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The structural requirements for actin cross-linking by FLNa include dimerization at the C terminus of its subunits and a stretch of 278 amino acids designated the actin-binding domain (ABD) at the N-terminal of each dimeric subunit. The potency of the FLNa F-actin cross-linking activity resides in the large size (280 kDa) of the subunits composed of a string of 24 β-pleated sheet repeats, because much higher concentrations of other dimeric F-actin cross-linking proteins with nearly identical ABDs and binding affinities for F-actin are necessary to create gels of actin filaments of identical length. Although regulation of FLNa dimerization, the ABD, or the structure of the intervening β-sheet repeats could affect cross-linking of the F-actin of FLNa, purified FLNa constitutively cross-links actin filaments in vitro, and no direct regulation of this activity has emerged in 30 years of research on this protein. Therefore, the working hypothesis for cellular control of actin cross-linking by FLNa has been that FLNa binding partners such as Rac, Rho, Cdc42, and other signaling components produce linear actin assembly on the FLNa template that orients the filaments formed into a three-dimensional cross-linked gel. Actin filament-severing proteins such as members of the gelsolin and actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin family could dismantle such actin networks (3Silacci P. Mazzolai L. Gauci C. Stergiopulos N. Yin H.L. Hayoz D. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2004; 61: 2614-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Desmarais V. Ghosh M. Eddy R. Condeelis J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, although plausible, this mechanism does not explain why a large fraction of cellular FLNa is free of F-actin in vivo. In this paper we present the first evidence for a direct regulation of the FLNa·F-actin interaction by the ubiquitous abundant calcium-binding protein, calmodulin (CaM). Proteins—Rabbit skeletal actin and human recombinant FLNa were prepared as described previously (5Nakamura F. Osborn E. Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9148-9154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HA-CaM was expressed and purified as described (6Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recombinant CaM was cloned from an IMAGE human cDNA clone (source identifier 4801400) into pET-23a(+) (EMB Biosciences, Inc.), expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and purified as described (7Hayashi N. Matsubara M. Takasaki A. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Bovine CaM was purchased from Sigma (catalog number P1431). Fragments of human FLNa were cloned by PCR and expressed as GST·His6 or maltose-binding protein·His6-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli using a modified pGEX-4T1-HT(a, b, or c) or pMALc-HT(a, b, or c) plasmid, respectively. The pGEX-4T1-HT(a, b, or c) were made by inserting the BglII/NotI fragment of a PCR product amplified from pFASTBAC-HT(a, b, or c) (Invitrogen) with two primers, 5′-GAAGATCTATGTCGTACTACCATCAC-3′ and 5′-CTAGTACTTCTCGACAAGCTTGG-3′, into BamHI/NotI sites of pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). The pMALc-HT(a, b, or c) were made using similar procedures but inserted into BamHI/XbaI sites of pMALc (New England BioLabs). An acidic sequence of FLNa, 156DEEEDEE162, was deleted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The fusion proteins were affinity purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow, Amylose resin or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose. For some experiments, the tags were cleaved with His6·tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease at room temperature for 1 h. GST·His6 tag, maltose-binding protein·His6 tag, and His6·TEV were removed by passing the solution supplemented with 3 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm imidazole through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column. The flow-through fractions were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 (Millipore) and applied onto a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4. The highly purified proteins were stored at 4 °C. Antibodies—Anti-FLNa monoclonal antibodies were prepared by hybridoma techniques. Approximately 15–20 μg of purified recombinant Homo sapiens FLNa proteins, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, were mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected intraperitoneally to BALB/c mice. The spleen of the immunized mouse was macerated, and the spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma Sp20 cells in the presence of a Hybrimax polyethylene glycol solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The fused cells were plated onto 96-well plates and cultured in Optimum medium. The standard hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine selection procedure was applied to select the hybridoma clones. After 10 days, hybridoma supernatants were tested for reactivity with recombinant H. sapiens FLNa by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To further select antibodies, the media were also tested by immunoblotting and immunostaining. Cells from the positive wells were cloned at least three times by limiting dilution and adapted to the serum-free medium Hybridoma-SFM (Invitrogen). The antibody subtypes were determined using a kit (Roche Applied Science). Monoclonal IgG or IgM antibodies were purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant by GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or KAP-TIV-M (Genomics One International, Buffalo, NY) affinity chromatography. Anti-HA mouse mAb (clone 12CA), anti-GST rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma), goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) were used for immunoblotting. Actin Filament Sedimentation Assay—Purified FLNa or FLNa fragments were mixed with or without CaM and G-actin (5 or 10 μm) in solution F (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) with 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA for 1 h at 25°C. The actin filaments were then sedimented by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 20 min at 25 °C. Proteins in the supernatants and pellets were then solubilized in SDS gel sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Polypeptides in the gel were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining or immunoblotting. Measurements of Apparent Viscosity and Gelation—Apparent viscosity and gelation were determined using a miniature falling ball viscometer as described previously (5Nakamura F. Osborn E. Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9148-9154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HA-Calmodulin Blot Overlay Assay—A CaM overlay assay was performed in the presence of either 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA as described by Szymanska et al. with slight modifications (6Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Purified FLNa or FLNa constructs (2 pmol) were spotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 3% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Tween 20). In some experiments, the blots were soaked in methanol/acetic acid/water (50:10:40) (v/v) for 10 s followed by methanol for 10 s to denature proteins. The membranes were then rinsed with water before blocking. The blots were probed with 5 μg/ml HA-CaM in TTBS for 1 h. The blot was washed three times (10 min/wash) with TBST, and bound HA-CaM was detected with an anti-HA mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. HA-Calmodulin Pull-down Assay—FLNa or GST·FLNa fragments (0.1 μm) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 20 μl (50% slurry) of CaM-agarose (Sigma) or 0.2 μm HA-CaM in 200 μl of TTBS in the presence of either 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA, and then 20 μl (50% slurry) of anti-HA mAb-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was added. After 1 h, the slurry was centrifuged and washed four times with TTBS containing either CaCl2 or EGTA. The polypeptides bound to the beads were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Measurements of Affinity to Actin Filaments—Affinity to actin filaments was measured by a sedimentation assay. Five or 10 μm G-actin was incubated with increasing concentrations of FLNa fragments in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm Na2ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EGTA for 2 h at 25 °C. The actin filaments were then sedimented by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 20 min at 25 °C. Proteins in the supernatants and pellets were then solubilized in SDS gel sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Polypeptides in the gel were visualized by CBB staining, and the band intensities were quantified by densitometry. Titration of Free Calcium Ion—Ca2+-EGTA solutions were prepared as described previously (8Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of free calcium was determined using Fura-2 and calcium calibration buffer kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). Data Base Analysis—Secondary or tertiary structures of FLNa were predicted by data base analysis available on web sites. For homology searches, protein-protein BLAST data base was used. For secondary structure prediction, the sites used were those of the Pôle BioInformatique Lyonnais network protein sequence analysis server (npsapbil.ibcp.fr) and the PredictProtein server of the Columbia University Bioinformatics Center (cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/). For three-dimensional structure prediction, the SWISS-MODEL automated comparative protein modelling server (swissmodel.expasy.org//SWISS-MODEL) and the 3D-Jigsaw comparative modelling server (www.bmm.icnet.uk/servers/3djigsaw/) were used. To predict the CaM-binding site, the Ontario Cancer Institute's calmodulin target data base (calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/flash.htm) was examined. The protein charge plot was carried out by the EMBOSS charge program (emboss.sourceforge.net/). To access these sites, include http:// at the beginning of each address. Ca2+-CaM Inhibits the Gelation of Actin by FLNa—Fig. 1A shows the apparent viscosity of 24 μm actin polymerized with various concentrations of FLNa in the presence either EGTA or Ca2+ with or without 10 μm CaM. In EGTA the gel point, an abrupt increase in the viscosity of actin, occurred at a FLNa concentration of 0.03 μm, a ratio of ∼1 FLNa to 800 actin subunits as described previously (5Nakamura F. Osborn E. Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9148-9154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the gel point was unaffected by Ca2+-free CaM. The amount of FLNa required to gel actin in the presence of 2 mm calcium was slightly higher, presumably because actin filaments polymerized in calcium are shorter than the filaments containing Mg2+ (9Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1077: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, CaM nearly doubled the FLNa concentration required for incipient gelation in the presence of Ca2+. Fig. 1B shows the apparent viscosity of 24 μm actin polymerized with 0.04 (1:600) and 0.08 μm (1:300) FLNa in the presence of either EGTA or Ca2+ with various concentrations of CaM. Low concentrations of CaM (≥ 0.1 μm) dissolved the F-actin-FLNa gel in the presence of Ca2+. Ca2+-CaM Inhibits the Binding of FLNa to F-actin—The simplest explanation for inhibition of FLNa-mediated actin gelation by Ca2+-CaM could be interference with the binding of FLNa to actin filaments, and Fig. 2 shows the evidence for this mechanism. Approximately 80% of added FLNa co-sedimented with actin filaments in the presence or absence of free Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). CaM reduced the binding of FLNa to actin filaments in the presence of Ca2+. CaM did not affect the solubility of FLNa in the absence of F-actin. Increasing concentrations of CaM inhibited the co-sedimentation of FLNa with actin filaments, but only in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C shows that the half-maximal inhibition of the binding of FLNa to actin filaments occurred at 40 μm CaM in the presence of Ca2+. More than 76% of the added FLNa bound to actin filaments in the presence of the same concentration of CaM in the absence of Ca2+. CaM Does Not Bind Native Full-length FLNa but Binds the ABD of Denatured FLNa—The results of both HA-CaM pull-down and HA-CaM overlay assays were inconsistent with a mechanism whereby Ca2+-CaM inhibits F-actin binding by competitive ligation to native FLNa, because the binding of recombinant FLNa to CaM was minimal (Fig. 3, A and B). FLNa partially denatured with methanol/acetic acid, however, bound CaM in a calcium-dependent fashion. An identically treated FLNa truncate lacking its 275 N-terminal amino acids comprising the ABD, which did not bind F-actin (data not shown), did not bind CaM (Fig. 3B), suggesting that binding occurs with first 275 amino acids of FLNa. Localizing the CaM-binding in the N-terminal Half of the FLNa ABD (N-ABD)—Fig. 4 shows that the a GST·His6 construct encompassing the N-terminal half of the FLNa ABD, N-ABD, binds to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, whereas a corresponding construct containing the ABD C-terminal half (C-ABD) does not. A GST fusion protein including the entire ABD, like full-length FLNa, did not bind to CaM. The ABD of FLNa contains two calponin homology (CH) domains, CH1 (Ile44–Tyr148) and CH2 (Pro168–Phe264), which each contain four principal α helices connected by loops or shorter helices (10Stradal T. Kranewitter W. Winder S.J. Gimona M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Based on these predictions and because many known CaM-binding proteins possess a relatively short α helical region, fusion proteins representing smaller fragments of the FLNa ABD illustrated in Fig. 4, C and E, were generated and tested for their CaM-binding activity in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+ (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4E, the minimum CaM binding site was narrowed down to a region between Thr50 and Arg96 within the CH1 domain. Removal of Thr50–Val60 from this sequence completely eliminated the CaM-binding activity of this fragment, and a shorter fragment containing Thr50–Val60 (Thr31–Ala65) did not bind to CaM either. Removal of a highly positively charged sequence, 87KKMHRKHNQR96 from the putative CaM-binding fragment diminished its CaM-binding activity, and smaller fragments containing this region (Ser61–Ser118 or Ser61–Arg96) did not bind to CaM. These data indicate that the Thr50–Val60 stretch is essential for CaM-binding activity and that the basic region between positions 87 and 96 augments the binding, but also that each segment alone is not sufficient to promote binding. This CaM-binding site of FLNa is apparently unique in that no matches of its sequence to the calmodulin target data base (11Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) were detectable. A Negatively Charged Site Linking the CH1 and CH2 Domains of the FLNa ABD Is Sufficient to Suppress the CaM Binding Activity—Our findings suggest that the C-terminal portion of the FLNa ABD is responsible for the inability of the intact FLNa ABD to bind CaM. The connecting segment between CH1 and CH2 (156DEEEDEE162), which is filamin family-specific, is highly acidic (Fig. 5A). This negatively charged sequence could complement the positively charged region (residues 87–96 amino acids) within the CaM-binding site in the N-ABD and might affect CaM-binding activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, the N-ABD extended by 10 C-terminal amino acids, including all of the positively charged residues, is unable to bind CaM, and deletion of the charged residues from the entire FLNa ABD enables it to bind to CaM (Fig. 5B). The CH2 Domain Suppresses the Inhibitory Activity of the Acidic Link between the CH1 and CH2 Domains in the Presence of Actin Filaments— Fig. 5C shows that expressed FLNa fragments containing the entire ABD (1–278 amino acids), the N-ABD (1–153 amino acids) and the N-ABD plus the acidic link between CH1 and CH2 (1–163 amino acids) associate with actin filaments, whereas the C-ABD (154–278 amino acids) does not. The results of the binding experiments also demonstrate that the N-ABD is sufficient to regulate actin-binding by CaM. The positively charged CH1-CH2 link desensitizes the N-ABD regulation by CaM; the entire ABD is responsive to CaM, suggesting that the CH2 sequence restores this sensitivity. CaM Interacts with FLNa at Physiological Ca2+ Concentrations—Fig. 6 compares the calcium dose-response for CaM binding to GST·1–278ΔDE (156DEEEDEE162 deleted) with that required to solate FLNa·F-actin·CaM networks. GST·1–278ΔDE was used in these experiments because it binds calmodulin in the absence of actin. Binding of CaM to GST·1–278ΔDE required ≥1 μm calcium and was nearly maximal at 10 μm calcium concentrations. The apparent viscosity of F-actin in the presence of FLNa and CaM was significantly decreased in this calcium range. Interpretations of effects at calcium are somewhat complicated because the assembly of actin filaments in >50 μm calcium increases the number of nuclei, leading to shorter filaments (9Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1077: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The apparent viscosity of FLNa·F-actin, however, was clearly reduced in the presence of CaM. The CH2-ABD Has Low Affinity for Actin Filaments but Augments the Binding of the Intact ABD—Qualitative binding studies suggest that both the intact ABD and the CH1-ABD of FLNa bind to actin filaments, whereas the CH2-ABD binds actin weakly. We measured the affinity of the intact ABD and CH2-ABD to actin filaments. These domains were expressed as fusion proteins in E. coli and purified, and the GST·His6 was removed. The ABD and the C-ABD were obtained in high yield and, as monomers, in concentrations up to 300 μm. We could not produce N-ABD protein in good yield because of technical problems that have also been reported with attempts to isolate the corresponding domain of utrophin (12Gimona M. Winder S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R674-R675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 7, A–C shows that the ABD of FLNa binds to actin filaments with a 1:1 stoichiometry (mol/mol actin as a monomer) and a Kd of 17.3 μm, whereas the CH2 did not demonstrate saturable binding to actin even at very high concentrations (∼160 μm). Although the affinity of N-ABD to actin could not be measured, the GST·His6·N-ABD sediments with actin filaments, whereas the GST·His6·C-ABD does not (Fig. 5C), implying that the major ABD is located in the N-ABD. Because CaM binds to the N-ABD, the results suggest that Ca2+-CaM directly competes with actin filaments. Phosphorylation of avian gizzard filamin (probably a FLNb homolog, inferring from its DNA sequence) by CaM-kinase II attenuates its actin binding (13Ohta Y. Hartwig J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6745-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, such an effect of CaM-kinase II on human FLNa has not been observed. 3F. Nakamura, J. H. Hartwig, T. P. Stossel, and P. T. Szymanski, unpublished observations. Here, we have obtained the first evidence for a direct regulation of the interaction between FLNa and actin filaments. Calcium-bound calmodulin (holocalmodulin) dissociates F-actin from FLNa and inhibits the ability of FLNa to bind and cross-link actin filaments into a three-dimensional gelled network in vitro. If this regulation exists within living cells, calcium signaling would have a consistent effect on actin gelation. First, calcium signaling dissolves actin gels by activating actin filament severing and capping proteins of the gelsolin family (3Silacci P. Mazzolai L. Gauci C. Stergiopulos N. Yin H.L. Hayoz D. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2004; 61: 2614-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Second, FLNa mobilized by removal from actin filaments in response to holocalmodulin could initiate a new actin gelation cycle where or when calcium levels fall. Because the binding of FLNa to actin filaments also slows actin depolymerization,4 calcium-calmodulin would also regulate this aspect of actin dynamics. Most cells express 1–3 μm FLNa, 50–200 μm F-actin (14Hartwig J.H. Shevlin P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and 30–60 μm CaM (15Szymanski P.T. Szymanska G. Goyal R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C94-C104Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Tansey M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the local concentrations of each at the leading edges of motile cells could be much higher (17Radding W. Williams J.P. Hardy R.W. McDonald J.M. Whitaker C.H. Turbat-Herrera E.A. Blair H.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, the local concentration of calmodulin around the Ca2+ channel has been estimated to be nearly 2.5 mm (18Mori M.X. Erickson M.G. Yue D.T. Science. 2004; 304: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Bulk measurements of free calcium concentrations in cells have reported increases from 0.1 to ∼1 μm following cell activation (19Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4451) Google Scholar), sufficient to promote the binding of CaM to the FLNa ABD in vitro. We determined a half-maximal concentration of ∼40 μm CaM to be effective in the presence of 10 μm actin and 0.32 μm FLNa in an actin co-sedimentation assay. This concentration of CaM exists in living cells. Much smaller amounts of CaM were sufficient to induce solation of FLNa·actin gels, most likely because solation can be initiated by dissociation of only one of the two ABDs in a FLNa dimer, whereas inhibition of actin binding requires the inactivation of both ABDs. Holocalmodulin does not bind FLNa directly. Rather, it seeks out the ABD of FLNa complexed to F-actin, thereby maximizing the specificity of its effect; it removes FLNa from actin filaments but does not prevent FLNa from binding to F-actin. We therefore attempted to achieve some understanding of this complex and interesting mechanism. The FLNa ABD is representative of many actin filament-binding proteins, including members of the spectrin, α-actinin, dystrophin, plectin, and fimbrin families (20Hartwig J.H. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 703-800PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved ABDs contain two CH subdomains in tandem linked by a short connector sequence (Fig. 8) (21Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K. Kranewitter W.J. Winder S.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22Banuelos S. Saraste M. Carugo K.D. Structure. 1998; 6: 1419-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The first, CH1, has two putative actin-binding sites (ABS1 and ABS2; Fig. 8), and the second, CH2, has one (ABS3). Accumulated evidence points to a hydrophobic stretch in ABS2 essential for actin binding, but the structural requirements for the other two actin binding sites are less clear (23Winder S.J. Hemmings L. Maciver S.K. Bolton S.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Critchley D.R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bresnick A.R. Janmey P.A. Condeelis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12989-12993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measured dissociation constants of isolated spectrin family ABDs for F-actin have been in the micromolar range (as we report in this paper for FLNa) (22Banuelos S. Saraste M. Carugo K.D. Structure. 1998; 6: 1419-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Winder S.J. Hemmings L. Maciver S.K. Bolton S.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Critchley D.R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Way M. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The CH2 subdomain of β-spectrin barely binds to F-actin (22Banuelos S. Saraste M. Carugo K.D. Structure. 1998; 6: 1419-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), as we also found for its FLNa counterpart. The affinity of intact FLNa for F-actin (Kd 0.5 μm) (26Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 563-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) is an order of magnitude higher than that of the isolated FLNa ABD. Therefore, although the ABD of FLNa is essential for binding of full-length FLNa to F-actin, 4E. Osborn, J. L. McGrath, F. Nakamura, S. K. Chalos, M. Schleicher Jr., and J. H. Hartwig, submitted for publication. other binding sites or the dimeric state of FLNa contribute to the FLNa-F-actin interaction. Neither intact FLNa nor its ABD bound to holocalmodulin, as determined by sedimentation assays. However, holocalmodulin did bind to partially denatured recombinant FLNa, provided that the protein contained its ABD, suggesting that the FLNa ABD has a cryptic binding site for holocalmodulin. Consistent with this idea, recombinant fragments of the FLNa ABD did bind to holocalmodulin, and from this binding we inferred that residues 50–96 in the CH1 subdomain represent the FLNa binding for calmodulin. Other actin filament-binding proteins thought to bind and be regulated by holocalmodulin include β spectrin (27Sobel J.S. Goldstein E.G. Venuti J.M. Welsh M.J. Dev. Biol. 1988; 126: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), calponin (28Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. Vasulka C. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13327-13333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and utrophin (29Winder S.J. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although some controversy exists regarding the role of holocalmodulin binding for dystrophin (29Winder S.J. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Jarrett H.W. Foster J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5578-5586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or α-actinin functions (31Tang J. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32Pacaud M. Harricane M.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Many known calmodulin-binding proteins have basic amphipathic helix structures with positively charged amino acids interspersed among conserved hydrophobic stretches (11Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 33Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Although such a motif in dystrophin overlaps with the functional calmodulin-binding domain that we identified for FLNa (shown in red in Fig. 8), a recombinant polypeptide containing the homologous sequence of FLNa alone bound calmodulin weakly. The addition to this fragment of a basic stretch of amino acids that is unique to the filamin family (shown in blue in Fig. 8) resulted in much tighter complexing to holocalmodulin. This cluster of basic amino acids in the FLNa ABD is presumably not the principal site for calmodulin binding, however, because the inferred FLNa calmodulin-binding domain is twice as long as that of most known calmodulin-binding sites, and the basic region augments but is not required for calmodulin binding. Because the FLNa segment Thr50–Val60 is critical for calmodulin binding and is homologous to an established calmodulin-binding motif in dystrophin, this region might represent the “authentic” FLNa calmodulin-binding domain, and the basic region may act as a clamp. The basic subdomain at the C-terminal end of the FLNa calmodulin-binding site also suggests a mechanism as to why holocalmodulin does not bind native intact FLNa or its ABD. Vertebrate filamins have a characteristic acidic region within the linker sequence between their ABD CH domains that could bind to the corresponding basic domain in the CH1. Supporting this hypothesis, this acidic fragment inhibits calmodulin binding to CH1. This inhibition suggests a model for the mechanism by which calmodulin dissociates FLNa from F-actin (Fig. 9). The acidic segment of the FLNa ABD prevents calmodulin binding. However, when bound to F-actin the acidic piece does not block the calmodulin-binding site on FLNa, allowing holocalmodulin to bind the FLNa·F-actin complex and dissociate it by direct competition for the actin-binding site, as has been proposed for dystrophin (34Levine B.A. Moir A.J. Patchell V.B. Perry S.V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our model suggests that deletions or point mutations of the CaM-binding, basic, or acidic domains could affect FLNa function in vivo. However, these mutations might also impair actin binding because the CaM-binding domain of FLNa overlaps the ABD, and mutations could lead to conformational changes of the ABD that would complicate interpretation of any results. Genetic mutations in FLNa cause a wide range of human diseases, and several point mutations have now been identified in the FLNa ABD (2Feng Y. Walsh C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). None of the mutations, however, are in the calmodulin-binding site identified in this study. Because the regulation of the FLNa-actin interaction requires the participation of other domains in the ABD in addition to the calmodulin-binding site, the point mutations identified in the ABD may cause disease by altering the calmodulin-FLNa interaction."

ATM initiates the immediate cell cycle checkpoint response to DNA double strand breaks whereas ATR is the predominant initiator of the checkpoint in response to lesions that stall replication forks (2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). ATM deficiency causes the human disease ataxia telangiectasia. Cells and animals lacking ATR are not viable (4Cortez D.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar), but a hypomorphic allele of ATR was recently associated with rare cases of seckel syndrome (6O'Driscoll M. Ruiz-Perez V.L. Woods C.G. Jeggo P.A.

ATM is held inactive in undamaged cells as an oligomer, with the kinase domain of one molecule bound intermolecularly to the FAT domain of another molecule (8Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). Cellular irradiation induces rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation of serine 1981 and dimer dissociation, leading to the activation of ATM kinase signaling. Association with the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex can also facilitate monomerization and activation of ATM (9Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The ATR activation mechanism is less well understood and may involve recruitment to sites of DNA lesions and interactions with specific DNA structures (10Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C.

ATR exists in a stable complex with an associated protein ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Similarly, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the ATR homologs Rad3 and Mec1 are found closely associated with ATRIP homologs Rad26 and Ddc2 respectively (12Edwards R.J. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Paciotti V. Clerici M. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P.

Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mutations in either Rad3 or Rad26 yield almost identical phenotypes, as do mutations in either Mec1 or Ddc2. Depletion of ATRIP by RNA inhibition also causes similar phenotypes the loss of ATR in mammalian cells (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depletion of either ATRIP or ATR from cells causes a decrease in the intracellular levels of the other protein. ATR and ATRIP colocalize to distinct nuclear foci following exposure to DNA damage (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). These nuclear foci are accumulations of checkpoint and DNA repair proteins at DNA lesions although it is unclear whether the large accumulation of checkpoint proteins is required for their proper function (16Lisby M. Rothstein R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol.

ATRIP functions as a recruitment protein for ATR through a direct replication protein A (RPA)-single-stranded DNA-ATRIP interaction at stalled replication forks (18Zou L. Elledge S.J.

Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Conflicting data also exist regarding the size of the protein complex in which ATR and ATRIP are normally associated in vivo. Wright et al. (23Wright J.A. Keegan K.S. Herendeen D.R. Bentley N.J.

A. 1998; 95: 7445-7450Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ATR eluted from a size exclusion column in a large complex of ∼1,000 kDa in size, whereas Unsal-Kacmaz and Sancar (24Unsal-Kacmaz K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) found that ATR and ATRIP exist as a loosely associated heterodimer that elutes in fractions consistent with its predicted size of less than 400 kDa. We recently isolated ATRIP in a yeast two-hybrid screen for ATRIP-interacting proteins and investigated ATR-ATRIP oligomerization in cells. We found that both ATR and ATRIP are associated in oligomeric complexes. Our results demonstrate that the predicted coiled-coil domain of ATRIP is essential for ATRIP oligomerization and for the formation of a stable ATR-ATRIP complex. Furthermore, ATRIP oligomerization through the coiled-coil domain is required for proper ATRIP localization to damage-induced nuclear foci and to promote ATR-dependent Chk1 phosphorylation after DNA damage. Cell Culture, siRNA, and Transfections—All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. Retroviruses were packaged using calcium phosphate transfections of the Phoenix-amphotropic packaging cell line. Plasmid DNA transfections in other cell types were accomplished using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). siRNA transfections were performed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The ATRIP siRNA target sequence is AAGGUCCACAGAUUAUUAGAU. The ATR siRNA target sequence is AACCUCCGUGAUGUUGCUUGA. All RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon. DNA Constructs—Myc, FLAG, and HA-tagged ATRIP expression vectors for transient expression were generated using the univector plasmid fusion system with pUNI50 ATRIP as the host vector (25Liu Q. Li M.Z. Leibham D. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1300-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A retroviral vector containing HA-tagged ATRIP was described previously (17Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 expression vector was generated by digesting pLPCX HA-ATRIP with BstB1 and AvrII, blunting with T4 DNA polymerase, and religation. The GCN4 dimerization domain was used to replace the ATRIP coiled-coil domain by PCR with the following primers: GAGAGTTCGAACCAAGCACCCCTGGATCCTCAAGAATGAAACAACTTGAAGACAAG and GAGAGCCTAGGGCTACTACCTGGAGTACAAGGCGGTTTAGGTCCGCGTTCGCCAACTAATTTCTTTAATC. The PCR product was digested with BstB1 and AvrII and sub-cloned into the corresponding sites of pLPCX HA-ATRIP. All constructs generated using PCR were confirmed by sequencing. Antibodies and Localization—The ATRIP antibody has been previously described (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Antibodies to ATR were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine red-X-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch; FLAG antibodies were purchased from Sigma. HA and Myc antibodies were purchased from Covance Laboratories. Immunofluorescence was performed by plating cells directly on glass coverslips. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeablized with Triton X-100 as previously described (26Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Images were obtained with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a Zeiss camera and software. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.75% CHAPS, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm μ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonate). In selected experiments 0.5% Igepal CA-630 was substituted for the CHAPS detergent. Immunoprecipitations were generally performed with 2 μg of antibody and 15 μl of protein-A/G agarose for 3 h at 4 °C. ATR-ATRIP Cross-linking—HeLa cells transiently expressing ATRIP protein (mutant or wild-type) were trypsinzed, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to ∼5% cell density. A stock of 25 mm DSP (dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate)) in 100% Me2SO was diluted to 1 mm, and cells were rotated at room temperature for 3 min to cross-link. Cells were pelleted for 3 min (1,000 × g), and the cross-linking reaction was quenched by resuspending cells in phosphate-buffered saline + 20 mm glycine. Cells were pelleted, frozen, and then lysed as described in the immunoprecipitation protocol above using 1% Triton X-100 detergent in place of CHAPS. RPA-ssDNA Binding—The 14 and 70 kDa subunits were tagged with a His6 epitope tag (27Stauffer M.E. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25638-25645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RPA was purified from Escherichia coli using nickel affinity chromatography followed by Superdex fractionation. 20 pmol of biotin-labeled 69 base pair single-stranded oligonucleotide was bound to streptavidin beads and incubated either with binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Igepal CA-630, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) alone or a 4 molar excess of RPA in binding buffer. The RPA-ssDNA-streptavidin beads were washed three times with binding buffer prior to use. 293T cells transiently transfected with HA-ATRIP-encoding vectors were lysed in NETN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm μ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonate). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Beads containing the ssDNA with or without RPA were added to the cleared lysates, incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with NETN buffer. Proteins bound to beads were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE prior to blotting. ATRIP Forms Oligomeric Complexes in Mammalian Cells—To identify ATRIP-interacting proteins we screened a B-cell cDNA two-hybrid library with full-length ATRIP fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Two of the interacting clones contained ATRIP cDNAs. To validate ATRIP oligomerization in mammalian cells, we co-expressed Myc-ATRIP and FLAG-ATRIP in 293T cells. Lysates were subjected to reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation using antibodies specific to the epitope tags and assessed by Western blotting. Myc-ATRIP isolated using a Myc antibody was able to co-immunoprecipitate FLAG-ATRIP (Fig. 1A). The reverse immunoprecipitation using FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate FLAG-ATRIP also isolated co-associated Myc-ATRIP. FLAG immunoprecipitation from cells expressing only Myc-ATRIP showed no nonspecific association of Myc-ATRIP in the FLAG immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A, center), nor did Myc immunoprecipitations isolate any FLAG-ATRIP from cells not expressing Myc-ATRIP (Fig. 1A, right). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of Myc- and FLAG-ATRIP is consistent with the two-hybrid data and confirms that ATRIP can form multimers in mammalian cells. To demonstrate that ATRIP also oligomerizes when expressed at endogenous levels we generated a stable HCT116 cell line expressing HA3-ATRIP at levels equivalent to endogenous protein using retroviral infection and antibiotic selection. Western blotting with an ATRIP antibody that recognizes both endogenous and HA-tagged ATRIP demonstrated that endogenous ATRIP and HA-ATRIP proteins are expressed at approximately equal levels, and the 3× HA tag allows separation of tagged and untagged proteins (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we were able to assess whether immunoprecipitates of the HA-ATRIP protein contained endogenous ATRIP. Indeed, HA antibodies immunoprecipitated both the tagged and untagged proteins from lysates of cells containing both proteins (Fig. 1B). These results confirm that ATRIP forms oligomeric complexes in mammalian cells. ATR Forms Oligomeric Complexes in Mammalian Cells—We next examined whether ATR is also an oligomer in cells. ATR oligomerization was analyzed by co-expressing FLAG- and Myc-tagged ATR proteins in 293T cells and assessing ATR oligomerization by co-immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-ATR using FLAG antibodies isolated Myc-ATR (Fig. 2A, lane 6), and Myc antibodies co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-ATR (Fig. 2A, lane 11), demonstrating that ATR also forms oligomeric complexes in cells. FLAG antibodies did not immunoprecipitate any Myc-ATR when FLAG-ATR was not expressed, nor did Myc antibodies immunoprecipitate FLAG-ATR without Myc-ATR (Fig. 2A, lanes 10 and 14). To confirm that ATR oligomerization is not an artifact of overexpression, we repeated these experiments in clonal cell lines that contained stable Myc- and FLAG-ATR proteins expressed at levels no greater than the endogenous protein. The cell lines were first created by sequential transfection of linearized expression plasmids followed by selection of individual clones that express low amounts of the tagged ATR proteins. Western blotting with Myc or FLAG antibodies revealed expression of the tagged proteins (Fig. 2B). Although the Myc- and FLAG-ATR proteins cannot be separated from endogenous ATR on SDS-PAGE gels, blotting with ATR antibodies indicates that expression of Myc- and FLAG-ATR increase total ATR levels less than 2-fold. Thus, they must be expressed at levels less than the endogenous proteins (Fig. 2B). We then performed the co-immunoprecipitation analysis using a FLAG antibody and again confirmed that the Myc- and FLAG-tagged ATR proteins co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2B). ATRIP Oligomerization Is Independent of ATR—To assess the role of ATR in mediating ATRIP oligomerization we compared ATRIP oligomerization in the presence and absence of ATR. ATR protein levels were reduced by transfecting HeLa cells with siRNA specific to ATR. HA-ATRIP was co-expressed with ATR siRNA and ATRIP oligomerization was assayed as the amount of endogenous ATRIP co-immunoprecipitated with HA-ATRIP from cell lysates using an HA antibody. ATR siRNA depleted ATR protein levels by ∼85% (Fig. 2C). The amount of endogenous ATRIP associated with HA-ATRIP was not altered in cells depleted of ATR (Fig. 2C), suggesting that ATRIP oligomerization is independent of ATR. Thus, ATRIP exists as an oligomer in cells and ATRIP oligomerization is not mediated by ATR. ATR Oligomerization Is Independent of ATRIP—To assess the role of ATRIP in mediating ATR oligomerization, we co-expressed Myc-ATR and FLAG-ATR in the presence of endogenous ATRIP levels, overexpressed ATRIP by co-expressing HA-ATRIP or in the presence of ATRIP-specific siRNA, which reduced ATRIP protein levels by ∼90% (Fig. 2A). The amount of co-association of Myc and FLAG-ATR was not changed by the ATRIP status of the cell (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–8 and 11–13). These results suggest that ATR oligomerization is independent of ATRIP. The lack of dependence of ATR oligomerization upon ATRIP or ATRIP oligomerization upon ATR suggests that both ATR and ATRIP contribute to the oligomeric status of the ATR-ATRIP complex. ATRIP Oligomers Are Not Dissociated by DNA Damage— ATM is held as an inactive dimer that autophosphorylates and dissociates into active monomers in response to ionizing radiation (8Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that a change in ATR or ATRIP oligomerization could regulate ATR activity we co-expressed Myc- and FLAG-tagged ATRIP proteins and analyzed oligomerization by co-immunoprecipitating FLAG- and Myc-ATRIP from lysates of cells harvested before and after treatment with UV, hydroxyurea (HU), or IR (Fig. 3A). We consistently found no change in the amount of ATRIP oligomerization after exposure to DNA-damaging agents as the intensity of the co-associated FLAG- or Myc-ATRIP band was not altered after damage (Fig. 3A). To confirm that regulation of endogenous ATRIP is similar to that of overexpressed protein we repeated this experiment in HCT116 cells stably expressing HA-ATRIP at near endogenous protein levels. ATRIP oligomerization was indicated by the amount of endogenous ATRIP co-immunoprecipitated with HA-ATRIP in the presence and absence of DNA damage. ATRIP oligomerization is unchanged at 2 h and 5 h after UV exposure compared with the amount of oligomerization seen in undamaged cells (Fig. 3B). HA antibodies do not immunoprecipitate endogenous ATRIP from HCT116 cells not expressing HA-ATRIP (Fig. 1B). A similar experiment using hTERT-immortalized epithelial cells stably expressing HA-ATRIP yielded similar results (data not shown). These data suggest that the ATRIP oligomer is not dissociated after DNA damage. ATR Oligomers Are Not Disrupted by DNA Damage—To test whether ATR oligomerization is disrupted by DNA damage, we co-expressed Myc-ATR, FLAG-ATR, and HA-ATRIP in 293T cells, exposed cells to UV radiation, and assessed ATR oligomerization before and after damage. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-ATR from cell lysates isolated co-associated Myc-ATR and HA-ATRIP (Fig. 3C). The amount of co-associated Myc-ATR protein was not changed by exposing the cells to UV (Fig. 3C). Reciprocally, isolation of co-associated FLAG-ATR with Myc-ATR using Myc antibodies was not altered by UV damage (Fig. 3C). Additionally, the amount of HA-ATRIP associated with either Myc-ATR or FLAG-ATR was not affected by UV treatment. We repeated these experiments using the clonal cell lines expressing less than endogenous amounts of Myc- and FLAG-tagged ATR proteins. Again we found that FLAG immunoprecipitations contained both Myc- and FLAG-ATR proteins, and the amount of the co-precipitation was not altered by exposing the cells to UV or HU damage (Fig. 3D). We have found that ATR and ATRIP in cell lysates co-elute from gel filtration columns in complexes larger than 1 MDa that are not detectably altered by DNA damage (data not shown). We also have not detected a difference in oligomerization of chromatin-bound ATR-ATRIP after DNA damage or in S-phase synchronized cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the ATR-ATRIP multimeric complex is not detectably dissociated by DNA damage. ATRIP Coiled-coil Domain Is Required for ATRIP Oligomerization and Stable ATR-ATRIP Complex Formation—ATRIP contains a predicted coiled-coil domain stretching from amino acids 108–217. Many coiled-coil domains function as oligomerization motifs (28Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). To determine if this region is necessary for ATRIP oligomerization, we generated a mutant of ATRIP lacking amino acids 112–225 (ATRIPΔ112–225) (Fig. 4A). Deletion of the ATRIP coiled-coil domain disrupted ATRIP oligomerization. HA-ATRIP WT or HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 was co-transfected with FLAG-ATRIP in HeLa cells. Full-length FLAG-ATRIP isolated with FLAG antibodies associated with full-length HA-ATRIP but not HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 (Fig. 4B, center panel). Reciprocally, immunoprecipitation of HA-ATRIP WT with HA antibodies co-precipitated full-length FLAG-ATRIP, but immunoprecipitates of HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 did not contain FLAG-ATRIP (Fig. 4B, right panel). We next tested whether ATRIPΔ112–225 could bind to ATR. ATRIP binds ATR through a C-terminal ATR binding domain (17Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 29Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected ATRIPΔ112–225 to retain the ability to bind ATR. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with HA-ATRIP WT or HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 and approximately equal amounts of the proteins were expressed (Fig. 4C, left panel). HA-ATRIP or HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an HA antibody, and co-associated ATR protein was detected using an ATR-specific antibody. HA-ATRIP WT bound to ATR efficiently based on co-immunoprecipitation. Surprisingly, binding between ATR and the HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 oligomerization mutant was severely compromised despite the retention of the ATR binding domain in this mutant (Fig. 4C). Reciprocally, immunoprecipitating ATR from cell lysates and detecting associated HA-ATRIP proteins confirmed that HA-ATRIP WT but not HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 is associated with ATR (Fig. 4D). Longer exposures of these blots sometimes revealed small amounts of ATRIPΔ112–225 binding to ATR; suggesting that oligomerization increases the affinity of ATRIP for ATR but does not necessarily provide residues in contact with ATR. To further clarify the role of ATRIP oligomerization in the formation and stability of the ATR-ATRIP, we repeated the co-immunoprecipitation experiments described above in the presence of a cross-linking agent to trap loosely associated ATR-ATRIP complexes. In contrast to the results generated in the absence of cross-linking, when cells were treated with a cross-linking agent both HA-ATRIP WT and HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 were associated with ATR, as judged by the amount of HA protein co-immunopreciptated using ATR antibodies (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that the oligomerization mutant ATRIP (ATRIPΔ112–225) is able to associate with ATR in cells but that the stability of the ATR-ATRIP complex is compromised in the absence of ATRIP oligomerization and becomes too weak to be detected by co-immunoprecipitation in the absence of a cross-linking agent. Therefore, ATRIP oligomerization is essential for the formation of a stable ATR-ATRIP complex. Importantly the ATRIPΔ112–225 protein still retained the ability to interact with RPA-ssDNA similar to wild-type ATRIP (Fig. 4F), indicating that the mutant protein was not completely misfolded. To confirm that disruption of stable ATR binding in the ATRIPΔ112–225 mutant was caused by the loss of oligomerization we sought to restore ATRIP oligomerization by adding a heterologous dimerization domain. We replaced the coiled-coil domain of ATRIP with the dimerization domain of the yeast transcription factor GCN4 to generate HA-ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN (Fig. 4A). Adding the GCN4 dimerization domain to the ATRIPΔ112–225 protein restored ATRIP oligomerization (Fig. 4B). HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 expressed in HeLa cells was unable to bind FLAG-ATRIP, but HA-ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4 was able to co-precipitate FLAG-ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4 when isolated with antibodies to the FLAG or HA tags (Fig. 4B). We next tested whether restoring ATRIP oligomerization with the heterologous dimerization domain restored stable ATR binding in the absence of cross-linking agents as would be expected if the ATRIP oligomerization domain itself did not make any specific contacts with ATR. HA-ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4 bound ATR with approximately equal efficiency as HA-ATRIP WT, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4, C and D). These findings demonstrate that ATRIP oligomerization through the coiled-coil domain is required for formation of the stable ATR-ATRIP complex. Oligomerization Is Required for ATRIP Damage-induced Foci Formation—ATRIP and ATR are localized to distinct nuclear foci after exposure to DNA-damaging agents such as HU, UV, and IR (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The role of ATRIP oligomerization in the localization of ATRIP to DNA damage-induced nuclear foci was assessed using indirect immunofluorescence. U20S cells expressing either HA-ATRIP WT, HA-ATRIPΔ112–225, or HA-ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4 were generated by retroviral infection and selection. The cells were exposed to 8 Gy of IR and harvested 3.5 h post-damage, or exposed to 2 mm HU for 5 h. Localization of the ATRIP proteins was assessed using antibodies to the HA tag. HA-ATRIP, HA-ATRIPΔ112–225, and HA-ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4 were located diffusely throughout the nucleus in undamaged cells. After exposure to HU, HA-ATRIP WT formed foci in 48% of cells, the oligomerization mutant HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 failed to form foci (0%) and restoring oligomerization with the GCN4 domain (HA-ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4) restored foci formation (30%) (Fig. 5, A and B). Similarly, after exposure to IR, HA-ATRIP WT formed foci in 47% of cells, HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 oligomerization mutant formed foci in only 9% of cells and restoring oligomerization in the HA-ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4 mutant restored foci in 29% of cells (Fig. 5, A and B). The ATRIPΔ112–225 mutant is completely defective in forming foci after HU treatment; however, we did observe ATRIPΔ112–225 foci that were generally smaller and fainter than those formed by wild-type ATRIP in 9% of IR-treated cells. In contrast, ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4 formed large, bright foci in cells after IR (Fig. 5, A and B). The slightly greater ability of ATRIPΔ112–225 to form foci after IR compared with an almost complete defect after HU may reflect a difference in the mechanism of ATR-ATRIP recruitment to these different DNA lesions. Because ATRIPΔ112–225 binds RPA-ssDNA in vitro (Fig. 4F), its inability to accumulate into foci suggests that RPA-ssDNA binding is not sufficient for ATRIP accumulation at DNA lesions. ATRIP Coiled-coil Domain Is Essential for ATR-ATRIP Checkpoint Signaling—To assess the role of ATRIP oligomerization on ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling, we examined the ability of wild-type ATRIP or ATRIP mutants to complement the loss of endogenous ATRIP in U20S cells. Stable cell lines were generated expressing HA-ATRIP WT, HA-ATRIPΔ112–225, or HA-ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4 containing wobble base pair mutations to provide immunity to siRNA treatment with ATRIP oligos. Cells were treated with ATRIP-specific oligos to reduce endogenous ATRIP protein levels, damaged with UV and harvested 2 h after damage. The ability of the expressed proteins to compensate for the loss of endogenous ATRIP was assessed by Western blotting for ATR-ATRIP-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser345. Cells expressing empty vector had greatly diminished levels of phosphorylated Chk1 after UV, whereas cells expressing HA-ATRIP WT were able to complement the loss of endogenous ATRIP as seen by the robust induction of Chk1 phosphorylation after damage (Fig. 5C). Cells expressing the oligomerization mutant HA-ATRIPΔ112–225 were severely compromised in the induction of Chk1 phosphorylation after UV damage (Fig. 5C). Restoration of ATRIP oligomerization in the HA-ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4-expressing cells was unable to significantly restore the UV-induced Chk1 phosphorylation. These data indicate that oligomerization through the ATRIP coiled-coil domain is essential for ATRIP to support ATR signaling and also suggests there may be a function of the coiled-coil domain beyond dimerization that is important to allow Chk1 phosphorylation. We have demonstrated that ATR and ATRIP form oligomeric complexes in cells, and ATRIP oligomerization is essential for stable binding to ATR. Additionally, ATRIP oligomerization is essential to localize ATRIP to intranuclear foci following DNA damage and to support ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling. Our data on ATRIP oligomerization are consistent with the observation that the yeast ATRIP homolog Rad26 can form homodimers when made in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (30Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Our data are also consistent with Bentley et al. (31Bentley N.J. Holtzman D.A. Flaggs G. Keegan K.S. DeMaggio A. Ford J.C. Hoekstra M. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6641-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and Paciotti et al. (32Paciotti V. Clerici M. Scott M. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 3913-3925Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that S. pombe Rad 3 and S. cerevisiae Mec1 form homo-oligomeric complexes that are not disrupted by DNA damage. ATR and ATRIP oligomerization are inconsistent with a recent report concluding that purified ATR and ATRIP exist as a loosely associated heterodimer with no higher order oligomerization (24Unsal-Kacmaz K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cause of this discrepancy is not clear, but may relate to the specific methods of purification used in the in vitro study. We have found that ATR and ATRIP co-elute from gel filtration columns in a complex larger than 1,000 kDa (data not shown), consistent with other reports (23Wright J.A. Keegan K.S. Herendeen D.R. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Hoekstra M.F. Concannon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7445-7450Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) but inconsistent with the elution profile of the purified ATR and ATRIP proteins that Unsal-Kacmaz et al. studied. Whereas the exact stoichiometry of the complex in vivo remains to be determined, our data conclusively demonstrate that in cells both ATR and ATRIP exist as oligomers and that oligomerization of ATRIP is essential for its function. ATM is an inactive dimer in cells that dissociates into active monomers in response to DNA damage (8Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). We did not observe any regulation of ATRIP or ATR oligomerization by DNA damage. It is possible that a population of ATR-ATRIP molecules that are not detected using our methodology is regulated by DNA damage. A portion of ATRIP and ATR are associated with chromatin, and this specific population may not be completely solubilized by our cell lysis conditions. However, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed from soluble nuclear- or chromatin-bound ATRIP populations and no differences in regulation of ATRIP oligomerization in these different protein populations was revealed (data not shown). In addition, our methodologies would not have detected a change in the complex if at least two molecules of ATRIP and ATR each remained associated or if only a small proportion of ATR-ATRIP oligomers were dissociated. Therefore, although we were unable to detect regulation of ATR or ATRIP oligomerization by DNA damage, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that it is occuring. The Role of the ATRIP Coiled-coil Domain—Deletion of the ATRIP coiled-coil domain demonstrated that the coiled-coil is essential for ATRIP oligomerization and that ATRIP oligomerization is required for the formation of a stable ATR-ATRIP complex. These data clarify previous data on the region of ATRIP, which is required for ATR binding. We previously reported that upon deletion of the first 380 amino acids of ATRIP, ATR could no longer be co-immunoprecipitated with ATRIP (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). However, we later mapped the ATR-binding domain of ATRIP to the C terminus (17Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), which was independently confirmed (29Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The requirement for ATRIP oligomerization mediated by the coiled-coil domain for stable ATR-ATRIP interaction explains these seemingly discrepant data because whereas the C terminus of ATRIP does contain the ATR interaction domain, stable association with ATR requires N-terminal coiled-coil domain-mediated oligomerization. The coiled-coil domain clearly functions in mediating ATRIP oligomerization. Failure of the heterologous GCN4 coiled-coil domain to restore the ability of ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN to promote Chk1 phosphorylation suggests that the ATRIP coiled-coil domain could have additional roles other than oligomerization. One possible explanation is that the ATRIP coiled-coil domain promotes the binding of other uncharacterized ATRIP-interacting proteins. Alternatively, the GCN4 coiled-coil domain could be restoring an incorrect form of ATRIP oligomerization. The GCN4 coiled-coil is a well characterized dimerization domain but we have not determined the exact stoichiometry of the ATRIP oligomer. Therefore, it is possible that the GCN4 coiled-coil may not restore the correct ATR-ATRIP quaternary structure. Further experiments using alternate heterologous dimerization or oligomerization domains could help to clarify this possibility. ATRIP Localization to Sites of DNA Damage—ATR and ATRIP are know to localize to DNA damage-induced nuclear foci (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). This ATR-ATRIP accumulation requires RPA, and ATRIP can bind to RPA-coated single stranded DNA in vitro (18Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). ATRIP lacking the RPA binding domain fails to accumulate at sites of DNA damage (17Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, an interaction between RPA and ATRIP may be one method by which ATR is recruited to DNA lesions. However, the ATRIPΔ112–225 oligomerization mutant can still bind to RPA-coated ssDNA, but fails to accumulate into damage-induced nuclear foci, suggesting that RPA-ATRIP binding alone is not sufficient to localize ATR-ATRIP. Indeed, we have recently shown that ATR-ATRIP binding is also required for ATRIP to properly localize to nuclear foci after DNA damage (17Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and ATR kinase activity is required to localize both ATR and RPA to sites of damage (19Barr S.M. Leung C.G. Chang E.E. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1047-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the inability of the ATRIPΔ112–225 mutant to accumulate in foci is due, at least in part, to its inability to stably bind ATR. Interestingly, there was a greater defect in ATRIPΔ112–225 foci formation after hydroxyurea treatment than after ionizing radiation suggesting that these two types of genotoxic stress may require different molecular interactions to be sensed by ATR-ATRIP. Additionally, the significance of ATR-ATRIP relocalization on ATR checkpoint signaling is unclear. Formation of bright ATRIP nuclear foci is not required for ATR-ATRIP checkpoint signaling after UV damage (17Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Data presented here demonstrate that the formation of nuclear foci is not sufficient for checkpoint signaling since ATRIPΔ112–225+GCN4 forms damage-inducible nuclear foci but fails to support ATR-dependent Chk1 phosphorylation. Further experiments are required to clarify how the ATR-ATRIP complex is recruited to and retained at DNA lesions and how recruitment and retention influence ATR function. In conclusion, the ATR protein kinase and its regulatory subunit ATRIP exist as multimers in cells similar to the related ATM kinase. There is no evidence that ATR-ATRIP oligomerization is regulated in response to DNA damage; however, it remains possible that while the majority of ATR-ATRIP oligomers do not dissociate, there is a subset of activated molecules that are indeed disrupted. Both ATR and ATRIP appear to contain homo-oligomerization domains and ATRIP oligomerization requires an intact coiled-coil domain. Disruption of ATRIP oligomerization prevents stable binding to ATR but does not disrupt ATRIP-RPA-ssDNA association. However, the ATRIP-RPA-ssDNA association is insufficient to target ATRIP to DNA lesions since the oligomerization mutant is defective in DNA damage-induced foci formation. Replacing the ATRIP coiled-coil domain with a heterologous dimerization domain restored ATR binding and proper localization after DNA damage. However, despite restoring proper ATRIP localization, restoring ATRIP oligomerization did not restore ATR-ATRIP checkpoint signaling, suggesting that ATRIP localization to damage-inducible nuclear foci is not sufficient for ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling.

https://openalex.org/W1963921564,"The activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by lipopolysaccharide or other ligands evokes a proinflammatory immune response, which is not only capable of clearing invading pathogens but can also inflict damage to host tissues. It is therefore important to prevent an overshoot of the TLR-induced response where necessary, and here we show that extracellular ATP is capable of doing this in human monocytes. Using reverse transcription-PCR, we showed that monocytes express P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y11, and P2Y13 receptors, as well as several P2X receptors. To elucidate the function of these receptors, we first studied Ca2+ signaling in single cells. ATP or UTP induced a biphasic increase in cytosolic Ca2+, which corresponded to internal Ca2+ release followed by activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry. The evoked Ca2+ signals stimulated Ca2+-activated K+ channels, producing transient membrane hyperpolarization. In addition, ATP promoted cytoskeleton reorganization and cell migration; however, unlike chemoattractants, the migration was non-directional and further analysis showed that ATP did not activate Akt, essential for sensing gradients. When TLR2, TLR4, or TLR2/6 were stimulated with their respective ligands, ATPγS profoundly inhibited secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) but increased the production of interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. In radioimmune assays, we found that ATP (or ATPγS) strongly increased cAMP levels, and, moreover, the TLR-response was inhibited by forskolin, whereas UTP neither increased cAMP nor inhibited the TLR-response. Thus, our data suggest that ATP promotes non-directional migration and, importantly, acts as a “host tissue damage” signal via the Gs protein-coupled P2Y11 receptor and increased cAMP to negatively regulate TLR signaling.

Innate immune cells express various surface membrane receptors, which enable them to respond to changes in their environment, such as invasion by pathogens. Among these receptors are the evolutionarily conserved Toll-like receptors (TLR 2The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase; IKK, inhibitor of IκB kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; fMLP, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PLC, phospholipase C; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; 8-p-SPT, 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline; BzATP, 3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) ATP; MALP-2, macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2; LTA, lipoteichoic acid.2The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase; IKK, inhibitor of IκB kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; fMLP, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PLC, phospholipase C; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; 8-p-SPT, 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline; BzATP, 3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) ATP; MALP-2, macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2; LTA, lipoteichoic acid.(s)), which recognize specific molecular patterns such as bacterial components. TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major structural component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (1Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3896) Google Scholar, 2Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Stimulation of TLR4 by LPS, also known as endotoxin, can initiate a proinflammatory immune response, which serves to clear bacterial infection, but if the response is not sufficiently tamed it can also inflict damage to host tissues, culminating in life-threatening endotoxic shock (3van der Poll T. Lowry S.F. Shock. 1995; 3: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, endotoxic shock can be simulated by exposing mice to LPS, whereas TLR4-/- (TLR4-deficient) mice are hyporesponsive to this ligand (4Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752PubMed Google Scholar). TLR4 signaling is initiated when a complex of LPS and LPS-binding protein binds to the receptor CD14, which is strongly expressed in monocytes and also present in macrophages and dendritic cells. Alternatively, soluble CD14, a serum protein, can substitute for membrane-bound CD14 and initiate TLR4-signaling in cells lacking CD14, such as endothelial cells. The secreted protein MD-2, which binds to the extracellular domain of TLR4 is also essential for responsiveness to LPS, which is virtually absent in MD-2-/- mice (5Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar, 6Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar).Although the molecular mechanisms by which LPS and other ligands stimulate TLRs leading to a specific pattern of gene expression are well understood (7Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar), detailed information about its negative regulation is lacking. Stimulation of TLR4, as well as other TLRs, activates IRAKs (IL-1 receptor-associated kinases) via the adaptor protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88) which leads to downstream activation of the IKK complex (inhibitor of IκB kinase complex), which consists of IKK-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ. The upstream signaling has been confirmed with MyD88-/- and IRAK4-/- mice, which show little response to LPS (8Kawai T. Sato S. Ishii K.J. Coban C. Hemmi H. Yamamoto M. Terai K. Matsuda M. Inoue J.

The IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitory protein IκB (inhibitor of (nuclear factor) κB), which leads to its subsequent degradation, allowing the release of NF-κB (nuclear factor κB), which translocates to the nucleus and promotes the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Following stimulation of TLRs in monocytes or macrophages, expression of IRAK-M increases, which has been shown to regulate negatively TLR signaling, as has up-regulation of single immunoglobulin IL-1 receptor-related molecule (SIGIRR) (10Wald D. Qin J. Zhao Z. Qian Y. Naramura M. Tian L. Towne J. Sims J.E. Stark G.R. Li X. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) (11Kinjyo I. Hanada T. Inagaki-Ohara K. Mori H. Aki D. Ohishi M. Yoshida H.

The latter, though, probably only dampens secondary (interferon-β-dependent) pathways (13Baetz A. Frey M. Heeg K. Dalpke A.H. J. Biol.

In any case, these negative regulators do not convey information about the state of host tissues.Recent studies with human monocyte-derived dendritic cells suggest that extracellular ATP is capable of negatively regulating TLR-signaling via extracellular nucleotide receptors, which can be broadly divided into the P2Y and P2X receptor families. In dendritic cells, ATP has been shown to inhibit LPS-induced secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-12 (15La Sala A. Ferrari D. Corinti S. Cavani A. Di Virgilio F. Girolomoni G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1611-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 16Wilkin F. Stordeur P. Goldman M. Boeynaems J.-M. Robaye B. Eur. J.

Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 796-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which raises the possibility that ATP may act, among other roles, as a “host tissue damage” signal for innate immune cells and inhibit TLR signaling in a negative feedback fashion. To test this possibility and to understand better the effect of extracellular ATP on innate immunity, we have investigated the effects of nucleotide receptor activation on the migration, second messenger signaling, and cytokine secretion of human monocytes in the absence and presence of various TLR ligands.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of Monocytes—Methods were performed essentially as recently described (18Hanley P.J. Musset B. Renigunta V. Limberg S.H. Dalpke A.H. Sus R. Heeg K.M. Preisig-Müller R. Daut J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9479-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In brief, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers by density centrifugation (Ficoll-Hypaque, 1.077 g/ml, Biochrom) and monocytes were enriched to a purity of >95% by counterflow centrifugation (19Sprenger H. Meyer R.G. Kaufmann A. Bussfeld D. Rischkowsky E. Gemsa D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Alternatively, monocytes of high purity (>95%) were isolated using anti-CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) in a SuperMACS. Cells were plated in cell culture dishes containing Clicks/RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biochrom).Analysis of Gene Expression—Total cellular RNA was prepared from CD14+ monocytes using a HighPure RNA extraction kit (Roche Diagnostics), which included DNase I digestion. After reverse transcription with a cDNA synthesis kit (MBI Fermentasm St. Leon-Rot, Germany), PCR analysis was performed using primers specific for P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, P2Y12, and P2Y13 and P2X1, P2X2, P2X3, P2X4, P2X5, and P2X7. The PCR primers have recently been published (18Hanley P.J. Musset B. Renigunta V. Limberg S.H. Dalpke A.H. Sus R. Heeg K.M. Preisig-Müller R. Daut J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9479-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), except for P2Y13 which was TTGTTCTTCATCTCCCTGCCAAATA. Real time quantitative PCR was done using a Eurogentec qPCR kit, and measured values were normalized to the level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA expression.Single Cell Ca2+ Imaging—A coverslip seeded with monocytes was sealed onto the bottom of a Perspex bath (volume, 100 μl) mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot 300). Cells were imaged via a ×40 (1.4 numerical aperture) oil-immersion Nikon objective lens and superfused at 1 ml/min with solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm probenecid, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). After a 15-min incubation with 10 μm fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes), a single monocyte was selected and excited at 488 nm via a monochromator, and fluorescence was detected at 530 ± 15 nm. Only 1 cell/coverslip was used for experiments. The fluorescence signals were normalized with respect to the resting fluorescence intensity (F0) and expressed as F/F0.Whole-cell Patch Clamp Measurements—Monocytes were superfused with solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.13 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm Na-pyruvate, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) or with high K+ solution containing 140 mm KCl and 4.5 mm NaCl. The pipette solution contained 50 mm KCl, 65 mm K+ glutamate, 10 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.9 mm K2ATP, 0.2 mm Na3-GTP, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), an A/D converter (PCI-MIO 16-XR-10, National Instruments), and software (PC.DAQ1.1) developed in our laboratory. The sampling rate was 5 kHz (-3 dB at 1 kHz). All patch clamp and fluorescence measurements were performed at room temperature (∼22 °C).Chemotaxis Assay—Monocyte migration was assayed in a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuro Probe Inc, Bethesda, MD) using polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters with 5-μm diameter pores (20Kaufmann A. Mühlradt P.F. Gemsa D. Sprenger H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6303-6308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lower chamber was filled with standard RPMI 1640 medium, with or without (negative control) stimulus, and the upper chamber (50-μl volume) was filled with cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml). In parallel, we performed checkerboard analyses (used to distinguish chemotaxis from chemokinesis). The chemoattractant peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was used as a positive control. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C in air containing 5% CO2, cells were fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin (Sigma). A software-controlled imaging system (Vilber Lourmat; distributed by Fröbel, Wasserburg, Germany) was used to quantify the number of migrated monocytes per well. Results are expressed as specific chemotaxis, the number of stimulus-induced migrated cells after subtracting unspecific migration (negative control).Time-lapse Microscopy—Images were acquired using a combination of differential interference contrast and time-lapse microscopy using an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with a software-controlled (Image-Pro Plus 4.5, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) Sensi-CamQE CCD camera (Chromaphor, Duisburg, Germany). Monocytes were plated on collagen type I-coated coverslips and imaged using a ×60 (1.4 numerical aperture) Olympus objective lens and immersion oil.Western Blot Analysis—Monocytes (5 × 106/well) were incubated for 20 h in 6-well tissue culture plates and then either left untreated or stimulated with 100 μm ATP, 100 μm ATPγS, or 0.1 μm fMLP. After 3 min, cells were lysed using a protein extraction reagent (M-PER, Pierce Biotechnology), supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Phosphorylation of Akt was then assayed by Western blot as recently described (21Salentin R. Gemsa D. Sprenger H. Kaufmann A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Equal loading was controlled by detecting total Akt.cAMP Measurements—Monocytes were preincubated for 30 min in RPMI 1640/HEPES buffer containing 25 μm rolipram for 30 min and then treated with a nucleotide or forskolin in the same medium for 15 min. Activity was stopped by adding 0.1 m HCl, and cAMP was quantified by radioimmune assays after acetylation.Cytokine Measurements—Secretion of cytokines into the culture supernatants was determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described previously (19Sprenger H. Meyer R.G. Kaufmann A. Bussfeld D. Rischkowsky E. Gemsa D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Kaufmann A. Mühlradt P.F. Gemsa D. Sprenger H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6303-6308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 96-well microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) were coated with cytokine-specific monoclonal antibodies specific for TNFα, MCP-1, or IL-10 (Pharmingen). Plates were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of culture supernatants (100 μl/well) were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and then a specific biotinylated secondary antibody (Pharmingen) and a streptavidin-peroxidase complex was added. Conversion of the substrate ortho-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was measured using a Dynatech MR7000 microplate reader. Sensitivities of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were <3 pg/ml (IL-10), <20 pg/ml (MCP-1), and <100 pg/ml (TNFα).Infection with Influenza A Virus—Influenza A/PR/8 (H1N1) virus was propagated and purified as previously described (21Salentin R. Gemsa D. Sprenger H. Kaufmann A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Nain M. Hinder F. Gong J.H. Schmidt A. Bender A. Sprenger H. Gemsa D. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar). Viral titers were determined by plaque assay, and monocytes were infected with H1N1 virus at a multiplicity of infection of 2.Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. After 16 h of incubation under control or treatment conditions, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and further incubated for 2 h with 0.5 mg/ml MTT. After cell lysis and solubility of crystals with isopropanol, the reduction of MTT was determined by measuring absorption at 570 nm using a microplate reader. Cell viability, assessed by MTT reduction, was expressed as percent control.RESULTSAt least seven human P2Y receptors have been identified and characterized: P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, P2Y12, and P2Y13. We found that monocytes express P2Y2 and P2Y11, similar to macrophages (18Hanley P.J. Musset B. Renigunta V. Limberg S.H. Dalpke A.H. Sus R. Heeg K.M. Preisig-Müller R. Daut J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9479-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), as well as the recently described Gi-coupled P2Y13 receptor (23Marteau F. Le Poul E. Communi D. Communi D. Labouret C. Savi P. Boeynaems J.-M. Gonzalez S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Weak signals for P2Y1 and P2Y4 were also detected. Furthermore, monocytes were found to express the ligand-gated ion channels P2X1, P2X4, and P2X7 (Fig. 1B). Most of the P2Y receptor subtypes are coupled to phospholipase C (PLC) and Ca2+ signaling; however, the P2Y11 receptor is additionally coupled to adenylate cyclase by the stimulatory G protein Gs (24Communi D. Govaerts C Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), whereas the P2Y13 receptor is negatively coupled to this enzyme (23Marteau F. Le Poul E. Communi D. Communi D. Labouret C. Savi P. Boeynaems J.-M. Gonzalez S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 25Communi D. Gonzalez N.S. Detheux M. Brézillon S. Lannoy V. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41479-41485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Because extracellular ATP can be hydrolyzed to ADP by ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (CD39), the major ectonucleotidase of monocytes, we tested whether or not ATP (10 and 100 μm) caused a net increase in cAMP levels. Indeed, ATP and its non-hydrolyzable analogue ATPγS both strongly increased cAMP in monocytes (Fig. 1C) suggesting that the P2Y11/Gs/adenylate cyclase pathway was functionally dominant in these cells.In whole-cell current-clamp recordings, application of 10 μm ATP consistently induced a transient depolarization (n = 13), which was followed by hyperpolarization (Fig. 1D). The initial depolarization was probably due to activation of P2X receptors, because in 5 of 7 cells it was absent when UTP was substituted for ATP (Fig. 1E). The secondary hyperpolarization was almost certainly because of the opening of Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channels, which we have recently characterized in detail (18Hanley P.J. Musset B. Renigunta V. Limberg S.H. Dalpke A.H. Sus R. Heeg K.M. Preisig-Müller R. Daut J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9479-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that monocytes express SK-4 (KCNN4) and BKCa (KCNMA1) channels (Fig. 1F), similar to macrophages.We have also recently shown that ATP induces Ca2+ oscillations in human macrophages, which may regulate various enzymes and gene expression (18Hanley P.J. Musset B. Renigunta V. Limberg S.H. Dalpke A.H. Sus R. Heeg K.M. Preisig-Müller R. Daut J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9479-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, application of ATP to single human monocytes did not induce such an oscillatory release of Ca2+, but typically we observed a rapid Ca2+ transient consisting of 1–3 spikes followed by a slower secondary increase (Fig. 2A). The slower secondary increase, also observed with UTP (Fig. 2A, inset), was probably due to store-operated Ca2+ entry, because it was absent in Ca2+-free solution, and it could be seen when Ca2+ was subsequently introduced (Fig. 2B). Ca2+ influx consistent with store-operated Ca2+ entry could also be repeatedly observed when the sarcoendoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase was blocked with thapsigargin (500 nm) and Ca2+ was intermittently introduced (Fig. 2B, inset). Fig. 2, C and D show that ATP and UTP equipotently increase Ca2+ with half-maximal response at ∼0.1 μm. Using digital time-lapse microscopy, we observed that the application of either ATP (n = 10) or UTP (n = 4), within minutes, caused a strong retraction of pseudopodia (single frames shown in Fig. 3, A and B; see also time-lapse movie in supplemental data), even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. This observation suggested that ATP may act as a chemoattractant.FIGURE 2Ca2+ signaling induced by extracellular nucleotides. A, application of 10 μm ATP to a single monocyte induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+], which was followed by a slower secondary increase. UTP (10 μm) elicited a similar Ca2+ transient (inset). B, in Ca2+-free solution, an application of 10 μm ATP induced a single monotonic Ca2+ transient, whereas a “secondary increase” followed the introduction of Ca2+ to the external solution. The latter signal is consistent with Ca2+ influx via Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels (store-operated Ca2+ entry), and the inset shows that it could be reproduced by treating the cells with thapsigargin (500 nm) and intermittently switching to Ca2+-free solution (indicated by solid bars). C, plot of ATP versus peak intracellular Ca2+. D, UTP was equally effective as ATP at mobilizing Ca2+ from internal stores.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3ATP induces pseudopodia retraction and migration without phosphorylating Akt.

In parallel, we performed checkerboard analyses (not shown), which revealed that ATP did not induce directional migration. That is, the stimulatory effect of ATP on migration was still observed when it was added at equal concentrations to both sides of the chamber. Although both P2Y and fMLP receptors are coupled via Gq to PLC, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, yielding diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, this signaling pathway alone is not sufficient to induce migration along chemotactic gradients. The fMLP receptor is additionally coupled to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which through the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate activates Akt (also known as protein kinase B), the activity of which is necessary for cell navigation (26Hannigan M.

For example, in studies using PI3Kγ-/- mice, directional movement of neutrophils in fMLP gradients is severely impaired without affecting random movement (29Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Stanford W.L. Bolon B. Wakeham A. Itie A. Bouchard D. Kozieradzki I. Joza N. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Suzuki A. Penninger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that ATP differs from fMLP in that it does not activate the PI3K-Akt pathway we performed an immunoblot analysis. Stimulation of monocytes with either ATP or ATPγS did not produce phosphorylation of Akt, whereas fMLP produced a strong “positive control” response (Fig. 3D).We next investigated the effects of extracellular nucleotides on TLR-signaling. Monocytes were stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS in the presence or absence of various concentrations of ATPγS or UTP for 16 h. ATPγS or UTP alone had no significant effect on TNFα production (Fig. 4A). However, ATPγS, but not UTP, inhibited LPS-induced production of TNFα in a dose-dependent fashion. These data indicate that ATPγS can potently regulate TLR signaling, and the lack of effect of UTP suggests that the neither P2Y2 nor P2Y4 receptors, where UTP is a full agonist (30Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar), are involved. The P2Y1 and P2Y13 receptors are also unlikely to be involved because both of these receptors are activated preferentially by diphosphate adenine nucleotides. Moreover, the P2Y1 blocker MRS2179 (100 μm) did not reduce the ability of ATPγS to inhibit LPS-induced production of TNFα (Fig. 4B). It could be argued that hydrolysis-resistant ATPγS is slowly degraded to adenosine, which could confound the interpretation of data. However, the activity of CD73 (ecto-5′-nucleotidase), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of AMP to adenosine, is weak in monocytes (31Sunderman F.W. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1990; 20: 123-139PubMed Google Scholar) and, moreover, we found that TLR-signaling was similarly inhibited when experiments were repeated in the presence of 100 μm 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8-p-SPT), an adenosine receptor blocker (not shown). Thus, P2Y11 is most likely the receptor through which ATP inhibits TLR signaling. Consistent with this conclusion, the potent P2Y11 (and P2X7) receptor agonist BzATP, as well as the weaker agonist ADPβS (32Communi D. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), inhibited TLR signaling (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Various P2Y receptor agonists and forskolin, but not UTP, suppr"

https://openalex.org/W2039115099,"Some recombinant vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors (factors VII, IX, and protein C) have become valuable pharmaceuticals in the treatment of bleeding complications and sepsis. Because of their vitamin K-dependent post-translational modification, their synthesis by eukaryotic cells is essential. The eukaryotic cell harbors a vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system that converts the proteins to γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing proteins. However, the system in eukaryotic cells has limited capacity, and cell lines overexpressing vitamin K-dependent clotting factors produce only a fraction of the recombinant proteins as fully γ-carboxylated, physiologically competent proteins. In this work we have used recombinant human factor IX (r-hFIX)-producing baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, engineered to stably overexpress various components of the γ-carboxylation system of the cell, to determine whether increased production of functional r-hFIX can be accomplished. All BHK cell lines secreted r-hFIX into serum-free medium. Overexpression of γ-carboxylase is shown to inhibit production of functional r-hFIX. On the other hand, cells overexpressing VKORC1, the reduced vitamin K cofactor-producing enzyme of the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system, produced 2.9-fold more functional r-hFIX than control BHK cells. The data are consistent with the notion that VKORC1 is the rate-limiting step in the system and is a key regulatory protein in synthesis of active vitamin K-dependent proteins. The data suggest that overexpression of VKORC1 can be utilized for increased cellular production of recombinant vitamin K-dependent proteins."

Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein that is particularly important for the development of hematological and biliary malignancies, but the mechanism of action of Mcl-1 is unknown. A number of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins exhibit their effects by modulating Ca2+ signals, so we examined the effects of Mcl-1 on components of the Ca2+ signaling pathway that are known to regulate apoptosis. Expression of Mcl-1 did not affect expression of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor or the size of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores. However, mitochondrial Ca2+ signals induced by either Ca2+ agonists or apoptotic stimuli were decreased in cells overexpressing Mcl-1 and increased in cells in which Mcl-1 expression was inhibited. These findings provide evidence that Mcl-1 directly inhibits Ca2+ signals within mitochondria, which may provide a novel mechanism to inhibit apoptosis and thereby promote neoplasia.

These findings provide evidence that Mcl-1 directly inhibits Ca2+ signals within mitochondria, which may provide a novel mechanism to inhibit apoptosis and thereby promote neoplasia. Apoptosis can result from a range of extracellular or intracellular stimuli, which converge with activation of caspases to lead directly to cell death (1Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar). Apoptosis provides a key control mechanism for the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and regeneration, and resistance to apoptosis has been linked to the development of neoplasia (2Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). Two general pathways to apoptosis have been described. One pathway is the so-called extrinsic pathway initiated by death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). The second pathway is the intrinsic pathway, which involves the convergence of intracellular stress signals on mitochondria resulting in mitochondrial permeability (4Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many cells, the death receptor pathway may also trigger mitochondrial dysfunction via caspase-mediated cleavage of the pro-apoptotic molecule, Bid, which when cleaved translocates to mitochondria triggering their permeabilization (5Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar). In this respect, mitochondrial permeabilization is key to both pathways. Mitochondrial permeabilization results in release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, which then exhibits specific toxic effects (6Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 7Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway is inhibited by members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which includes Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 (8Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar, 9Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 10Gross A. McDonnell J.M.

Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis in part by decreasing the size of Ca2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3R, InsP3 receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Cam2+, free mitochondrial Ca2+; siRNA, small interference RNA; PTP, permeability transition pore.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), whereas Bcl-xL acts in part by inhibiting expression of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor (InsP3R) (12Li C. Fox C.J. Master S.R. Bindokas V.P. Chodosh L.A. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9830-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which is the principal ER Ca2+ release channel in most types of cells. Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1) was first identified because this gene is up-regulated early in the differentiation of the ML-1 human myeloid leukemia cell line and was found to be a member of the emerging Bcl-2 gene family as well (13Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Mcl-1 inhibits apoptosis is not entirely understood. Because Mcl-1 is a member of the Bcl-2 family, we examined the effects of this protein on Ca2+ signaling pathways. Materials, Reagents, and Cell Lines—The Ca2+ dyes fluo-4, mag-fluo-4, and rhod-2, the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker green, and the nuclear stain TO-PRO-3 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). JC-1, ATP, and staurosporine were from Sigma. A monoclonal antibody labeling the N-terminal region of the human type III InsP3R was from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) (14Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody for Mcl-1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A monoclonal antibody for the 17-kDa subunit of oxidative phosphorylation complex I, which is localized to mitochondria, was from Molecular Probes. The secondary antibodies were Alexa 488 anti-rabbit, Alexa 568 anti-mouse, and Alexa 647 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Mz-Cha-1 cells derived from a human biliary adenocarcinoma (15Knuth A. Gabbert H. Dippold W. Klein O. Sachsse W. Bitter-Suermann D. Prellwitz W. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. J. Hepatol. 1985; 1: 579-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Greg Fitz (University of Texas Southwestern). Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium-α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, gentamycin and streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics. Immunofluorescence—Immunochemistry was performed on Mz-Cha-1 cells and paraffin-embedded sections of human liver biopsy specimens as described previously (16Shibao K. Hirata K. Robert M.E. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, Mz-Cha-1 Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Paraffin-embedded sections were pretreated with 1 mm citrate buffer at 100 °C. Primary antibodies used were anti-type III IP3R-3 mouse monoclonal (1:100) and anti-Mcl-1 rabbit polyclonal (1:100). Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488 anti-rabbit (1:500), Alexa 568 anti-mouse (1:500), and Alexa 647 anti-rabbit (1:500). Cells also were labeled with the nuclear stain TO-PRO-3. Negative controls were performed under each experimental condition by incubating tissue with secondary antibodies but not primary antibodies. All images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Thornwood, NY). To ensure specificity of staining, images were obtained using machine settings at which no fluorescence was detectable in negative control samples. Immunofluorescence images were obtained by excitation at 488 nm with observation at 505-550 nm to detect Alexa 488 or GFP, by excitation at 543 nm and observed at >585 nm to detect Alexa 568 or DsRed, then by excitation at 633 nm with observation at >650 nm to detect Alexa 647 or TO-PRO-3. Mcl-1 or InsP3R immunofluorescence was quantified in transfected Mz-Cha-1 cells by normalizing the fluorescence relative to the fluorescence detected in nearby non-transfected cells. To perform this calculation, transfected cells in each microscopic field were identified by expression of DsRed or GFP. Mean fluorescence in each transfected cell then was divided by mean fluorescence measured in at least five non-transfected cells in the same microscopic field, and the ratio was multiplied by 100%. Plasmids and Transfections—The plasmids for Mcl-1 cDNA and siRNA have been described previously (17Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In particular, a specific double-stranded 21-nucleotide RNA sequence homologous to the target message was used to silence Mcl-1 (17Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) or DsRed (both from Clontech) to identify transfected cells. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Transfection efficiency was typically 5-10%. Cells were used 48 h after transfection. Mitochondrial Preparation and Cytosolic Extracts—Mitochondria were isolated using a commercially available mitochondria isolation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, mitochondria were prepared from cells by homogenization followed by low speed (600 × g) and then high speed (1100 × g) centrifugation. The final pellet contained the crude mitochondrial fraction that was used for immunoblots. Purity of the mitochondrial fraction was validated by a fluorometric assay that measures uptake of the cationic carbocyanine dye JC-1 by intact mitochondria (18Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). In selected experiments, JC-1 was used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential directly in intact Mz-Cha-1. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with JC-1 (10 μg/ml), and then examined by confocal microscopy. Fluorescence images were obtained by excitation at 488 nm with observation at 505-550 nm and at >585 nm to detect potential-sensitive color shifts. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblots were performed as described previously (16Shibao K. Hirata K. Robert M.E. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 m leupeptin), and then protein content was determined by the Bradford assay. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to protein nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) plus 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, and incubated with rabbit anti-Mcl-1 antibody (1:500) in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation (1 h) with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, 1:4000) in TBS-T. Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). A Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer was used for quantitative analysis of the blots. Calcium Measurements—Free mitochondrial Ca2+ (Cam2+) was measured in wild type Mz-Cha-1 cells and in Mz-Cha-1 cells transiently transfected with Mcl-1 cDNA or Mcl-1-specific siRNA using the mitochondrial Ca2+ dye rhod-2 and time lapse confocal microscopy. rhod-2 can sometimes detect cytosolic rather than mitochondrial Ca2+, but rhod-2 labeling in Mz-Cha-1 cells was punctuate, and Ca2+ signals detected by rhod-2 were different from those detected by the cytosolic Ca2+ dye fluo-4 (not shown), suggesting that rhod-2 fluorescence reflected Cam2+ in these cells. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with rhod-2/AM (10 μm). Coverslips containing the cells were transferred to a custom-built perfusion chamber on the stage of a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope (Hercules, CA) (14Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 16Shibao K. Hirata K. Robert M.E. Nathanson M.H.

A. 1998; 95: 8381-8386Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cam2+ was monitored in these cells by exciting the specimens at 543 nm and observing at >585 nm to detect rhod-2 emission signals. Cells were stimulated with ATP (10 or 100 μm) or staurosporine (1 μm), and images were acquired every 150-600 ms. Increases in Cam2+ were expressed as percent increases in fluorescence intensity of rhod-2. In separate studies, ER Ca2+ was measured using the low affinity Ca2+ dye mag-fluo-4 (Kd 22 μm) and examined by confocal microscopy (22Echevarria W. Leite M.F. Guerra M.T. Zipfel W.R. Nathanson M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with mag-fluo-4/AM (6 μm) then observed using the same confocal imaging system used to detect rhod-2. ER Ca2+ was monitored in these cells by exciting the specimens at 488 nm and observing at >515 nm to detect mag-fluo-4 emission signals. Cells were stimulated with thapsigargin (2 μm) to deplete ER Ca2+ stores, and images were acquired every 1-2 s. Changes in ER Ca2+ were expressed as percent increases or decreases in fluorescence intensity of mag-fluo-4. rhod-2 and mag-fluo-4 fluorescence was quantified in transfected Mz-Cha-1 cells by normalizing the fluorescence relative to the fluorescence detected in nearby non-transfected cells. To perform this calculation, transfected cells in each microscopic field were identified by expression of GFP (in cells loaded with rhod-2) or DsRed (in cells loaded with mag-fluo-4). Mean fluorescence in each transfected cell then was divided by mean fluorescence measured in at least five non-transfected cells in the same microscopic field, and the ratio was multiplied by 100%. Statistical Analysis—Data are represented as mean ± S.E. Means between groups were compared using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistically significant differences. Expression of Mcl-1 and Type III InsP3R in Primary Cholangiocytes and in a Cholangiocarcinoma Cell Line—Mcl-1 is thought to play a role in development of cholangiocarcinoma (17Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), but expression of this protein has not been investigated in primary biliary tissue. Therefore we used confocal immunofluorescence to examine expression of Mcl-1 in liver biopsies from eight patients with normal bile ducts, five patients with biliary obstruction due to stone disease (n = 4) or malignancy (n = 1), and five patients with cholangiocarcinoma (Fig. 1). Specimens were co-labeled for the type III InsP3R (InsP3R-3). This isoform accounts for >80% of InsP3Rs in bile ducts and is known to be concentrated in the apical region (16Shibao K. Hirata K. Robert M.E. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Hirata K. Dufour J.F. Shibao K. Knickelbein R. O'Neill A.F. Bode H.P. Cassio D. St-Pierre M.V. Larusso N.F. Leite M.F. Nathanson M.H. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mcl-1 labeling was present in normal cholangiocytes and was distributed diffusely throughout the cytosol, whereas InsP3R-3 was concentrated apically as shown previously (Fig. 1A). Both Mcl-1 and InsP3R-3 were detected in cholangiocarcinoma as well (Fig. 1B). Quantitative immunofluorescence suggested that Mcl-1 expression was increased in cholangiocarcinoma, because fluorescence increased from 86 ± 1 pixel values in normal cholangiocytes to 124 ± 2 pixel values (p < 0.0005, mean ± S.E. of fluorescence intensity obtained using the same confocal machine settings for each sample). Mcl-1 expression was decreased to 58 ± 1 pixel values, and InsP3R-3 expression was nearly absent in patients with biliary obstruction (p < 0.0001 relative to normal tissue, Fig. 1C). Interpretation of these results is limited, because there was insufficient tissue from these patient specimens to perform quantitative immunoblots. However, these results demonstrate that Mcl-1 is expressed in primary human cholangiocytes and suggest that expression is increased in cholangiocarcinoma. Next, we examined the expression and distribution of Mcl-1 and InsP3R-3 in Mz-ChA-1 cells, because this is a well characterized human cholangiocarcinoma cell line (21McGill J.M. Basavappa S. Mangel A.W. Shimokura G.H. Middleton J.P. Fitz J.G. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 236-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and InsP3R-3 accounts for nearly all of the InsP3R in these cells (data not shown). Mcl-1 was distributed throughout the cytosol, whereas InsP3R-3 was distributed in a perinuclear pattern. The two proteins did not co-localize (Fig. 2). Based on these findings, Mz-Cha-1 cells were used as the model cell line for the remaining studies.FIGURE 2Distribution of Mcl-1 and the InsP3 receptor in Mz-ChA-1 cells. Confocal immunofluorescence images were obtained from Mz-ChA-1 cells. Cells were triple-labeled with antibodies against Mcl-1 (green), type III InsP3R (red), and the nuclear stain TO-PRO-3 (blue). Mcl-1 is distributed diffusely in cytosol, whereas the InsP3R is more concentrated in the perinuclear region. As in primary cholangiocytes, no co-localization is seen. Scale bar, 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mcl-1 Does Not Alter Expression of the InsP3 Receptor—Bcl-xL has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in part by decreasing expression of the InsP3R (12Li C. Fox C.J. Master S.R. Bindokas V.P. Chodosh L.A. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9830-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), so we examined whether Mcl-1 similarly alters InsP3R expression. To investigate this, cells were transfected with either Mcl-1 cDNA or siRNA for Mcl-1, to increase or decrease Mcl-1 expression, respectively (Fig. 3). HEK293 cells were used to validate the Mcl-1 cDNA and siRNA constructs (Fig. 3), and all subsequent transfections were performed in Mz-Cha-1 cells. Cells were co-transfected with DsRed as a marker of successful transfection. Control cells were transfected with DsRed alone. Expression of Mcl-1 and InsP3R in each group was evaluated simultaneously by quantitative confocal immunofluorescence (20Hirata K. Dufour J.F. Shibao K. Knickelbein R. O'Neill A.F. Bode H.P. Cassio D. St-Pierre M.V. Larusso N.F. Leite M.F. Nathanson M.H. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and was normalized by expression of these proteins in non-transfected cells on the same coverslips (Figs. 4 and 5). Mcl-1 fluorescence in the DsRed control group was 100 ± 12% of the fluorescence in non-transfected cells in co-culture, whereas fluorescence staining of InsP3R-3 was 101 ± 11%. The normalized Mcl-1 fluorescence in siRNA-treated cells was reduced to 54 ± 4% of that of non-transfected cells in co-culture (p < 0.005 versus control), whereas that of InsP3R-3 in these cells was 92 ± 6% (p > 0.1 versus control). The fluorescence intensity of Mcl-1 labeling in cells transfected to overexpress this protein was 193 ± 21% of that seen in non-transfected cells in co-culture (p < 0.005 versus control), whereas that of InsP3R-3 was 102 ± 12% (p > 0.1 versus control). Thus, neither increased nor decreased expression of Mcl-1 altered the expression of the InsP3R. To analyze these results further, we examined the relationship between normalized Mcl-1 fluorescence and normalized InsP3R fluorescence over the range of values for Mcl-1 (Fig. 5B). There was no correlation between Mcl-1 and InsP3R fluorescence (r = 0.22; p > 0.2), providing further evidence that Mcl-1 does not regulate expression of InsP3R.FIGURE 4Identification of single Mz-ChA-1 cells that over- or underexpress Mcl-1. Each confocal immunofluorescence image is triple-labeled to reveal Mcl-1 (blue), the type III InsP3R (green), and DsRed (red), which is used as a marker of transfection.

A, for each experimental group, immunofluorescence for Mcl-1 and the type III InsP3R was quantified in individual cells and was normalized by immunofluorescence detected in at least 10 nearby non-transfected cells. Mcl-1 labeling decreased significantly in Mz-ChA-1 cells treated with siRNA and increased significantly in cells transfected with Mcl-1 cDNA (*, p < 0.001 relative to control cells transfected with DsRed alone). In contrast, labeling for the InsP3R did not change in either of these groups. Results are mean ± S.E. (n = 10 cells in each group).

Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To determine whether Mcl-1 influences ER Ca2+ stores, Mz-ChA-1 cells were loaded with the low affinity Ca2+ dye mag-fluo-4 (Kd 22 μm) and examined by confocal microscopy (22Echevarria W. Leite M.F. Guerra M.T. Zipfel W.R. Nathanson M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). mag-fluo-4 fluorescence was distributed in a reticular fashion (Fig. 6A), consistent with selective labeling of ER Ca stores. Cells were transfected with either Mcl-1 cDNA or siRNA for Mcl-1, along with DsRed as a marker of successful transfection. Control cells were transfected with DsRed alone. As an additional control, mag-fluo-4 fluorescence in all transfected cells was compared with fluorescence signals observed in co-cultured non-transfected cells on the same coverslips (Fig. 6B). The mag-fluo-4 fluorescence intensity of cells in each group was determined to quantify these observations. The ratio of fluorescence in transfected/non-transfected cells was 1.03 ± 0.08 (n = 38) in control cells (DsRed only), 1.10 ± 0.14 (n = 18) in cells transfected with siRNA to decrease Mcl-1 expression, and 0.99 ± 0.15 (n = 23) in cells transfected with Mcl-1 cDNA to increase Mcl-1 expression (p > 0.25 for each group, Fig. 6C). Stimulation with the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin (2 μm) induced a progressive decrease in mag-fluo-4 fluorescence (Fig. 6D), providing further evidence of selective labeling of ER Ca2+ stores. Treatment with thapsigargin induced a similar decrease in fluorescence in all (control, siRNA, and cDNA) transfected cells as well as in non-transfected cells (p > 0.8 by analysis of variance, Fig. 6E). These results provide evidence that, unlike Bcl-2, Mcl-1 does not affect the size of ER calcium stores. Mcl-1 Inhibits Mitochondrial Calcium Signaling—Immunoblot analysis of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial fractions of Mz-Cha-1 cells demonstrated that Mcl-1 is localized to the mitochondria (Fig. 7A), consistent with previous reports (23Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Confocal immunofluorescence of Mcl-1 was performed to further confirm this observation (Fig. 7B). Mcl-1 co-localized with oxidative phosphorylation complex I, which is expressed only in mitochondria. This provides additional evidence that Mcl-1 is mitochondrial, so we examined the effects of Mcl-1 on mitochondrial Ca2+ signals. Excessive increases in free mitochondrial Ca2+ can lead to formation of the permeability transition pore (25Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and can also release cytochrome c and induce apoptosis(26Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). To determine Ca2+ whether Mcl-1 influences mitochondrial free signals, Mz-ChA-1 cells were loaded with the mitochondrial Ca2+ dye rhod-2 (27Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 28Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar) and examined by confocal microscopy. To confirm the subcellular distribution of rhod-2, a subset of cells were loaded with both rhod-2 and the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker green (Fig. 8). Confocal imaging demonstrated that the two dyes co-localized, which demonstrates that rhod-2 preferentially labels mitochondria in this cell type. Cells were then transfected with either Mcl-1 cDNA or siRNA for Mcl-1, along with GFP as a marker of successful transfection. Control cells were transfected with GFP alone. As an additional control, mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in all transfected cells were compared with signals observed in co-cultured non-transfected cells on the same coverslips. Cells were stimulated with ATP (10 and 100 μm), which is known to increase Ca2+ via P2Y receptor-mediated InsP3 formation in this cell type (21McGill J.M. Basavappa S. Mangel A.W. Shimokura G.H. Middleton J.P. Fitz J.G. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 236-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nathanson M.H. Burgstahler A.D. Mennone A. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G86-G96PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Ca2+ increased just as often in cells transfected with GFP alone as in matched non-transfected controls (p > 0.1, Fig. 9, B and C). In both groups, Ca2+ increased in most cells stimulated with 100 μm ATP (69 ± 14% and 75 ± 11%, respectively), but only in a minority of cells stimulated with 10 μm ATP (18 ± 11% and 26 ± 11%). In contrast, mitochondrial Ca2+ increased less often in cells overexpressing Mcl-1 than in non-transfected controls, regardless of the concentration of ATP. Specifically, mitochondrial Ca2+ increased in a minority of overexpressing cells stimulated with 100 μm ATP (14 ± 9% versus 82 ± 9%, p < 0.0005), and increased in a minimal percent of cells stimulated with 10 μm ATP (1 ± 1% versus 30 ± 10%, p < 0.05). Mitochondrial Ca2+ increased in most cells in which Mcl-1 expression was decreased, regardless of the ATP concentration. Thus, mitochondrial Ca2+ increased more often than in non-transfected controls when cells were stimulated with 10 μm ATP (64 ± 12% versus 26 ± 13%, p < 0.05) but not 100 μm ATP (84 ± 7% versus 73 ± 11%, p > 0.1). These findings demonstrate that Mcl-1 inhibits mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling.FIGURE 8Subcellular distribution of rhod-2 in Mz-Cha-1 cells.

Although fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue or the liver is initiated by citrate transport in exchange for malate across the mitochondrial membrane, the transporter responsible for supplying malate during citrate transport has not been identified. In the present study, we clarified the role of Slc25a10 in supplying malate for citrate transport and examined the effect of Slc25a10 suppression on the lipogenic pathway and lipid accumulation. We have reported an Slc25a10 increase in white adipose tissue in obese mouse models and a decrease in a fasted mouse model using expression profiles. Next, we examined the effect of Slc25a10 suppression by small interfering RNA on citrate transport in the lipogenic cell lines HepG2 and 3T3-L1. We observed that inhibition of malate transport by Slc25a10 suppression significantly reduced the citrate transport from the mitochondria to the cytosol. We also found that suppression of Slc25a10 down-regulated the lipogenic pathway, indicated by decreases in ACC1 expression and malonyl-CoA level. Furthermore, suppression of Slc25a10 decreased triglyceride lipid accumulation in adipose-differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. These results suggested that Slc25a10 plays an important role in supplying malate for citrate transport required for fatty acid synthesis and indicated that inhibition of Slc25a10 might effectively reduce lipid accumulation in adipose tissues.

A series of fatty acid synthesis reactions begins with the export of mitochondrial citrate to the cytosol in exchange for malate by a citrate carrier (1Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by the conversion of citrate to acetyl-CoA by ATP citrate lyase (2Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC1 or ACC2), the rate-limiting enzymes of fatty acid synthesis (3Munday M.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Cytosol citrate also functions as an activator for ACCs, accelerating the rate of fatty acid synthesis. Subsequently, fatty acids are synthesized by sequential reactions catalyzed by fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and other fatty acid elongases or desaturases (2Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev.

The products of fatty acid synthesis, such as palmitate or stearate, are stored in the form of triglyceride. In contrast with the mechanism of fatty acid synthesis from the precursor citrate, little is known about the mechanism to regulate the transport of citrate to the cytosol in the initial step of fatty acid synthesis. However, the mechanism involving the supply of cytosolic malate for the citrate transporter, which antiports the cytosolic malate and mitochondrial citrate, remains to be elucidated.Mitochondrial solute carrier family 25 member 10 (Slc2510) transports a dicarboxylate, such as malate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The carrier is composed of six transmembrane regions with three structurally cognate repeats and is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane (6Das K. Lewis R.Y. Combatsiaris T.P. Lin Y. Shapiro L. Charron M.J. Scherer P.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mouse Slc25a10 is expressed in lipogenic tissues, with predominant expression in WAT and secondary and relatively low expression in the liver (6Das K. Lewis R.Y. Combatsiaris T.P. Lin Y. Shapiro L.

Lin Y. Shapiro L. Charron M.J. Scherer P.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Malate, the substrate of Slc25a10, is abundant in lipogenic tissues and antiported for citrate (8Fiermonte G. Palmieri L. Dolce V. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol.

Overexpression of Slc25a10 in cultured cells results in hyperpolarization of mitochondria via an unknown mechanism, which produces reactive oxygen species (10Lin Y. Berg A.H. Iyengar P. Lam T.K. Giacca A. Combs T.P. Rajala M.W. Du X. Rollman B. Li W. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Rhodes C.J. Fantus I.G. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. J. Biol.

We also showed with the microarray study that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is overexpressed in WAT of obese mice, indicating a relation between obesity and athero-sclerosis (13Takahashi K.

Further microarray studies of lipogenic tissues combining several obese and lean animal models may reveal more important pathways or genes in the development of increased fat mass and resultant metabolic syndrome.The proteins involved in the pathway of de novo fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis have attracted attention as novel anti-obesity targets because suppression of the expression or function of these proteins reduces fat mass and improves obese parameters in several animal models (14Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 15Ashrafi K. Chang F.Y. Watts J.L. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2003; 421: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). A genome-wide screening of RNA interference suppression in Caenorhabditis elegans showed that inhibiting the expression of acetyl-CoA synthetase reduced fat levels in wild type and mutants with increased fat content (15Ashrafi K. Chang F.Y. Watts J.L. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2003; 421: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of new genes in this pathway may identify new anti-obesity targets.In the present study, we performed a microarray analysis of WAT using three obese mouse models and a fasted mouse model to focus on changes in the lipogenic pathway. Slc25a10 was up-regulated in all three obese mouse models and down-regulated in the lean mouse model. We then examined the effect of Slc25a10 suppression on fatty acid synthesis. We found that Slc25a10 plays a crucial role in supplying malate for the citrate transport required for fatty acid synthesis. We also found that the suppression of Slc25a10 down-regulated fatty acid synthesis, resulting in reduced lipid accumulation in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESObese and Lean Model Mice—C57BL/6N mice (6 weeks old, CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were housed in individual cages. Mice were maintained under conditions of controlled temperature (23 ± 2 °C) and light (07:00–19:00). Water and food (CA-1, CLEA Japan) were available ad libitum unless noted otherwise. Models of DIO and d-Trp34NPY-treated obese mice (free-fed and pair-fed models) have been described previously (13Takahashi K. Mizuarai S. Araki H. Mashiko S. Ishihara A. Kanatani A. Itadani H. Kotani H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46654-46660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the fasted model, 17-week-old male mice were fasted for 21 h, and food intake was restricted to a 3-h period daily for 7 days. All procedures involving animals complied with National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Banyu Animal Care and Usage Committee.Microarray Study in WAT—Total RNA was extracted from WAT using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen) and repurified with an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). To determine changes in expression, 10 μg of RNA was utilized for microarray analysis (MG-U74U74A chip, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) of ∼12,000 genes. For analysis of microarray data, GeneChip software (Affymetrix) was utilized. Appropriate control mice were used to provide baseline values for the experimental groups, and genes displaying values of p < 0.05 were identified using the Mann-Whitney test.Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from WAT and cultured cells as described in the previous paragraph. For cultured cells, the first purification with TRIzol reagent was omitted. Reverse transcription was performed for 500 ng of total RNA, and cDNA obtained was applied to TaqMan PCR for quantification of mRNA expression. Data were collected and analyzed using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). The relative mRNA expression data were normalized to β-actin or transferrin receptor. Probes and primers used for quantitative RT-PCR are listed in Supplemental Data 1. Pre-Developed TaqMan assay reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used for TaqMan probe and primers for human β-actin.siRNA Transfection—For siRNA transfection of HepG2 cells, the cells were seeded at a confluency of 10% one day before transfection with siRNA for human Slc25a10 using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as follows. The siRNA sequence was 5′-AGCCUCUCCACUCACCAGCTT-3′, which was synthesized by in vitro transcription with an siRNA kit (Silencedr siRNA construction kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). As a control, we used scramble II duplex siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). For transfection of a 6-well plate, siRNA solution (50 nm) was complexed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in 100 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After incubating for 20 min, HepG2 cells were treated with the lipid/siRNA solution. After 6 h, the transfection solution was replaced with growth medium. Two days after transfection, the cells were assayed. For siRNA transfection of 3T3-L1 cells, cells were first differentiated into adipocytes (16Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Two and 6 days after differentiation, 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with siRNA for mouse Slc25a10 by GeneSilencer (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) as follows. siRNA (20 nm) with a sequence of 5′-CGUCAGGAUGCAGAACGACTT-3′ was mixed with GeneSilencer in 100 μl of Opti-MEM. After incubating for 20 min, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with the lipid/siRNA solution. After 2 h, the transfection solution was replaced with medium for differentiation. Ten days after the onset of differentiation, they were assayed.Mitochondrial Transport Study—Freshly isolated mitochondria from HepG2 were loaded with malate by incubating in 10 ml of a transport buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, and 1 mm EGTA at pH 7.0, in the presence of 2 mg/ml rotenone and 0.75 mm malate. After 5 min, 5 mm phenylsuccinate and 1,2,3-benzene tricarboxylate were added to inhibit the oxoglutarate carrier and citrate carrier, respectively. The malate-loaded mitochondria with the transport buffer were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The mitochondria were washed once and resuspended in 2.0 ml of the transport buffer. The kinetics of [14C]malate/malate exchange were determined using the inhibitor stop method (8Fiermonte G. Palmieri L. Dolce V. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol.

Acta. 1993; 1143: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Malate-loaded mitochondria were incubated in 1 ml of reaction buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mg of rotenone at pH 7.0. Exchange transport was initiated by adding [14C]malate and terminated, at the indicated times, by the addition of 12.5 mm n-butylmalonate. The mitochondria were then immediately reisolated by centrifugation, washed once, and acidified with 20% HClO4. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was diluted, and radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter.Quantification of Malate, Citrate, and Malonyl-CoA—For quantification of malate in whole cells, malate was extracted from 109 cells and measured using a standard enzymatic assay (19Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972: 149-218Google Scholar). Briefly, after collection and washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution, cells were dissolved in 70% EtOH. The cell lysate in EtOH was homogenized with sonication followed by the addition of formic acid (4%). After removing cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatants were evaporated. Dried samples were dissolved in hydrazine solution (200 mm, pH 9.3). The solution containing malate was reacted with malate dehydrogenase and NAD to produce oxaloacetate and NADH. The production of NADH was measured by spectrometry at 340 nm. For quantification of citrate, dried samples were prepared using the same procedure used for malate. Dried samples were dissolved in citrate detection buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 10 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EDTA). The citrate solution was reacted with citrate lyase, malate dehydrogenase, and NADH to form malate and NAD+. The formation of NAD+ was measured by spectrometry at 340 nm. For quantification of malate and citrate in mitochondria, the mitochondria were fractionated before measurement (20Majima E. Ishida M. Miki S. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9792-9799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For quantification of malonyl-CoA in cells, radiolabeled palmitate stoichiometrically converted from malonyl-CoA in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA, and purified FAS was measured using a modification of a previously described method (21Harwood Jr., H.J. Petras S.F. Shelly L.D. Zaccaro L.M. Perry D.A. Makowski M.R. Hargrove D.M. Martin K.A. Tracey W.R. Chapman J.G. Magee W.P. Dalvie D.K. Soliman V.F. Martin W.H. Mularski C.J. Eisenbeis S.A. J. Biol.

To extract malonyl-CoA from cells, pellets containing 108 cells were dissolved in 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a reverse phase chromatography column (Sep-Pak Vac C18 cartridge, Waters, Milford MA). Extracts containing malonyl-CoA were reacted with [14C]acetyl-CoA and purified FAS to produce palmitoyl-CoA. The radiolabeled palmitoyl-CoA was extracted with hexane, and radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter.Lipid Biosynthesis Assay—Lipid biosynthesis was measured by the 6-h incorporation of [14C]acetate into extractable lipids added to scintillation fluids (22Keay S. Grossberg S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4099-40103Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Oil Red O Staining—Ten days after differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 2 h in 10% formaldehyde. A 0.35% solution of Oil Red O in isopropyl alcohol was diluted with an equal volume of water, filtered, and added to the fixed cells for 2 h. After washing with PBS, stained triglyceride droplets were visualized and photographed. For quantification of Oil Red O, stained cells were treated with 100% isopropyl alcohol for 10 min to extract Oil Red O, and colorimetric intensity was measured by spectrometry at 510 nm.Western Blot—3T3-L1 cells were collected in 0.5 ml of cold M-PER buffer (Pierce). After cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, 30 μg of protein was separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. For the detection of ACC, the membrane was incubated with anti-ACC and anti-Ser79-phosphorylated ACC antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Evaluation of Data and Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistics were performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test.RESULTSMicroarray Analysis of WAT in Obese and Lean Mouse Models—To understand the molecular mechanism underlying an accelerated lipogenic pathway in obesity, we performed microarray analysis in WAT of obese and fasted mouse models. The obese mouse models included DIO and d-Trp34NPY-treated mice (free-fed and pair-fed models), and the fasted mouse model was a caloric-restricted model. d-Trp34NPY is known to represent appetite stimulant acting on the NPY Y5 receptor. Administration of this neuropeptide is known to increase food intake, with changes in body weight accompanied by increased fat weight (23Mashiko S. Ishihara A. Iwaasa H. Sano H. Oda Z. Ito J. Yumoto M. Okawa M. Suzuki J. Fukuroda T. Jitsuoka M. Morin N.R. MacNeil D.J. Van der Ploeg L.H Ihara M. Fukami T. Kanatani A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Through the analysis of ∼12,000 genes by oligonucleotide microarray, we extracted genes up-regulated by more than 1.8-fold in the obese models and down-regulated by more than 3.0-fold in the fasted mice. The thresholds were determined based on the change in leptin expression, which is positively correlated with adipose volume (24Guo K.Y Halo P Leibel R.L Zhang Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 28: R112-R119Google Scholar). With this threshold, six genes were extracted including the reference gene, leptin (TABLE ONE). The list includes MCP-1, which is induced in the obese mouse model and was decreased in fasted mice. The genes included the mitochondrial dicarboxylate transporter Slc25a10. The substrate of Slc25a10 is malate, which increases in several tissues with enhanced lipogenesis and is also an antiporter for citrate across the mitochondrial membrane. We focused on Slc25a10, hypothesizing that the carrier is involved in the initial steps of fatty acid synthesis.TABLE ONECommon signature genes with WAT in DIO, d-Trp34NPY-treated, and fasted mice Genes with more than 1.8 of -fold change in all the obese model mice and less than -3.0 of -fold change in fasted mice are listed.

Approximately 2.0-, 2.5-, and 2.0-fold increases were observed in DIO, d-Trp34NPY-FF, and d-Try34NPY-PF mice, respectively. We also confirmed a 40-fold increase in Slc25a10 in adipose-differentiated 3T3-L1 (Fig. 1D).Suppression of Slc25a10 Reduces Malate Transport Activity in Isolated Mitochondria—To analyze the function of Slc25a10 in lipogenesis and examine the effect of inhibition on de novo fatty acid synthesis, we designed siRNA for human and mouse Slc25a10. In lipogenic cells (HepG2 derived from liver and mouse adipocyte 3T3-L1), siRNA for Slc25a10 was transiently transfected. By selecting optimal siRNA sequences, we observed 75 and 90% of mRNA suppression in HepG2 and 3T3-L1, respectively (Fig. 2A). Next, we measured the malate-transporting activity of Slc25a10 in mitochondria isolated from the siRNA-treated cells. After suppression of Slc25a10 expression by siRNA, mitochondria were isolated from HepG2 and 3T3-L1, and the malate exchange rate was measured. Malate-transporting ability was reduced to 60 and 45% in siRNA-treated cells of HepG2 and differentiated 3T3-L1, respectively (Fig. 2B), indicating functional repression of Slc25a10.FIGURE 2Suppression of Slc25a10 reduces malate transport activity in isolated mitochondria. A, suppression of Slc25a10-mRNA expression by siRNA in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cells. Relative mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. B, malate transport activity across the mitochondrial inner membrane was measured in mitochondria isolated from control or Slc25a10-siRNA-treated HepG2 or 3T3-L1 cells.

Expression was not affected by Slc25a10-siRNA treatment. The citrate carrier transport study in isolated mitochondria was also performed as a control. The citrate/citrate exchange ability of the citrate carrier was not affected by Slc25a10 suppression (Supplemental Data 2).Suppression of Slc25a10 Reduces Cytosol Malate and Citrate Levels— We examined the effect of Slc25a10 suppression on malate and citrate levels in whole cells. After siRNA treatment of Slc25a10 in HepG2 cells, malate levels in the cells were measured. The malate level was decreased by 38% when compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). Since Slc25a10 transports malate across the inner membrane of mitochondria, mitochondrial malate was also measured to determine whether the difference in whole cell malate level was derived from the mitochondria or cytosol. After isolating mitochondria, malate concentrations were measured. No difference in malate concentration between control and siRNA-treated mitochondria was observed (Fig. 3B), indicating that malate was decreased in the cytosol of siRNA-treated cells by the inhibition of malate transport from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Since citrate carrier transports cytosol malate in exchange for mitochondrial citrate, we speculated that the reduced cytosolic malate caused by Slc25a10 suppression might decrease citrate/malate exchange of citrate carrier. Thus, citrate concentration was measured. In whole cells, the citrate concentration of siRNA-treated samples was decreased by 31% when compared with the control (Fig. 3C), although no change was detected in mitochondrial concentration (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Suppression of Slc25a10 reduces malate and citrate in cytosol. HepG2 cells were treated with Slc25a10-siRNA or control RNA. Malate levels in whole cell fractions (A) and mitochondrial fractions (B) were measured in control or siRNA-treated cells. Citrate was simultaneously measured in whole cell fractions (C) and in mitochondrial fractions (D).

Citrate functions as an allosteric regulator of ACC1. To examine the effect of reduced cytosol citrate on ACC1, we measured the expression of ACC1 in Slc25a10-suppressed cells. Fig. 4A shows the time course suppression of Slc25a10 in 3T3-L1 cells by siRNA. Although Slc25a10 increased 30-fold in control 3T3-L1 cells after differentiation, ∼90% of Slc25a10 suppression was achieved in cells treated with siRNA for Slc25a10 after 10 days of differentiation. ACC1 also increased in control cells depending on differentiation time, indicating that the lipogenic pathway was activated in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 4B). In contrast, ACC1 induction was reduced to 50% of control in cells treated with siRNA for Slc25a10 after 10 days of differentiation (Fig. 4B). We also measured the expression of lipoprotein lipase and citrate carrier as differentiation markers, which were increased ∼100- and 25-fold, respectively, both in control and in siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4, C and D). The expression levels of other lipogenic genes were also quantified (ATP citrate lyase and Fas) in 3T3-L1 cells. Expression was not affected by Slc25a10-siRNA (Fig. 4, E and F). In another lipogenic cell line, HepG2, reduced ACC1 expression was also observed when cells were treated with siRNA for Slc25a10 (Fig. 4G), whereas citrate carrier expression was not changed when compared with control (Fig. 4H). The decreased expression of ACC1 was confirmed with other siRNA sequences for Slc25a10 both in 3T3-L1 and in HepG2. In addition, when Slc25a10 was overexpressed in HEK293 cells with low endogenous Slc25a10 expression, ACC1 expression increased significantly in comparison with vector-transfected control cells, whereas citrate carrier expression was unchanged when compared with control (data not show"
https://openalex.org/W1987441803,"The activating protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor is a converging point of multiple signal transduction pathways in many cells. We have previously demonstrated that overexpressing Tam67, a dominant-negative (DN) form of cJun, blocks AP-1 activity and inhibits breast cancer cell growth. We hypothesized that Tam67 forms dimers with other AP-1 proteins to suppress the growth of breast cancer cells. In the present study, we used immunoprecipitation-Western blotting to demonstrate that Tam67 binds all Jun and Fos proteins in breast cancer cells. In addition, we used two variants of the Tam67 mutant to investigate whether Jun or Fos protein was required for breast cancer cell growth. We created a Tam/Fos mutant in which the cJun dimerization domain was replaced by the cFos dimerization domain, and a Tam/Squelcher mutant in which the cJun dimerization domain was deleted. We then isolated MCF-7 cell lines that stably expressed these cJun-DN mutants under the control of an inducible promoter. Using AP-1-dependent reporter assays, we observed that Tam67 and Tam/Fos mutants inhibited AP-1 transcriptional activity, while the Tam/Squelcher mutant did not. We then determined whether Tam/Fos or Tam/Squelcher inhibited breast cell growth as well as Tam67. We found that while Tam67 repressed cell growth, neither Tam/Fos nor Tam/Squelcher mutant affected cell growth. These results indicate that Tam67 likely inactivates Fos family member proteins to suppress breast cancer cell growth. Finally, we performed antisense experiments to knock down the expression of individual family members (cJun or cFos). Our results demonstrated that antisense cFos inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and colony formation, while antisense cJun did not. These results suggest that Tam67 suppresses breast cancer cell growth by interacting with Fos family members, specifically with cFos, to produce an inactive AP-1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2010345210,"The A2A adenosine receptor is a prototypical Gs-coupled receptor, but it also signals, e.g. to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, via a pathway that is independent of heterotrimeric G proteins. Truncation of the carboxyl terminus affects the strength of the signal through these alternative pathways. In a yeast two-hybrid interaction hunt, we screened a human brain library for proteins that bound to the juxtamembrane portion of the carboxyl terminus of the A2A receptor. This approach identified ARNO/cytohesin-2, a nucleotide exchange factor for the small (monomeric) G proteins of the Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) family, as a potential interaction partner. We confirmed a direct interaction by mutual pull down (of fusion proteins expressed in bacteria) and by immunoprecipitation of the proteins expressed in mammalian cells. To circumvent the long term toxicity associated with overexpression of ARNO/cytohesin-2, we created stable cell lines that stably expressed the A2A receptor and where ARNO/cytohesin-2 or the dominant negative version E156K-ARNO/cytohesin-2 was inducible by mifepristone. Cyclic AMP accumulation induced by an A2A-specific agonist was neither altered by ARNO/cytohesin-2 nor by the dominant negative version. This was also true for agonist-induced desensitization. In contrast, expression of dominant negative E156K-ARNO/cytohesin-2 and of dominant negative T27N-Arf6 abrogated the sustained phase of MAP kinase stimulation induced by the A2A receptor. We therefore conclude that ARNO/cytohesin-2 is required to support the alternative, heterotrimeric G protein-independent, signaling pathway of A2A receptor, which is stimulation of MAP kinase.

We therefore conclude that ARNO/cytohesin-2 is required to support the alternative, heterotrimeric G protein-independent, signaling pathway of A2A receptor, which is stimulation of MAP kinase. Over the last decade, it has been increasingly accepted that G protein-coupled receptors also bind regulatory proteins other than G proteins, arrestins, and G protein-coupled kinases, which are involved in effector regulation and desensitization, respectively (1Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).

Trends Neurosci. 2000; 10: 469-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The A2A adenosine receptor has an unusually long intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail, 122 amino acids in man, when compared, for instance, to 34 residues in the carboxyl terminus of the A1 adenosine receptor. Circumstantial evidence suggests that accessory proteins bind to the carboxyl terminus of the A2A receptor (3Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).

Truncation of the carboxyl terminus does not impair the ability of the A2A adenosine receptor to stimulate MAP kinase but blunts stimulation of cAMP accumulation. In addition, full-length and truncated receptors differ in their constitutive (agonist-independent) activity; this difference is only seen in intact cells and is lost upon membrane preparation, suggesting the loss of one or several interacting proteins (6Klinger M. Kuhn M. Just H. Stefan E. Palmer T. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Naunyn. Schmiedeberg's. Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with earlier experiments where the A2A receptor was found to be tightly coupled to its cognate G protein. Tryptic cleavage of the receptor, which presumably released the carboxyl terminus, abrogated the tight complex and restored guanine nucleotide sensitivity to the ternary complex of agonist, receptor, and G protein (7Nanoff C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nanoff C. Stiles G.L. J. Recept. Res. 1993; 13: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest an important role for the carboxyl terminus in signaling by the A2A receptor. In the present paper we identify ARNO (Arf nucleotide site opener)/cytohesin-2, an exchange factor for low molecular weight G proteins of the Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) family, as a direct interaction partner of the COOH terminus of the A2A receptor. The presence of ARNO/cytohesin-2 is required to support the alternative signaling to MAP kinase, because dominant negative ARNO/cytohesin-2 efficiently suppresses the sustained phase of receptor-dependent MAP kinase phosphorylation.

Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Hunt—Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using the MATCHMAKER yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). In this system, yeast strain EGY48 (MATα trp1 his3 ura3 leu2 6 LexAop-LEU2) was used for transformation of bait, prey, and reporter plasmids: pEG202, pJG4-5 and pSH18-34, respectively. EGY48 containing the lacZ reporter plasmid (pSH18-34) and the A2ARCt bait plasmid (pEG202-A2aRct) was transformed with prey plasmids bearing human brain cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Selection for colonies that express interacting proteins was done by using the auxotrophy markers according to the manufacturer's instructions. To verify the two-hybrid interactions, positive transformants grown on selection medium were assayed directly in situ for β-galactosidase activity assay by briefly exposing the plates to chloroform and subsequent incubation with 100 μm X-gal in the medium as a substrate. Cell Culture, Creation of Stable Cell Lines, Radioligand Binding Assay, Cellular cAMP Accumulation, MAP Kinase Stimulation—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 5% CO2, 95% air and 37 °C. The culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, β-mercaptoethanol, and nonessential amino acids. The cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine Plus™. Because forced transient expression of ARNO/cytohesin-2 altered cell morphology and reduced cell viability, we transfected HEK293 cells with a plasmid encoding GAL4-DBD/hPR-LBD/p65-AD, a fusion protein that comprises the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, the ligand-binding domain of the progesterone receptor, and the activation domain of the human p65 subunit of NF-κB; this protein is activated by mifepristone (9Nordstrom J.L.

Stable cell clones were selected and subjected to a second transfection with a plasmid engineered to encode ARNO/cytohesin-2 or dominant negative E156K-ARNO/cytohesin-2 under the control of 6 GAL4-responsive upstream activating sequences. Stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of zeocin. Two cell lines with a robust induction of ARNO/cytohesin-2 and its dominant negative version were selected and transfected with a third plasmid encoding for the Flag-tagged A2A receptor, the selection marker being geneticin.

The media for the culture of stably transfected cells were supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml geneticin (G418), 125 mg/liter zeocin, and 50 mg/liter hygromycin to maintain the selection pressure. Expression of ARNO/cytohesin-2 or of E156K-ARNO/cytohesin-2 was induced by the addition of 10 nm mifepristone and monitored by immunoblotting of cellular lysates with an antiserum against ARNO/cytohesin-2. The membranes were prepared from uninduced and induced cells, and binding of the antagonist radioligand [3H]ZM241385 was determined as described (6Klinger M. Kuhn M. Just H. Stefan E. Palmer T.

In brief, the cells were seeded on coverslips and co-transfected with plasmids encoding CFP-tagged ARNO and YFP-tagged A2A receptor. Twenty four hours after transfection, the coverslips were mounted in the microscope chamber. Images of cells with CFP-tagged ARNO and YFP-tagged A2A receptor were captured through corresponding filter channels. To measure donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching (DRAP), we acquired a donor (CFP) image before and after photobleaching using the YFP setting for 90 s (excitation, 500 nm; dichroic mirror, 525 nm; and emission, 535 nm) to calculate a ratio image. Fluorescence images were analyzed using the MetaSeries software MetaFluor and MetaMorph (release 4.6; Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Immunoprecipitation of the Epitope-tagged A2A Receptor—The membranes (0.5 mg) were solubilized in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science)) for 1 h on ice. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant was incubated with anti-Flag M2 affinity matrix (0.1 ml of pre-equilibrated 50% slurry) for 16 h at 4 °C; after repeated washings in buffer, the bound proteins were released by heat denaturation in SDS-containing sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with an antiserum directed against ARNO/cytohesin-2 or with the antibody directed against the Flag epitope. The carboxyl terminus of the A2A adenosine receptor (A2ARCt) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid interaction hunt; a human brain cDNA library was searched for potential interaction partners. The minimum sequence that is required to support efficient MAP kinase activation by the A2A receptor is a construct that contains the first 22 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus (6Klinger M. Kuhn M. Just H. Stefan E. Palmer T. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Naunyn. Schmiedeberg's. Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Of the 18 positive clones that were first identified, we selected a prey insert that, upon retransformation, still interacted with truncated versions of the carboxylterminal tail as strongly as the with the full-length COOH terminus (Fig. 1A, left panel). The only prey insert that fulfilled this criterion contained the PH domain of ARNO/cytohesin-2 (ARNOPH); this prey interacted equally well with two mutated versions that correspond to the removal of 100 and 51 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus, A2ARCt (290-311) and A2ARCt (290-360), respectively. The interaction with both truncated versions induced the same level of β-galactosidase activity as compared with the full-length carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1A, left panel). As an internal control we used USP4, a different interactor, which also binds to the A2A receptor COOH terminus 2T. Milojevic and M. Freissmuth, submitted for publication.; in this case, truncation of the last 50 amino acids greatly reduced the capacity of the bait to induce β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1A, right panel). The direct physical interaction between the two proteins was confirmed in vitro by a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 1B). A purified fusion protein comprising the maltose-binding protein and the carboxyl terminus of the A2A receptor (A2ARCt-MBP) was incubated with GSH-Sepharose in the presence of purified GST-full-length ARNO/cytohesin-2 or the GST-PH domain of ARNO/cytohesin-2 or of GST alone. A2ARCt-MBP fusion protein was eluted as a complex with GST-full-length ARNO/cytohesin-2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6) and GST-ARNOPH (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) but not with GST alone (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). These results confirm the findings of the yeast two-hybrid experiments. More importantly, they rule out the possibility that the interaction arises from an intermediary protein that binds to both ARNO/cytohesin-2 and the carboxyl terminus of the A2A receptor and the ortholog of which may be present in yeast. β-Arrestin, for instance, has been proposed to allow for the recruitment of Arf6 and ARNO to mediate endocytosis of the β2-adrenergic receptor (13Claing A. Chen W. Miller W.E. Vitale N. Moss J. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42509-42513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although the data in Fig. 1 show that the carboxyl terminus can interact with the PH domain of ARNO/cytohesin-2, it does not prove that the receptor binds ARNO/cytohesin-2 in vivo. To visualize the distribution of the two proteins in living cells, we tagged the COOH terminus of the A2A adenosine receptor and the NH2 terminus of the ARNO/cytohesin-2 with spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein, YFP, and CFP, respectively. Wild type and YFP-tagged receptors did not differ in their ability to raise cAMP upon agonist stimulation, i.e. the agonist potency and efficacy were comparable (data not shown). Thus, YFP-A2A adenosine receptors were functionally indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts. When transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells YFP-tagged A2A adenosine receptors were localized at the cell surface and to some extent in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 2A, left panel). In contrast, confocal imaging of CFP-tagged ARNO/cytohesin-2 showed a distribution throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A, middle panel). Interestingly, in cells expressing high levels of CFP-ARNO/cytohesin-2, there appeared to be more YFP-tagged A2A adenosine receptors in the intracellular vesicular compartment (Fig. 2A, cell in the middle and cell on the right). If the two images were overlaid, there was evidence for widespread co-localization of the two proteins at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A, right panel, green color). The overlays are indicative of a close spatial relationship rather than a proof of a direct interaction between proteins. This can be demonstrated by using FRET microscopy. To visualize the interaction of the ARNO/cytohsin-2 and the A2A receptor, we applied the DRAP-FRET method. This method has the advantage that it yields valid results, even if the expression levels of acceptor and donor protein are different. The interaction of a pair of FRET fluorophores within the Foerster distance renders the donor less susceptible to bleaching or enhances donor emission upon acceptor bleaching. Obviously, high levels of illumination lead to a rapid decline of either acceptor or donor fluorescence. In the case of DRAP-FRET, the parameters were set to preserve donor fluorescence while obtaining maximum acceptor bleaching (14Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells overexpressing YFP-A2A adenosine receptors and CFP-ARNO/cytohesin-2, we observed a resonance energy transfer limited to the cell membrane (Fig. 2B). Cells with YFP-fluorescence (before bleaching) are shown in the left panel of Fig. 2B to confirm the expression of the A2A receptor. The cells that only contain YFP-tagged A2A receptor (but no ARNO/cyohesin-2, marked by an asterisk in Fig. 2B) do not show any FRET. In cells that express both, YFP-tagged A2A receptor and CFP-tagged ARNO/cytohesin-2, the increase in donor fluorescence upon acceptor bleaching is confined to the membrane area (Fig. 2B, right panel, arrows). Thus, resonance energy transfer only takes place at the plasma membrane, although the fluorescence signal for ARNO/cytohesin-2 is evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, middle panel) and although there is significant intracellular accumulation of A2A receptors in cells that express ARNO/cytohesin-2 (Fig. 2B, left panel). These experiments show that the A2A receptor and ARNO/cytohesin-2 do not only interact when expressed as fusion proteins in yeast or in bacteria but also interact when co-expressed in mammalian cells. These findings also suggest that this interaction takes place at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, in most of the experiments, uncontrolled overexpression of ARNO/cytohesin-2 resulted in strong phenotypic effects on HEK293 cell morphology and promoted cell rounding (Fig. 2B) and subsequently cell detachment. On the other hand, endogenous expression of ARNO/cytohesin-2 in HEK293 cells is very low and barely detectable by immunoblots with available antisera/antibodies (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1, 4, and 5 with lanes 2 and 3). We therefore generated a HEK293 cell line that stably expressed a Flag-tagged version of the A2A receptor and in which expression of ARNO/cytohesin-2 was inducible (wt-ARN-A2A cells). A corresponding cell line was also generated for the dominant negative version E156K-ARNO/cytohesin-2 (dn-ARN-A2A cells); the point mutation E156K renders ARNO/cytohesin-2 catalytically inactive (15Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Chardin P. Paris S. Chabre M. Cherfils J. Antonny B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3651-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In these cell lines the synthetic promoter of ARNO/cytohesin-2 is under the control of a GAL4-DBD/hPR-LBD/p65-AD regulatory fusion protein, which is activated by binding of mifepristone. Mifepristone drives the expression of ARNO/cytohesin-2 as well as the expression of GAL4-DBD/hPR-LBD/p65-AD through an auto regulatory feedback loop (9Nordstrom J.L. Steroids. 2003; 68: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Stable levels of ARNO/cytohesin-2 and of E156K-ARNO/cytohesin-2 were detected 8-48 and 8-30 h after the addition of mifepristone, respectively. We therefore performed all following experiments 8 h after induction of wild type ARNO/cytohesin-2 and dominant negative ARNO/cytohesin-2 and compared the response of these cells to cells that had not been treated with mifepristone. Under these conditions, the morphology of the cells was unchanged, and the levels of A2A receptor expression were not affected. Finally, we verified that mifepristone did not affect A2A receptor-mediated cAMP accumulation and MAP kinase stimulation in cells that were devoid of a mifepristone-inducible ARNO (data not shown). We incubated cell extracts prepared from wt-ARN-A2A cells with anti-Flag antibodies immobilized on Sepharose beads. The eluate was analyzed by immunoblotting for ARNO/cytohesin-2; immunoreactive material was recovered with the antibody directed against the Flag-tagged A2A receptor, if cells had been induced to express ARNO/cytohesin-2 (Fig. 3C, second lane). A faint band is seen in the eluate of cells that had not been treated with mifepristone (Fig. 3C, third lane). Because this band co-migrates with overexpressed ARNO, it is likely to represent co-immunoprecipitated endogenous ARNO/cytohesin-2. As a control of specificity, we used extracts from cells that overexpress ARNO/cytohesin-2 but do not express the A2A receptor; there is no immunoreactivity for ARNO/cytohesin-2 in this lane (Fig. 3C, fourth lane). These findings corroborate the DRAP-FRET experiments that the A2A receptor and ARNO/cytohesin-2 are indeed able to form complexes in mammalian cells. ARNO/cytohesin-2 is thought to act as the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor of Arf6 (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), a small G protein that affects cell mobility by remodeling of the cortical actin (17Song J. Khachikian Z. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in polarized cells, Arf6 can specify the distribution of G protein-coupled receptors to distinct membrane compartments (18Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Finally, in the LH/HCG (luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin) receptor, another GS-coupled receptor, ARNO/cytohesin-2 is thought to promote receptor desensitization (19Mukherjee S. Casanova J.E. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6524-6528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R.

We therefore determined the effect of ARNO/cytohesin-2 on A2A receptor signaling. For these experiments, we selected two ARN-A2A cell lines that had reasonably comparable levels of receptor expression, that is, the Bmax values were 10.9 ± 1.6 and 12.5 ± 1.7 pmol/mg protein for cell lines with inducible ARNO/cytohesin-2 and the"

Previous studies from our laboratory have identified significant differences in cellular responses to sustained or intermittent hypoxia with the latter proving more cytotoxic. We hypothesized that differences in susceptibility of neurons to intermittent (IH) and sustained hypoxia (SH) are mediated by altered Akt signaling.

Akt immunoprecipitations followed by proteomic analysis identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as an Akt-binding protein.

Protein phosphatase 2A treatment inhibited this acidic shift consistent with SH-induced phosphorylation of VCP in vivo.

Furthermore, VCP association with ubiquitinated proteins was demonstrated in vector-transfected PC-12 cell lysates, whereas active Akt-transfected cells demonstrated a marked decrease in association of VCP with ubiquitinated proteins.

Most mammalian neurons are sensitive to hypoxia to a varying degree. However, the mechanisms underlying this heterogeneous sensitivity are not well understood. Heterotopic differences in hypoxic sensitivity are now well established in the brain during conditions of oxygen deprivation such as hypoxic ischemia and the oxidant stress that follows reperfusion or malonate-induced mitochondrial metabolic disruption (1Kadar T.

Previous studies from our laboratory have identified significant differences in the hypoxic susceptibility of the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions, with CA1 vulnerability being particularly prominent in response to intermittent mild hypoxic episodes (5Gozal D.

These findings suggest that the CA3 region is relatively resistant to hypoxia when compared with the CA1 region, and CA1 regional vulnerability to hypoxia varies depending on the mode, severity, and duration of the hypoxic insult (8Nabetani M.

We have recently shown in PC-12 cells that different signaling pathways are involved in sustained and intermittent hypoxia-induced cell death. Identifying these pathways may contribute to our understanding of differential brain susceptibility to sustained and intermittent hypoxia (11Gozal E. Sachleben Jr., L.R. Rane M.J. Vega C. Gozal D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 288: C535-C542Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that in rat CA1, SH but not IH induces significant increase in Akt activation compared with room air (RA) control, suggesting that differences in Akt signaling maybe implicated in the differences in hypoxia sensitivity in IH versus SH. Proteomic analysis of Akt immunoprecipitates from RA, SH, and IH CA1 samples was performed to identify differences in the assembly of Akt-binding partners among different conditions. These studies demonstrated that SH but not IH increased expression and association of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-proteasome interacting protein, velosin-containing protein 97 (VCP) with Akt, compared with RA-exposed animals. Additionally, VCP was identified as an Akt substrate in vitro and in vivo thereby potentially implicating the VCP-Akt complex in the regulation of protein quality control during SH. VCP is a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) family and is divided into N (residues 1-187), D1 (residues 209-460), D2 (residues 481-761), and C (residues 742-806) domains, and two linkers, N-D1 linker (residues 188-208) and D1-D2 linker (residues 461-480). The N domain is involved in substrate and cofactor binding; D1 is required for oligomerization, and both D1 and D2 domains contribute to the ATPase activity. Intact ATPase activity is required for various biological functions of VCP. VCP is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including altering morphology of nuclear and Golgi membranes, transcriptional regulation, membrane fusion, cell cycle control, stress response, programmed cell death, B and T cell activation, protein degradation, ER-associated degradation, and the dislocation of ubiquitinated proteins from the ER (12Hetzer M.

VCP plays a role in mediating ER-associated protein degradation by interacting with potential proteasome substrates before being degraded by the proteasome. VCP has been shown to associate physically with ubiquitinated IκBα and the 26 S proteasome and to target IκBα to the proteasome for degradation (15Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J.

Here we identify VCP as an Akt-binding protein and as an Akt substrate, suggesting a role for Akt in the regulation of VCP function.

Levine T.P. Peters J.M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 27Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat.

Cell. 1998; 9: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). VCP tyrosine phosphorylation has also been shown to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis, suggesting it to be a pro-proliferation or anti-apoptotic protein (41Imamura S. Ojima N. Yamashita M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, VCP tyrosine dephosphorylation has been shown to destabilize VCP/ER membrane association thereby promoting ER transitional assembly (42Lavoie C. Chevet E. Roy L. Tonks N.K. Fazel A. Posner B.I. Paiement J. Bergeron J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13637-13642Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). VCP has been shown to target proteins to the 26 S proteosome. It is unclear if VCP further modifies ubiquitinated proteins, but it is known that once these proteins are targeted at the proteosome, VCP dissociates from ubiquitinated proteins. The exact mechanism of VCP release from ubiquitinated protein is unclear. Our current data demonstrate that VCP Ser/Thr phosphorylation releases it from ubiquitinated substrate protein(s) possibly allowing ubiquitinated protein(s) to be degraded by the proteosome. Active recombinant Akt was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-Ser473-Akt, anti-pleckstrin homology domain Akt, and anti-Akt antisera were obtained from Cell Signaling Inc (Beverly, MA). Mouse isotype control and VCP antisera were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein A-Sepharose was obtained from Pharmingen. Histone H2B was obtained from Roche Applied Science. The synthetic AKTide-2T inhibitory peptide (ARKRERTYSFGHHA) and scrambled peptide (HAKEAYGHARRPRA) were obtained from the Macromolecular Structure Analysis Facility at the University of Kentucky (Lexington, KY). Animals—Animal experimental protocols were approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and are in agreement with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (weights175-225 g) were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Hypoxic Exposures—Hypoxic exposures were conducted in four identical commercially designed chambers (30 × 20 × 20 inches) that can accommodate up to 12 rats each and were operated under a 12-h light-dark cycle (Oxycycler model A44XO, Biospherix, Redfield, NY). Ambient CO2 in the chamber was constantly monitored and maintained at <0.03% by servo-controlled adjustments in overall chamber ventilation, and humidity was maintained at <40%. Animals were exposed to either room air (RA), SH (8% O2), or IH (8% O2 to 21% O2 alternating every 6 min). CA1 Sample Preparation—Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (intraperitoneal 50 mg/kg) and decapitated. Brains were dissected on ice to retrieve the hippocampal formation bilaterally, and the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus were then dissected as described previously (7Gozal E. Gozal D. Pierce W.M. Thongboonkerd V. Scherzer J.A. Sachleben Jr., L.R. Brittian K.R. Guo S.Z. Cai J. Klein J.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 43Klein J.B.

Tissues corresponding to the CA1 region harvested from either normoxic or hypoxic animals were homogenized on ice with a tissue tearer in 300 μl of sample buffer (58 mm dithiothreitol, 65 mm CHAPS, 7 m urea, 1.9 m thiourea, 1.75% pH 3-10 carrier ampholytes). The mixture was then mixed for 1 h and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined in the soluble supernatant, using the RC-DC-Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) to avoid interference of ampholytes and reducing agents present in the buffer, with accurate protein determination. In addition, an equal amount of proteins from each sample was separated on a Tris/glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue staining to confirm visually the accuracy of the assay. PC-12 Cell Culture and Transfection—PC-12 cells were cultured on collagen-coated plates in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), and 5% heat-inactivated (30 min at 56 °C) horse serum (Hyclone). Cells were exposed normoxia (21% O2, 5% CO2, balanced N2) or to a defined profile of sustained hypoxia (0.1% O2, 5% CO2, balanced N2), using a custom-designed computer-controlled incubator chamber attached to an external O2/CO2 computer-driven controller (Biospherix, Redfield, NY), for 6 h unless otherwise stated. Chamber oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide levels were continuously monitored and adjusted according to the programmed profile. Media oxygen content was monitored with a fiberoptics oxygen sensor (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL). Oxygen levels in the air-phase as well as in the media were monitored and recorded as described previously (11Gozal E. Sachleben Jr., L.R. Rane M.J. Vega C. Gozal D. Am. J.

Transient Transfection of PC-12 Cells—PC-12 cells were plated on collagen-coated 6-well trays each day prior to performing transfections, to reach 60% confluence. On the day of transfection, PC-12 cells were washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. One μg of appropriate cDNA was transfected into PC-12 cells using geneporter reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Gene Therapy Systems). Twenty-four h after transfection, PC-12 cells were lysed in 100 μl of Akt lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm p-nitrophenol phosphate, 20 mm NaF, 5 mm PMSF, 21 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and proteins concentrations were determined. Protein lysates (100 μg) were diluted to 160 μl in urea/thiourea rehydration buffer (Genomic Solutions) and subjected to two-dimensional PAGE as described above. Alternatively, protein lysates (50 μg) were subjected to one-dimensional PAGE and immunoblot analysis.

The next day protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl) were added to the lysates and incubated further at 4 °C with shaking. Antibody-conjugated protein A-Sepharose beads were washed three times, and immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 40 μl of 2× Laemmli dye. Samples were boiled for 2 min; beads were precipitated by a quick spin in a picofuge, and 40 μl of supernatant containing eluted proteins was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody (1:1000 dilution).

PC-12 cells were pretreated with 50 μm LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor for 1 h prior to subjecting cells to sustained hypoxia (0.1% O2 for 6 h) or RA treatments. After the treatments, PC-12 cells were lysed with 100 μl of Akt lysis buffer. Lysates were subjected to protein determination (DC, Bio-Rad) and 50 μg of protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-pAktSer473 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Akt (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-actin antibody as described previously (44Rane M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2060143030,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a protein kinase A and ATP-regulated Cl– channel that also controls the activity of other membrane transport proteins, such as the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC. Previous studies demonstrated that cytosolic domains of ENaC are critical for down-regulation of ENaC by CFTR, whereas others suggested a role of cytosolic Cl– ions. We therefore examined in detail the anion dependence of ENaC and the role of its cytosolic domains for the inhibition by CFTR and the Cl– channel CLC-0. Coexpression of rat ENaC with human CFTR or the human Cl– channel CLC-0 caused inhibition of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents after cAMP-dependent stimulation and in the presence of a 100 mm bath Cl– concentration. After activation of CFTR by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and forskolin or expression of CLC-0, the intracellular Cl– concentration was increased in Xenopus oocytes in the presence of a high bath Cl– concentration, which inhibited ENaC without changing surface expression of αβγENaC. In contrast, a 5 mm bath Cl– concentration reduced the cytosolic Cl– concentration and enhanced ENaC activity. ENaC was also inhibited by injection of Cl– into oocytes and in inside/out macropatches by exposure to high cytosolic Cl– concentrations. The effect of Cl– was mimicked by Br–, Br-,NO3-, and I–. Inhibition by Cl– was reduced in trimeric channels with a truncated COOH terminus of βENaC and γENaC, and it was no longer detected in dimeric αΔCβ ENaC channels. Deletion of the NH2 terminus of α-, β-, or γENaC, mutations in the NH2-terminal phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate-binding domain of βENaC and γEnaC, and activation of phospholipase C, all reduced ENaC activity but allowed for Cl–-dependent inhibition of the remaining ENaC current. The results confirm a role of the carboxyl terminus of βENaC for Cl–-dependent inhibition of the Na+ channel, which, however, may only be part of a complex regulation of ENaC by CFTR.

Interestingly, the reverse, namely an up-regulation of CFTR currents by ENaC coexpression, has also been observed (12Jiang Q. Li J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J.

Possible contributions by additional proteins and factors to the CFTR regulation of ENaC has been examined in subsequent studies. CFTR carries a so-called PDZ-binding domain, a common site for protein interaction at the COOH terminus, which binds regulatory proteins such as NHERF (23Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This PDZ domain is essential for proper expression of CFTR in the apical plasma membrane of polarized cells (24Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M.

Whereas in Xenopus oocytes this domain was neither important for expression of CFTR nor for inhibition of ENaC by CFTR, in polarized epithelial cells NHERF affects expression of both CFTR and ENaC (26Boucherot A. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1515: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Schreiber R. Boucherot A. Mürle B. Sun J. Kunzelmann K. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 199: 89-98Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms were excluded, such as release of ATP by CFTR, followed by purinergic inhibition of ENaC (28König J. Schreiber R. Mall M. Kunzelmann K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Also changes in cell volume, which may occur during activation of Cl– conductances, are unlikely to explain the negative effects of CFTR on ENaC (29Schreiber R. König J. Sun J. Markovich D. Kunzelmann K. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 192: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, independent reports demonstrated a role of Cl– ions (15Ji H.L. Chalfant M.L. Jovov B.

It has known for some time that Na+ and Cl– conductances are controlled by the cytosolic Cl– concentration in intralobular duct cells of the mouse mandibular gland (31Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that the control of ENaC currents by intracellular anions is mediated by G proteins in salivary duct cells, but not in Xenopus oocytes (32Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 487: 549-555Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Hübner M. Schreiber R. Boucherot A. Sanchez-Perez A. Poronnik P. Cook D.I. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Different mechanisms have been shown for inhibition of ENaC by cytosolic Na+ and Cl– (34Komwatana P. Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our initial work suggested that influx of Cl– into the oocyte rather than the efflux is inhibiting ENaC (9Briel M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 825-836Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although a role of Cl– for the inhibition of ENaC by CFTR was not found in all studies (19Konstas A.A. Koch J.P. Korbmacher C. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 445: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Chabot H. Vives M.F. Dagenais A. Grygorczyk C. Berthiaume Y. Grygorczyk R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), subsequent work in both epithelial tissues and Xenopus oocytes confirmed that intracellular Cl– ions decrease expression of ENaC protein (36Niisato N. Eaton D.C. Marunaka Y. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 287: F932-F939Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and acutely inhibit ENaC currents (15Ji H.L. Chalfant M.L. Jovov B. Lockhart J.P.

Recent studies with polarized epithelial cells expressing ENaC along with CFTR and Ca2+-activated Cl– channels, demonstrate an increase in intracellular Cl– by stimulation of CFTR or Ca2+-dependent Cl– channels (38Adam G. Ousingsawat J. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Pflügers Arch. 2005; 449: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This increase in intracellular Cl– is paralleled by inhibition of amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents are also inhibited in patch clamp experiments, when high Cl– concentrations are present on the cytosolic side (27Schreiber R. Boucherot A. Mürle B. Sun J. Kunzelmann K. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 199: 89-98Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 38Adam G. Ousingsawat J. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Pflügers Arch. 2005; 449: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest a role of Cl– ions for inhibition of ENaC by CFTR or other Cl– channels. These channels cause an increase in the intracellular Cl– concentration when a large parallel Na+ conductance is present (39Kunzelmann K. Pflügers Arch. 2003; 445: 505-512Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We therefore tried in the present study to identify a Cl–-sensitive side in ENaC. We found that amino and carboxyl termini of α-, β-, and γENaC control ENaC activity and show a role of the COOH terminus of βENaC for inhibition by Cl–. Ussing Chamber Experiments—Mouse M1 collecting duct cells were grown to confluence on permeable supports and were mounted into a modified Ussing chamber with a circular aperture of 0.95 mm2. M1 cells are derived from mouse cortical collecting duct and have properties of principal cells (kindly provided by C. Korbmacher, Physiologisches Institut, Universität Erlangen, Germany). Luminal and basolateral sides of the epithelium were perfused continuously at a rate of 10 ml/min (chamber volume 2 ml). The bath solution had the following composition (mmol/liter): NaCl, 145; KH2PO4, 0.4; K2HPO4, 1.6; d-glucose, 5; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 5; calcium gluconate, 1.3. pH was adjusted to 7.4. Bath solutions were heated to 37 °C using a water jacket. Experiments were carried out under open circuit conditions. Values for transepithelial voltages (Vte) were referred to the serosal side of the epithelium. Transepithelial resistance (Rte) was determined by applying short (1 s) current pulses (ΔI = 0.5 μA) and the resistance of the empty chamber was subtracted. Rte was calculated according to Ohms law (Rte = ΔVte/ΔI). The equivalent short circuit current (Isc) was calculated (Isc = Vte/Rte) and the amiloride-sensitive Isc (Isc-Amil) is used to express the amount of equivalent short circuit current that is inhibited by 10 μmol/liter amiloride. Tissue preparations were only accepted if the transepithelial resistance exceeded that of an empty chamber at least by a factor of 3. The transepithelial resistance of filter grown M1 cells was 387 ± 39 ohm cm2 (n = 20). cRNAs for ENaC Subunits, CFTR, and CLC-0 and ENaC Mutants—cDNAs encoding rat αβγENaC (kindly provided by Prof. Dr. B. Rossier, Pharmacological Institute of Lausanne, Switzerland) and Cl– channels CFTR or CLC-0 were linearized in pBluescript or pTLN (40Kieferle S. Fong P. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6943-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) with NotI or MluI, and in vitro transcribed using T7, T3, or SP6 promotor and polymerase (Promega). For some experiments cDNAs of FLAG-tagged αβγENaC subunits were used (kindly provided by Prof. B. Rossier, University of Lausanne, Switzerland) (41Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Isolation and microinjection of oocytes have been described in a previous report (8Mall M. Hipper A. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In brief, after isolation from adult Xenopus laevis female frogs (Xenopus express, South Africa and Kähler, Germany), oocytes were dispersed and defolliculated by a 45-min treatment with collagenase (type A, Boehringer, Germany). Subsequently, oocytes were rinsed and kept at 18 °C in NMDG/ND96 buffer (in mmol/liter): NMDG3, 96; HCl, 80; KCl, 2; CaCl2, 1.8; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 5; sodium pyruvate, 2.5; pH 7.55), supplemented with theophylline (0.5 mmol/liter) and gentamicin (5 mg/liter). Mutations in the NH2-terminal phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2)-binding domains of β- and γENaC were generated by replacing 2 (β2N, γ2N) and 4 (β4N, γ4N) positively charged amino acids by non-polar (N) amino acids as described in Ref. 42Kunzelmann K. Bachhuber T. Regeer R.R. Markovich D. Sun J. Schreiber R. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 142-163Google Scholar. αΔN, βΔN, and γΔN indicate that the NH2 terminus of α-, β-, and γ-subunits was shortened by removing the first 94, 50, and 94 initial amino acids, respectively, and in some cases replaced by other N-terminal subunits (43Kunzelmann K. Kidney Blood Press. Res. 1997; 20: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). All other mutations and truncations (αP671A, αΔC = αH647X; βΔC = βR561X and βV554X; γΔC = γS608X and γR565X) have been generated by PCR techniques and correct sequences were verified by sequencing. Double Electrode Voltage Clamp—Oocytes were injected with cRNA (1–10 ng) after dissolving in 47 nl of double-distilled water (Nanoliter Injector WPI, Germany). Water-injected oocytes served as controls. 2–4 days after injection, oocytes were impaled with two electrodes (Clark instruments) that had a resistances of <1 megohm when filled with 2.7 mol/liter KCl. Using two bath electrodes and a virtual-ground head-stage, the voltage drop across Rserial was effectively zero. Membrane currents were measured by voltage clamping of the oocytes (Warner oocyte clamp amplifier OC725C) in intervals from –90 to +30 mV, in steps of 10 mV, each 1 s. Conductances were calculated according to Ohms law, and amiloride-sensitive conductances (GAmil) were used in the present report to express the amount of whole cell conductance that is inhibited by 10 μmol/liter amiloride. During the whole experiment, the bath was continuously perfused at a rate of 5–10 ml/min. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 °C). Chemiluminescence Measurements—Oocytes were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in ND96 media (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2·2 H2O, 1 MgCl2·6 H2O, 5 HEPES, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH) with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block nonspecific binding of antibodies. Afterward oocytes were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (clone M2, Sigma) in 1% BSA/ND96, washed eight times at 4 °C with 1% BSA/ND96, and incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Bioscience) diluted 1:20000 in 1% BSA/ND96 for 40 min at 4 °C. Then oocytes were washed for 60 min at 4 °C in 1% BSA/ND96 and in ND96 (60 min, 4 °C) and placed separately in 50 μl of ECL Plus Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences). After an incubation period of 5 min at room temperature, chemiluminescence was measured in a BioOrbit 1250 Luminometer (Turku, Finland). The integration period was 1 s and the results were obtained in millivolts (mV). Fluorescence Measurements—Oocytes were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in ND96 media (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2·2H2O, 1 MgCl2·6 H2O, 5 HEPES, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH) with 1% BSA to block nonspecific binding of antibodies. Afterwards oocytes were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody in 1% BSA/ND96, washed eight times at 4 °C with 1% BSA/ND96, and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG1 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1% BSA/ND96 for 60 min at room temperature and in the dark. Oocytes were washed for 60 min at room temperature and in the dark in 1% BSA/ND96 and then under the same conditions for 60 min in ND96. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 35-inverted microscope with a ×3.2 objective and digitized with a Nikon D100 camera. Macropatch—Xenopus oocytes expressing ENaC were defolliculated and were placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (IM35, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The bath was continuously perfused with Ringer solution at a rate of about 10 ml/min. Patch clamp experiments were performed in cell-excised inside/out and outside/out configurations. The patch pipettes had an input resistance of 2–4 ohm when filled with a solution containing (mmol/liter) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2·2H2O, 1 MgCl2·6H2O, 5 HEPES, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, 1 diphenylcarboxylate at pH 7.5. Currents (voltage clamp) and voltages (current clamp) were recorded using a patch clamp amplifier (EPC 9, HECA, Lambrecht, Germany), and data were stored continuously on a computer hard disc. In regular intervals, membrane voltages (Vc) were clamped in steps of 10 mV from –50 to +50 mV. G was calculated from the measured I and Vc values according to Ohms law. Materials and Statistical Analysis—All compounds were of highest available grade of purity. Nystatin, amiloride, NMDG, PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus and ATP were from Sigma. U73122 was from Calbiochem. The anti-PIP2 antibody was from Echelon. Student's t test p values <0.05 were accepted to indicate statistical significance. n indicates the number of experiments. Whole cell currents produced by the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC were partially inhibited by activation of CFTR through stimulation with IBMX (1 mmol/liter) and forskolin (2 μmol/liter). Inhibition was reversible when extracellular (bath) Cl– concentration was reduced from 100 to 5 mm. This is shown as a continuous whole cell current recording of an oocyte coexpressing CFTR and ENaC (Fig. 1A) and is summarized in Fig. 1B. In oocytes expressing ENaC only, the amiloride-sensitive conductance (GAmil) of 59.2 ± 7.9 microsiemens was not changed when the extracellular Cl– concentration was reduced to 5 mmol/liter (GAmil = 59.9 ± 8.2 μS; n = 9). All experiments were performed using a bath clamp, which minimizes voltage drops along the series resistances. However, we included two sets of control experiments. (i) We permeabilized ENaC expressing oocytes with 10 μm nystatin, which induced a nonselective conductance without affecting amiloride-sensitive membrane currents (Fig. 1D). GAmil was 19.3 ± 2.7 and 23.3 ± 3 μS (n = 7) in the absence and presence of nystatin, respectively. (ii) ENaC was coexpressed with KVLQT1 K+ channels, and amiloride-sensitive currents were assessed in the absence or presence of the K+ channel blocker Ba2+ (5 mm), which did not affect Na+ transport (Fig. 1E): GAmil was 7.9 ± 1.3 and 7.5 ± 1.1 μS (n = 9) in the absence and presence of Ba2+, respectively. Thus, additional currents do not compromise the measurement of ENaC currents in our setup. Cl– currents generated by CFTR but not non-selective currents or K+ currents inhibited ENaC. We examined the Cl– dependence of the CFTR effect on ENaC in more detail and found that in oocytes, in which CFTR had been activated by IBMX/forskolin, a gradual increase in the bath Cl– concentration from 2 to 100 mm, gradually inhibited ENaC currents, in parallel to the increase of CFTR Cl– currents (Fig. 2, A and C). Moreover, we coexpressed the Cl– channel CLC-0 together with ENaC and found a comparable decrease of ENaC currents with increasing bath Cl– concentrations (Fig. 2, B and D). Thus, Cl– ions play an essential role in both CFTR, and CLC-0 induced inhibition of ENaC. When ENaC was inhibited by amiloride, oocyte membranes are dominated by a Cl– conductance. Thus it is possible to measure the Cl– diffusion potential and to calculate for the apparent intracellular Cl– concentration. We found that in the presence of activated CFTR or when CLC-0 was coexpressed, increase in bath Cl– from 5 to 100 mm resulted in a change of the apparent intracellular Cl– concentration from about 10 to roughly 60 mm (Fig. 2, E and F). In parallel, ∼50% of the initial amiloride-sensitive Na+ current was inhibited, indicating that an increase in cytosolic Cl– inhibits ENaC. We observed a recovery of amiloride-sensitive conductances over the time course of 30 min, when bath Cl– was reduced from 100 to 5 mm in ENaC/CLC-0 coexpressing oocytes. Finally, injection of 23 nl of 50 mm NaCl also inhibited ENaC, whereas injection of water or 5 mm NaCl had no effect (data not shown). In summary, increase in intracellular Cl– inhibits ENaC, which may be in charge of the inhibitory effects of CFTR or CLC-0 on ENaC. This was further confirmed in experiments with macropatches from ENaC expressing oocytes, after verifying expression by double electrode voltage clamp. Patch pipettes were filled with 1 mm diphenylcarboxylate, to minimize endogenous Cl– currents. A current noise was recorded from excised inside/out macropatches, which was largely increased when the cytosolic Cl– concentration was reduced from 100 to 5 mm (Fig. 3, A and B). 95 mm Na+ were replaced by NMDG+ in the presence of low or high bath Cl–. We found that the NMDG+ that inhibited Na+ conductance in macropatches was 86.2 ± 6.2 microsiemens in the presence of 5 mm cytosolic Cl–, which was significantly larger when compared with that observed at 100 mm Cl– (27.3 ± 2.1 microsiemens). We then exposed the cytosolic side of the macropatches to different Cl– concentrations, ranging from 5 to 100 mm. As shown in Fig. 3B, a gradual increase in cytosolic Cl– inhibited the conductance of excised inside out membrane patches. Finally, we confirmed expression of ENaC in excised outside/out patches and found inhibition of membrane conductance by amiloride (10 μm) from 228 ± 70 to"
https://openalex.org/W2039684178,"In this work we have characterized the galA gene product from Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a ring-cleavage dioxygenase that acts specifically on gallate to produce 4-oxalomesaconate. The protein is a trimer composed by three identical subunits of 47.6 kDa (419 amino acids) that uses Fe2+ as the main cofactor. The gallate dioxygenase showed maximum activity at pH 7.0, and the Km and Vmax values for gallate were 144 μm and 53.2 μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. A phylogenetic study suggests that the gallate dioxygenase from P. putida KT2440 is the prototype of a new subgroup of type II extradiol dioxygenases that share a common ancestor with protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenases and whose two-domain architecture might have evolved from the fusion of the large and small subunits of the latter. A three-dimensional model for the N-terminal domain (residues 1–281) and C-terminal domain (residues 294–420) of the gallate dioxygenase from P. putida KT2440 was generated by comparison with the crystal structures of the large (LigB) and small (LigA) subunits of the protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase from Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6. The expression of the galA gene was specifically induced when P. putida KT2440 cells grew in the presence of gallate. A P. putida KT2440 galA mutant strain was unable to use gallate as the sole carbon source and it did not show gallate dioxygenase activity, suggesting that the GalA protein is the only dioxygenase involved in gallate cleavage in this bacterium.

The variety and number of complete microbial genome sequences is increasing at an unprecedented rate. To date, more than 200 bacterial genomes have been successfully sequenced and nearly 1000 genomes are currently in progress, which provides an enormous amount of data for comparative genomic analysis and for identifying new enzymes, regulators, and pathways, including key aspects of genome evolution and bacterial adaptation (1DeLong E.F.

Among bacteria, Pseudomonas species constitute a large diverse group of ubiquitous γ-proteobacteria that are well known for their broad metabolic versatility and genetic plasticity. Pseudomonas putida is one of the best studied species of the genus and many aspects of its biology have been unraveled (2Wackett L.P. Nat.

Miñambres B. García J.L. Díaz E. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas. 3. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2004: 425-462Google Scholar, 6Jiménez J.I. Miñambres B. García J.L. Díaz E. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 824-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This search revealed the presence of three central pathways, the ortho pathway for the catabolism of protocatechuate (pca genes) and catechol (cat genes), the phenylacetate pathway (pha genes), and the homogentisate pathway (hmg genes). A number of peripheral routes that channel different aromatic compounds to some of the three central pathways were also identified (4Jiménez J.I. Miñambres B. García J.L. Díaz E. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas. 3. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2004: 425-462Google Scholar, 6Jiménez J.I. Miñambres B. García J.L. Díaz E. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 824-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). A key enzyme in the aerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds is the ring-cleavage dioxygenase that opens the aromatic ring. There are two distinct classes of ring-cleavage dioxygenases: (i) intradiol dioxygenases, which cleave the aromatic nucleus ortho to (between) the hydroxyl substituents, and (ii) extradiol dioxygenases, which cleave the aromatic ring meta (adjacent) to the hydroxyl substituents. Whereas intradiol dioxygenases only cleave substrates possessing vicinal hydroxyl groups (catecholic compounds), the extradiol dioxygenases may act both on catecholic and non-catecholic compounds (7Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas. Vol. 3. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2004: 359-395Crossref Google Scholar). Extradiol dioxygenases belong to at least three evolutionary independent families. Type I extradiol dioxygenases belong to the vicinal oxygen chelate superfamily and include two-domain enzymes, such as the 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase from Burkholderia sp. LB400, and one-domain enzymes, such as the 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenases II and III from Rhodococcus globerulus P6 (7Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas. Vol. 3. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2004: 359-395Crossref Google Scholar), corresponding to Class II and Class I dioxygenases according to Spence et al. (8Spence E.L. Kawamukai M. Sanvoisin J. Braven H. Bugg T.D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5249-5256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type III dioxygenases belong to the cupin superfamily and include enzymes such as the gentisate and homogentisate dioxygenases (7Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas. Vol. 3. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2004: 359-395Crossref Google Scholar). Type II dioxygenases are multimers possessing one, e.g. the 2,3-dihydroxyphenylpropionate 1,2-dioxygenase (MhpB) from Escherichia coli, or two different subunit types (7Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas. Vol. 3. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2004: 359-395Crossref Google Scholar). In the case of the protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase from Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6, which has an α2β2 composition, the large (β) and small (α) subunits appear to be unrelated, with the β subunit being similar to the protomers of the homooligomeric enzymes (7Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas. Vol. 3. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2004: 359-395Crossref Google Scholar, 9Sugimoto K. Senda T. Aoshima H. Masai E. Fukuda M. Mitsui Y. Structure. 1999; 7: 953-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, the two subunits of the 2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenase share sequence similarity but it appears that only the β subunit contains an active site (10Takenaka S. Murakami S. Shinke R. Hatakeyama K. Yukawa H. Aoki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14727-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Even though these three types of extradiol dioxygenases present different structural folds, they all share similar active sites and the two histidines and one glutamate structural motif for Fe2+ coordination (7Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas. Vol. 3. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2004: 359-395Crossref Google Scholar). In P. putida KT2440 we had identified three intradiol dioxygenases, the CatA and CatA2 catechol 1,2-dioxygenases and the PcaGH protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, and one extradiol dioxygenase, the HmgA homogentisate dioxygenase (4Jiménez J.I. Miñambres B. García J.L. Díaz E. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas. 3. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2004: 425-462Google Scholar, 6Jiménez J.I. Miñambres B. García J.L. Díaz E. Environ.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5062-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this work we have characterized the galA gene of P. putida KT2440, which is the first one reported to code for a specific gallate dioxygenase. The characterization of the gallate dioxygenase from P. putida KT2440 revealed not only that this enzyme is a prototype of a new subgroup of type II extradiol dioxygenases, but also suggested the existence of a novel aromatic catabolic pathway involved in gallate mineralization in P. putida KT2440.

E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) containing, where appropriate, ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (50 μg/ml). P. putida KT2440 cells were grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium or in MC minimal medium (16Barragán M.J.L. Carmona M. Zamarro M.T. Thiele B. Boll M. Fuchs G. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5762-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) containing 0.2% citrate. Where appropriate, 50 μg/ml kanamycin was added to the culture medium. P. putida KT2440 cells were adapted to grow in MC minimal medium containing 1 mm l-cysteine, acting as a reducing agent to prevent gallic acid oxidation, and 5 mm gallic acid as sole carbon source. Molecular Biology Techniques—Standard molecular biology techniques were performed as previously described (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). PCR products were purified with the High Pure plasmid isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). DNA fragments were purified with Gene-Clean Turbo (Q-BIO-gene). Genomic DNA from P. putida KT2440 was isolated with the Genomic Prep Cells and Tissue DNA Isolation kit (Amersham Biosciences). All cloned inserts and DNA fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide terminators (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) and AmpliTaq FS DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems Inc.) in an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Transformation of E. coli cells was carried out using the RbCl method (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Sequence Data Analysis—Nucleotide sequence analyses were done at the INFOBIOGEN server (www.infobiogen.fr/services/menuserv.html). A homology search with finished and unfinished microbial genome data bases was performed with the TBLASTN algorithm (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information server (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi). Amino acid sequences retrieved from the protein data bases were aligned using the ClustalW program (19Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) at the INFOBIOGEN server. Phylogenetic analysis of the type II extradiol dioxygenases was carried out according to the two-parameter method of Kimura (20Kimura M. J. Mol. Evol. 1980; 16: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (22585) Google Scholar) and a tree was reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method (21Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) of the PHYLIP program (22Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogenetic Inference Package) Version 3.5.1. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA1993Google Scholar). Modeling of Gallate Dioxygenase—The three-dimensional models for the N- and C-terminal domains of the gallate dioxygenase from P. putida KT2440 were built using the automated SWISS-MODEL Protein Homology-Modeling Server (23Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase from S. paucimobilis SYK-6 (Protein Data Bank entry 1BOU) was used as template. The gallate dioxygenase homology model was superimposed onto the crystal structure of the protocatechuate/protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1B4U) using the PyMOL viewer program (24DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Overproduction of Gallate Dioxygenase—The galA gene was PCR amplified from P. putida KT2440 genomic DNA using oligonucleotides GalA5′ (5′-CGCATATGGCTCGTATCATTGGTGG-3′; the galA start codon is indicated in boldface type, and an engineered NdeI restriction site is underlined) and GalA3′ (5′-CGGAATTCTCCAGGGATGGGCAAAGCGC-3′; located at 100-bp from the galA stop codon; an engineered EcoRI restriction site is underlined). The resulting 1.3-kb DNA fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and then subcloned as a NdeI/EcoRI DNA fragment into NdeI/EcoRI double-digested pET-29a(+) plasmid, giving rise to plasmid pETGalA (6.7 kb) that expresses the galA gene under control of the T7lac promoter and the ribosome-binding site from the pET-29a(+) plasmid. E. coli BLB21(DE3) cells harboring plasmid pETGalA were grown until the cultures (1 liter) reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5. Overexpression of the cloned gene was then induced during 3 h by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested at 4 °C, resuspended in 100 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm MOPS, 2The abbreviations used are: MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidOMA4-oxalomesaconatePDC2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid. pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate, and 2 mm l-cysteine hydrochloride), and disrupted by two consecutive passages through a French press (Aminco Corp.) operated at a pressure of 20,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatant fluid was carefully decanted and used as the crude extract fraction. 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 4-oxalomesaconate 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid. Purification of Gallate Dioxygenase—The purification of gallate dioxygenase from P. putida KT2440 was performed at 4 °C by a combination of ultracentrifugation and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. The E. coli BLB21(DE3) (pETGalA) crude extract (100 ml, 490 mg of protein) was ultracentrifuged at 80,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant (step 2, ultracentrifugation fraction) was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with extraction buffer containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. Proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient (1 to 0 m)of ammonium sulfate in 1 liter of extraction buffer, and protein concentrations and gallate dioxygenase activity were assayed. The gallate dioxygenase eluted around 0.1 m ammonium sulfate (step 3, phenyl-Sepharose fraction). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence Determination—The N-terminal amino acid sequence of gallate dioxygenase from P. putida KT2440 was determined by Edman degradation with a 477A automated protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). A crude extract of E. coli BLB21(DE3) (pETGalA) cells was loaded in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gallate dioxygenase was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) as described previously (26Speicher D.W. Methods. 1994; 6: 262-273Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments of purified gallate dioxygenase solutions in extraction buffer were carried out at 40,000 rpm and 20 °C in an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter Inc.) equipped with UV-visible absorbance optics, using an An60Ti rotor and 12-mm double-sector centerpieces of Eponcharcoal. Absorbance scans were measured at 280 nm. Sedimentation coefficient distributions, c(s), were calculated by least-squares boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data using the program SEDFIT (27Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). These coefficients were corrected to standard conditions (water and 20 °C) to obtain the corresponding s20,w values using the SEDNTERP program (28Laue T.M. Shah R.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S. Rowe A. Norton J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. 90. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The latter program was also used to calculate the partial specific volume of the protein (0.7326 ml/g) from its amino acid composition. Short-column (80 μl) sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at two successive speeds (10,000 and 13,000 rpm) on parallel protein samples. Afterward, baselines were measured at high speed (40,000 rpm). The weight-average molar mass of the protein was calculated by fitting the experimental gradients to the equation that describes the radial concentration distribution of a solute at sedimentation equilibrium, as implemented in the EQASSOC program (29Minton A.P. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhäuser, Boston, MA1994: 81-93Google Scholar). Gallate Dioxygenase Assays—The activity of the gallate dioxygenase was measured by monitoring the substrate-dependent oxygen consumption rate at 30 °C using an oxygen electrode (DW1 Hansa-Tech Oxygen Electrode, Hansa-Tech Oxygen Instrument Limited). The 1-ml assay mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, gallate dioxygenase (15 μg of purified protein or 20 μg of gallate dioxygenase-containing crude extract), and 250 μm of the aromatic substrate (gallate, protocatechuate, catechol, resorcinolate, resorcinol, gentisate, hydroquinone, pyrogallol, methylgallate, or syringate). The gallate dioxygenase activity in crude extracts was also measured spectrophotometrically by following the decrease in absorbance at 265 nm (ϵ265 of gallic acid is 6,700 m-1 cm-1). Kinetic parameters such as Km and Vmax were calculated with the oxygen electrode by changing the gallate concentration from 0.0005 to 5 mm (7 of the 10 data points covered the concentration range of 0.5–10 × Km) in three independent experiments (with S.D. values of <10%) and directly fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation with a nonlinear regression program (GraphPad Software; www.graphpad.com). Temperature and pH optimal were calculated by assaying the gallate dioxygenase over a temperature range from 20 to 40 °C and a pH range from 6.0 to 9.0, respectively. The influence of different agents on the gallate dioxygenase activity was tested by incubating samples of the purified enzyme (1 mg/ml) with 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl, or 1 mm hydrogen peroxide at 4 °C for 30 min in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, buffer. The enzyme reaction was started by adding 250 μm gallic acid. Whereas reactivation of the EDTA- or 2,2′-dipyridyl-inhibited enzyme was performed by adding 2 mm of the different metal salts (FeSO4, MgCl2, MnSO4, ZnCl2, CoCl2, CuCl2, or NiCl2) or ferric citrate, hydrogen peroxide-treated enzyme was reactivated by adding 10 mm sodium ascorbate. The samples were then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was started by adding 250 μm of gallic acid. Identification of the Reaction Product from Gallic Acid—The reaction mixture (5 ml) consisted of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 μg of gallate dioxygenase, and 2 mm gallic acid. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 1 h with vigorous shaking. Where appropriate, the reaction mixture was acidified with 10 n hydrochloric acid to pH 1.0 and extracted with ethyl acetate. NMR samples were prepared in 100% D2O. The spectra were acquired at 298 K on an AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer, equipped with a broad-band z-gradient probe (Bruker). Heteronuclear single-quantum coherent spectrometry (30Santoro J. King C.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 202-207Google Scholar) experiments were performed using the standard procedures provided by the manufacturer. Two different pH values, 8.0 and 3.0, were used. Mass spectra were performed in a LCQ Deca XP plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Instruments) using an ion trap analyzer. The sample was analyzed by direct injection in the electrospray source, using a syringe pump with a 5-μl/min flux. The conditions used were as follows: voltage spray, 4000 V; input temperature, 250 °C; Seath gas flow, 29 (arbitrary units); capillary voltage, 20 V. Additionally, three experiments were performed in negative and full scan mode, with zoom scan of the ions defined by m/z 201 and 183. Moreover, a MS/MS analysis was also performed on these key peaks and they gave rise to a loss of 44 units (decarboxylation), thus originating new peaks with [M-H]- at m/z 139 and 157.1 units. Also, electrospray ionization with the quadruple analyzer was performed using a HPLC1100MSD spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). Flow injection analysis of the sample was used with a methanol flux rate of 0.2 ml/min. The fragmentation voltage was 60 V; the nitrogen flux, 10 liters/min; the nebulizer pressure, 50 p.s.i.; the gas temperature, 335 °C, and the voltage spray, 4000 V. Construction of a P. putida KT2440dgalA Mutant Strain—To disrupt the galA gene in P. putida KT2440 by single homologous recombination, an internal fragment of galA was PCR amplified by using oligonucleotides GalA5′int (5′-CGGAATTCGACATGAGCTTTTCCGCG-3′, the EcoRI restriction site is underlined) and GalA3′int (5′-CGGAATTCAGCGTTTCCTGAGCGAAC-3′, the EcoRI restriction site is underlined). The resulting 0.7-kb DNA fragment was cloned into the EcoRI-digested pK18mob suicide vector (a mobilizable plasmid that does not replicate in Proteobacteria other than E. coli), giving rise to plasmid pK18GalAint (4.5 kb). To transfer the pK18GalAint plasmid into P. putida KT2440, triparental filter mating was performed as previously described (31de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) using E. coli DH10B (pK18GalAint) (donor strain), E. coli HB101 (pRK600) (helper strain), and P. putida KT2440 (recipient strain). A P. putida KT2440dgalA exconjugant harboring the galA-disrupted gene was isolated on MC minimal medium plates containing citrate (which selected for the Pseudomonas recipient cells) and kanamycin (which selected for the insertion of the suicide vector) after incubation at 30 °C for 16 h. The mutant strain was analyzed by PCR to confirm the disruption of the galA gene. Monitoring galA Expression in P. putida KT2440—P. putida KT2440 cells were grown in citrate-containing MC medium. When the cultures reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5, samples were removed and 1 mm of the different aromatic compounds, i.e. gallate, protocatechuate, syringate, phloroglucinol, and pyrogallol, were added and incubation was resumed for 2 h. The expression of the galA gene was checked by reverse transcription-PCR experiments. To this end, cells were collected by centrifugation, and total RNAs were obtained with a High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche). Any contamination by DNA was eliminated by the use of a DNase treatment and removal kit (Ambion). One microgram of purified total RNA was used to prepare cDNA by adding 3 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and the oligonucleotide GalA3′int. PCRs were carried out with 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Roche) and oligonucleotides GalA5′int and GalA3′int. Control reaction in which reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reaction mixture ensured that DNA products resulted from the amplification of cDNA rather than from DNA contamination. To assay gallate dioxygenase activity in P. putida KT2440 cells, cultures were harvested at 4 °C, resuspended in extraction buffer, and disrupted by two consecutive passages through a French press (Aminco Corp.) operated at a pressure of 20,000 p.s.i. The clear supernatant fluid was used as the crude extract fraction. Cloning and Expression of the galA Gene from P. putida KT2440—In the course of a genomic in silico search for novel aromatic ring-cleavage dioxygenases in P. putida KT2440, we have identified at position 2866 kb of the genome a 1263-bp gene (herein referred as galA) whose product, a putative 420-amino acid length protein, shared the last 340 residues with protein PP2518 (340 amino acids) of the annotated P. putida genome (www.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR2/GenomePage3.spl?database=gpp). The deduced amino acid sequence of the galA gene product showed significant similarity to that of protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenases (see below), suggesting that it could be involved in the meta cleavage of a catecholic compound, a type of reaction that has not been reported yet in P. putida KT2440. To characterize the galA gene product, the galA gene was cloned into the pET-29a(+) expression vector and the resulting plasmid, pETGalA, was transferred to E. coli BLB21(DE3) cells to overexpress the cloned gene (see “Experimental Procedures”).

https://openalex.org/W2094932039,"The serine/threonine-specific casein kinase I delta (CKIδ) is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, is p53 dependently induced in stress situations and plays an important role in various cellular processes. Our immunohistochemical analysis of the human placenta revealed strongest expression of CKIδ in extravillous trophoblast cells and in choriocarcinomas. Investigation of the functional role of CKIδ in an extravillous trophoblast hybrid cell line revealed that CKIδ was constitutively localized at the centrosomes and the mitotic spindle. Inhibition of CKIδ with the CKI-specific inhibitor IC261 led to structural alterations of the centrosomes, the formation of multipolar spindles, the inhibition of mitosis and, in contrast to other cell lines, the induction of apoptosis. Our findings indicate that CKIδ plays an important role in the mitotic progression and in the survival of cells of trophoblast origin. Therefore, IC261 could provide a new tool in treating choriocarcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W1985964383,"The structure and function of Mycobacterium smegmatis Dps (DNA-binding proteins from starved cells) and of the protein studied by Gupta and Chatterji (Gupta, S., and Chatterji, D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 5235-5241), in which the C terminus that is used for binding DNA contains a histidine tag, have been characterized in parallel. The native dodecamer dissociated reversibly into dimers above pH 7.5 and below pH 6.0, with apparent pKa values of ∼7.65 and 4.75; at pH ∼4.0, dimers formed monomers. Based on structural analysis, the two dissociation steps have been attributed to breakage of the salt bridges between Glu157 and Arg99 located at the 3-fold symmetry axes and to protonation of Asp66 hydrogen-bonded to Lys36 across the dimer interface, respectively. The C-terminal tag did not affect subunit dissociation, but altered DNA binding dramatically. At neutral pH, protonation of the histidine tag promoted DNA condensation, whereas in the native C terminus, compensation of negative and positive charges led to DNA binding without condensation. This different mode of interaction with DNA has important functional consequences as indicated by the failure of the native protein to protect DNA from DNase-mediated cleavage and by the efficiency of the tagged protein in doing so as a result of DNA sequestration in the condensates. Chemical protection of DNA from oxidative damage is realized by Dps proteins in a multistep iron oxidation/uptake/mineralization process. Dimers have a decreased protection efficiency due to disruption of the dodecamer internal cavity, where iron is deposited and mineralized after oxidation at the ferroxidase center. The structure and function of Mycobacterium smegmatis Dps (DNA-binding proteins from starved cells) and of the protein studied by Gupta and Chatterji (Gupta, S., and Chatterji, D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 5235-5241), in which the C terminus that is used for binding DNA contains a histidine tag, have been characterized in parallel. The native dodecamer dissociated reversibly into dimers above pH 7.5 and below pH 6.0, with apparent pKa values of ∼7.65 and 4.75; at pH ∼4.0, dimers formed monomers. Based on structural analysis, the two dissociation steps have been attributed to breakage of the salt bridges between Glu157 and Arg99 located at the 3-fold symmetry axes and to protonation of Asp66 hydrogen-bonded to Lys36 across the dimer interface, respectively. The C-terminal tag did not affect subunit dissociation, but altered DNA binding dramatically. At neutral pH, protonation of the histidine tag promoted DNA condensation, whereas in the native C terminus, compensation of negative and positive charges led to DNA binding without condensation. This different mode of interaction with DNA has important functional consequences as indicated by the failure of the native protein to protect DNA from DNase-mediated cleavage and by the efficiency of the tagged protein in doing so as a result of DNA sequestration in the condensates. Chemical protection of DNA from oxidative damage is realized by Dps proteins in a multistep iron oxidation/uptake/mineralization process. Dimers have a decreased protection efficiency due to disruption of the dodecamer internal cavity, where iron is deposited and mineralized after oxidation at the ferroxidase center. The proteins of the Dps (DNA-binding proteins from starved cells) family are expressed by most bacteria under a variety of stress conditions to protect DNA against oxidative damage and other detrimental factors (1Nair S. Finkel S.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4192-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 2Yamamoto Y. Poole L.B. Higuchi M. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3740-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Pulliainen A.T. Haataja S. Kahkonen S. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7996-8005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). DNA protection is achieved by a dual action. DNA binding itself provides an effective physical shield against damaging molecules, whereas the highly conserved ferroxidase center affords chemical protection under oxidative stress conditions in particular. Chemical protection is achieved in a multistep process that has been characterized in Escherichia coli Dps, the family prototype (4Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L. Laue T.M. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27689-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the first step, Fe(II) is bound at the ferroxidase center, where it is oxidized most efficiently by hydrogen peroxide, thus avoiding hydroxyl radical production through Fenton chemistry. In the subsequent uptake/mineralization steps, Fe(III) is sequestered as a ferric core inside the protein cavity, where- from it can be released upon reduction (5Ilari A. Ceci P. Ferrari D. Rossi G.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37619-37623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All Dps proteins are endowed with ferroxidase activity, but not all of them are capable of binding DNA, although the family was named after this property. In E. coli Dps, interaction with DNA involves the freely mobile, lysine-rich N termini that extend beyond the four-helix bundle of each subunit and protrude from the dodecamer surface toward solvent (6Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 7Ceci P. Cellai S. Falvo E. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Chiancone E. Nucleic Acid Res. 2004; 32: 5935-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the inability to interact with DNA correlates either with an N terminus of reduced length, as in Listeria innocua Dps, Bacillus anthracis Dlp-1 and Dlp-2, and Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein (8Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3259-3265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Papinutto E. Dundon W.G.

Battistutta R. Seveso M. Del Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), or with its immobilization on the protein surface, as in Agrobacterium tumefaciens Dps (11Ceci P. Ilari A. Falvo E. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20319-20326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A recent in vitro work on E. coli Dps revealed the occurrence of two different modes of DNA binding that depend on the number of positive charges carried by the N terminus (7Ceci P. Cellai S. Falvo E. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Chiancone E. Nucleic Acid Res. 2004; 32: 5935-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The native protein, in which the intact N terminus contains 1 arginine and 3 lysines, promotes DNA condensation with formation of large Dps-DNA complexes, a situation reminiscent of the rapid formation of Dps-DNA co-crystals in starved E. coli cells that overexpress Dps (12Wolf S.G. Frenkiel D. Arad T. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Minsky A. Nature. 1999; 400: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In contrast, the DpsΔ18 deletion mutant, in which the N terminus lacks all positively charged amino acids, binds DNA very weakly without causing condensation. The same study also demonstrated that DNA condensation is coupled tightly to Dps self-aggregation, a phenomenon that takes place in the absence of DNA. Thus, at physiological pH values in low ionic strength buffers (30-50 mm), native E. coli Dps condenses DNA and has a strong tendency to self-aggregate and precipitate out of solution. Conversely, the DpsΔ18 deletion mutant, which is unable to condense DNA, has no tendency to self-aggregate. In this framework, Mycobacterium smegmatis Dps represents a most interesting model system. It is characterized by a truncated, uncharged N terminus and by a freely mobile, 26-amino acid long C-terminal extension (13Roy S. Gupta S. Das S. Sekar K. Chatterji D. Vijayan M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that contains both positively and negatively charged amino acid side chains (3 lysines and 2 arginines plus 1 aspartic acid and 3 glutamic acids) and, in principle, could substitute the N terminus in the interaction with DNA. Indeed, Gupta and Chatterji (14Gupta S. Chatterji D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5235-5241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported recently that M. smegmatis Dps forms large complexes with DNA. However, these authors cloned and purified a C-terminally tagged protein containing the KPAAALEHHHHHH sequence precisely in the region responsible for the interaction with DNA. The same authors also observed that the tagged protein undergoes dissociation into trimers at low temperature (4 °C). In other Dps proteins, the dodecamer assemblage is extremely stable, e.g. in L. innocua, Dps dissociation takes place below pH 2.0 and gives rise to dimers (15Chiaraluce R. Consalvi V. Cavallo S. Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The difference in the nature of the dissociation product is of functional relevance. Trimer formation would entail loss of ferroxidase activity due to disruption of the ferroxidase center, which has an unusual location at the dimer interface, with both symmetry-related subunits providing the iron ligands (8Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3259-3265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this study, the subunit dissociation, DNA binding, and protection properties of native, untagged M. smegmatis Dps (DpsMs) 2The abbreviations used are: DpsMs, M. smegmatis Dps; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; AFM, atomic force microscopy. were assessed in parallel with those of the tagged protein (DpsMs-His) to establish possible differences between the two proteins ascribable to the C-terminal tag. Untagged and tagged dodecamers dissociated into dimers in a similar fashion. At variance with subunit dissociation, DNA binding was affected dramatically by the tag. Thus, unlike the tagged protein, the native one was unable to promote DNA condensation, a phenomenon attributed to compensation of positive and negative charges within the C-terminal extension. Accordingly, the tagged protein protected DNA from DNase-mediated cleavage, whereas the native protein afforded no protection. Notably, dimers protected DNA from oxidative damage to a lesser extent than did dodecamers. In turn, this difference proves that iron mineralization inside the protein cavity contributes significantly to the chemical protection activity of Dps proteins by effectively removing iron from solution. The M. smegmatis Dps system is of interest not only for understanding the strategies employed by Dps proteins to regulate the interaction with DNA, but also because this rapidly growing mycobacterium was recognized recently as a human pathogen usually associated with soft tissue or wound infections, a source of pulmonary infections in susceptible people following trauma and healthcare-associated procedures (16Ergan B. Coplu L. Alp A. Artvinli M. Respirology. 2004; 9: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Skiest D.J Levi M.E. South. Med. J. 1998; 91: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, DpsMs has 82.5% similarity and 75.6% identity to Dps from Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, a facultative intracellular bacterium known to cause paratuberculosis, a chronic, progressive disease, mainly in ruminants (18Whittington R.J. Marshall D.J. Nicholls P.J. Marsh I.B. Reddacliff L.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2989-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). M. avium has been invoked also as a possible a causative agent of some cases of inflammatory bowel disease in humans, especially Crohn disease (19Chacon O. Bermudez L.E. Barletta R.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 13: 329-363Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Construction of DpsMs—The dps gene was amplified by PCR from the M. smegmatis MC2 genome using primers Myc1 (5′-AAGGAGCACATATGACCTCATTCACCATCCC-3′) and Myc2 (5′-GTTCTAAGCTTGGCAGACTTGCGGCGCGCC-3′). The restriction sites for NdeI and HindIII are underlined. The amplified fragment (570 bp) was digested with NdeI and HindIII, purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc.), and cloned into the expression vector pET-22b (Novagen) digested with NdeI and HindIII. This plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) and sequenced by dideoxy sequencing to confirm the presence of the correct gene. Construction of DpsMs-His—An M. smegmatis Dps protein containing 6 histidines and an additional KPAAALE sequence at the C terminus was obtained by PCR using the primers described previously (20Gupta S. Pandit S.B. Srinivasan N. Chatterji D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Strains and Media—E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was grown at 37 °C on liquid LB medium (10 g/liter Tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl) or LB plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression and Purification of DpsMs—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the recombinant plasmid were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of liquid LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm. The dps gene was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was incubated further for 3-4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min; suspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl; and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant was precipitated using two ammonium sulfate cuts at 30 and 60% (w/v) saturation. DpsMs remains in solution at 60% saturation; after centrifugation (15,000 × g for 45 min), the supernatant was dialyzed overnight at room temperature against 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) and loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (DE52) equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted with 300 mm NaCl, purified on a Sephadex G-150 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.3), pooled, and stored at -75 °C. Expression and purification of DpsMs-His were performed as described for DpsMs. The purity of the preparations was probed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels. Protein Crystallization—Crystallization was achieved at 293 K by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. A 2-μl volume of the protein sample (at 7 mg/ml) equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was mixed with an equal amount of the reservoir solution containing 0.1 m HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0-7.8) and 1.5-2.0 m (NH4)2SO4. Crystals grew in 1 week to ∼0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3. Data Collection and Processing—Data were collected as 1.0 oscillation frames using an MAR CCD detector on the x-ray beamline at ELETTRA (Basovizza, Trieste, Italy) at a wavelength of 1.0 Å. Data were collected at 100 K using 25% glycerol as cryoprotectant. The data analysis, performed with DENZO (21Ottwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), indicated that the crystals are rombohedral (R32), with unit cell dimensions of a = 124.3, b = 124.3, and c = 304.65 Å. The data were scaled using SCALEPACK (21Ottwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), with Rsym = 0.082% and χ2 = 1.23. The crystal contains four monomers/asymmetric unit, corresponding to one-third of the assembled molecule, with VM = 2.15 Å3/Da and a solvent content of ∼45%. Structure Solution and Refinement—The structure was solved by molecular replacement using, as a search probe, a truncated polyalanine model of one-third of the E. coli Dps dodecamer (Protein Data Bank code 1DPS). The rotational and translational searches, performed with the program AMoRE (22Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) in the resolution range of 10-3.0 Å, produced a clear solution corresponding to a correlation coefficient between Fc and Fo of 62.1 and to an RF of 44.6%. Refinement of the atomic coordinates and displacement parameters was carried out by the maximum likelihood method with the program REFMAC Version 5 (23Murshudov G.N. Lebedev A. Vagin A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Model building was performed using the program package XTALVIEW (24McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1993: 365-374Google Scholar). Water molecules were added to the model manually. The final model (a tetramer) includes 624 residues (156 residues/monomer), 141 water molecules, and four iron ions with an occupancy of 0.3. The final Rcryst at 2.8-Å resolution is 27.2%. The quality of the model was assessed by the program PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The core and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot contain 85.2 and 14.6% non-glycine residues, respectively. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Experiments—Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 30,000 rpm and 20 °C at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The buffer used was 30 mm Tris-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl at pH values ranging from 7.0 to 8.5. Because the effect of temperature on pH is large (ΔpH/ΔT = -0.03 units/°C) in this buffer system, in specific experiments, we used 30 mm MOPS and 0.15 m NaCl. The gradient of protein concentration in the cells was determined by absorption scans along the centrifugation radius at 280 nm, with three averages and a step resolution of 0.005 cm. Data were analyzed with SEDFIT (26Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar), and the sedimentation coefficient was reduced to s20,w by standard procedures. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 12,000 or 24,000 rpm and 20 °C. The protein concentration was 1 mg/ml. DpsMs was incubated in 30 mm Tris-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl at pH 7.0 or 8.5. Data were collected at a spacing of 0.001 cm, with 10 averages in a step scan mode every 3 h. Equilibrium was checked by comparing scans up to 24 h. Data sets were edited with REEDIT (35Lary J.W. REEDIT. National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Center, Storrs, CT1998Google Scholar) and fitted with WINNONLIN (36Yphantis D.A. Johnson M.L. Lary J.W. WINNONLIN. University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT1997Google Scholar). HPLC and Gel Filtration Experiments—DpsMs (50 μl) was applied to a TSKgel G3000SW XL 7.8/30 column (Tosoh Bioscience, Inc.) on an Amersham Biosciences HPLC system and was eluted at pH 3.0-7.4 at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 25 °C. The buffers used were 100 mm glycine HCl, 100 mm acetic acid-sodium acetate, 100 mm BisTris-HCl, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, all in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl. DpsMs was used 1, 5, and 10 mg/ml. Horse spleen ferritin (450 kDa), E. coli Dps (221 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and myoglobin (16.9 kDa) were run independently under the same conditions to calibrate the column. The operating conditions and specifications for the TSKgel G3000SW XL column do not permit analyses below pH 7.4. For experiments at higher pH values, gel filtration chromatography was performed on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 100 mm Tris-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.7) at 25 °C or a Sephadex G-150 column in 30 mm Tris-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.6) at 25 °C. In particular, the Superdex 75 column was used to investigate the kinetic aspects of the association-dissociation processes. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD measurements were performed at 20 °C using a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter. Near-UV spectra (250-310 nm) were recorded using 0.1-cm optical path quartz cells (Hellma). The protein concentration was 4 mg/ml in 30 mm Tris-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl at pH 7.0 or 8.5. Spectra were taken by averaging eight accumulations. Gel Retardation Assay—The DNA binding ability of DpsMs and DpsMs-His was assessed in gel shift assays using supercoiled pUC9-5S (3115 bp, 20 nm) or a 500-bp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragment as a probe. DNA was purified using the QIAprep spin plasmid miniprep kit or the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.) to ensure removal of impurities and salts. DNA was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with the Dps proteins (3 μm) in 30 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm NaCl at pH 7.0, 7.4, or 8.0. To resolve the Dps-DNA complexes, electrophoresis was carried out on 1% agarose gels in the same buffer used for incubation of the Dps/DNA mixture. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide or Coomassie Blue and imaged using ImageMaster VDS (Amersham Biosciences). The pUC9-5S plasmid preparation used is characterized by multiple bands that can be ascribed to catenated intermediates in plasmid replication apparent in atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (data not shown). Moreover, only one band was present on the gels after digestion of the plasmid with HindIII. DNA Protection from DNase—DNA protection from DNase I-mediated cleavage was assayed in vitro using pUC9-5S (3115 bp, 20 nm) as a probe. DpsMs and DpsMs-His (2 μm) were incubated with DNA at 25 °C in 30 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm and NiSO4 (pH 7.0) for 5 min and thereafter with 0.3 unit of DNase I for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by incubation with 2% SDS at 85 °C for 5 min. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto 1% agarose gel in Tris acetate/EDTA. DNA Protection from Oxidative Damage—DNA protection from oxidative damage was assessed in vitro using pUC9-5S (20 nm). The dissociated and undissociated forms of DpsMs were separated by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G-150 column equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.6). The damage assay was carried out in a 15-μl volume of 30 mm Tris-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.6). Plasmid DNA was allowed to interact with the DpsMs proteins (2 μm) for 10 min prior to addition of 50 μm FeSO4. After 2 min, H2O2 was added at a final concentration of 10 mm, and the mixtures were incubated for 3 min at room temperature to allow complete consumption of Fe(II) (3Pulliainen A.T. Haataja S. Kahkonen S. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7996-8005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thereafter, 2% SDS was added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated at 85 °C for 5 min. Plasmid DNA was resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in Tris acetate/EDTA. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and imaged using ImageMaster VDS. AFM—Dps-DNA complexes were prepared by incubating the protein (50 nm) with DNA (2 nm) at 20 °C for 5 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 2 mm NiCl2. Sample deposition onto freshly cleaved ruby mica (Mica, New York) and AFM measurements were performed as described by Ceci et al. (7Ceci P. Cellai S. Falvo E. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Chiancone E. Nucleic Acid Res. 2004; 32: 5935-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—The M. smegmatis Dps protein containing the KPAAALEHHHHHH tag at the C terminus was crystallized in the hexagonal space group (R32). The structure was solved at 2.8-Å resolution by molecular replacement using E. coli Dps (Protein Data Bank code 1DPS) as a search probe and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1UVH). The model contains 157 residues; the first 4 and the last 22 residues plus the C-terminal tag are not visible, an indication that these residues are freely mobile just as the N terminus in E. coli Dps (6Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Only slight differences (limited to the N and C termini) are apparent with respect to the structures obtained by Roy et al. (13Roy S. Gupta S. Das S. Sekar K. Chatterji D. Vijayan M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) for the same protein crystallized in the P63, P43212, and F432 space groups. Native DpsMs did not form crystals under the conditions used to crystallize the tagged protein or under those covered by the Crystal Screen crystallization kit (Hampton Research Corp., Aliso Viejo, CA). The DpsMs dodecamer shares the architecture of all known Dps proteins (6Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 9Papinutto E. Dundon W.G. Pitulis N. Battistutta R. Montecucco C. Zanotti G. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar): identical subunits, folded into a four-helix bundle, form a hollow shell (∼90 Å in diameter) characterized by tetrahedral 23 symmetry. The symmetry of the molecule leads to two non-equivalent environments along the 3-fold axes: one is typical of Dps proteins, whereas the other resembles the environment along the 3-fold axes of canonical ferritins with octahedral 432 symmetry, hence the respective names “Dps-like” and “ferritin-like” interfaces. Like all Dps proteins, DpsMs has a ferroxidase center at the interface of 2-fold symmetry-related subunits. It contains one iron atom coordinated by Asp66 and Glu70 of one subunit and by His39 of the symmetry-related subunit; the site occupancy is 0.33. Iron is bound also in the cubic crystal form of Roy et al. (13Roy S. Gupta S. Das S. Sekar K. Chatterji D. Vijayan M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with a 0.4 site occupancy. Analysis of the Dodecamer Interfaces—Although analysis of the 2-fold and 3-fold interfaces in terms of solvent-accessible surface was performed by Roy et al. (13Roy S. Gupta S. Das S. Sekar K. Chatterji D. Vijayan M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the specific interactions that stabilize the various interfaces were not detailed. This information is relevant to understanding the structural basis of the subunit dissociation process. Therefore, the analysis was repeated using a 1.4-Å radius probe, and the residues involved in intersubunit interactions were identified using the AREAIMOL program (CCP4 package) (16Ergan B. Coplu L. Alp A. Artvinli M. Respirology. 2004; 9: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For comparative purposes, the E. coli and L. innocua Dps proteins were analyzed in parallel. The surface area buried upon dimerization, 1290 Å2/monomer, is similar to those calculated with the same probe for E. coli and L. innocua Dps, 1540 and 1205 Å2/monomer, respectively. The dimer interface is formed by helices A and B and by the short BC helix placed in the middle of the long loop connecting helices B and C (Fig. 1A). As in other Dps proteins, the buried residues are mostly hydrophobic: Leu33 and Trp40 (helix A), Ala69 and Ala73 (helix B), and Ile87 and Pro83 (helix BC). However, in DpsMs, the dimer interface is stabilized also by two strong salt bridges formed between Lys36 (N-ζ) and Asp66 (O-δ2) of the 2-fold symmetry-related subunits (Fig. 1A and TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEHydrophilic interactions stabilizing the dimer and trimer interfaces in M. smegmatis, L. innocua, and E. coli Dps proteins M. smegmatis Dps L. innocua Dps E. coli Dps Å Å Å Dimer interface Lys36 N-ζ–Asp66 O-δ1 2.0–2.5 Trp32 N-ϵ1–Asp58 O-δ1 2.5–2.8 Lys48 N-ζ–Asp78 O-δ2 2.8–3.0 Lys36 N-ζ–Asp66 O-δ2 2.8–3.0 Arg70 N-η2–Asp78 O-δ2 2.9–3.2 Arg90 N-2–Gly84 O 3.1–3.2 Ferritin-like interface Lys147 N-ζ–Glu70 O-ϵ2 2.4–2.8 Lys141 N-ζ–Glu62 O-ϵ1 2.9–3.0 Arg18 N-ϵ–Asp123 O-δ1 2.7–2.9 Arg71 N-η1–Glu146 O-ϵ2 2.4–2.5 Lys114 N-ζ–Glu126 O-δ2 2.5–2.7 Arg83 N-η1–Asp156 O-δ1 2.8–2.9 Arg121 N-η2–Asp131 O-δ1 2.4–2.5 Arg63 N-η2–Asp140 O-δ1 2.9–3.0 Arg133 N-η1–Asp20 O-δ1 2.8–2.9 Lys134 N-ζ–Asp20 O-δ2 2.9–3.0 Dps-like interface Asn46 N-δ2–Pro45 O 2.5–3.2 His37 N-δ1–Asn38 O-δ1 3.2–3.4 Arg99 N-η1–Glu157 O-ϵ2 2.3–2.8 Asp96 O-δ2–His37 N-ϵ2 3.2–3.3 Open table in a new tab Along the ferritin-like interfaces, the surface of the mycobacterial protein is lined by negatively charged residues, viz.

https://openalex.org/W1963838580,"The dynein motor domain consists of a ring of six AAA domains with a protruding microtubule-binding stalk and a C-terminal domain of unknown function. To understand how conformational information is communicated within this complex structure, we produced a series of recombinant and proteolytic rat motor domain fragments, which we analyzed enzymatically. A recombinant 210-kDa half-motor domain fragment surprisingly exhibited a 6-fold higher steady state ATPase activity than a 380-kDa complete motor domain fragment. The increased ATPase activity was associated with a complete loss of sensitivity to inhibition by vanadate and an ∼100-fold increase in the rate of ADP release. The time course of product release was discovered to be biphasic, and each phase was stimulated ∼1000-fold by microtubule binding to the 380-kDa motor domain. Both the half-motor and full motor domain fragments were remarkably resistant to tryptic proteolysis, exhibiting either two or three major cleavage sites. Cleavage near the C terminus of the 380-kDa motor domain released a 32-kDa fragment and abolished sensitivity to vanadate. Cleavage at this site was insensitive to ATP or 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate but was blocked by ADP-AlF3 or ADP-vanadate. Based on these data, we proposed a model for long range allosteric control of product release at AAA1 and AAA3 through the microtubule-binding stalk and the C-terminal domain, the latter of which may interact with AAA1 to close the motor domain ring in a cross-bridge cycle-dependent manner.

Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based motor that utilizes energy from ATP hydrolysis to facilitate a wide variety of functions in eukaryotic cells such as spindle alignment, nucleus positioning and chromosome separation during mitosis, and retrograde axonal transport of subcellular components (1Dujardin D.L. Vallee R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Dynein belongs to the functionally diverse family of AAA+ proteins (3Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this family contain a conserved domain of 200-250 residues termed AAA, or “ATPases associated with various cellular activities,” that contains five signature motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Most AAA proteins form homohexameric rings in which each subunit is composed of either one or two AAA domains. The ∼380-kDa dynein motor, in contrast, consists of a ring of six dissimilar and covalently linked AAA domains and at the extreme C terminus an ∼30-kDa region of unknown function. Fused to the motor domain is a substantial projection, referred to as the stem, which contains sites for dimerization and association with cargo binding subunits (4Tynan S.H. Gee M.A. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32769-32774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Emerging from between AAA4 and AAA5 is another projection, the stalk, which is thought to consist of an antiparallel coiled-coil with a globular domain for microtubule binding at its tip (5Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the dynein motor domain suggests that the ability to bind and hydrolyze nucleotides differs among the six AAA domains (6Gibbons J.R. Gibbons B.H. Mocz G. Asai D.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Whereas the first AAA domain contains the entire set of nucleotide-interacting motifs, the probability of identifying these motifs in AAA2-AAA4 varies with organism and class of dynein. The AAA consensus in the fifth and sixth AAA domain are partly or entirely degenerate, making the C-terminal half of the ring incapable of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Based on vanadate photocleavage data, the first AAA domain has been designated the main site for ATP hydrolysis (5Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 7Gibbons I.R. Lee-Eiford A. Mocz G. Phillipson C.A. Tang W.J. Gibbons B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2780-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the third AAA domain has emerged as a potential secondary site for hydrolysis (8Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11266-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Takahashi Y. Edamatsu M. Toyoshima Y.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12865-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mechanism for coupled nucleotide hydrolysis and force production within the dynein motor is not fully understood. Microtubule binding by dynein sharply increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis (10Shpetner H.S. Paschal B.M. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), indicating a central role for the stalk in regulating enzymatic activity. Recent work on P-loop mutants showed that nucleotide binding at the first and third AAA domains is required for ATP-induced release of microtubules (11Silvanovich A. Li M.G. Serr M. Mische S. Hays T.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1355-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and for microtubule stimulation of ATPase activity (8Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11266-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), supporting long range allosteric communication through unknown conformational changes within the motor domain. The complexity of dynein motor mechanics has been further reinforced by results from electron microscopy of an axonemal dynein, in which part of the stem was bent around the AAA ring in either of two conformations, depending on whether the motor was in a pre- or post-power stroke state (12Burgess S.A. Walker M.L. Sakakibara H. Knight P.J. Oiwa K. Nature. 2003; 421: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To improve our understanding of how the motor activity in cytoplasmic dynein is regulated, we produced two fragments from the 4644-residue heavy chain and studied their properties. The first fragment corresponded to the entire 380-kDa motor domain, and the second to the N-terminal 210-kDa half of the motor domain (half-motor domain). Although both fragments contain the entire machinery for ATP hydrolysis, they unexpectedly display distinctive enzymatic properties. Most surprisingly, the ATPase activity and ADP release rate of the half-motor were considerably higher than those of the full motor. In addition, the 210-kDa fragment lost its sensitivity to inhibition by vanadate ion, a mimic of the γ-phosphate of ATP, and to photocleavage in the presence of vanadate. Each fragment was remarkably resistant to limited proteolysis, although a C-terminal 32-kDa segment could be removed from the full motor in a nucleotide-dependent manner by trypsin, resulting in altered enzymatic properties. Based on our findings we suggest a model in which both the stalk and the extreme C terminus of the dynein heavy chain control the rate-limiting step of product release in the dynein enzymatic cycle through long range allosteric mechanisms. Protein Production—The 380-kDa motor domain fragment was cloned from Gly1286-Glu4644 of rat cytoplasmic dynein into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1393 (BD Biosciences) with a C-terminal in-frame hexahistidine tag. The 210-kDa fragment was subcloned from Gly1286-Glu3106 of the 380-kDa construct into pVL1393. Hi5 cells were infected with virus for 40 h. The cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and the recombinant motor domain fragments were extracted from the cells by homogenization in extraction buffer (50 mm Pipes, 3The abbreviations used are: Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; 2′dmD, 2′-deoxy-mant-ADP; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. pH 7.2, 50 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cytosolic extract was spun at 5000 × g for 10 min and 100 000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-affinity column (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow; Qiagen) equilibrated in extraction buffer supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. Unbound material was removed by washing with 16 volumes of extraction buffer supplemented with 10 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted in 5 volumes of elution buffer (50 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 50 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 125 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Eluted protein was extensively dialyzed in extraction buffer to remove the imidazole. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, using albumin as a standard. A typical batch of six 15-cm dishes of confluent Hi5 cells produced 2-4 mg of recombinant protein that had no visible sign of contaminants or degradation. Peak fractions were pooled, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at -80 °C. Enzymatic Assays—ATPase activities were determined using the malachite green assay (13Kodama T. Fukui K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was expressed as the number of ATP hydrolyzed per dynein motor fragment/s (s-1) For microtubule-stimulated ATPase, 50 μl of taxol-stabilized microtubules (tubulin; Cytoskeleton) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml were pelleted at 90,000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was saved for later SDS-PAGE analysis, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of a sample containing the motor domain. Following a 30-min incubation, 2 mm ATP was added, and the reaction was continued for an additional 30 min. Control samples of motor domain fragment without microtubules and of microtubules alone were included in the analysis. Vanadate inhibition of dynein ATPase activity was carried out in the presence of 2 mm ATP. UV-vanadate photocleavage was performed essentially as reported previously (7Gibbons I.R. Lee-Eiford A. Mocz G. Phillipson C.A. Tang W.J. Gibbons B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2780-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A sample of recombinant motor fragment was incubated with 500 μm ATP and 500 μm vanadate for 1 h at room temperature and irradiated for 90 min on ice with UV light (365 nm). Vanadate-mediated photocleavage was determined by SDS-PAGE. Solute Quenching and ADP Binding and Release Kinetics—The fluorescence emission of 2′-deoxy-mant-ADP bound to the 380- and 210-kDa fragments of dynein was measured as a function of acrylamide concentration as described previously (14Rosenfeld S.S. Correia J.J. Xing J. Rener B. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30212-30221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, dynein fragments were mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of 2′-deoxy-mant-A DP, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and the excess nucleotide was removed by gel filtration on pre-poured Sephadex G-25 columns (PD-10, GE Healthcare), followed by dialysis. The fluorescence emission of the bound mant nucleotide was monitored in a steady state fluorimeter (ISS, Inc.) by exciting at 356 nm and monitoring the emission at 450 nm. Small aliquots of concentrated acrylamide were added, and the fluorescence intensity was measured during constant stirring. The effects of acrylamide quenching can be described by the Stern-Volmer Equation 1 (15Lehrer S.S. Leavis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 220-236Google Scholar), F0F=∑ifi1+Ki[Q]exp(Vi[Q]-1(Eq. 1) where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher; fi is the fractional emission of each component; Ki is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, and Vi is the solute quenching (Q) parameter. The kinetics of 2′-deoxy-mant-ADP release from the 380- and 210-kDa motor domain fragments were measured by mixing mant nucleotide-labeled dynein fragment in a stopped flow spectrometer (SX18.MV, Applied Photophysics, Ltd.) with 2 mm ATP. The resulting fluorescence transient was produced by excitation at 356 nm and observation at 90° through a 450 nm cut-off filter. Essentially identical results were obtained by excitation of the mant fluorophor through energy transfer from vicinal tryptophan residues (295 nm). The kinetics of 2′-deoxymant-ADP binding to a dynein-microtubule complex was monitored by mixing 10 μm tubulin + 2 μm 380-kDa fragment in the stopped flow spectrometer with 2′-deoxy-mant-ADP. Binding was monitored by exciting the mant fluorophor via dynein tryptophan residues (295 nm) and observing the resulting emission at 90° through a 450 nm cut-off filter. Limited Proteolysis—Motor domain fragments were incubated with trypsin for 1 h at room temperature. Proteolysis was terminated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min or by the addition of 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone at a final concentration of 100 μm. The effect of nucleotides was determined by preincubation of the motor domain fragment for 1 h with 400 μm ATP plus 400 μm vanadate or 1 mm of either AMP-PNP, ADP-AlF3, or ADP for 1 h followed by the addition of trypsin and incubation for an additional hour. Composition of the proteolytic products was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. N-terminal sequencing was carried out on electroblotted proteolytic fragments by automated Edman degradation on a 494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and by high pressure liquid chromatography fractionation. The C-terminal boundaries were deduced by measuring the masses of the proteolytic fragments using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Voyager-DE STR, Applied Biosystems). A matrix solution containing a 3:1:2 (v/v/v) mixture of formic acid/water/isopropyl alcohol was mixed with the proteolytic products, spotted onto a sample plate pretreated to form an ultrathin layer of matrix, and analyzed as described (16Cadene M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5655-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Size-exclusion chromatography fractionation of the tryptic digest was carried out on a Superose 6 FPLC column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with extraction buffer. Separation was conducted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Aliquots from each fraction of eluted digest were tested for ATPase activity and analyzed for fragment composition by SDS-PAGE. Basal and Microtubule-stimulated ATPase Activities—To determine whether the 210-kDa half-motor and 380-kDa full motor domains had enzymatic activity, each fragment was tested for its ability to hydrolyze ATP. Most interestingly, the specific activity of the half-motor was ∼6 times higher than that of the full motor (Fig. 1A). The range of activities for the half-motor was broad, ranging from ∼3 to ∼10-fold higher than the full motor domain, reflecting variations in specific activity among half-motor preparations. The addition of saturating amounts of taxol-stabilized microtubules to the 380-kDa dynein motor produced an almost 10-fold increase in ATPase activity (Fig. 1B), whereas no stimulation was detected for the 210-kDa fragment lacking the microtubule-binding domain (see Fig. 4C for the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the two motor domain fragments). The difference in ATP turnover rate between microtubule-bound and nonbound dynein and between the 210- and 380-kDa fragment suggests that regions within the C-terminal half of the motor, including the microtubule-binding domain, are involved in controlling the rate by which dynein hydrolyzes ATP. To characterize Vmax and Km of the basal steady state ATPase of the two motor domain fragments, turnover rates were analyzed over a 100-fold range in ATP concentration (Fig. 1C). The Vmax value of the 210-kDa fragment was about three times higher than that of the 380-kDa motor domain, whereas the apparent Km value was ∼50% higher (TABLE ONE), implying that the 210-kDa motor fragment binds and hydrolyzes nucleotides at greater efficiency.FIGURE 4Controlled proteolysis with trypsin. Proteolysis was carried out on the 210-kDa half-motor and 380-kDa full motor domain fragments. Top, SDS-PAGE of digests obtained from proteolysis at various concentrations of trypsin.

Lee-Eiford A. Mocz G. Phillipson C.A. Tang W.J. Gibbons B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2780-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this state UV light irradiation causes a photolytic reaction that cleaves the dynein polypeptide chain at the first nucleotide-binding P-loop (5Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 7Gibbons I.R. Lee-Eiford A. Mocz G. Phillipson C.A. Tang W.J. Gibbons B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2780-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the 210- and 380-kDa dynein motor fragments were susceptible to photocleavage, the fragments were irradiated with UV light in the presence of ATP and vanadate. The treatment resulted in cleavage of the 380-kDa fragment at the first P-loop, whereas, surprisingly, no cleavage occurred for the 210-kDa fragment (Fig. 2A). To test whether the lack of UV cleavage reflected a decrease in affinity for vanadate, its ability to inhibit steady state ATPase activity was determined. Enzymatic activity of the 380-kDa fragment was strongly decreased by vanadate, with a 50% reduction in ATPase activity at ∼0.1 μm vanadate and an 80% reduction at 2 μm vanadate (Fig. 2B), consistent with the sensitivity of the dynein holoenzyme to this inhibitor (7Gibbons I.R. Lee-Eiford A. Mocz G. Phillipson C.A. Tang W.J. Gibbons B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2780-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shpetner H.S. Paschal B.M. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activity of the 210-kDa fragment was unaffected by vanadate (Fig. 2B), even at concentrations up to 250 μm. The combination of high ATPase activity and the insensitivity to vanadate suggest that the kinetics of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis were different in the truncated 210-kDa half-motor fragment compared with that of the entire 380-kDa motor domain. Solute Quenching and ADP Binding Kinetics—These results suggested that the conformation of the catalytic site in the full motor domain is different from that of the 210-kDa half-motor domain. In particular, the increase in Vmax for the half-motor domain may reflect weaker ADP binding, potentially reflected in a more solvent-exposed binding site in this fragment. In order to assess this possibility, we measured the accessibility of the fluorescent ADP analog, 2′-deoxy-mant-ADP (2′dmD), when bound to the full and half-motor domains. This was accomplished by exposure to acrylamide, a steady state fluorescence quencher. The plot of F/F0 shows a single component for the Stern-Volmer quenching constant K for free 2′dmD and 2′dmD bound to the 210- and 380-kDa fragments with no appreciable component from static quenching. Furthermore, although the nucleotide in the 380-kDa motor domain fragment appears to be relatively buried in the protein (K = 1.21 ± 0.12 m-1; Fig. 3A), the nucleotide-binding site in the 210-kDa fragment is considerably more accessible (K = 2.00 ± 0.14 m-1). The value of K for free 2′dmD was 3.36 ± 0.14 m-1. Product release is the rate-limiting step in the dynein mechanochemical cycle (17Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and acceleration of ADP release is the basis for microtubule stimulation of its ATPase activity, at least for axonemal dynein (18Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7010-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To provide further insight into the differences we observed in the steady state ATPase kinetics between the half-motor and full motor, the release rates of 2′dmD were measured by mixing a complex of 380-kDa-2′dmD or 210-kDa-2′dmD in the stopped flow with a large excess of ATP. In both cases, the resulting fluorescence transient from the displacement of the fluorescent nucleotide consisted of two well separated phases (data not shown). The amplitude ratio for the 380-kDa fragment was nearly 1:1, whereas it was closer to 2:1 for the 210-kDa fragment. The values of the corresponding rate constants are summarized in TABLE ONE. These results imply that both the 210- and 380-kDa motor domain fragments release ADP at two separate rates, consistent with nucleotide release from two separate ADP-binding sites. In the half-motor fragment, the two rate constants differed by a factor of 35, whereas in the full motor, the difference was smaller (∼5-10 times; TABLE ONE). In addition, product dissociation from the 210-kDa fragment was ∼100 times faster than from the 380-kDa motor fragment (TABLE ONE). Taken together with the solvent accessibility studies (Fig. 3A), these results suggest that the nucleotide-binding site in the half-motor domain is more “open,” resulting in enhanced solvent accessibility of the catalytic site, weaker coordination of nucleotide, and more rapid release of bound ADP. For comparison with these results, we wished to monitor the effects of microtubules on the kinetics of ADP release from the 380-kDa motor fragment. This is difficult to accomplish directly, because of the low stability of the microtubule-dynein-ADP complex. Instead, we determined the rate of microtubule-activated ADP release indirectly, by measuring the kinetics of 2′dmD binding to a nucleotide-free complex of 380-kDa motor domain + excess microtubules. We combined the dynein-microtubule complex in the stopped flow with 2′dmD, and we monitored the rate of the resulting fluorescence increase as a function of nucleotide concentration. Under these conditions, the rate constants for the fluorescence increase due to 2′dmD binding to the two classes of catalytic sites should vary linearly with 2′dmD concentration, with the y intercepts defining the apparent dissociation rate constants. As expected, the kinetics of the fluorescence increase due to 2′dmD binding in this experiment were biphasic, suggesting two exchangeable nucleotide-binding sites (data not shown). The rates of each phase varied linearly with [2′dmD], as expected (Fig. 3B). The apparent second-order rate constants for these two phases, defined by the slopes in Fig. 3B, were 11.90 ± 0.20 and 0.40 ± 0.07 μm-1s-1. Furthermore, the apparent dissociation rate constants, defined by the y intercepts of these plots, were 48.2 ± 7.7 and 9.1 ± 2.8 s-1. These apparent dissociation rates compare with the rates of 0.035-0.060 and 0.006 s-1 in the absence of microtubules (TABLE ONE) and suggest that ADP release is stimulated by microtubules in each of the exchangeable catalytic sites of the full motor domain, consistent with data from a recent mutational study on cytoplasmic dynein (8Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11266-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Proteolytic Analysis—As an additional means to gain insight into conformational and enzymatic control within the dynein motor domain, we subjected the 210- and 380-kDa motor domain fragments to controlled proteolysis. Proteolytic sites were identified by SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrometry. Proteolysis of the 210-kDa motor domain at a relatively low trypsin concentration generated two fragments: one from residues 1298-2395, which included the N-terminal segment AAA1 and two-thirds of AAA2 (Fig. 4, A and C, fragment a), and a smaller fragment from residues 2398 and 3106 that includes the remainder of AAA2 and the entire C-terminal region (Fig. 4, A and C, fragment b). At a higher trypsin concentration, two additional fragments were produced, which were 139 and 217 residues shorter at the C-terminal end of fragment a, respectively (Fig. 4, A and C, fragments c and d). Three major tryptic sites were identified within the 380-kDa full motor domain. Most interestingly, two of these sites at residues 1317 and 2398 were almost identical to those generated from the 210-kDa half-motor fragment (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that the full and half-motor domain polypeptides are equally resistant to proteolysis and suggesting that they have similar structural stability. A third cleavage site at residue 4362 in the full motor domain generated a 32-kDa fragment from the C-terminal region of the dynein heavy chain (Fig. 4, B and C, fragment g) plus a fragment including part of AAA2 and all of AAA3-AAA6, including the stalk (Fig. 4, B and C, fragment e). In an attempt to establish which of the fragments were enzymatically active, ATPase activity was measured in digests generated at a series of trypsin concentrations. ATPase activity in digests of the half-motor domain was unaffected by proteolytic cleavage at residues 1298 and 2395, i.e. activity was unchanged at the point of complete digestion of the 210-kDa fragment (Fig. 4A). Activity was surprisingly stable over a substantial range of trypsin concentration but could ultimately be destroyed at a trypsin/dynein ratio of >1:500 (Fig. 4A). The drop in activity was correlated with the loss of fragment a and the generation of the 139- and 217-residue shorter fragments c and d (Fig. 4, A and C), suggesting that the two shorter fragments lack the ability to hydrolyze ATP, which likely reflects the loss of regulatory elements within AAA2 (see “Discussion”). Fragment b seemed less stable, and its loss was not obviously correlated with any further effect on enzymatic activity, suggesting that activity is associated entirely with fragment a. The pattern by which ATPase activity decreased in digests of the full 380-kDa motor domain differed from that of the half-motor domain. Proteolysis of the full motor produced a gradual decline in hydrolysis rate, and there was no obvious correlation with the degradation of fragment f (Fig. 4B). Controlled proteolysis of the 210-kDa motor domain fragment using the relatively nonspecific proteases subtilisin and papain also generated a small number of stable fragments that were remarkably resistant to further proteolytic attack (see supplemental Fig. S1). The N-terminal boundaries for the three fragments (residues 1298, 1319, and 2415) were almost identical to those produced by tryptic proteolysis (residues 1298, 1317, and 2398). Fractionation of the 380-kDa Motor Domain Tryptic Digest by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography—To test the extent to which proteolysis of the 380-kDa motor domain affected the tertiary structure of the dynein motor domain, a tryptic digest was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography. Two peaks were observed, a larger, symmetric peak and a smaller"
https://openalex.org/W1977538873,"The FadR protein of Escherichia coli has been shown to play a dual role in transcription of the genes of bacterial fatty acid metabolism. The protein acts as a repressor of β-oxidation and an activator of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. FadR DNA binding is antagonized by long chain acyl-CoAs, and thus FadR acts as a sensor of fatty acid availability in the environment. When viewed from a genomic viewpoint, FadR proteins are unusual in that the DNA binding domain is very highly conserved among FadR-containing bacteria, whereas the C-terminal acyl-CoA binding domain shows only weak conservation. To further our understanding of the role of FadR in bacterial lipid metabolism we have examined the in vivo and in vitro properties of a diverse set of FadR proteins expressed in E. coli. In addition to E. coli FadR the proteins examined were those of Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus influenzae. These FadR proteins were found to differ markedly in their effects on repression and induction of β-oxidation in E. coli and in their acyl-CoA binding abilities as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. The E. coli and S. enterica proteins were the most similar, although they differed in their effects on utilization of oleic acid and acyl-CoA binding affinities, whereas the P. multocida and H. influenzae proteins showed only weak repression and poor acyl-CoA binding affinities. The V. cholerae FadR was strikingly superior to the other proteins in the amplitude of its regulatory response, and it bound long chain acyl-CoAs appreciably more strongly than the E. coli and S. enterica proteins.

The significance of these findings is discussed in view of the protein sequences and the physiological niches occupied by these organisms. Escherichia coli FadR protein is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. FadR specifically represses the transcription of each of the genes essential for fatty acid transport, activation and β-oxidation, including fadL, fadD, fadE, fadBA, fadF, fadG, fadH, and fadIJ (1Campbell J.W.

FadR also acts as a transcriptional activator of the fabA and fabB genes of the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (7Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5982-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4704-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of FadR as a repressor or an activator is readily explained by the location of its binding sites within the promoter regions. When the binding site either overlaps the –10 or –35 regions or lies just downstream of the –10 sequence (6Cronan Jr., J.E. Subrahmanyam S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) FadR represses transcription. However, when the binding sites are located immediately upstream of the –35 region of the promoter, FadR binding activates transcription presumably by promoting the binding or action of RNA polymerase. The apparent role of FadR is to optimize fatty acid metabolism in response to exogenously supplied fatty acids (6Cronan Jr., J.E. Subrahmanyam S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Addition of long chain (>C12) fatty acids induces the fad enzymes, whereas medium (C7–C11) or short chain-length (C4–C6) fatty acids cannot (11Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 12Weeks G. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1913-1921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, wild-type E. coli strains utilize long-chain fatty acids such as oleate (C18:1), but not medium-chain-length fatty acids such as decanoate (C10:0) as sole carbon and energy sources. However, mutants that grow on decanoate are readily isolated by plating wild-type cells onto minimal media containing this acid as sole carbon source (11Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 12Weeks G. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1913-1921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These stains have constitutive levels of the fad enzymes and have mutations that map in fadR (2Clark D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 521-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Overath P. Pauli G.

The utilization of fatty acids shorter than C6 requires enzymes other than those encoded by the fad regulon (3Clark D.P. Cronan Jr., J.E. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30645-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The N-terminal DNA binding domain has the winged helix structure often found in prokaryotic regulator proteins (16Brennan R.G. Cell. 1993; 74: 773-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 17Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 63: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal half of FadR contains the acyl-CoA binding domain (18Raman N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19van Aalten D.M. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In recent years four FadR crystal structures have been reported from two research groups and show a gratifying agreement and complementarity. One structure is of the unliganded protein (20van Aalten D.M. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), another is an FadR-myristoyl-CoA complex (19van Aalten D.M. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and two others are complexes of FadR with the fadBA operator DNA (19van Aalten D.M. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Xu Y. Heath R.J. Li Z. Rock C.O. White S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17373-17379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Given these crystal structures it is instructive to examine alignments of FadR homologues (see Fig. 1). Note that in the completed bacterial genomes FadR is found only in those γ-proteobacteria that colonize vertebrates (or in one case plants). This distribution suggests that FadR regulation evolved to utilize fatty acids available in these ecological niches. The alignments are unusual in that the N-terminal DNA binding halves show extremely strong sequence conservation (>95% identical residues), whereas the C-terminal acyl-CoA binding halves are much less conserved (∼25% identical residues). Moreover, all of the residues critical for DNA binding by E. coli FadR are conserved in all known FadR proteins, which strongly implies that the operator sequences bound by FadRs of these disparate organisms are the same or very similar to those of E. coli. Indeed, in these genome sequences one can find plausible operator sequences upstream of the relevant genes (22Sadovskaya N.S. Laikova O.N. Mironov A.a. Gelfand M.S. Mol. Biol. 2001; 35: 862-866Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal acyl-CoA binding regions are much more diverse. For example, in the E. coli FadR helices that contact myristoyl-CoA in the co-crystals (19van Aalten D.M. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Xu Y. Heath R.J. Li Z. Rock C.O. White S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17373-17379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) only 20–30% of the residues are conserved in the other FadR proteins. These findings suggest that different FadR proteins may be tuned to bind different acyl-CoA ligands with differing affinities.In the present study, we analyzed the FadR proteins of E. coli, Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus influenzae. The E. coli and S. enterica FadR proteins differ in only 7 of 239 residues, but interestingly all but one of the mismatches are in the C-terminal halves (Fig. 1). The other FadR homologues studied were chosen because their sequences seemed the most different from E. coli and from one another (Fig. 1). This includes P. multocida and H. influenzae, which despite both being Pasteurellaceae, have FadRs that are only 54% identical. V. cholerae FadR is unusual in that relative to the E. coli protein 40 residues are inserted into the midst of the protein (Fig. 1).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedia and Growth Conditions—Rich broth contained 10 g of Tryptone, 5 g of NaCl, and 1 g of yeast extract per liter. 2× YT medium contained 16 g of Tryptone, 5 g of NaCl, and 10 g of yeast extract per liter. Minimal medium was M9 medium (23Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 268-276Google Scholar) supplemented with 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mg/liter thiamine. Acetate was used at a final concentration of 0.4% as sole carbon source. Fatty acids were neutralized with KOH and solubilized with Tergitol NP-40 and were used at final concentrations of 1 g/liter (w/v) as carbon source and at 5 mm for induction. Solid media contained 1.5% (w/v) Bacto agar (Difco, Milwaukee, WI). Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations (in mg/liter): ampicillin, 100; kanamycin, 50; tetracycline, 12; and chloramphenicol, 25.Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—All bacterial strains are derivatives of E. coli K-12. Phage transduction and other basic genetic techniques were generally carried out as described by Miller (24Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar). Strains MFH9 (fadR::Tn5) and MFH13 (fadR::Tn5, fabAts) (8Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were used for fadR complementation and characterization of growth phenotype on minimal media containing fatty acids. The transcriptional fusion strain SI203 (fadBA-lacZ) was used to assay induction of the fad regulon genes. Strain SI207 (fadR fadBA-lacZ) derived from SI203 was used to assay the repressor activity of plasmid encoded FadR homologues. Strain BL21(λDE3)/pLysS was used as host for overproduction of FadR proteins (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). Other strains used in this study were: UB1005 (F–metB1 relA1 spoT1 gyrA216), MG1655 (rph-1 fnr?), and MC1061 (F– araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7696 galE15 galK16 Δ(lac)X74 rpsL hsdR2 (rK– mK+) mrcA mcrB1. Strain SI203 was constructed using λRed and flippase (FLP) 2The abbreviations used are: FLP, flippase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.-mediated site-specific recombination (26Ellermeier C.D. Janakiraman A. Slauch J.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 290: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase (Kan) gene of plasmid pKD4 (27Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10974) Google Scholar) was amplified via PCR using primers 1 plus 2 (see TABLE ONE). The resulting PCR product was used to replace the entire coding sequence of fadBA in strain MG1655 by homologous recombination catalyzed by the λred genes encoded by plasmid pKD46 (27Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10974) Google Scholar). The chromosomal structures of several kanamycin-resistant transformants were verified by colony PCR using primers three plus four, and one of these was called strain SI186. The temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20 (28Cherepanov P.P. Wackernagel W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar) encoding FLP recombinase was transformed into strain SI186, and transformants were plated on RB ampicillin at 30 °C to allow loss of the kanamycin resistance cassette leaving behind a single FRT site. The FRT site in the resulting strain was then used for FLP recombinase site-specific integration of a lac fusion plasmid pCE70 (26Ellermeier C.D. Janakiraman A. Slauch J.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 290: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) containing a FRT site upstream of the promoterless lacZY genes, a kanamycin resistance gene, and the R6K origin of replication. Transformants were plated on RB plates containing kanamycin and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. This resulted in the stable integration of the fusion plasmid due to the loss of the temperature-sensitive replication of pCP20 to produce fadBA-lacZ transcriptional fusion strain SI198. Strain SI203 was obtained by P1 transduction of strain MC1061 with a lysate grown on SI198 and selection for kanamycin resistance. Strain SI207 was generated by P1 transduction of strain SI203 with a lysate grown on MFH8 (8Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) followed by selection for tetracycline resistance. Plasmid pSH11 was made by PCR amplification of the fadR gene from the chromosomal DNA of strain UB1005 using primers 5 plus 6 (TABLE ONE). The resultant 983-bp PCR product was purified via Qiagen spin columns and cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The insert of the resultant plasmid was sequenced to verify the fidelity of the cloned PCR product. The sequenced plasmid was digested with HindIII and ClaI (sites introduced by the primers) and ligated to pACYC177 cut with the same enzymes. Note that this manipulation inserted the fadR gene into the kanamycin resistance gene of the vector in the orientation opposite to that of the resistance gene and its promoter. Similarly, plasmids pSH12, pSH13, and pSH14 were constructed using the PCR products of S. enterica, V. cholerae, and P. multocida genomic DNA obtained with primer sets 7 plus 8, 9 plus 10, and 11 plus 12, respectively. The resultant PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 and then subcloned into pACYC177 using HindIII-ClaI double digest for pSH12 and pSH13, whereas BamHI-ClaI double digest was used in case of pSH14. Plasmid pSH44 was constructed by subcloning a 1850-bp fragment carrying H. influenzae fadR gene from pGHIDM89 into pACYC177 using a HindIII-XhoI double digest. Plasmids pSH56 and pSH57 contain the fadR coding sequence of P. multocida and H. influenzae and the native promoters of both genes are replaced by E. coli fadR promoter sequence. Plasmids pSH56 and pSH57 were made by PCR amplification using pSH14 and pSH44 as templates with primer sets 13 plus 14 and 15 plus 16, respectively. Both forward primers 13 and 15 contained a 68-bp E. coli fadR promoter sequence that included the fadR ribosome binding site and 20 bp of sequence homologous to the first codons of either the P. multocida or H. influenzae fadR coding sequences. The resulting PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 to give pSH54 and pSH55. A BamHI-XhoI fragment from pSH54 and a HindIII-XhoI fragment from pSH55 (sites from pCR2.1) were subcloned into pACYC177 cut with the same enzymes to produce pSH56 and pSH57, respectively. Plasmid pSH89 encoding V. cholerae FadRΔ132–171 was constructed by overlap PCR (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). Briefly, two separate PCR amplifications were done from template plasmid pSH13 using primer sets 9 plus 27 and 28 plus 10. Primers 27 and 28 were designed such that their 3′ ends hybridized to a template sequence on one side of the deletion, and the 5′ ends are complementary to a template sequence on the opposite side of the deletion. The resulting PCR products of expected size were purified via Qiagen spin columns and used together as templates in a subsequent fusion PCR reaction with primers 9 plus 10. The PCR product of expected size was again purified and cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The insert of the resultant plasmid was sequenced and subcloned into pACYC177 using HindIII-ClaI double digest (sites within the primers) to give plasmid pSH89.TABLE ONEOligonucleotide primers used in this studyPrimerSequence (5′→3′)1TCATCTGGTACGACCAGATCACCTTGCGGATTCAGGAGACTGACTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC2TTAAACCCGCTCAAACACCGTCGCAATACCCTGACCCAGACCGACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG3CTGCAGTCTGCCGAGCGTGATCAGATC4AAGCTTACGCTGGCGCGTCTTATCAGG5CCCAAGCTTGGGCAGGCAGGAGTGAGGCAAG6CCATCGATGGCAGCATCGAGTTGCTGG7CCCAAGCTTGGGCGACGAATGCAAGCAAG8CCATCGATGGCCGCCGCGCATGAAC9CCCAAGCTTGGGTTTCGACGTACACCAAC10CCATCGATGGCGAACAGTGCTAGATTAGC11CGCGGATCCGCGGCAACTAAGAGCCAACCG12CCATCGATGGCTGCACCGTACTGAATACG13TGTCTGCTATCAGCGTAGTTAGCCCTCTGGTATGATGAGTCCAACTTTGTTTTGCTGTGTTATG GAAAGAAACGTATGAATAATGATC14GTGCATAGCGTCGCAATGCTCAATGATCGATCTGCACCGTACTGAATACGAGTGCAGATTTCGCAAGATGTGTTATCTGG15TGTCTGCTATCAGCGTAGTTAGCCCTCTGGTATGATGAGTCCAACTTTGTTTTGCTGTGTTATGGAAAAATTGTAATGCAAAACAATA16TCGTTCATCCAGAGCGTGATTTCTGCCGAGCGTGATCAGATCGGCATTATCGATCGCTTCCAGTATTAATCTGATAAAT17GCATATGGTCATTAAGGCGCAAAGC18GGATCCGGCAGCATCGAGTTGCTGG19GCATATGGTCATTAAGGCGCAGAGC20GGATCCGCCGCGCATGAACATGC21GCATATGGTCATTAAGGCAAAAAG22GGATCCTTAGCAATCGTCTTCAGTAAA23GCATATGAATAATGATCAACCTCT24GGATCCCGCAAGATGTGTTATCTGGT25CCATATGCAAAACAATAACGACAT26GGATCCCTTCCAGTATTAATCTGATA27AGATTTCCTGCCTAATCACATTGATCATGATCCGCTC28TGATCAATGTGATTAGGCAGGAAATCTTGATCGCGAAAAC Open table in a new tab Construction of Genes Encoding His6-tagged FadR Homologues—The fadR gene of strain UB1005 was amplified via PCR using Easy-A High-Fidelity Polymerase (Stratagene) under standard PCR conditions using primer set 17 plus 18. The resultant 822-bp PCR product was purified via Qiagen spin column and cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The insert of the resultant plasmid was sequenced to verify the fidelity of the cloned PCR product. The sequenced plasmid was digested with NdeI and BamHI (sites within the primers) and ligated to pET16b cut with the same enzymes to give in-frame fusion of the coding sequence of the FadR N terminus to that of the His tag of the vector to give pSH77. Plasmids pSH78, pSH79, pSH80, and pSH81 were constructed in the same manner using primer sets 19 plus 20, 21 plus 22, 23 plus 24, and 25 plus 26, respectively, with the appropriate chromosomal DNA preparations.Western Blot Analyses—Western blotting of cell extracts from E. coli fadR strains transformed with the plasmid constructs harboring the different fadR homologues or the empty vector control was carried out as follows. Cultures were grown overnight in RB medium plus ampicillin, then sub-cultured 1:100 in the same media and grown until mid-log phase. Crude extracts were loaded on an equal cell number basis and separated on 12% resolving SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad). The separated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) for 60 min at 90 V. The membrane was incubated first in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk powder for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Following this blocking step the membrane was probed with rabbit polyclonal antibody (raised against E. coli His6-FadR protein) diluted 1:1000 in the antibody buffer (0.25% Triton X-100 and 2% nonfat milk powder in TBS buffer) for an additional hour. After rinsing four times with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in TBS buffer), the membrane was incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:20,000 in antibody buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed as above and the FadR proteins were visualized by incubation of the membrane in ECL Plus chemiluminescent detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences).β-Galactosidase Assays—Overnight cultures were grown in either RB medium or RB medium supplemented with oleate. The overnight cultures were subcultured into the same medium and shaken at 37 °C. When the cultures reached mid-log phase the cells were pelleted and then washed twice with RB medium containing 0.5% Tergitol NP-40 and three times with RB medium to remove fatty acid and detergent. After the final rinse the cells were resuspended to 4 × 108 cells/ml and assayed for β-galactosidase activity after chloroform/sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis as described by Miller (24Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar). The cell debris in the assay mix was removed by centrifugation prior to reading the absorbance at 420 nm. All cultures contained Tergitol NP-40 and received the washing treatment regardless of oleate supplementation.Expression and Purification of His6-FadR Proteins—The His6-FadR proteins of E. coli, S. enterica, V. cholerae, H. influenzae, and P. multocida were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(λDE3)/pLysS harboring a FadR coding plasmid using the T7 polymerase expression system (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). Cultures (1 liter) were grown in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 37 °C until an optical density of ∼0.5 was reached, and then 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added followed by incubation for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended (4-fold concentration) in ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and centrifuged for 5 min at 4,000 × g. The pellets were stored at –80 °C until further use. All further purification steps were performed at 5 °C. For purification of the His-tagged proteins frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice for 15 min prior to the addition of 20 ml of buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). Lysozyme (1 mg/ml) was added, and after 30 min of incubation on ice the cells were disrupted via sonication. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and 3 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) was added to the resultant supernatant. The slurry was rotated slowly at 5 °C for 60 min, and the resin was loaded into a 5-ml column and washed with 5 volumes of Buffer B (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). The His6-tagged protein was eluted by 1 ml of buffer C (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole). The elution was repeated 4 times. The purity of the samples was monitored via SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled and dialyzed against two changes of calorimetry buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride) for 12 h at 5 °C. Following dialysis 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol were added prior to storage at –80 °C.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed using a VP-isothermal titration calorimeter from MicroCal Inc. (Northampton, MA). This instrument has been described in detail by Wiseman et al. (30Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). To improve baseline stability, the temperature of the system was kept about 5 °C below the working temperature. All solutions were degassed under vacuum with stirring immediately before use. All samples were prepared in, and thoroughly dialyzed against, the same batch of buffer to minimize artifacts due to minor differences in buffer composition. The ligand concentration in the titration syringe was usually 10-fold higher than the protein concentration in the cell. The protein concentrations were ∼0.01–0.03 mm and were measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using calculated (31Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar) molar extinction coefficients (m–1 cm–1)) of 33,120, 33,120, 37,200, 34,520, and 35,800 for the E. coli, S. enterica, V. cholerae, H. influenzae, and P. multocida His6-FadRs, respectively. The experiments were performed at 30 °C, and injections were begun after equilibration to baseline stability. Each injection consisted of a volume of 10 μl and a 10-s duration, with a 240-s interval between injections. The syringe was rotated at 300 rpm during the experiment to assure immediate mixing. Nonspecific heat effects were estimated from the magnitude of the peaks appearing after complete saturation. Raw data were integrated, corrected for nonspecific heat, and analyzed using the ORIGIN software supplied with the instrument. The total heat of binding (ΔH), the association constant (Ka), and the binding stoichiometry (n) were obtained by nonlinear regression fitting to the isotherm.RESULTSCloning and Expression of fadR Gene Homologues—The fadR gene homologues of E. coli, S. enterica, V. cholerae, P. multocida, and H. influenzae were cloned into the moderate copy number vector pACYC177 under control of their native promoters to give plasmids pSH11, pSH12, pSH13, pSH14, and pSH44, respectively (TABLE TWO). We used the pACYC177 vector due to prior work (32DiRusso C.C. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because it seemed possible that some of the FadR homologue proteins might be weak repressors, the function of which could be overlooked at lower expression levels. These plasmids were introduced into the E. coli fadR null mutant strain MFH9, and the FadR expression was assayed in extracts of these strains by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody raised against E. coli FadR (Fig. 2). These analyses showed that the plasmids encoding the E. coli, S. enterica, and V. cholerae FadRs expressed similar levels of the FadR proteins. However, the P. multocida and H. influenzae FadR proteins were only very weakly expressed. This could be due to either a lack of cross-reactivity with the antibody raised against E. coli FadR and/or poor recognition of the Pasteurellaceae fadR promoters by the E. coli transcriptional machinery. Because the latter hypothesis seemed more likely, we replaced the native promoters and ribosome binding sites of the P."
https://openalex.org/W2019029225,"The Mdm2 and Mdm4 genes are amplified and overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and encode structurally related oncoproteins that bind to the p53 tumor suppressor protein and inhibit p53 activity. Mice deleted for either Mdm2 or Mdm4 die during embryogenesis, and the developmental lethality of either mouse model can be rescued by concomitant deletion of p53. However, the phenotypes of Mdm2 and Mdm4-deficient mice suggest that Mdm2 and Mdm4 play nonoverlapping roles in regulating p53 activity during development, with Mdm2 regulating p53-mediated cell death and Mdm4 regulating p53-mediated inhibition of cell growth. Here, we describe complete rescue of Mdm4-deficient mice by expression of an Mdm2 transgene, and demonstrate that Mdm2 can regulate both p53-mediated apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth in the absence of Mdm4 in primary cells. Furthermore, deletion of Mdm4 enhances the ability of Mdm2 to promote cell growth and tumor formation, indicating that Mdm4 has antioncogenic properties when Mdm2 is overexpressed."
https://openalex.org/W2114034523,"To clarify stress-induced immunological reactions and molecular events during exercise and the potential relevance to exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, transcriptional responses to standardized physical stress were determined. Six healthy, young volunteers underwent an endurance exercise of 90% of their individual anaerobic threshold for 90 min. Time-dependent alterations in the expression pattern of leukocytes from healthy, trained subjects were analyzed by DNA microarrays before and 2 h and 6 h after exercise. Starting out from a large collection of cDNA library clones comprising more than 70,000 human expressed sequence tags, we selected, designed, and immobilized oligonucleotide probes (60-70mers) for transcripts of 5000 stress- and inflammation-relevant genes. Exercise-induced stress provoked changes in the expression of 433 gene activities 2 h and/or 6 h after exercise, which could be grouped into six clusters. The most prominent feature was an enhanced transcription of two genes, coding for 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) and ALOX5-activating protein. Moreover, enhanced levels of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and LTC4 (P<0.05) were detected in plasma after exercise. Our data demonstrate that exercise alters the activities of a distinct number of genes. In particular, they possibly provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and suggest that enhanced transcription of ALOX5 and its activating protein together with a present predisposition of the subject critically contribute to exercise-induced asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2028924607,"DsbB is a disulfide oxidoreductase present in the Escherichia coli plasma membrane. Its cysteine pairs, Cys41–Cys44 and Cys104–Cys130, facing the periplasm, as well as the bound quinone molecules play crucial roles in oxidizing DsbA, the protein dithiol oxidant in the periplasm. In this study, we characterized quinone-free forms of DsbB prepared from mutant cells unable to synthesize ubiquinone and menaquinone. While such preparations lacked detectable quinones, previously reported lauroylsarcosine treatment was ineffective in removing DsbB-associated quinones. Moreover, DsbB-bound quinone was shown to contribute to the redox-dependent fluorescence changes observed with DsbB. Now we reconfirmed that redox potentials of cysteine pairs of quinone-free DsbB are lower than that of DsbA, as far as determined in dithiothreitol redox buffer. Nevertheless, the quinone-free DsbB was able to oxidize ∼40% of DsbA in a 1:1 stoichiometric reaction, in which hemi-oxidized forms of DsbB having either disulfide are generated. It was suggested that the DsbB-DsbA system is designed in such a way that specific interaction of the two components enables the thiol-disulfide exchanges in the “forward” direction. In addition, a minor fraction of quinone-free DsbB formed the DsbA-DsbB disulfide complex stably. Our results show that the rapid and the slow pathways of DsbA oxidation can proceed up to significant points, after which these reactions must be completed and recycled by quinones under physiological conditions.

We discuss the significance of having such multiple reaction pathways for the DsbB-dependent DsbA oxidation. Many secretory proteins undergo oxidative folding, in which they acquire intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds. The periplasmic space of Escherichia coli contains a series of Dsb enzymes, which catalyze introduction and isomerization of protein disulfide bonds (1Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 2Nakamoto H. Bardwell J.C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). DsbA is the primary disulfide bond donor having the Cys30–Cys33 disulfide at the active site. It is kept in the oxidized and active state by a cytoplasmic membrane protein, DsbB, which transmits electrons from DsbA to either UQ 2The abbreviations used are: UQ, ubiquinone; UQ8, ubiquinone-8 (an endogenous ubiquinone in E. coli); UQ1, ubiquinone-1 (a commercial chemical product used as an exogenous source of ubiquinone in vitro); MK, menaquinone; MK8, menaquinone-8 (an endogenous menaquinone in E. coli); DsbB(ΔQ), quinone-free DsbB; DsbB(UQ8), ubiquinone-8-bearing DsbB; DsbB(MK8), manaquinone-8-bearing DsbB; DTT, dithiothreitol; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; LS, lauroyl-sarcosine; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; PMF, peptide mass fingerprinting; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. or MK, the source of oxidizing power under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, respectively (3Kobayashi T.

Whereas it is believed that the respiratory quinones enable the DsbB-DsbA cascade to cycle catalytically, there are conflicting views about the basic redox reactivity of DsbB. DsbB is integrated into the membrane via its four transmembrane segments, with cytoplasmic termini, a short cytoplasmic loop, and two periplasmic regions. Each of its periplasmic regions contains a pair of cysteines, Cys41–Cys44 and Cys104–Cys130, respectively, which are essential for its function (7Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Whereas the Cys104–Cys130 pair seems to be involved directly in the disulfide exchange with DsbA (8Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Kishigami S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17072-17074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the Cys41–Cys44 pair was shown to be kept oxidized by respiratory functions in vivo (10Kobayashi T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and by quinone molecules in vitro (4Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We (11Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and others (12Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32706-32713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) determined the redox potential values for these cysteine pairs. Contrary to an expectation that the DsbB active sites will be more oxidizing than the Cys30–Cys33 active site of DsbA (standard redox potential, -120 mV), redox potentials of Cys41–Cys44 and Cys104–Cys130 of DsbB were found to be around -210 mV and -250 mV, respectively. Apparently, the DsbB-quinone complex seems to be able to catalyze “uphill” electron transfer with respect to the redox potential differences between the DsbA cysteines and the DsbB cysteines. Grauschopf et al. (13Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) argued subsequently that DsbB-bound UQ must be removed and direct spectroscopic measurements rather than the chemical modification of free thiols must be used to accurately estimate the redox potentials of the DsbB active sites. Thus, they attempted to remove the bound UQ by LS treatment of the DsbB preparation and measured fluorescence changes of the preparation in different redox buffers. Their results showed that Cys41–Cys44 in DsbB was even more oxidizing (-69 mV) than Cys30–Cys33 of DsbA. Whereas Grauschopf et al. (13Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) addressed the issue correctly, the LS treatment did not effectively remove DsbB-bound quinones in our hand. Instead, we prepared quinone-free DsbB by genetically inactivating the enzymes responsible for the biosyntheses of UQ and MK and used such a preparation of DsbB to study reactivities of quinone-free DsbB. Our reassessments showed that the redox potentials of individual cysteine pairs did not differ significantly from those we determined previously. Surprisingly, the quinone-free DsbB was still able to oxidize ∼40% of DsbA by apparent disulfide exchange reactions, whereas other fraction of DsbB was engaged in the formation of the DsbA-DsbB disulfide complex. We discuss how individual elements in this system are integrated into the elaborate multiple mechanisms that ensure effective recycling of the disulfide bond formation reactions, in which quinone molecules play essential roles. Preparation of Various Forms of DsbB and DsbA—All the DsbB derivative proteins in this work contained a C-terminally attached His6-tag as well as Ala and Val substitutions for nonessential DsbB cysteines, Cys8 and Cys49, respectively (4Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In the standard preparations, they were over-produced from plasmid in wild-type E. coli cells and purified essentially as described previously (14Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-h. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DsbB thus obtained is referred to as Dsb-B(UQ8) as it contains endogenously bound UQ8. To prepare DsbB without bound quinones (DsbB(ΔQ)), it was overproduced in the ubiA menA double mutant strain, AN384 (15Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) as described by Inaba et al. (14Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-h. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We also prepared DsbB with endogenously bound MK8 (DsbB(MK8)) by overproducing it in the ubiA- mutant strain, TA36, as described by Takahashi et al. (6Takahashi Y.-h. Inaba K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47057-47065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DsbA was prepared as described previously (11Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reduced forms of DsbA and DsbB were prepared as follows. Purified DsbA was reduced by incubation with 20 mm DTT for 30 min, followed by gel filtration (PD-10 Sephadex column, Amersham Biosciences) to remove DTT. DsbB was likewise reduced with DTT but more careful gel filtration steps were required because it is prone to rapid air oxidation in the absence of DTT. Thus, we first equilibrated Bio-Spin resin with degassed buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% DDM) containing 20 mm DTT for 30 min, which was then washed thoroughly with degassed DTT-free buffer before loading of a DTT-reduced DsbB preparation. Concentrations of DsbA and of DsbB were determined by the BCA method, using bovine serum albumin as standard. Identification of DsbB-bound Quinone Species—Quinones were extracted from the DsbB preparations essentially as described by Takahashi et al. (6Takahashi Y.-h. Inaba K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47057-47065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The extract was separated by Shim-pack VP-ODS reverse phase column chromatography, using Shimadzu LCMS-2010A, with elution with methyl alcohol-isopropyl alcohol (3:1) and flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The chromatographic peak of UQ represented the DsbB-bound UQ semiquantitatively, as we used samples of extensive (four times cumulative) hexane extraction (6Takahashi Y.-h. Inaba K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47057-47065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Also, we were able to detect consistent mutational alterations of the UQ peak intensities. 3K. Inaba, unpublished results. To establish the peak identities, the peak fractions were subjected to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry with scanning for m/z 900 to m/z 100 in 1 s. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence of each DsbB derivative (1 μm) was measured with excitation wavelength of 295 nm and emission wavelengths of 300–400 nm, using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer. The buffer used was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1 containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.1% DDM. Determination of the Redox Potentials of DsbB(ΔQ)—The redox potential values of the active sites in DsbB(ΔQ) were determined as described by Inaba and Ito (11Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, DsbB(ΔQ) (1 μm) was incubated at30°Cfor 3 or 16 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1 containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% DDM, 100 mm oxidized DTT (Sigma), and different concentrations (1 μm to 5mm) of reduced DTT. To minimize air oxidation, buffer solutions were thoroughly degassed and flushed with nitrogen before use. After incubation, samples were treated with trichloroacetic acid of a final concentration of 5%. The protein precipitates were washed with cold acetone and then dissolved in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, and 2 mm AMS. Reduced (AMS-derivatized) and oxidized (non-derivatized) forms of DsbB were separated by 12% non-reducing SDS-PAGE, stained with CBB, and quantified by LAS-1000 CCD imaging. The equilibrium constant and the standard redox potential were calculated as described by Huber-Wunderlich and Glockshuber (16Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). DsbB(ΔQ)-DsbA Redox Reactions—Procedures described by Inaba and Ito (11Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were used to follow disulfide exchange reactions between DsbB(ΔQ) and DsbA, one of which had been reduced immediately before use. In brief, equimolar concentrations (40 μm) of oxidized and reduced proteins were incubated at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.1% DDM. At specified time points, the reaction was terminated by mixing an aliquot with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were then processed for AMS modification, SDS-PAGE (12%), and CBB staining. Characterization of the Partially Reduced Forms of DsbB—In the above analysis, the AMS modification caused different degrees of gel mobility shifts of DsbB depending on the numbers and the locations of the alkylated cysteines and of non-modified intramolecular disulfide bonds. The different mobility DsbB species that appeared after reaction with DsbA (bands 1–3 in Fig. 5D) were characterized by PMF analyses. The stained gel bands were excised and subjected to digestions with lysyl endopeptidase and trypsin. Digested peptides were extracted as described by Tie et al. (17Tie J.-K. Mutucumarana V.P. Straight D.L. Carrick K.L. Pope R. Stafford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45468-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems). The reflector mode was used for peak detections in the mass range of 800–3,100 (m/z), where the monoisotopic mass peaks were measured. For the mass range of 3,000–10,000 (m/z), the linear mode displayed the averaged mass peaks. The program MS-Fit (Protein Prospector) was used for the peptide identification. Quinone-free DsbB Can Be Prepared by Expressing DsbB in Quinone-deficient Mutant—DsbB is usually prepared as a complex with UQ8 (5Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.-A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In our previous study (6Takahashi Y.-h. Inaba K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47057-47065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-h. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we prepared DsbB after its overproduction in different E. coli cells, the wild-type strain, the ubiA mutant defective in UQ biosynthesis, and the ubiA menA double mutant defective in biosynthesis of both UQ and MK (15Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Now we directly determined the quinone contents of such preparations. Materials extracted by organic solvent were separated by reverse-phase column chromatography (Fig. 1). DsbB from wild-type cells gave a peak of retention time 12.5 min (Fig. 1, trace a) and that from the ubiA mutant cells gave a peak at 15.5 min (Fig. 1, trace b). Mass spectrometry established the identities of these peaks as those of UQ8 and MK8, respectively (6Takahashi Y.-h. Inaba K. Ito K. J. Biol.

In contrast, DsbB from the double mutant cells yielded no detectable materials that were eluted at these positions (Fig. 1, trace d), justifying the notation of DsbB(ΔQ) for it. The absence of quinones in our DsbB(ΔQ) preparations was also confirmed by the lack of NaBH4-dependent change in A275.2 In the presence of exogenously added UQ1, DsbB(ΔQ) was fully active in catalyzing DsbA oxidation with kcat of 7.0 ± 0.4 nm UQ1/nm DsbB/s and Km for UQ1 of 2.8 ± 0.5 μm (at pH 8.0; data not shown). We also attempted to remove UQ8 from a DsbB(UQ8) preparation by the LS treatment procedures of Grauschopf et al. (13Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although peaks of early retention times, presumably some impurities, were decreased by the LS treatment, the UQ peak was not at all affected by this treatment (Fig. 1, compare trace c with a). The peak identity was confirmed by its mass of 728 Da exactly corresponding to that of UQ8. It was not appropriate to repeat washings with LS because such manipulations led to the formation of DsbB aggregates.2 Thus, we were unable to obtain UQ-free DsbB by LS treatment, although it remains unsettled why Grauschopf et al. (13Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) did not detect UQ by the NaBH4-dependent absorbance change with their preparations. Absence of the Redox-dependent Fluorescence Changes for Quinone-free DsbB—We were able to reproduce the observation (13Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that DTT treatment of DsbB (DsbB(UQ8) in our case) resulted in a significant increase of tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 2A, broken line). However, we found that DsbB(ΔQ) exhibited the higher fluorescence without any DTT treatment (Fig. 2B, continuous line). DsbB(ΔQ) was in the fully oxidized state (Fig. 2I, lane 3), which was reduced with DTT (Fig. 2I, lane 4) without any further increase in the fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B, broken line). Similarly different behaviors were observed between the UQ-bound and the UQ-free forms of DsbB[CCSS] 4DsbB variants having cysteine to serine substitutions at positions 41, 44, 104, and/or 130 are indicated by C for cysteine and S for serine for these positions in the above order (for instance, DsbB[SSCC] for a variant with positions 41 and 44 mutated). (Fig. 2, C and D). However, DsbB[SSCC] no longer responded to DTT (Fig. 2E), in agreement with the previous observation (13Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because the [SSCC] variant does not actively interact with UQ (10Kobayashi T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32706-32713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the results obtained above collectively suggest that bound UQ was somehow responsible for the DTT-induced fluorescence increase observed for DsbB(UQ8). A simplest interpretation may be that the bound UQ quenches the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of DsbB and that the DTT treatment of the DsbB-UQ complex reduces UQ, possibly leading to dissociation of the resulting ubiquinol from DsbB. In support of the UQ-mediated quenching mechanism, addition of increasing concentrations of UQ1 to the DsbB(ΔQ) sample led to the progressive reduction of fluorescence (Fig. 2M). The fluorescence intensity of DsbB[SSCC](UQ8) was low (Fig. 2E), comparable to that of the wild-type DsbB(UQ8) without DTT treatment. In contrast, DsbB[SSCC](ΔQ), irrespective of DTT treatment, exhibited the higher fluorescence intensity comparable to the DTT-induced value of wild-type DsbB(UQ8) (Fig. 2F). Similar results were obtained with [CSSC] forms of these proteins (Fig. 2, G and H). These results suggest that the reduction of UQ was mediated by the Cys41 and Cys44 residues of DsbB, in the absence of which UQ remained oxidized and active in quenching the fluorescence. At any event, our results indicate that the DTT-induced fluorescence increase observed for Dsb-B(UQ8) does not represent the redox state change of DsbB itself. UQ molecules on DsbB behave like a static fluorescence quencher, although the quenching mechanism remains unclear due to lack of structural information on DsbB. The fluorescence decrease induced by quinone analogues was also observed previously for other ubiquinone oxidoreductases (18Watmough N.J. Loehr J.P. Drake S.K. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Redox Properties of DsbB Cysteines in the Absence of Quinones—As shown above, the fluorescence intensity changes observed for Dsb-B(UQ8) do not report changes in the DsbB protein itself, although they could be useful to assess the redox reactivity of the DsbB-UQ combination (see “Discussion”). Clearly, fluorometry is not a method of choice for the determination of redox potentials of DsbB(ΔQ). This forced us to use the thiol alkylation method to assess its redox states, taking great care to achieve quantitative protein recovery at each step of sample manipulation. We thus determined the intrinsic redox potential of each active site of DsbB(ΔQ) by equilibrating it with a series of redox buffers followed by acid treatment, subsequent derivatization of reduced cysteines with AMS, and gel electrophoresis (11Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32706-32713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We used [CCSS] and [SSCC] variants of DsbB(ΔQ) to determine redox potential for Cys41–Cys44 and for Cys104–Cys130, respectively. Although glutathione redox buffer is often used for this type of determination, we and others noted that the active sites of DsbB, particularly Cys104–Cys130, exhibited unusually low reactivity with glutathione (5Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.-A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used DTTred/DTTox buffer. The DsbB(ΔQ) variants were equilibrated with different ratios of DTTred/DTTox at 30 °C, acid-denatured and AMS-treated. They were then separated by SDS-PAGE into the reduced (derivatized) and oxidized (non-derivatized) species (Fig. 3A). Because incubations for 3 and for 16 h gave identical results, the redox states of the proteins were in equilibrium with each of the DTTred/DTTox ratios used. Fractions of the reduced form were plotted against the DTTred/DTTox ratios (Fig. 3B) to calculate the equilibrium constants, 3.1 × 10-4 and 1.2 × 10-3 for DsbB[CCSS](ΔQ) and DsbB[SSCC](ΔQ), respectively. From the known redox potential of DTT (-312 mV) (19Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), we determined the standard redox potential values, -207 mV and -224 mV for Cys41–Cys44 and Cys104-Cys130, respectively. These values are similar to those determined previously for UQ-bound proteins using cysteine/cystine redox buffers (11Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The DsbB cysteines are less oxidizing than DsbA even in the UQ-free state. We also used a [CSSC] form of DsbB(ΔQ), in which its Cys41 and Cys130 form a disulfide bond (14Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-h. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This alternative combination of disulfide bond may be physiologically relevant because it is probably formed in the DsbA-DsbB intermediate complex during one of the reaction pathways of this system (Refs. 14Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-h. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 20Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; also, see “Discussion” and Fig. 7). The Cys41–Cys130 combination proved to have redox potential of -224 mV (Figs. 3, A–C). Thus, this transient disulfide bond is as stable as the two disulfide bonds that DsbB forms in the resting state. The use of cysteine mutants in the above experiments could have been problematic and we were concerned about the possibility that the serine substitutions present in the above constructs may have affected the redox property of each element to be determined. We therefore carried out the same analysis using wild type DsbB(ΔQ). In this case, two species of partially reduced forms of DsbB with different electrophoretic mobilities were observed in the midst of the redox transition (Fig. 3D). They correspond to the half-oxidized species having only one of the Cys41–Cys44 and Cys104–Cys130 pairs oxidized (see below for their identities). Importantly, the transitions occurred between the DTTred/DT-Tox ratios of 1.0 × 10-4 and 2.0 × 10-2, which did not significantly differ from the transition points observed with DsbB[CCSS](ΔQ) and DsbB[SSCC](ΔQ) (compare Fig. 3, D with A). Thus, we conclude that DsbB cysteines have intrinsic redox potentials that are significantly lower than the active site cysteines of DsbA. Reverse Direction Redox Reactions between DsbA and Quinone-free DsbB—We then examined redox reactions between DsbA and quinone-free DsbB (wild-type, as well as CCSS, SSCC, or CSSC variant), one of which was reduced, as described under “Materials and Methods,” before incubation with the other. In a series of experiments shown in Fig. 4, reduced forms of DsbB(ΔQ) and its variants were incubated with oxidized DsbA. These reactions may be called “reverse-direction” reactions in view of the physiological direction of the electron flow. In equimolar reverse reactions, DsbA oxidized ∼90% of DsbB[SSCC](ΔQ) within 1 min (Fig. 4A). In contrast, DsbA oxidation of DsbB[CCSS](ΔQ) was much slower and insignificant (Fig. 4B). These results are similar to those obtained previously using quinone-bound or LS-treated DsbB preparations (11Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The rapid reverse reaction between DsbA and DsbB Cys104-Cys130 is consistent with the observed redox potential differences between DsbA and DsbB as well as with the fact that Cys104–Cys130 pair of DsbB directly interacts with DsbA (21Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Cys41–Cys44 pair does not directly interact with DsbA (11Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We also noted that DsbA only slowly oxidized DsbB[CSSC](ΔQ) (Fig. 4C). —In a 1:1 reaction involving wild-type DsbB(ΔQ), DsbA oxidized DsbB(ΔQ) rapidly (within 1 min), with concomitant and complete reduction of DsbA itself. DsbB(ΔQ) was converted into two half-oxidized species (Fig. 4D, bands 1 and 2 in lanes 2–4). The partial oxidation of DsbB(ΔQ) was expected because the numbers of cysteines involved were 2 and 4, respectively, for DsbA and DsbB(ΔQ). The results shown in Fig. 4, A–C suggest that DsbA oxidizes the Cys104–Cys130 pair preferentially. This can be true also for its action against the wild-type DsbB. Thus, it is possible that Cys104–Cys130 is first and directly oxidized, producing the band 2 species (having oxidized Cys104–Cys130 as shown below), and that subsequent thiol-disulfide exchange within DsbB resulted in the equally populated band 1 (having oxidized Cys41–Cys44 as shown below) and band"
https://openalex.org/W1994997057,"The visual process in rod cells is initiated by absorption of a photon in the rhodopsin retinal chromophore and consequent retinal cis/trans-isomerization. The ring structure of retinal is thought to be needed to transmit the photonic energy into conformational changes culminating in the active metarhodopsin II (Meta II) intermediate. Here, we demonstrate that cis-acyclic retinals, lacking four carbon atoms of the ring, can activate rhodopsin. Detailed analysis of the activation pathway showed that, although the photoproduct pathway is more complex, Meta II formed with almost normal kinetics. However, lack of the ring structure resulted in a low amount of Meta II and a fast decay of activity. We conclude that the main role of the ring structure is to maintain the active state, thus specifying a mechanism of activation by a partial agonist of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin."

Infection occurs by ingestion of the cyst form of the parasite, which then differentiates to trophozoites that colonize the intestine and other organs, including the liver (1Stanley S.L. Lancet. 2003; 361: 1025-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins, glycolipids, and lectins on the surface of trophozoites are thought to play pivotal roles in regulating host cell adhesion and invasion and may be potential targets for drugs and vaccines (2Stanley S.L.

The lack of a morphologically defined Golgi apparatus (GA) led until recently to the hypothesis that these protists had evolved prior to the acquisition of this organelle (7Bakker-Grunwald T.

Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 10Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). Very recent ultrastructural evidence as well as immunolocalization studies with trophozoites suggest that GA-like elements do occur in this organism. Cryofixation and cryosubstitution studies showed flattened cisternae in the cytoplasm that resemble GA of higher eukaryotes (11Chavez-Munguia B. Espinosa-Castellano M. Castanon G. Martinez-Palomo A. Arch. Med. Res. 2000; 31: 165-167Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Antibodies against mammalian GA proteins such as €COP and ARF labeled vesicles of trophozoites that could be disrupted by Brefeldin A and okadaic acid, both known disrupters of GA structures of higher eukaryotes (3Ghosh S.K.

Cell Microbiol. 2003; 5: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Previously, a combination of cytochemical and transmission electron microscopy studies identified Eh vesicles with glucose-6-phosphatase and thiamine pyrophosphatase activities as well as vesicles fluorescently labeled with C6–12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl))-ceramide. These approaches have been previously used to identify ER and GA elements of higher eukaryotes (13Mazzuco A. Benchimol M. De Souza W. Micron. 1997; 28: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cytosolic and luminal side of the ER membrane and the luminal side of the GA cisternae of higher and lower eukaryotes are the principal subcellular organellar sites where glycosylation of proteins and lipids occur (9Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 10Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). The nucleotide substrates for the luminal reactions, nucleotide sugars, which are mostly synthesized in the cytosol, must first be translocated into the lumens of the above organelles. Translocation is mediated by specific transporters in a nucleotide sugar transport/antiport cycle with the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate (14Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of this cycle is well documented as mutants in nucleotide sugar transporters as well as in antiporter-generating enzymes have biochemical and developmental phenotypes described in humans, cows, yeast, nematodes, Drosophila, Leishmania, and plants (14Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 15Hirschberg C.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Very recently the entire genome of Eh was published (16Loftus B. Anderson I. Davies R. Alsmark U.C.M. Samuelson J. Amedeo P. Roncaglia R. Berriman M. Hirt R.P. Mann B.J. et al.Nature. 2005; 433: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Examination of this genome suggested the presence of genes encoding three putative nucleotide sugar transporters as well as other putative GA and ER proteins of the nucleotide sugar transport/antiport cycle including nucleotide phosphatases and the UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. We have used a combination of bioinformatics as well as biochemical and cell biological approaches to obtain evidence for GA- and ER-like functions of the above proteins suggesting that glycoconjugates may be synthesized in this organism in a manner broadly analogous to these macromolecules in higher eukaryotes. Radioactive Substrates—The following radioactive substrates used were all from PerkinElmer Life Sciences except as indicated: UDP-[3H]Glc (11.5 Ci/mmol), UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (39.7 Ci/mmol), UDP-[3H]GalNAc (5.8 Ci/mmol),), GDP-[14C]mannose (260 mCi/mmol), GDP-[3H]fucose (17.5 Ci/mmol), CMP-[3H]sialic acid (33.6 Ci/mmol). UDP-[3H]Gal (5.8 Ci/mmol) and UDP-[14C]GlcA (300 mCi/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Molecular Biology—Standard molecular biology protocols were used as described by Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) unless otherwise noted. The EhNST1 gene (locus 425.t00006) was amplified from total DNA isolated from Eh HM1 (a generous gift of Dr. Suchismita Das) by PCR using puRETaq DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) and primers XbaIVSV (forward) and XhoIrev (reverse). The sequence of the oligonucleotide primers was CTCTCTAGAATGTACACTGATATCGAAATGAACCGCCTGGGTAAGAACTCAAGTGTAGTCAGCTTAATTTTTCTTGTTTTATTGTGTTGTC (XbaIVSV) and GAGCTCGAGTTAGTTTTCAGCCTTTACGTACTTATCATTATAATTAGCAATTGAAATAATGAC(XhoIrev). The isolated PCR product (EhNST1) sequence fused with an 11 amino acid VSV-G tag coding sequence was digested with XbaI/XhoI and ligated to the p426GPD vector (digested with SpeI/XhoI) to obtain plasmid pEhNST1 for the expression in yeast (18Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). The identity of the cloned fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Yeast Strain, Transformation, and Growth Media—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PRY225 (ura3-52, lys2-801am, ade2-1020c, his3, leu2, trp1Δ1) was used to express EhNST1. For transformation with pEhNST1 a lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method was utilized (19Elble R. Bio/Technology. 1992; 13: 18-20Google Scholar). Cells were grown in complete medium (0.75% yeast extract, 1.13% tryptone, 2.2% dextrose), and transformants were selected for their ability to grow in the absence of uracil on plates containing 6.7% yeastnitrogen base without amino acids (YNB), 0.67% complete supplemented medium minus Ura (Ura–), 2.2% dextrose, and 1.5% agar. Western Blotting Analysis—Total membrane fractions, from 3 ml of liquid yeast cultures (A600 = 3.0), were prepared by glass bead disruption of the cells in membrane buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 10 mm triethanolamine/acetic acid, pH 7.2, at 4 °C) plus 2 mm dithiothreitol followed by centrifugation at 134,000 × g for 1 h. Total membranes were resuspended in membrane buffer, and proteins were electrophoresed on 12% SDS acrylamide gels according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and subsequently electrotransferred onto Millipore Immobilon P membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membranes for 1 h at room temperature in 0.05% Tween and 1% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The membranes were incubated 1 h with 1 μg/ml mouse anti-VSV-G antibody (Roche Applied Science) in phosphate-buffered saline. Detection was performed by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse IgG (Promega) followed by chemiluminescence using ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast Subcellular Fractionation—Typically 3 liters of S. cerevisiae PYR225 transformed with p426GPD or pEhNST1 were grown in SCMURA liquid medium to an A600 of 3.0. The culture was chilled and centrifuged, and cells (30 g) were converted to spheroplasts as described previously (21Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, using 1 mg of Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku America, Rockville, MD)/g of cells in spheroplast buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 20 mm NaN3, 48 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 37 °C). The spheroplast suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. Cells were broken by suspending the pellet in 1.5× volume of membrane buffer and by drawing the cells rapidly several times into a narrow bore serological pipette. The suspension was centrifuged successively 10 min at 2000 × g, 8 min at 5000 × g, and finally 45 min at 125,000 × g to obtain the pellet fraction P125 enriched in ER- and GA-derived vesicles (21Abeijon C.

Nucleotide Sugar Translocation Assays—The theoretical basis for the translocation assay of the nucleotide derivatives into vesicles has been described previously (22Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast P125 fraction (1.0 mg of protein/ml) was incubated at 0 or 30 °C in 1 ml of 0.5 m sucrose, 30 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.20, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm MnCl2 with the radioactive nucleotide sugar to be tested. After 3 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 ml of cold stop solution (1 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA), and the vesicles were separated from the incubation medium by centrifugation at 134,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was washed four times with 4 ml of stop solution and resuspended in 1 ml of 4% perchloric acid. After 15 min on ice the acid-insoluble fraction was separated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant, containing radioactive nucleotide sugar within and in between the vesicles, was counted in 9 ml of scintillation solution (Ecoscint™ A, National Diagnostics). Transport activity is defined as total radioactive solutes in the vesicle pellet after incubation at 30 °C–0 °C. E. histolytica Cell Culture and Membrane Isolation—Axenic Eh strain HM1:IMSS was obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Trophozoites were cultured in TYI-S33 medium at 37 °C in 50-cm2 flasks. Crude membranes were prepared by a modification of the procedure described for COS-1 cells by Enyedi et al. (23Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, trophozoites from six flasks were chilled, collected by centrifugation (2000 × g, 15 min), and washed once with 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells (0.5 ml) were resuspended in 5 ml of cold hypotonic solution containing 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.20, at 4 °C and complete protease inhibitor mixture. After 10 min on ice, cells were homogenized with 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a B pestle. The homogenate was diluted with an equal volume of the same buffer containing 0.5 m sucrose, homogenized again with 25 strokes, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min. The pellet (P5K) was frozen. The supernatant was centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 60 min, and the pellet (P130K) was resuspended in a solution containing 0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, and complete protease inhibitor mixture at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The resuspended P130K fraction was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Nucleotide Sugar-dependent Transferase Activities in Eh Membranes—Measurements were carried out in Eppendorf tubes using the corresponding radioactive nucleotide sugar plus different concentrations of nonradioactive nucleotide sugar as substrate. The reaction mixture in a final volume of 200 μl contained 10 mm divalent cation (MnCl2, MgCl2, or CaCl2) or EDTA, 0.5 m sucrose, 30 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 25–50 μg of membrane protein (P5K or P130K fraction), and 0.1% Triton X-100. Following incubation at 37 °C for 15–30 min the reaction was stopped by adding 800 μl of ice-cold 5% perchloric acid and 20 μlof 10 mm sugar nucleotide. The mixture was allowed to stand on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet surface was washed three times, each with 0.5 ml of ice-cold water, dissolved in 1 ml 1 n NaOH by vortex mixing, neutralized by the addition of 0.85 ml of 1.6 n HCl and counted in 18 ml of Scintillation solution (Ecoscint™ A, National Diagnostics). Radioactivity associated at zero time or with tubes containing EDTA was subtracted from all values. Native or urea-denatured thyroglobulin was used as exogenous acceptors for the detection of UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase activity as was described previously (24Trombetta S.E. Bosch M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). UDP-Gal Transport into Eh130K (“Light”) Vesicles—A Eh130K vesicle fraction (960 μg of membrane protein) was isolated as described above and incubated with 0.6 μm UDP-[3H] Gal for 4 min at 0 or 37 °Cin a reaction medium containing 0.5 m sucrose, 30 mm TEA, pH 7.2, and 10 mm MnCl2. Transport activity, UDP-[3H]Gal within vesicles, is defined as soluble radioactivity remaining after perchloric acid precipitation of washed vesicles. Nucleotidase Activity—The assay was essentially as described previously (25Yanagisawa K. Resnick D. Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19351-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, incubation mixtures contained, in a final volume of 100 μl, 10 μg of membrane protein (P130K), 2 mm CaCl2 or EDTA, 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 2 mm nucleosides, diphosphates, or nucleoside triphosphates, and with or without 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of 7.5% SDS. Inorganic phosphate released was determined by adding 700 μlof Ames reagent (0.42% ammonium molybdate in 1 n sulfuric acid:10% ascorbic acid, 6:1), followed by incubation for 20 min at 45 °C. Absorbance was measured at 660 nm. Protein Assay—Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Yeast Vesicles Expressing EhNST1 Transport UDP-Galactose—Previous studies from our and other laboratories showed that the amino acid sequence of nucleotide sugar transporters cannot predict the substrate specificity of an unknown transporter and that transporters of very different amino acid sequences can mediate transport of the same nucleotide sugar in the same organism (27Guillen E. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7888-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Berninsone P.M. Hirschberg C.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on this we queried the genome of Eh with the amino acid sequence of several nucleotide sugar transporters including that for the UDP-galactose transporter of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, Eh has three putative proteins with relatively high amino acid sequence identity to that of the S. pombe UDP-Gal transporter. Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plots of these putative transporters suggested very hydrophobic proteins with multiple transmembrane domains (Fig. 1B). To determine the substrate specificity of the above putative nucleotide sugar transporters we used a previously described approach developed in our laboratory (29Berninsone P. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12616-12619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It consists of transforming S. cerevisiae with the transporter encoding gene as well as the plasmid without insert followed by isolation of ER- and GA-enriched vesicles from both yeasts (29Berninsone P. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12616-12619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sugar transport was then measured into vesicles from both yeasts. Because S. cerevisiae has only endogenous transport activities for GDP-mannose and UDP-glucose this heterologous expression system provides a relatively low background system to measure transport of other nucleotide sugars than the above. We successfully expressed the VSV-tagged version of EhNST1 (Fig. 2A). The mobility was somewhat lower than that predicted for a protein of 36.5 kDa (Fig. 1A). The same had been previously observed by us for another transporter (29Berninsone P. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12616-12619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). So far we have not expressed the other two putative transporters. Golgi apparatus-enriched vesicles from S. cerevisiae transformed with empty vector or vector encoding the VSV-EhNST1 fusion protein were assayed for their ability to transport different nucleotide sugars. Results obtained are shown in Fig. 2B. Transport of GDP-mannose and UDP-glucose were comparable in both vesicle preparations suggesting that the insert gene does not encode a transporter for these substrates. Transport of UDP-galactose, however, was ∼10-fold higher in vesicles with the EhNST1 gene product suggesting this nucleotide sugar is a substrate for this putative transporter. Other nucleotide sugars, as shown in Fig. 2B, appeared not be substrates for this putative transporter. We next determined whether the kinetics for UDP-galactose transport mediated by the EhNST1 gene product expressed in S. cerevisiae, were similar to those previously observed for other nucleotide sugar transporters. As shown in Fig. 2C this was indeed the case; transport of UDP-Gal was saturable with an apparent Km of 2.9 μm. Other nucleotide sugar transporters have Kms for their nucleotide sugar substrates between 1 and 10 μm (14Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These results therefore suggest that Eh has a nucleotide sugar transporter for UDP-galactose with kinetics similar to those of other GA transporters in eukaryotes. Golgi-like Functions Occur in Eh130K Vesicles—Does Eh have GA-like functions consistent with the above-described gene encoding the UDP-galactose transporter? Previously we had described that GA and ER vesicles from higher and lower eukaryotes contain luminal nucleoside di- and triphosphatases whose role is to give rise to nucleoside monophosphates, which are necessary for mediating the nucleotide sugar transport/antiport cycle (14Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Uccelletti D. O'Callahan C. Berninsone P. Zemtseva I. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27390-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To answer the above question, a cell suspension of Eh trophozoites was subjected to Dounce homogenization as previously described (22Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following centrifugation at 130,000 × g a membrane pellet was obtained, resuspended, and assayed for latency of different nucleoside di- and triphosphatases, which had been shown to be luminal enzymatic activities of the GA and ER (31Uccelletti D. O'Callahan C. Berninsone P. Zemtseva I. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27390-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the high latency toward nucleoside di- and triphosphates strongly suggests that the extract contained vesicles with luminal ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase activities as previously observed in mammalian cells as well as Caenorhabditis elegans (14Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Uccelletti D. O'Callahan C. Berninsone P. Zemtseva I. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27390-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This result also suggests that the above vesicles have the same membrane orientation as in vivo. Examination of the Eh genome showed five putative proteins with apyrase-conserved regions (31Uccelletti D. O'Callahan C. Berninsone P. Zemtseva I. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27390-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and high homology to the crystallized human apyrase 1S1DB (Fig. 4). Homologies to other apyrases from humans, insects, nematodes, Toxoplasma, and Cryptosporidium were also found (not shown). No homologs to the S. cerevisiae nucleoside diphosphatase GDA1 gene were found. Although we are unable to determine at this stage which of the above Eh apyrases are responsible for the activities shown in Fig. 3 the results strongly suggest that Eh130K pellets contain vesicles, presumably derived from ER- and GA-like organelles, with the same topographic orientation as vesicles from other eukaryotes. Evidence further confirming this hypothesis was obtained from experiments in which we measured transport of UDP-galactose into vesicles of the above extract. As shown in Fig. 5A, radioactive solutes within vesicles were significantly higher at 37 than at 0 °C suggesting that transport of the nucleotide sugar had indeed occurred. This assay, where mostly solutes within vesicles are measured, requires a relatively large amount of protein and therefore is not conducive for multiple measurements. In most cases with GA- and ER-derived vesicles one measures a combination of transport of nucleotide sugars into the vesicles coupled with subsequent transfer of the sugar to luminal endogenous acceptors. The latter reactions are catalyzed by glycosyltransferases, known to occur in the lumens of these vesicles. In these instances incubations containing 1–10 μm nucleotide sugars are used; subsequent to entry into the vesicles these substrates are concentrated ∼30–50-fold and can therefore attain the Kms of ∼100 μm of many glycosyltransferases, before transfer of the sugar to the corresponding endogenous acceptor can occur. Thus an important control in this transport/transfer-coupled assay is that the amount of sugar covalently transferred to endogenous acceptors can be considerably higher when intact compared with permeabilized vesicles are used; the latter can neither transport nor concentrate the nucleotide sugar in their lumen for efficient transfer when low micromolar concentrations of nucleotide sugars are used. In a preliminary experiment, using 5 μm UDP-galactose, with an extract of intact and Triton-permeabilized vesicles, we found significantly higher transfer of galactose into endogenous acceptor macromolecules using intact vesicles than into disrupted ones, strongly suggesting the presence of a transport/transfer system in these vesicles (Fig. 5B). Further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by studying the kinetics of this combined transport/transfer reaction. As shown in Fig. 5C the reaction was saturable with an apparent Km for UDP-Gal of 2.7 μm. This was very similar to that of transport of UDP-galactose when EhNST1 was expressed in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 2C). In this latter system there is no transfer of galactose to endogenous macromolecules subsequent to transport. Final proof that this nucleotide sugar transport/transfer was indeed occurring in Eh was obtained by direct measurement of the Km for UDP-Gal of galactosyltransferase(s) using endogenous acceptors as substrates. For this, disrupted vesicles were incubated with different concentrations of"

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in such interactions are still not completely understood. We have proposed previously that helix C, one of the four α-helices of human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF), contains a GAG-binding site in which positively charged residues are spatially positioned for interaction with the sulfate moieties of the GAGs (Wettreich, A., Sebollela, A., Carvalho, M. A., Azevedo, S. P., Borojevic, R., Ferreira, S. T., and Coelho-Sampaio, T. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 31468-31475). Protonation of two histidine residues (His83 and His87) in helix C of hGM-CSF appears to act as a pH-dependent molecular switch to control the interaction with GAGs. Based on these findings, we have now generated a triple mutant form of murine GM-CSF (mGM-CSF) in which three noncharged residues in helix C of the murine factor (Tyr83, Gln85, and Tyr87) were replaced by the corresponding basic residues present in hGM-CSF (His83, Lys85, and His87). Binding assays on heparin-Sepharose showed that, at acidic pH, the triple mutant mGM-CSF binds to immobilized heparin with significantly higher affinity than wild type (WT) mGM-CSF and that neither protein binds to the column at neutral pH. The fact that even WT mGM-CSF binds to heparin at acidic pH indicates the existence of a distinct, lower affinity heparin-binding site in the protein. Chemical modification of the single histidine residue (His15) located in helix A of WT mGM-CSF with diethyl pyrocarbonate totally abolished binding to immobilized heparin. Moreover, replacement of His15 for an alanine residue significantly reduced the affinity of mGM-CSF for heparin at pH 5.0 and completely blocked heparin binding to a synthetic peptide corresponding to helix A of GM-CSF. These results indicate a major role of histidine residues in the regulation of the binding of GM-CSF to GAGs, supporting the notion that an acidic microenvironment is required for GM-CSF-dependent regulation of target cells. In addition, our results provide insight into the molecular basis of the strict species specificity of the biological activity of GM-CSF.

Science. 1991; 254: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and osteoblasts (2Modrowski D. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 177: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the human form of this cytokine (3Walter M.R. Cook W.J. Ealick S.E. Nagabhushan T.L. Trotta P.P. Bugg C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) shows that its main structural motif is a four-helix bundle, which forms a compact, globular fold. Although the structure of human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF) was determined more than 10 years ago, the precise molecular interactions involved in binding to its cellular receptor and the mechanisms of signal transduction activated by such binding remain to be fully elucidated.A high affinity protein receptor for GM-CSF has been described (4Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar, 5Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K.I. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), and its mechanism of activation has been characterized (reviewed in Ref. 6D'Andrea R.J. Gonda T.J. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence indicate that this is not the only receptor involved in the cellular responses to GM-CSF. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been implicated in the co-activation of growth factor receptors upon ligand binding (reviewed in Ref. 7Harmer N.J. Chirgadze D. Kim K.H. Pellegrini L. Blundell T.L. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 100: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, the participation of cell-surface proteoglycans, mainly through their GAG moieties, in GM-CSF signaling and mitogenic activity has been reported by several groups (2Modrowski D. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 177: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Alvarez-Silva M. Da Silva L.C.F. Borojevic R. J.

Marie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9178-9185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In particular, heparan sulfate, a GAG mainly present on cell surfaces (11Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and heparin, a structurally related soluble GAG, regulate the biological functions of GM-CSF. The interaction between GM-CSF and GAGs may also involve the GM-CSF high affinity protein receptor via formation of a complex containing one or more heparan sulfate chains. A similar type of ternary complex is known to be formed between fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a well known heparin-binding growth factor, its protein receptor, and GAGs (12Schlessinger J.

Biol. 2004; 339: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Although the role of proteoglycans in the modulation of GM-CSF signaling is clear, the precise binding site(s) for heparin/heparan sulfate in the GM-CSF molecule are still unknown. This may be partly related to uncertainties in the determination of the domains of GM-CSF involved in binding to its protein receptor (14Monfardini C. Canziani G. Plugariu C. Kieber-Emmons T. Godillot A.P. Kwah J. Bajgier J. Chaiken I. Williams W.V. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 2185-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, despite the fact that conserved amino acid sequences corresponding to heparin-binding motifs have been identified (namely the XBBXBX and XBBBXXBX motifs, where B corresponds to a basic residue) (15Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a large number of reports have also shown that heparin/heparan sulfate-binding sites in proteins are not always or necessarily defined by a unique sequence or structural motif (16Mulloy B. Linhardt R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have shown previously (17Wettreich A. Sebollela A. Carvalho M.A. Azevedo S.P. Borojevic R. Ferreira S.T. Coelho-Sampaio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31468-31475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), by using a cell-free assay, that the interaction between hGM-CSF and heparin/heparan sulfate in solution leads to the formation of high molecular weight complexes. Most interestingly, the interaction requires an acidic pH, which led us to propose the existence of a pH-dependent GAG-binding site in hGM-CSF. That putative binding site is located in helix C of hGM-CSF and contains two histidine residues (His83 and His87) that become protonated at acidic pH and may mediate the interaction with negatively charged sulfate groups in GAGs (17Wettreich A.

Based on those previous results, we have now constructed a “humanized” triple mutant form of murine GM-CSF (mGM-CSF) in which three noncharged residues in helix C (Tyr83, Gln85, and Tyr87) were replaced by the corresponding basic residues present in hGM-CSF (His83, Lys85, and His87), and we analyzed its interaction with immobilized heparin at different pH values. Taken together, the results presented here indicate a prominent role of helix C of hGM-CSF in the regulation of high affinity heparin binding, and we show that the widely conserved histidine residue (His15) present in helix A of GM-CSF also participates in the interaction with GAGs. Possible implications of our results in terms of the species specificity of the biological actions of GM-CSF are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthetic Peptides—Peptides (19-mers) corresponding to the amino acid sequences of wild type (WT) and mutated helix C of both murine and human GM-CSF (Table I) were purchased from Peptron (Daejeon, South Korea), and peptides corresponding to WT and mutated helix A of murine GM-CSF (Table I) were from Genemed Synthesis (San Francisco, CA). Their purities were ascertained by mass spectrometry. Circular dichroism analysis of the peptides was performed on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter, as described below. Peptides were diluted in 20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations of TFE (see “Results”).Table IAmino acid sequences of synthetic peptides corresponding to WT and mutant helices A and C of human and murine GM-SCF Mutation sites are highlighted in boldface.Peptideα-HelixAmino acid sequenceMolecular massDaWT humanCTKLKGPLTMMASHYKQHCP2211Mutant humanCTKLKGPLTMMASAYAQACP2022WT murineCTKLKGALNMTASYYQTYCP2193Mutant murineCTKLKGALNMTASHYKTHCP2141WT murineAWKHVEAIKEALNLLDD1935Mutant murineAWKAVEAIKEALNLLDD1869 Open table in a new tab Binding of the peptides to immobilized heparin was evaluated using a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to an LC-10-AD high pressure liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). Peptide solutions (0.1 mg/ml) were prepared in running buffer (20 mm acetate, pH 5.0, or 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) containing 20% (v/v) TFE, and 20 μl of each sample were loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Elution of the peptides was performed using a linear NaCl gradient from 0.5 to 1 m in 10 column volumes. Runs were monitored by intrinsic tyrosine (excitation at 275 nm; emission at 303 nm) or tryptophan fluorescence (excitation at 295 nm; emission at 350 nm), as indicated.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of WT and Mutant mGM-CSF—The cDNA encoding WT mGM-CSF was a kind gift from Dr. Donald Metcalf (The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia). The cDNA was cloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) by using the restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI, after PCR amplification using primers containing cleavage sites for those enzymes, resulting in the plasmid pGEX-3XmGM-CSF. PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis based on the strategy described previously (18Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) was employed to create a triple mutant (Y83H/Q85K/Y87H) mGM-CSF. For the construction, we used as template the cDNA encoding WT mGM-CSF cloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector. The mutated sequence was obtained using the same forward primer used to clone the mGM-CSF cDNA into the pGEX-3X vector and the mutagenic reverse primer, 5′-CGTTTCCGGAGTTGGCGGGCAATGTGTCTTGTAGTGGCTAGCTGTCATGTT-3′ (the replaced bases are highlighted in boldface; introduction of the indicated adenine base produced a silent mutation used for screening purposes only). The PCR product and the pGEX-3XmGM-CSF vector were both treated with BamHI and BspEI and ligated using T4 DNA ligase, resulting in the plasmid pGEX-3XmGM-CSFh. The pGEX-3XmGM-CSF plasmid was also used as a template in another PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis to create the single mutant (H15A)mGM-CSF. For this purpose, the mutagenic forward primer, 5′-CGTGGATCCGCACCCACCCGCTCACCCATCACTGTCACCCGGCCTTGGAAGGCTGTAG-3′ (replaced bases in boldface), and the reverse primer, 5′-CTCCGAATTCTCATTTTTGGA-3′, were used. The PCR product and pGEX-3XmGM-CSF vector were extensively digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated using T4 DNA ligase, generating the plasmid pGEX-3XmGM-CSF(H15A). The correct cloning and site-directed mutagenesis of all mGM-CSF constructs were checked by DNA sequencing using an ABI 377 prism system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at the Brazilian National Synchrotron Laboratory.Escherichia coli (strain BL21(DE3)pLysS) was transformed with either pGEX-3XmGM-CSF, pGEX-3XmGM-CSFh, or pGEX-3XmGM-CSF(H15A), and the expression of recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins was induced by addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed and disrupted, and proteins were recovered from inclusion bodies after solubilization with 6 m urea. Urea was removed by dialysis against 20 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Refolded fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a GSTrap 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences). Column-bound fusion proteins were digested overnight at 4 °C with 10 IU of factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences), collected, and stored at -20 °C. The concentrations of purified GM-CSF samples were determined using the BCA method (Pierce).Structural and Functional Characterization of WT and Mutant mGM-CSF—The purities of recombinant WT and mutant mGM-CSF preparations were checked by 17% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Samples were also analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-mGM-CSF polyclonal antibody (Sigma) and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Commercial mGM-CSF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used as a positive control. Circular dichroism measurements were performed at 23 °C on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD; kindly made available by Dr. J. L. Silva, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) using 0.1-cm path length quartz cells. Protein samples were diluted in 20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0, to the final concentrations indicated in the legends to the figures. The CDPro package (lamar.colostate.edu/~sreeram/CDPro/main.html) was used to calculate secondary structure contents from CD data. Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of WT and mutant mGM-CSF (10 μm) diluted in 20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0, were measured at 23 °C on an ISS (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL) PC-1 spectrofluorometer (λexc = 275 nm; 8 and 16 nm bandwidths for excitation and emission, respectively).The biological activity of recombinant mGM-CSF was verified in a mitogenic assay using the FDC-P1 myeloid cell line, as described (19Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45461) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (4 × 103/well) were grown for 4 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere in the absence or in the presence of recombinant mGM-CSF. Proliferation was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (19Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45461) Google Scholar). Commercial mGM-CSF (Peprotech) was used as a positive control.Binding of WT and Mutant mGM-CSF to Immobilized Heparin—Proteins (4 μm final concentration) were diluted in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, or 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and were loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated in the corresponding buffer and connected to the high pressure liquid chromatography system. Runs were carried out as described above for synthetic peptides. Proteins were eluted using a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m in 10 column volumes. Detection was by intrinsic fluorescence emission (excitation at 295 nm; emission at 350 nm).Chemical Modification with DEPC—WT mGM-CSF (4 μm) was diluted in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and was incubated for 5 min at 23 °C with 500 μm of freshly dissolved DEPC (Sigma). Formation of carbethoxyhistidine was monitored spectrophotometrically by the increase in absorbance at 242 nm (20Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). In order to verify the extent of chemical modification, samples were purified using ZipTips (Millipore, Billerica, MA) immediately after modification and were analyzed by MALDI-MS using a Voyager-DE PRO spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in linear mode.Electrostatic Surface Potential of hGM-CSF—The surface potential was calculated by using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver software package (21Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5741) Google Scholar) and images were generated using PyMol 0.97 (22DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates for hGM-CSF were obtained from the Protein Data Bank entry 1CSG. Calculations were performed assigning either a neutral or a positive charge to His residues (see text). A probe sphere of 1.4 Å radius was used to generate the solvent-accessible surface. The dielectric constants used for protein and solvent were 20 and 80, respectively, and the system temperature was maintained at 310 K.RESULTSWe have shown previously that the interaction of hGM-CSF with various GAGs, including heparan sulfate and heparin, leads to the formation of high molecular weight complexes revealed by light-scattering measurements (17Wettreich A. Sebollela A. Carvalho M.A. Azevedo S.P. Borojevic R. Ferreira S.T. Coelho-Sampaio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31468-31475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In that study, we also proposed the existence of a GAG-binding site in helix C of hGM-CSF. On the other hand, inspection of the amino acid sequence of mGM-CSF reveals that three basic residues that are thought to be important for heparin binding to helix C of hGM-CSF (His83, Lys85, and His87) are replaced by noncharged residues (Tyr83, Gln85, and Tyr87) in the murine protein. This is in line with the observation that formation of high order molecular complexes between human GM-CSF and heparin is much more robust than that observed with murine GM-CSF (17Wettreich A. Sebollela A. Carvalho M.A. Azevedo S.P. Borojevic R. Ferreira S.T. Coelho-Sampaio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31468-31475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Interaction of Peptides Corresponding to Helix C of GM-CSF with Heparin—In order to gain insight into the possible roles of His83, Lys85, and His87 in the interaction of helix C of hGM-CSF with heparin, we initially used synthetic peptides corresponding to the 19-amino acid sequence of helix C in hGM-CSF or a “triple mutant” peptide in which those three basic residues were replaced by alanine residues (Table I). CD analysis of the secondary structures of the synthetic peptides showed that both WT and mutant peptides assume helical conformations in aqueous solution in the presence of increasing concentrations of TFE (data not shown). This indicates that the amino acid replacements introduced in the mutant peptide did not alter the helix propensity of helix C of hGM-CSF. In order to maintain a helical structure of the peptides, we routinely added 20% (v/v) TFE to the samples prior to heparin binding assays.The relative affinities of the synthetic peptides for heparin were estimated from the concentrations of NaCl required to elute the peptides from a column containing immobilized heparin (Fig. 1A). The assays were carried out at both acidic pH (pH 5) and at pH 8.5, well above the pKa value of histidine, to ensure that the two His residues present in the wild type peptide would be in a nonprotonated state. Reflecting the lack of the three basic residues that were replaced by alanines, the mutant human peptide presented a lower affinity for heparin than the WT peptide; at pH 5.0, NaCl concentrations of ∼675 and 725 mm, respectively, were required to elute the mutant and WT peptides from the column. Most interestingly, the affinity of the WT peptide for heparin was substantially decreased at pH 8.5, and became very similar to the affinity of the mutant peptide. These results indicate that protonation of His residues of the WT peptide at acidic pH plays an important role in the modulation of heparin binding affinity. Furthermore, consistent with our previous proposal (17Wettreich A. Sebollela A. Carvalho M.A. Azevedo S.P. Borojevic R. Ferreira S.T. Coelho-Sampaio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31468-31475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the results obtained with the triple mutant peptide also show that Lys72 and Lys74, located at the N terminus of helix C of GM-CSF, also contribute to heparin binding.We next investigated the interaction of synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of helix C of murine GM-CSF with immobilized heparin. In addition to the WT peptide, we used a triple mutant peptide in which three noncharged residues were replaced by the corresponding basic residues found in hGM-CSF (Table I). CD analysis showed that both WT and triple mutant murine peptides assumed helical conformations in the presence of TFE (data not shown). As described above, 20% (v/v) TFE was routinely used in heparin binding assays. At pH 5.0, the peptide corresponding to WT helix C of mGM-CSF bound to the heparin column with an affinity similar to that observed for the peptide corresponding to the mutated human helix C (Fig. 1). Most interestingly, at pH 5.0, the triple mutant murine helix C peptide bound to heparin with an affinity comparable with that found for the WT human helix C peptide (Fig. 1). These results clearly indicate the importance of His83, Lys85, and His87 in modulating high affinity heparin binding of the peptides. Furthermore, consistent with the requirement of His protonation for interaction with heparin, the affinity of the mutant murine peptide for immobilized heparin was markedly reduced at pH 8.5 (Fig. 1B).Structural Characterization and Interaction of WT and Triple Mutant mGM-CSF with Heparin—Based on the results obtained with the synthetic peptides, we created a humanized mutant form of mGM-CSF in which three noncharged residues in helix C of the murine factor were replaced by the corresponding basic residues present in hGM-CSF (Y83H, Q85K, and Y87H). Recombinant WT and triple mutant mGM-CSF were expressed in E. coli and were purified from inclusion bodies using 6 m urea followed by progressive dialysis, as described previously for the purification of recombinant murine (23Delamarter J.F. Mermod J.J. Liang C.M. Eliason J.F. Thatcher D.R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2575-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and human GM-CSF (24Burgess A.W. Begley C.G. Johnson G.R. Lopez A.F. Williamson D.J. Mermod J.J. Simpson R.J. Schmitz A. Delamarter J.F. Blood. 1987; 69: 43-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purities and identities of both WT and mutant mGM-CSF were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Purification of recombinant WT and triple mutant murine GM-CSF. A, silver-stained 17% SDS-PAGE showing single bands with the expected molecular weight in samples of purified WT and triple mutant mGM-CSF. The Mr markers (M) used are cytochrome c (12 kDa) and ovalbumin (45 kDa). B, Western blot analysis of purified proteins using anti-mGM-CSF antibody. Commercial mGM-CSF was used as a positive control. The same amount of protein was loaded in the three lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The α-helix content of mGM-CSF is estimated to be ∼47% (25Wingfield P. Graber P. Moonen P. Craig S. Pain R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CD measurements of our recombinant proteins (Fig. 3A) revealed helical contents of 43 and 46% for WT and triple mutant mGM-CSF, respectively, in excellent agreement with the value reported previously. In addition, the similarity in helical contents found for WT and mutant mGM-CSF indicates that the three amino acid replacements did not alter the native structure of mGM-CSF. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements and size-exclusion chromatography analysis of the recombinant proteins showed that both WT and triple mutant mGM-CSF presented fluorescence emission spectra with intensity maxima at ∼350 nm (Fig. 3B) and eluted as monomeric globular proteins in the calibrated column (not shown). These results are also in agreement with previous reports for mGM-CSF (26Schrimsher J.L. Rose K. Simona M.G. Wingfield P. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Structural and functional characterization of recombinant WT and triple mutant mGM-CSF. Far-UV circular dichroism (A) and intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra (B) of WT (solid line) or triple mutant (dashed line) mGM-CSF. In both cases, protein concentration was 10 μm. Measurements were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, mitogenic activity of WT and triple mutant mGM-CSF (10 ng/ml) on FDC-P1 cells. Commercial mGM-CSF (10 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. Proliferation was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results correspond to means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. In all conditions (commercial, WT, or mutant mGM-CSF), proliferation was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the control containing no growth factor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recombinant WT and triple mutant mGM-CSFs were also assayed for their abilities to induce proliferation of murine myeloid cells. In this assay, we used the FDC-P1 cell line, which is strictly dependent upon GM-CSF or interleukin-3 (27Dexter T.M. Garland J. Scott D. Scolnick E. Metcalf D. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1036-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). WT and triple mutant mGM-CSF induced proliferation of FDC-P1 cells to similar extents as a commercial preparation of mGM-CSF used as a positive control (Fig. 3C). It should be noted, however, that the FDC-P1 cell line grows in suspension in the culture medium, and, different from normal myeloid cells, its proliferation induced by mGM-CSF is not strictly dependent on interaction with extracellular matrix elem"
https://openalex.org/W2057083641,"Two novel types of dye-linked l-proline dehydrogenase complex (PDH1 and PDH2) were found in a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3. Here we report the first crystal structure of PDH1, which is a heterooctameric complex (αβ)4 containing three different cofactors: FAD, FMN, and ATP. The structure was determined by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.86 Å. The structure of the β subunit, which is an l-proline dehydrogenase catalytic component containing FAD as a cofactor, was similar to that of monomeric sarcosine oxidase. On the other hand, the α subunit possessed a unique structure composed of a classical dinucleotide fold domain with ATP, a central domain, an N-terminal domain, and a Cys-clustered domain. Serving as a third cofactor, FMN was located at the interface between the α and β subunits in a novel configuration. The observed structure suggests that FAD and FMN are incorporated into an electron transfer system, with electrons passing from the former to the latter. The function of ATP is unknown, but it may play a regulatory role. Although the structure of the α subunit differs from that of the β subunit, except for the presence of an analogous dinucleotide domain with a different cofactor, the structural characteristics of PDH1 suggest that each represents a divergent enzyme that arose from a common ancestral flavoenzyme and that they eventually formed a complex to gain a new function. The structural characteristics described here reveal the PDH1 complex to be a unique diflavin dehydrogenase containing a novel electron transfer system.

Dye-linked dehydrogenases catalyze the oxidation of various amino acids, organic acids, amines, and alcohols in the presence of an artificial electron acceptor such as ferricyanide or 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP). 1The abbreviations used are: DCIP, 2,6-dichloroindophenol; CAPS, N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid; CPR, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase; GR, glutathione reductase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MSOX, monomeric sarcosine oxidase; OABA, o-aminobenzaldehyde; P5C, Δ1-pyroline-5-carboxylate; PDH, l-proline dehydrogenase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TD, trimethylamine dehydrogenase; TSOX, heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase. We have identified several novel dye-linked dehydrogenases among the hyperthermophilic archaea, including d-proline dehydrogenase (1Satomura T. Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Ohshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12861-12867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and l-proline dehydrogenase (PDH) (2Sakuraba H. Takamatsu Y. Satomura T. Kawakami R. Ohshima T. Appl.

The gene sequence and primary structure of the first PDH isolated from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus profundus DSM9503, have been determined (2Sakuraba H. Takamatsu Y. Satomura T. Kawakami R. Ohshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1470-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Ohshima T. Extremophiles. 2004; 8: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The complete gene is formed by an operon comprised of four genes, pdhA, pdhB, pdhF and pdhX, in a tandem arrangement in the order pdhA-F-X-B. The purified enzyme has a native molecular mass of 120 kDa and forms an unusual αβγδ heterotetrameric complex (α (54 kDa), β (43 kDa), γ (19 kDa), and δ (11 kDa)) encoded by pdhA, pdhB, pdhF, and pdhX, respectively. In addition, functional analysis of each subunit has shown that the α and β subunits possess NADH and l-proline dehydrogenase activities, respectively (3Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Ohshima T. Extremophiles. 2004; 8: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because this multifunctional dye-linked dehydrogenase complex appears to representative of a new enzyme group (3Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Ohshima T. Extremophiles. 2004; 8: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we have been seeking others by screening dye-linked dehydrogenases expressed in hyperthermophilic archaea. So far, we have identified two different types of dye-linked PDH in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT-3: PDH1 and PDH2 (4Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Tsuge H. Goda S. Katunuma N. Ohshima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Biochemical and gene analyses of PDH1 and PDH2 revealed PDH2 to be similar to the T. profundus PDH. By contrast, the gene encoding PDH1 formed an operon comprised of two consecutive genes, PH1363 and PH1364, and the molecular masses of the encoded α and β subunits were determined to be about 56 and 43 kDa, respectively. The native molecular mass of PDH1 was determined to be 440 kDa by gel filtration study (4Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Tsuge H. Goda S. Katunuma N. Ohshima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), indicating that the enzyme exists as an (αβ)4 heterooctamer with a subunit structure that is different from that of PDH2. In addition, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis recently showed that PDH1 contains three cofactors: FAD, FMN, and ATP (4Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Tsuge H. Goda S. Katunuma N. Ohshima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). The β subunit contains FAD and exhibits proline dehydrogenase activity, while the α subunit contains ATP but exhibits no proline dehydrogenase activity (4Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Tsuge H. Goda S. Katunuma N. Ohshima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Although both PDH1 and PDH2 genes are annotated as sarcosine oxidase in the P. horikoshii genome, because of their high homology with a monomeric sarcosine oxidase (MSOX), neither of these enzymes exhibits any sarcosine oxidase activity. The amino acid sequences of the α and β subunits of PDH1 showed 31 and 56% similarity with those of the α and β subunits of PDH2, respectively. Analysis of the genome database revealed that both types of PDH complex are widely distributed among the Thermococcales family of hyperthermophilic archaea, including the species Pyrococcus and Thermococcus. PDH has also been identified in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, and some of the fundamental properties of those enzymes have been investigated (5Menzel R. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9762-9766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Menzel R. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9755-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Graham S.B.

Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 561-568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of E. coli PutA has been resolved (9Lee Y.H. Nadaraia S. Gu D. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Notably, the primary structure and molecular properties of PDH1 and PDH2 are different from those of PutA. Still, dye-linked dehydrogenases generally have been found to function in the uptake of electrons from a reduced substrate into an electron transfer system. Little is currently known about the physiological function of these enzymes in hyperthermophilic archaea nor is much known about their mechanism catalysis or their electron transfer systems. This makes structural analysis of the archaeal PDH complex particularly interesting, as it could shed new light on the evolution of energy and amino acid metabolism in hyperthermophilic archaea such as P. horikoshii and T. profundus. Here we describe the unique structure of the PDH1 complex, which is a novel type of archaeal enzyme containing FAD, FMN, and ATP. Protein Expression and Purification—PH1363 and PH1364 genes, which, respectively, encode the α and β subunits of PDH1, were amplified and inserted separately into the pET11a expression plasmid. To construct the co-expression plasmid pEPDH1, the region containing PH1363 gene and its T7 promoter was cleaved from pET11a/PH1363 and inserted into pET11a/PH1364 upstream of the region containing the T7 promoter. E. coli strain BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) cells transformed with pEPDH1 were grown at 37 °C in SB medium containing ampicillin. After 6 h, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was added, and cultivation was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min) and suspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Crude extract was prepared by ultrasonication, and then three purification steps were applied: heat treatment at 90 °C for 10 min, hydrophobic chromatography on Butyl Toyopearl, and gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200. Active fractions containing (αβ)4 complex were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Enzyme Assay—Enzyme activity was spectrophotometrically assayed as described previously using a Shimadzu UV-1200 spectrophotometer (4Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Tsuge H. Goda S. Katunuma N. Ohshima T.

In this case, the reaction mixture was composed of 200 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm l-proline, 2.5 mm OABA, and enzyme. The amount of P5C coupled with OABA was monitored at 440 nm at 50 °C, and a millimolar absorption coefficient of 2.7 mm-1 cm-1 was used. The native enzyme had specific activities of 1.09, 2.01, and 0.324 (μmol/min/mg) using DCIP, ferricyanide, and oxygen as electron acceptors, respectively. Crystallization—After concentrating the enzyme to 10 mg/ml, the crystallization conditions were screened using Wizard 1, 2 and Cryo 1, 2 (Emerald Biostructure). A drop containing 2 μl of enzyme solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution was equilibrated against 200 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS)/NaOH (pH 10.5), 1.2 m NaH2PO4/0.8 M K2HPO4 and 0.2 m Li2SO4) by vapor diffusion using the sitting drop method. Crystals were obtained within 3-5 days at room temperature. The crystals were then placed in mother liquor containing 40% trehalose, briefly soaked, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Heavy atom derivatives were made by soaking the crystals in mother liquor containing a heavy atom compound (1 mm) for 24 h at 20 °C. PDH1 crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P6422 or its enantiomorph P6222 with lattice constants a = b = 172.22 Å and c = 175.39 Å, and it diffracts to 2.8 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit consists of one αβ heterodimer with a solvent content of 67%. Phase Determination and Model Building—Phase was determined using the multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering method by collecting two native data sets and four derivative data sets (K2Pt(SCN)6, (NH3)2PtCl4, phenyl mercury acetate, and mersalyl acid) at KEK beamline NW12 using monochromatized radiation at λ = 1.0 Å and an Area Detector Systems Corp. CCD detector (supplemental Table 1). The crystal-to-detector distance was 290 mm, and the scan angle was 1.0°. Data processing was carried our using HKL2000 (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar), and phase calculations were carried out using SOLVE and RESOLVE (11Terwilliger T. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). When the phase was calculated using the P6422 space group, the quality of the electron density map was excellent, even at 2.86 Å resolution. The model was built manually using XTALVIEW (12McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Model Refinement and Quality of the Model—The initial R-factor for a model consisting of 860 residues (α1-94 and α101-490 and β2-375) without cofactor was 41% in the resolution range 2.86-20.0 Å. The model was refined using REFMAC5 (13Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Several cycles of inspection of 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc Fourier maps calculated with 2.86-20.0 Å data were carried out, after which the model was rebuilt. FAD, FMN, ATP, CAPS, Cl-, Fe3+, SO4, and 206 water molecules were included in that model. Residues 95-100 in the α subunit had poor electron density and formed a loop to bind the β subunit. Further manual correction and refinement using CNS (14Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) yielded R and Rfree values of 18.1 and 22.5%, respectively. In both the α and β subunits, there were no residues in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Molecular graphics figures were created using PyMOL (www.pymol.sourceforge.net/). Overview of the Structure of the (αβ)4 Octameric Complex—The structure of PDH1 assembled as a tetramer of the αβ heterodimer had a crystallographic 222 symmetry. One α and one β subunit of PDH1 were present in an asymmetric unit, forming a tight binding heterodimer (Fig. 1, A and B). The active (αβ)4 heterooctamer had dimensions of 110 × 140 × 90 Å. An interesting feature of the complex was the presence of a disulfide bridge (Cys381α-Cys381α) formed between two α subunits. The quaternary structure indicates that one (αβ)2 block generated by the intermolecular disulfide bridge binds with another from the back side to form the heterooctamer. The intermolecular surface area of the αβ heterodimer was 1,788 Å2, while that of the (αβ)4 heterooctamer was a huge 14,090 Å2. The oligomeric structure with huge interface probably contributes the hyperthermostability of PDH1, which showed that no activity was lost during incubation at 90 °C for 120 min (4Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Tsuge H. Goda S. Katunuma N. Ohshima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). It appeared that one molecule of FAD is located in the center of the β subunit, one molecule of ATP is located in the α subunit, and one molecule of FMN is located at the interface between the α and β subunits (Fig. 1C). The redox centers of FAD and FMN were in close proximity within the enzyme, as the distance between the two flavins was 12.5 Å (Fig. 1D). The dimethyl benzene portions of the two isoalloxyazine rings of FAD and FMN were within about 8 Å of one another, and the plane of the two rings was almost parallel. The Interface between the α and β Subunits—As mentioned above, FMN was found between the α and β subunits. The interaction of the subunits via this FMN appears highly important for the function the heterodimeric complex; details of the interaction between the FMN molecule and the protein will be discussed later. The other interactions between the subunits were mostly hydrophobic: 1) Met485α is buried in a β subunit hydrophobic core formed by Val228β, Phe288β, Leu295β, Leu298β, and Ile300β; 2) Phe91α is buried within the β subunit hydrophobic residues Leu128β, Ile233β, Thr237β, Ile292β, Leu295β, and Leu298β; and 3) a hydrophobic cluster is formed by Leu182α, Phe185α, Leu192α, Pro194α, Leu201α, Val483α, Tyr278β, Leu281β, and Ile300β. In addition, the following protein-protein ionic interactions were observed: Glu203α (OE1)-Arg282β (NH1) (3.75 Å) and Lys187α (N2)-Asp279β (OD2) (2.86 Å). Structure of the β Subunit—The β subunit consists of two domains (supplemental Fig. 1 and Fig. 2A). One is an FAD-binding domain (residues 2β-48β, 148β-222β, and 307β-356β) containing the dinucleotide-binding fold observed in enzymes belonging to the glutathione reductase (GR) family (15Dym O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1712-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The fold is mainly composed of a central five-stranded parallel β sheet (β1, β2, β5, β9, and β16) flanked by two α helices (α1 and α6) on one side and a three-stranded anti-parallel β sheet (β6, β7, and β8) on the other. The other domain is an interface domain mostly formed by an anti-parallel β sheet having two parts, 49β-147β and 223β-306β. Superposition using DALI (16Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) showed that the β subunit has similarity with MSOX (r.m.s.d., 2.3 Å for 363 Cα pairs; 22% sequence identity), glycine oxidase (r.m.s.d., 2.1 Å for 344 Cα pairs; 24% sequence identity), N,N-dimethylglycine oxidase (r.m.s.d., 2.2 Å for 350 Cα pairs; 27% sequence identity) and d-amino acid oxidase (r.m.s.d., 3.0 Å for 302 Cα pairs; 16% sequence identity). MSOX is known to belong to the structural class of flavoenzyme originally found in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and contains only FAD as the cofactor (17Trickey P. Wagner M.A. Jorns M.S. Mathews F.S. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar). FAD in the β subunit is bound in a manner similar to that seen in MSOX, although we found several key differences. FAD binds noncovalently to PDH1β, whereas it binds covalently with Cys315 in MSOX. Moreover, all but one of the residues gathered on the si face of the flavin ring of FAD differ from those in MSOX (Fig. 2B, purple surface). These residues are responsible for creation of a new electron transport pathway from FAD to FMN, which is located at the interface between the α and β subunits (there is no FMN binding in MSOX). Only Arg302β on the si face is conserved between PDH1β and MSOX. The side chain of Cys47β makes parallel contact with the flavin ring of FAD, while Trp304β makes a π-π interaction with the flavin ring of FMN. By contrast, residues on the re face of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, which form a substrate-binding site (shown as gray sticks), are moderately conserved: Tyr251β, His336β, Tyr308β, and Arg52β are present in both PDH1β and MSOX. Finally, a unique FMN-binding site is created between the interface domain of the β subunit and the Cys-clustered domain of the α subunit (Fig. 2, B and C). Structure of the α Subunit—Analysis of the Pfam (18Lim L.W. Mathews F.S. Steenkamp D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3075-3078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) protein family data base predicts that the α subunit of PDH1 has a dinucleotide domain, although the overall structure is unknown. The crystal structure revealed that the α subunit consists of four domains (supplemental Fig. 2 and Fig. 3A), which include an ATP-binding domain containing residues α101-α217 and α309-α397 with a dinucleotide-binding fold, a central domain containing α218-α308, an N-terminal domain containing α1-α94, and a Cys-clustered domain containing α398-α498. The ATP-binding domain, which contains a FAD-binding motif similar to the one in the β subunit, consists of a five-stranded parallel β sheet (β9, β10, β13, β17 and β29) flanked on one side by two helices (α2 and α4) and by a three-stranded anti-parallel β sheet (β14, β15, and β16) on the other. Analysis using DALI showed this domain to be highly similar to the FAD-binding domain of another flavoenzyme, an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase belonging to the GR family (r.m.s.d., 2.2 Å for 176 Cα pairs; 19% sequence identity) (16Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The central domain consists of a four-stranded parallel β sheet (β18, β19, β20, and β24) flanked on one side by two helices (α5 and α6) and by a three-stranded anti-parallel β sheet (β21, β22, and β23) on the other. The topology has some similarity with the NADPH-binding domain of GR, but the domain of PDH1α lacks the ability to bind NADPH. The overall structure of PDH1α is unique because the N-terminal domain and the Cys-clustered domain were fused additionally; the former domain has an α/β structure, and the latter domain consists of four α helices and mediates FMN binding to the α subunit at the interface with the β subunit. Using HPLC, we detected the presence of ATP in the α subunit of PDH1 (4Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Tsuge H. Goda S. Katunuma N. Ohshima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). The tracing of the electron density of the enzyme clearly shows the binding of an ATP molecule in the α subunit (supplemental Fig. 2), where it serves as a third nucleotide cofactor along with FAD and FMN (Fig. 3A). This is noteworthy, as it is the first report of ATP serving as a cofactor in a flavin-dependent dehydrogenase. ATP is situated within the α subunit in the dinucleotide-binding domain known as the Rossman fold. Three Gly residues (Gly113-115) lie in parallel with the backbone of the ATP, as is usually observed in FAD-binding sites (Fig. 3B), and O2′ and O3′ of the ATP ribose make contact with the carboxyl group of the side chain of Glu135α. In another example of the binding of a nucleotide cofactor, ADP reportedly binds to trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TD) (18Lim L.W. Mathews F.S. Steenkamp D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3075-3078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the physiological function of the ADP is unknown. Looking for similarities in the nucleotide-binding sites in GR, TD, and PDH1α, we found that they all have a GR fold; r.m.s.d. between equivalent Cα positions was 0.928 Å (PDH1α/TD), 0.897 Å (GR/TD), and 0.698 Å (PDH1α/GR). Comparison of the three aligned sequences of the six peptides of the ADP-binding regions (Ile111-Gly118, Ile134-Arg137, Leu140-Met144, Thr179-Leu182, Ile211-Ala215, and Val346-Ala350) showed that 15 (PDH1α/GR), 14 (PDH1α/TD), and 12 (TD/GR) of the 32 residues are identical, thus ADP-binding motifs are moderately conserved. However, a prominent difference was observed in the γ-phosphate-binding site that specifically involves His356 and Asn359 in PDH1α. In TD, His427 and Asp674 disturb ATP binding. Another binding factor was found from the experimental and Fo - Fc electron density; CAPS, which was included in the crystallization buffer, appeared like a clasp fastened between the ATP-binding domain and the N-terminal domain (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the site consists of four Trp residues (243α, 268α, 145α, and 139α) and Val242α. This means that four of the five Trp residues in the α subunit are clustered together in this region to form a highly hydrophobic surface. The four α helices of the Cys-clustered domain include four Cys residues (Cys413α, Cys415α, Cys447α, and Cys452α). The crystal structure revealed that two of them (Cys413α and Cys452α) form a disulfide bridge that is in close proximity to Cys447α (Fig. 3A). Although the Pfam (19Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (data base issue): D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) protein family database predicted the existence of a [2Fe-2S]-binding domain within the sequence of PDH1α, we could not confirm the presence of [2Fe-2S]. However, an electron density at 5, near the Cys413α-Cys452α disulfide, was attributed temporarily to the Fe3+ (supplemental Table 2). FMN-binding Site—The absorption spectrum for PDH1 showed a typical spectrum for flavin compounds, with peaks at 370 and 450 nm; the flavins were confirmed to be FAD and FMN (4Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Tsuge H. Goda S. Katunuma N. Ohshima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Although it was unclear from the HPLC analysis whether the FMN-binding site is present in the β or α subunit, in the present study we found the electron density for FMN between the Cys-clustered domain in the α subunit and the interface domain in the β subunit, with the isoalloxazine ring of FMN sandwiched by two hydrophobic residues, Trp304β and Met444α (Fig. 2, B and C), and the phosphate group fixed by three basic residues, Arg46β, Arg302β, and Arg477α (Fig. 2C). As far as we know, this manner of binding FMN using the interface of two separate subunits is novel. FAD is known to locate between two domains in enzymes belonging to the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family (20Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), but the environment of the isoalloxazine ring in the FMN-binding site in PDH is quite different. Notably, one of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), accepts a pair of electrons from NADPH as a hydride ion, with FAD and FMN serving as the port of entry and exit, respectively, and transfers them to a heme of cytochrome P450 (21Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). But although both PDH1 and CPR are diflavin reductases, they differ in the relative positions of FAD and FMN. PDH-catalyzed electron transport from l-proline to oxygen or, as in our experiments, to ferricyanide or DCIP cannot be considered physiological. Even the transport to oxygen would be unusual for this enzyme, as Pyrococcus and Thermococcus, the archaeal hyperthermophiles in which it is expressed, grow under anaerobic conditions. In considering the physiological pathway of electron transport, the structural relationship of the two flavins, FAD and FMN, would seem to be very important. The close proximity of their dimethyl benzene portions suggests that an electron pathway from FAD to FMN is reasonable; indeed, a similar pathway can be seen in CPR. Nevertheless, PDH1 is categorized as a different class of diflavin enzyme because of the following differences between the two enzymes: 1) diflavin-binding sites are created by a single polypeptide in CPR, but by two in PDH1; 2) contact between the dimethyl benzene portions are direct in CPR but are indirect via Cys47β and Trp304β in PDH1; and 3) the relative positions of the diflavin portions differ. In addition, the oxidase activity and dye-linked PDH activity could be detected even with only a separately expressed β subunit, without either the α subunit and FMN (4Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Tsuge H. Goda S. Katunuma N. Ohshima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Therefore, to take into consideration the α subunit and FMN, we propose an alternative pathway for electron transfer. The distances between FAD and FMN and between FMN and the Cys-cluster (12 Å) are typical of those in other FeS-cluster-containing proteins and are compatible with efficient electron transfer (22Moser C.C. Keske J.M. Warncke K. Farid R.S. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1992; 355: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). At present, we cannot confirm the presence of iron within the PDH1 crystal structure. However, if iron were present within the Cys-clustered site, it would be in an excellent position to transfer electrons from FAD via FMN. Then, in a final step, the electron could be transferred via iron to an as yet unknown electron acceptor. In this scenario, the α subunit acts not only to create the FMN-binding site but also to transport electrons to a specific electron acceptor protein via iron. Perhaps the hydrophobic CAPS-binding site plays a role in binding the unknown electron acceptor. Also consistent with this idea is the finding the region is not perturbed by formation of the (αβ)4 heterooctameric complex. So far, four different FAD enzyme folds have been identified based on a their sequence-structure analysis (15Dym O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1712-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the case of PDH1, both subunits belong to the GR structural family, but each belongs to different subfamily. In the GR family, two separate subfamilies were identified (15Dym O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1712-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar): GR1, which is represented by GR (23Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), and GR2, which is represented by d-amino acid oxidase (24Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Both subfamilies share a similar overall three-dimensional structure in their FAD-binding domain as well as at least one conserved sequence motif (GxGxxG). Whereas proteins from the GR1 subfamily align well through the entire FAD-binding domain, those belonging to GR2 subfamily align well only in their N-terminal. PDH1β clearly belongs to the GR2 subfamily; however, a BLAST search (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Scaffer A.A. Zhang Z. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59926) Google Scholar) showed that PDH1α has no similarity with the both subfamily except the α subunit of heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase (TSOX) (27Eschenbrenner M. Chlumsky L.J. Khanna P. Strasser F. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5352-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is probable that PDH1α, PDH2α, and TSOXα form a different subfamily in GR family. In addition, when we superimposed the structure of the α and β subunits on the common GR fold with different cofactors (r.m.s.d., 0.97 Å for 67 Cα pairs), we found that the overall structure of the α subunit clearly differed from the β subunit (Fig. 3C). The structural characteristics of PDH1 suggest that each represents a divergent enzyme that arose from a common ancestral flavoenzyme and that they eventually formed a complex to gain a new function. We emphasize that our results provide a structural basis for understanding this unique enzyme, which is an FAD-, FMN-, and ATP-containing archaeal l-proline dehydrogenase. We thank Drs. N.

https://openalex.org/W2081495665,"Polysialic acid is an anti-adhesive protein modification that promotes cell migration and the plasticity of cell interactions. Because so few proteins carry polysialic acid, we hypothesized that polysialylation is a protein-specific event and that a specific polysialyltransferase-substrate interaction is the basis of this specificity. The major substrate for the polysialyltransferases is the neural cell adhesion molecule, NCAM. Previous work demonstrates that the first fibronectin type III repeat of NCAM (FN1) was necessary for the polysialylation of the <i>N</i>-glycans on the adjacent immunoglobulin domain (Ig5) (Close, B. E., Mendiratta, S. S., Geiger, K. M., Broom, L. J., Ho, L. L., and Colley, K. J. (2003) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 278, 30796–30805). This suggested that FN1 may be a recognition site for the polysialyltransferases. In this study, we showed that the second fibronectin type III repeat (FN2) of NCAM cannot replace FN1. Arg substitution of three unique acidic amino acids on the surface of FN1 eliminated polysialylation not only of a minimal Ig5-FN1 substrate but also of full-length NCAM. Ala substitution of these residues eliminated Ig5-FN1 polysialylation but not that of full-length NCAM, suggesting that the two proteins are interacting differently with the enzymes and that multiple residues are involved in the enzyme-NCAM interaction. By using another truncated protein, Ig5-FN1-FN2, we confirmed the importance of enzyme-substrate positioning for optimal recognition and polysialylation. In sum, we have found that acidic residues on the surface of FN1 are part of a larger protein interaction region that is critical for NCAM recognition and polysialylation by the polysialyltransferases."

The CRTH2 receptor shares greatest sequence similarity with chemoattractant receptors compared with prostanoid receptors. To investigate the structural determinants of CRTH2 ligand binding, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of putative mCRTH2 ligand-binding residues, and we evaluated mutant receptor ligand binding and functional properties. Substitution of alanine at each of three residues in the transmembrane (TM) helical domains (His-106, TM III; Lys-209, TM V; and Glu-268, TM VI) and one in extracellular loop II (Arg-178) decreased PGD2 binding affinity, suggesting that these residues play a role in binding PGD2. In contrast, the H106A and E268A mutants bound indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, with an affinity similar to the wild-type receptor. HEK293 cells expressing the H106A, K209A, and E268A mutants displayed reduced inhibition of intracellular cAMP and chemotaxis in response to PGD2, whereas the H106A and E268A mutants had functional responses to indomethacin similar to the wild-type receptor. Binding of PGE2 by the E268A mutant was enhanced compared with the wild-type receptor, suggesting that Glu-268 plays a role in determining prostanoid ligand selectivity.

Pharmacol. 1988; 94: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Increased production or exposure to PGD2 leads to elevated Th2-type cytokines and eosinophilic inflammation in murine asthma models (4Fujitani Y. Kanaoka Y. Aritake K. Uodome N. Okazaki-Hatake K.

Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of PGD2 action in the pathogenesis of allergic disease remains only partially characterized.PGD2 exerts its effects through two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the D prostanoid receptor (DP) and the recently discovered chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2). DP receptor signaling has been linked to NF-κB activation (6Mandal A.K. Zhang Z. Ray R. Choi M.S. Chowdhury B. Pattabiraman N. Mukherjee A.B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and may influence dendritic cell function leading to skewing of the T cell response toward a Th2 phenotype (7Gosset P. Bureau F. Angeli V. Pichavant M. Faveeuw C. Tonnel A.B. Trottein F. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4943-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in the DP receptor display reduced Th2-mediated airway inflammation in the ovalbumin-induced asthma model (8Matsuoka T. Hirata M. Tanaka H. Takahashi Y. Murata T. Kabashima K. Sugimoto Y. Kobayashi T. Ushikubi F. Aze Y. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Yoshida N. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Honda Y. Nagai H. Narumiya S. Science. 2000; 287: 2013-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), suggesting that PGD2 signaling through the DP receptor plays a pro-inflammatory role in settings of allergic inflammation. On the other hand, PGD2 has been hypothesized to exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting dendritic cell migration and T cell activation (9Hammad H. de Heer H.J. Soullie T. Hoogsteden H.C. Trottein F. Lambrecht B.N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3936-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).The role of PGD2 signaling through the CRTH2 receptor in allergic disease is less well established. In humans, the CRTH2 receptor is expressed on Th2 cells, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes (7Gosset P. Bureau F. Angeli V. Pichavant M. Faveeuw C. Tonnel A.B. Trottein F. J.

Moqbel R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: 5-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Polymorphisms in the 3′-untranslated region of the CRTH2 receptor gene that confer greater mRNA stability have been linked to increased asthma severity (13Huang J.L. Gao P.S. Mathias R.A. Yao T.C.

CRTH2 receptor activation stimulates chemotaxis of human Th2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils both in vitro and in vivo (16Hirai H. Tanaka K. Yoshie O. Ogawa K. Kenmotsu K. Takamori Y. Ichimasa M.

Ther. 2005; 312: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that the CRTH2 receptor may directly mediate recruitment of inflammatory cells in response to PGD2 generated in settings of allergic inflammation and thus a pro-inflammatory role (18Hata A.N. Breyer R.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 103: 147-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that ramatroban, a thromboxane receptor antagonist used clinically for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, also exhibits CRTH2 antagonist activity and inhibits PGD2-stimulated eosinophil migration (17Shiraishi Y. Asano K. Nakajima T. Oguma T. Suzuki Y. Shiomi T. Sayama K. Niimi K. Wakaki M. Kagyo J. Ikeda E. Hirai H. Yamaguchi K. Ishizaka A. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Ther. 2003; 305: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, ramatroban had been observed previously to inhibit antigen-induced mucosal eosinophilia in sensitized guinea pigs (20Narita S. Asakura K. Kataura A. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1996; 109: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ramatroban shares structural similarity with indomethacin, an arylacetic acid class nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor and widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has also been shown to be a potent CRTH2 agonist (21Hirai H. Tanaka K. Takano S. Ichimasa M. Nakamura M. Nagata K. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We recently performed structure-activity relationship analysis of arylacetic acid NSAIDs that revealed play structural features of indomethacin and ramatroban that are required for binding to the mouse CRTH2 receptor (22Hata A.N. Lybrand T.P. Marnett L.J. Breyer R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The CRTH2 receptor does not share significant sequence homology with the DP or other prostanoid receptors but instead exhibits greatest sequence similarity to peptide chemoattractant receptors such as the formyl peptide receptor (16Hirai H. Tanaka K. Yoshie O. Ogawa K. Kenmotsu K. Takamori Y. Ichimasa M. Sugamura K. Nakamura M. Takano S. Nagata K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Residues that have been identified as playing a role in prostanoid ligand binding by the DP and other prostanoid receptors are not conserved in the CRTH2 receptor sequence, suggesting that the CRTH2 receptor binds its prostaglandin ligand in a manner distinct from the other prostanoid receptors. In addition to peptide chemoattractant receptors, the CRTH2 receptor is related to several eicosanoid-binding chemoattractant receptors such as the leukotriene B4 and lipoxin A4 receptors; however, little is known about how these receptors interact with their respective ligands. To investigate the structure of the mouse CRTH2 receptor ligand binding pocket, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of putative ligand-binding residues, and we evaluated the effects of these mutations on ligand binding and receptor function. These studies reveal that PGD2 likely binds in the CRTH2 binding pocket with an orientation that is distinct from that proposed for other prostanoid receptors. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that PGD2 and indomethacin interact with distinct but overlapping sets of residues within the ligand binding pocket and suggest specific ligand-receptor interactions that may play a role in determining ligand binding affinity and selectivity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[3H]PGD2 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and unlabeled prostaglandin ligands were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Indomethacin, forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, and sodium butyrate were from Sigma. Ramatroban was a kind gift from K. Bacon (Bayer AG, Kyoto, Japan). DMEM and Opti-MEM were from Invitrogen. FBS was obtained from Atlanta Biologicals (Lawrenceville, GA). G418 was purchased from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). l-Glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin were from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). The 262K monoclonal anti-HA antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA); the PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA); the 3F10 rat anti-HA antibody was from Roche Applied Science, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody was from Amersham Biosciences.Construction and Expression of HA-tagged Wild-type mCRTH2 and HA-mCRTH2 Mutants—The HA-mCRTH2 expression plasmid was generated by ligation of fragments containing the HA epitope tag (SnaBI/NdeI) from the 77AHA pRc/CMV plasmid (23Audoly L. Breyer R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the mCRTH2 coding region (NdeI/XbaI) from the pRc/CMV/mCRTH2 plasmid (24Hata A.N. Zent R. Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) into pRc/CMV (SnaBI/XbaI). HA-mCRTH2 mutants were generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the HA-mCRTH2 pRc/CMV plasmid as template. Mutagenic oligonucleotides used were as follows (sense, 5′ to 3′ with mutagenic changes underlined): H38A, GTCGGTGCTGTTGGCCGGGCTGGCCTC; T87A, CCTGCCTTTCTTCGCCTACTTCCTGGCAG; H106A, CACTACCTTCTGCAAGCTAGCATCCTCGGTCTTCTTCCTCA; S107A, TTCTGCAAGCTACATGCCTCGGTCTTCTTCCTC; S108A, TGCAAGCTACATTCCGCGGTCTTCTTCCTCAAC; F110A, GCAAGCTACATTCCTCGGTCGCATTCCTCAACATGTTTGCCAG; R178A, CGCGGCTTGATGGCGCCATCATGTGCTACTACA; R178K, CGCGGCTTGATGGCAAGATCATGTGCTACTACA; R178H, CGCGGCTTGATGGCCACATCATGTGCTACTACA; L205A, CGCCAGAAGGCCGCGGCGGTCAGCAAATT; S208A, GCCCTGGCGGTCGCCAAATTCCTGCTGGC; K209A, CCTGGCGGTCAGCGCATTCCTGCTGGCCTTC; K209R, GGCGGTCAGCAGATTCCTGCTGGCC; Y261A, TCTGCTGGGGGCCCGCACACATCTTCAGTCTGC; Y261F, GCTGGGGGCCCTTCCACATCTTCAGTCTG; S265A, GCCCTACCACATCTTCGCACTGCTGGAGGCGCG; E268A, CAGTCTGCTGGCGGCGCGTGCCC; E268Q, CAGTCTGCTGCAGGCGCGTGCCC; E268D, CAGTCTGCTGGACGCGCGTGCCC; and S290A, GCTGCCCTTTGTCACCGCACTGGCCTTCTTCAACAGC. The coding regions of two independent clones of each mutant were verified by sequencing to ensure that only the intended mutation had been introduced into the expression construct.Expression of HA-mCRTH2 and Mutant Receptors in HEK293 Cells— Two independently derived plasmids encoding the HA-mCRTH2 and each mutant mCRTH2 receptor construct were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines (HA-mCRTH2, H106A, K209A, K209R, and E268A) were selected in media containing 600 μg/ml G418, and clones were isolated by manual colony isolation using cloning rings. For the Y261F mutant, a stably transfected polyclonal population was generated. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5.5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units ml-1 penicillin, 100 μg and ml-1 streptomycin. Expression of HA-mCRTH2 and mutant receptors in both transiently and stably expressing cells was enhance incubation with 5 mm sodium butyrate for 24 h prior to all experiments.Flow Cytometric Analysis of Receptor Expression—HA-mCRTH2 and mutant receptor expression in transiently and stably transfected HEK293 cells was monitored by flow cytometry. After brief trypsinization, cells were resuspended in media containing 10% FBS and immediately placed on ice. Cells were incubated with 1:100 of the 262K monoclonal anti-HA antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with 1:100 of a PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed for PE fluorescence on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Cell Surface ELISA Analysis of Receptor Expression—Cells stably expressing HA-mCRTH2 or mutant receptors were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) at a density of 4 × 105/well 2 days prior to experiment to ensure confluency at the time of ELISA. Receptor expression was enhanced by addition of sodium butyrate (5 mm) 24 h prior to the ELISA. Cells transiently expressing HA-mCRTH2 or mutant receptors were plated at a density of 6 × 105/well in the presence of sodium butyrate 1 day prior to experiment. Cells were fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.12 m sucrose in PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 m CaCl2 (PBS-CM) for 20–30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS-CM and incubated with 3% BSA in PBS-CM for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with 1:500 of the 3F10 rat anti-HA antibody in 3% BSA in PBS-CM for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS-CM for 5 min each, and incubated with 1:100 of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody in 3% BSA in PBS-CM for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS-CM, and the chromogenic substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (1 mg/ml, Pierce) was added. After color development (20–30 min), the reaction was stopped with the addition of an equal volume of 2.5 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 490 nm was determined. In some experiments, cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min prior to blocking with BSA.Radioligand Binding—Membranes for radioligand binding experiments were harvested from HEK293 cells expressing HA-mCRTH2 wild-type or mutant receptors as described (24Hata A.N. Zent R. Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Membranes (30 μg of membrane protein) were incubated with [3H]PGD2 and unlabeled ligands for 1.5 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl). These conditions were sufficient to achieve apparent equilibrium of binding while ensuring ligand stability and minimizing nonspecific binding. The binding reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and rapidly filtered under vacuum over Whatman GF/F filters. Filters were washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, dried and counted in 4 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation fluid (Packard Biosciences, Groningen, The Netherlands). For saturation isotherm experiments, the [3H]PGD2 concentration ranged from 2.5 to 30 nm. Specific binding did not exceed 5% of total radioligand concentration present in the binding reaction. For competition experiments, 3 nm [3H]PGD2 was used.[cAMP]i Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-mCRTH2 or mutant receptors were plated at a density of 9 × 105/well in 6-well plates 2 days prior to the experiment, and 5 mm sodium butyrate was added for the final 24 h. Thirty minutes prior to addition of ligands, media were replaced with Opti-MEM I containing 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. Cells were incubated with ligands for 10 min and washed once with PBS, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.1 m HCl. Cells were scraped free, and the resulting cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g. Supernatants were assayed for protein content by BCA assay (Pierce). After normalization to protein content, [cAMP]i levels were determined by an enzyme-linked immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical).Transwell Migration Assay—Cells stably expressing HA-mCRTH2 or mutant receptors were incubated with 5 mm sodium butyrate prior to harvesting. Cells were trypsinized, washed three times in PBS, and resuspended in DMEM. Cells (1 × 105) were added to the upper chamber of 24-well 8.0-μm polycarbonate transwell inserts (Costar, Cambridge, MA) that had been previously treated overnight with 5 μg/ml Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in PBS at 4 °C and blocked in the presence of 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37°C. Ligands were diluted in DMEM and added to the lower chamber. After incubating for 4 h at 37°C, inserts were removed, and cells adhering to the top of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. Cells on the bottom of the membrane were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h, washed twice with PBS, and stained overnight with crystal violet. For each insert, five independent fields were counted in blinded fashion at ×200 magnification.Molecular Modeling—The mCRTH2 model was constructed as described previously (22Hata A.N. Lybrand T.P. Marnett L.J. Breyer R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transmembrane-spanning α-helical bundle of mCRTH2 was constructed with homology modeling methods, using a β2-adrenergic receptor model as a template (25Furse K.E. Lybrand T.P. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4450-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The extracellular and cytosolic loops were generated de novo by attaching the loops as extended polypeptides to the appropriate helix and applying weak harmonic constraints during low temperature (30 K) molecular dynamics to connect appropriate loop segments with a trans-peptide bond. A putative disulfide cross-link between the extracellular region of transmembrane helix III and extracellular loop II was generated by applying additional constraints during the generation of extracellular loop II. The N and C termini were generated using similar techniques in the absence of constraints. To simplify model construction, the C-terminal tail was truncated at Val-321. The intact mCRTH2 receptor model was then refined further with limited energy minimization and low temperature molecular dynamics simulation to relieve any peptide backbone conformational strain or residual bad steric interactions. Ligands were docked into the putative ligand-binding site using both manual (PGD2) and automated (indomethacin) ligand docking algorithms. Receptor-ligand complexes that were consistent with mutagenesis data were refined by using limited energy minimization and low temperature molecular dynamics simulations in which weak harmonic positional restraints were placed on backbone atoms to prevent overcompaction of the receptor. All structural refinement calculations were performed in vacuo with a distance-dependent dielectric model, using standard AMBER all-atom potential functions. Energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculations were performed with the AMBER package. Automated ligand docking was performed using the automated docking module in MOE (Chemical Computing, Inc.).RESULTSTo predict putative CRTH2 receptor ligand-binding residues, we performed multiple sequence alignments to compare the transmembrane domains of the human and mouse CRTH2 receptors with those of related chemoattractant receptors, including the formyl peptide receptor (FPR), the C5a anaphylatoxin receptor (C5aR), and the leukotriene B4 receptors (BLT1 and BLT2). The ligand binding pockets of the FPR and C5a receptors have been extensively studied and ligand-binding residues identified (26Quehenberger O. Pan Z.K. Prossnitz E.R. Cavanagh S.L. Cochrane C.G.

We reasoned that CRTH2 receptor residues with the highest probability of interacting with ligand are as follows: 1) those that are conserved between the CRTH2 and chemoattractant receptors that have been shown to play a role in chemoattractant ligand binding or 2) those charged or polar residues that lie within the regions of conservation but are not themselves conserved. Based on these criteria (TABLE ONE), an initial set of candidate residues (His-106, Ser-107, Ser-108, Leu-205, Ser-208, and Lys-209) was selected and individually mutated to Ala. Additionally, Ser-290 was selected because its position corresponds to that of a highly conserved arginine that has been shown to play a role in ligand binding for members of the prostanoid receptor GPCR subfamily. The wild-type and mutant mCRTH2 receptor constructs possessed an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, which had ligand binding and signaling indistinguishable from that observed for the wild-type untagged receptor (data not shown).TABLE ONERationale for selection of mCRTH2 residues to mutateResidueRationaleTM IHis-38Based on mCRTH2 receptor model (22Hata A.N.

RASSLs are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that no longer respond to their endogenous ligands but can still be activated by synthetic ligands (5Coward P. Wada H.G. Falk M.S. Chan S.D. Meng F. Akil H. Conklin B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Given the biological importance of GPCRs, the ability to stimulate a single G protein pathway in a tissue of choice in vivo is useful for the understanding of subsequent changes in downstream signaling. The use of RASSLs has already provided valuable insight into the effect of Gαi signaling in the heart. Stimulation of a Gαi-coupled RASSL selectively expressed in the murine heart resulted in a strong (3-fold) and rapid (within 1 min after drug administration) decrease in heart rate (1Redfern C.H. Coward P. Degtyarev M.Y. Lee E.K. Kwa A.T. Hennighausen L. Bujard H. Fishman G.I. Conklin B.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the future, RASSLs may further be applied, e.g. to create reversible models of disease states, or combined with microarrays, to result in gene expression fingerprints of specific G protein pathways (for review, see Ref. 6Scearce-Levie K. Coward P. Redfern C.H. Conklin B.R. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 2001; 22: 414-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There are four major classes of G proteins, named after their respective α-subunit (Gαs, Gαi, Gαq/11, and Gα12). Each class couples to specific signal transduction pathways, which are well characterized in vitro (for a review, see Ref. 7Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The first described RASSL couples through Gαi proteins (5Coward P. Wada H.G. Falk M.S. Chan S.D. Meng F. Akil H. Conklin B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and thus far is the only RASSL being applied in vivo (1Redfern C.H. Coward P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus far, there have been no reports about either Gαq/11- or Gα12-coupled RASSLs. The human histamine H1 receptor (H1R) couples through Gαq/11 proteins and thereby activates phospholipase C, resulting in, for example, inositol phosphate hydrolysis and increased concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ (9Gutowski S.

Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 356: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the H1 receptor also activates NF-κB, both in a ligand-induced as well as in a constitutive manner, via Gαq/11 proteins (11Bakker R.A. Schoonus S.B. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Although several Gαq-coupled GPCRs also activate Gα12 (for a review, see Ref. 12Riobo N.A. Manning D.R. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 2005; 26: 146-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the H1R does not seem to couple to Gα12 (10Leopoldt D. Harteneck C.

By mutational analysis, we previously characterized several amino acids that are involved in the binding of histamine and several synthetic agonists, such as the histaprodifens (a new class of specific H1R agonists) (14Bruysters M. Pertz H.H. Teunissen A. Bakker R.A. Gillard M. Chatelain P. Schunack W. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 487: 5563Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutation of Phe435 (6.55) to Ala in TM6 (transmembrane domain 6) resulted in a strong decrease in affinity and potency of histamine, whereas only marginally affecting affinities and potencies of histaprodifens. In this study, we showed that for another class of H1R agonists, the substituted 2-phenyl-histamines (PheHAs, Ref. 15Leschke C. Elz S. Garbarg M. Schunack W. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), mutation of F435A results in strongly increased affinities and potencies, thereby identifying the first Gαq/11-coupled RASSL.

Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 African green monkey kidney cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (11Bakker R.A. Schoonus S.B. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Mol.

Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Mutations in the cDNA were verified by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method. NF-κB Reporter Gene Assay—Cells transiently co-transfected with pNF-κB-Luc (125 μg/1 · 107 cells) and pcDEF3 containing mutant or wild-type human H1R cDNA (25 μg/1 · 107 cells) were seeded in 96-well white plates (Costar) in serum-free culture medium and incubated with drugs. After 48 h, cells were assayed for luminescence by aspiration of the medium and the addition of 25 μl/well luciferase assay reagent (0.83 mm ATP, 0.83 mm d-luciferin, 18.7 mm MgCl2, 0.78 μm Na2H2P2O7, 38.9 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 0.39% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 2.6 μm dithiothreitol). After 30 min, luminescence was measured for 3 s/well in a Victor2 (Wallac). Histamine H1R Binding Studies—The transfected COS-7 cells used for radioligand binding studies were harvested after 48 h and homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm Na2/K phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) (binding buffer). The COS-7 cell homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in H1R binding buffer in 200 μl with 3 nm [3H]mepyramine. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm mianserin. The incubations were stopped by rapid dilution with 3 ml of ice-cold H1R binding buffer. The bound radioactivity was separated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters that had been treated with 0.3% polyethylenimine. Filters were washed twice with 3 ml of H1R binding buffer, and radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Binding data were evaluated by a non-linear, least squares curve-fitting procedure using GraphPad Prism® (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Analytical Methods—Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All data shown are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were carried out by non-paired Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference (a, p < 0.05; b, p < 0.01; c, p < 0.001). Molecular Modeling—Our H1R homology model was obtained using the bovine rhodopsin crystal structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1L9H, Ref. 19Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) as the template. The third intracellular loop that connects transmembranes 5 and 6 was omitted due to its large size. Side chains were added using the homology module of InsightII (20Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Water molecules present in the crystal structure were not incorporated. The initial model was refined by a steepest descent energy minimization. The minimized model was placed in a dodecahedral box filled with simple point charge water (21Vangunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1990; 29: 992-1023Crossref Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), and a second minimization step using steepest descent was performed. Hereafter, a 20-ps molecular dynamics (MD) run was performed with positions restraints (1000 kJ · mol-1 nm-2) on all heavy protein atoms. Finally, the model was refined by a 100-ps MD run. In this structure, Phe435 was changed to Ala with InsightII, thus creating a model of the F435A H1R. Histamine and 2-(3-chlorophenyl)histamine (ClPheHA) were docked in the WT and F435A models using AutoDock 3.0.0 (22Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8853) Google Scholar) applying default parameters. The monocationic ligands were assigned Löwdin atomic charges obtained after a single point ab initio restricted Hartree-Fock calculation using 6-31Gr* with the GAMESS US package (23Schmidt M.W. Baldridge K.K. Boatz J.A. Elbert S.T. Gordon M.S. Jensen J.H. Koseki S. Matsunaga N. Nguyen K.A. Su S.J. Windus T.L. Dupuis M. Montgomery J.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1993; 14: 1347-1363Crossref Scopus (18874) Google Scholar). The protein was assigned with KOLLUA partial charges using the SYBYL program (version 6, Tripos, St. Louis). Only essential hydrogens were taken into account. The obtained ligand-receptor complexes were minimized using the steepest descent method. These ligand-receptor complexes were placed in a dodecahedral box, with a minimum distance of 7 Å between protein and the box. The system was solvated with simple point charge water, and the protein partial charges were assigned by GROMACS. Again, a steepest descent procedure was performed on the system. Subsequently, a set of MD runs with position restraints (1000 kJ· mol-1nm-2) was applied to the system in which a controlled release of the restraints was performed. A run for 50 ps with position restraints on all heavy protein atoms and all ligand atoms was performed, with the protein hydrogens and all water molecules unrestrained. Consecutively, a run was performed for 20 ps with position restraints on all Cα-atoms, all heavy atoms of residues Asp107 and Asn198, and all ligand atoms. Finally, a MD run was performed for 1 ns with only position restraints on Cα-atoms. During the last 500 ps of this run, the presence of hydrogen bonds was analyzed using cutoff distance between heavy atoms of 3.5 Å and a cutoff angle between acceptor donor and hydrogen of 60°. All minimizations and MD simulations were performed using the GROMACS software package and the GROMOS 43a1 force field (24Lindahl E. Hess B. Van der Spoel D. J. Mol.

An NPT ensemble was generated using both the Berendsen thermostat and the barostat with default settings for 300 K and 1 bar (25Berendsen H.J.C. Van der Spoel D. Van Drunen R. Comput. Phys.

Mutation F435A Differentially Modulates Affinities of Several Classes of H1R Agonists—At the H1R, several H1R agonists show a higher affinity than the natural agonist histamine. The histamine analogs 2-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)histamine (CF3PheHA), histaprodifen, suprahistaprodifen, and the newly characterized H1R agonist 8R-lisuride bind 9-1000-fold better to the H1R as compared with histamine (TABLE ONE). Previously, we characterized Phe435 (6.55), as a specific interaction point for histamine (14Bruysters M. Pertz H.H. Teunissen A. Bakker R.A. Gillard M. Chatelain P. Schunack W. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 487: 5563Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue into alanine resulted in a 25-fold decrease in histamine affinity without drastic alterations in the affinity of the agonists histaprodifen and suprahistapodifen (TABLE ONE) (Ref. 14Bruysters M. Pertz H.H. Teunissen A. Bakker R.A. Gillard M. Chatelain P. Schunack W. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 487: 5563Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we further studied the role of Phe435 (6.55) in agonist binding to the H1R. TABLE ONE shows that, similar to histaprodifen and suprahistaprodifen, affinities of pyridylethylamine as well as 8R-lisuride are comparable for WT and F435A mutant H1Rs. Unexpectedly, for F435A H1R, the affinity of CF3PheHA was increased 54-fold as compared with WT H1R (Fig. 1 and TABLE ONE). Thus, the F435A mutant H1R has an affinity for CF3PheHA that exceeds the affinity of histamine more than 10,000-fold.TABLE ONEAffinities of H1R agonists for wild-type and Phe435 Ala mutant H1Rsa Affinities are determined by [3H]mepyramine displacement.

Basic Characterization of Phe435 Mutant H1Rs—Phenylalanine at position 6.55 is conserved among all known H1Rs (27Horn F. Vriend G. Cohen F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and is implicated in ligand binding in both human and guinea pig H1Rs (14Bruysters M. Pertz H.H. Teunissen A.

Leurs R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29994-30000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The F435A mutation removes an aromatic ring structure from the binding pocket, and therefore, potential interactions with either ligands or other amino acids in the H1R-binding pocket may be lost. However, exchanging the bulky Phe435 (6.52) with the smaller alanine may also increase the size of the ligand-binding pocket and thus create space for the trifluoromethyl-phenyl moiety of CF3PheHA, resulting in an increased affinity for this ligand. To address the latter possibility, we created additional mutant H1Rs (F435V and F435L) that vary in the size of the side chain at position 6.55. The generated mutant receptors are expressed at comparable levels (Bmax = 13.6-20.1 pmol/mg of protein) in transiently transfected COS-7 cells and bind the H1 R radioligand [3H]mepyramine with virtually unchanged affinity (Kd = 1.5-5.7 nm), as determined by radioligand saturation binding experiments (TABLE TWO). Although the expression levels are similar, there is a clear difference in constitutive GPCR activities of the tested H1R mutants as measured by an NF-κB-driven reporter gene assay (Fig. 2, white bars). Although the basal activity of H1R F435L H1R is comparable with the WT H1R, the level of constitutive NF-κB activation of H1R F435V is twice as high, whereas for mutant H1R, F435A constitutive activity is hardly detectable. Although the levels of constitutive NF-κB activation vary between the mutant H1Rs, their agonist-induced responses are comparable (Fig. 2, black bars), indicating that G protein-coupling of the mutant H1Rs is not impaired.TABLE TWOCharacteristics of [3H]mepyramine binding to WT and mutant H1R The values are determined by saturation radioligand binding assays.

Binding Analysis of WT and Phe435 Mutant H1Rs—Similar to the mutant F435A H1R (pKi = 2.7), the mutant H1R F435V (pKi = 2.9) and F435L (pKi = 2.9) exhibit a strong decrease in their affinity for histamine as compared with the WT receptor (pKi = 4.1) (TABLE THREE). Again, these mutant receptors exhibit an increased affinity for CF3PheHA. The exchange of Phe435 for leucine, valine, or alanine results in mutant H1Rs with a 47-, 124-, and 54-fold increased affinity for CF3PheHA respectively, as compared with the WT receptor (pKi = 5.0) (TABLE THREE). For these mutant H1Rs, the affinity of CF3PheHA greatly exceeds their affinity of the endogenous ligand histamine, the mutant F435V H1R exhibiting the greatest selectivity for the synthetic agonist CF3PheHA over histamine (17,000-fold).TABLE THREECharacterization of H1R agonists on wild-type and mutant H1Rs Potencies of agonists (pEC50) are determined by an NF-κB-driven reporter gene assay.

We tested two other substituted PheHAs, ClPheHA and 2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)histamine (Cl2PheHA), on the mutant H1Rs as well. For the WT H1R, the affinity of ClPheHA (pKi = 5.3) is slightly higher then than that of CF3PheHA (pKi = 5.0). An (additional) para-chloro substituent is not favorable for H1R affinity (pKi = 4.6), fitting previous findings for both human and rodent H1Rs (29Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Burckstummer T. Pertz H.H. Schunack W. Dove S. Buschauer A. Elz S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 1104-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similar to CF3PheHA, the affinity of ClPheHA is increased upon mutation of Phe435 into leucine (pKi = 6.8), valine (pKi = 7.3), or alanine (pKi = 6.7). Although for Cl2PheHA, H1R affinities are lower and increases in affinity are smaller, the same trend upon mutation is observed (pKi values, 4.6, 5.3, 5.8, and 5.4, respectively). Similar to CF3PheHA, for ClPheHA and Cl2PheHA, mutation F435V also results in the largest increase in affinity, as compared with the WT receptor. Additionally, we tested a series of 2-cyclohexyl-histamines (CxHAs), varying in spacer length between the imidazole ring and the cyclohexyl moieties: CxHA, 2-(methyl-cyclohexyl)-histamine (MeCxHA), and 2-(ethyl-cyclohexyl)-histamine (EthCxHA). The affinities of the CxHAs are approximately equal to the affinity of histamine (TABLE THREE). Again, mutation of Phe435 into alanine, valine, or leucine results in increased affinities as compared with the WT H1R (TABLE THREE). The increases in affinity, however, are smaller (maximum 10-fold) than those observed for the PheHAs (maximum 120-fold). Although changes in affinity are less prominent, for EthCxHA, we observe a correlation between the space available in the binding pocket (Ala → Val → Leu → Phe) and the affinities for the mutant receptors (F435A, pKi 4.9; F435V, pKi = 4.6; F435L, pKi = 4.3; and WT, pKi = 4.1, TABLE THREE). For both CxHA and MeCxHA, the highest affinities are observed for the F435V mutant H1R, following the trend observed for the PheHAs. Functional Analysis of WT and Phe435 Mutant H1Rs—Using an NF-κB-driven reporter gene assay, we evaluated the potencies of several 2-phenylsubstituted histamine analogs for mutant and WT H1Rs. For the WT H1R, these analogs are less potent than the endogenous ligand histamine (pEC50 = 6.9) (TABLE THREE). Fig. 3 clearly illustrates that as compared with the WT H1R, the potency of HA at the H1R F435A is decreased 200-fold, whereas the potency of ClPheHA is increased 2,600-fold. Also, for CF3PheHA and Cl2PheHA, potencies were increased upon the mutation F435A; again ClPheHA (pEC50 = 9.4) and CF3PheHA (pEC50 = 9.2) are equipotent, and Cl2PheHA is clearly less potent (pEC50 = 7.9) (TABLE THREE). For mutant H1Rs F435L and F435V, similar trends are observed, with PheHA potencies for H1R F435V being slightly higher than for F435A and F435L H1Rs. For mutant H1Rs, F435A, F435V, and F435L ClPheHA and CF3PheHA are agonists with subnanomolar potencies, which exceed the potency of histamine 70,000-280,000-fold. Molecular Modeling of WT and F435A Mutant H1Rs—Our model of the H1R, based on the bovine rhodopsin crystal structure, was used to visualize the interactions of either histamine or ClPheHA with the WT and F435A mutant H1R. Models of both WT and F435A H1Rs were optimized by molecular dynamics simulations. Hereafter, histamine and ClPheHA were automatically docked in both WT and F435A mutant H1R models. Finally, a second round of molecular dynamics was used to optimize the receptor-ligand complexes. In the WT H1R, both histamine and ClPheHA show an ionic interaction between the conserved Asp107 (3.32) in TM3 (transmembrane domain 3) and their ethylamine group over distances of 2.6 and 3.0 Å, respectively (Fig. 4, A and C). As expected, differences between histamine and ClPheHA can be observed for interaction with Phe435. In binding histamine, Phe435 has an indirect role, keeping Phe432 in an edge-to-face orientation toward the imidazole moiety of histamine (Fig. 4A). In this orientation, a hydrogen bond can be formed between the distal nitrogen of the imidazole ring of histamine and Asn198 at a distance of 2.7 Å and is obse"
https://openalex.org/W1996907077,"The human c-rel gene (REL), encoding an NF-kappaB transcription factor, is amplified or mutated in several human B-cell lymphomas and can transform chicken lymphoid cells in vitro. We have previously shown that certain deletions of C-terminal transactivation sequences enhance REL's transforming ability in chicken spleen cells. In this report, we have analysed the effect of single amino-acid changes at select serine residues in the C-terminal transactivation domain on REL's transforming ability. Mutation of either of two TNFalpha-inducible serine residues (Ser460 and Ser471) to nonphosphorylatable residues (alanine, asparagine, phenylalanine) made REL more efficient at transforming chicken spleen cells in vitro. In contrast, mutation of Ser471 to a phosphorylation mimetic aspartate residue impaired REL's transforming ability, even though it increased REL's inherent transactivation ability as a GAL4-fusion protein. Alanine mutations of several other serine residues within the transactivation domain did not substantially affect REL's transforming ability. Transactivation by GAL4-REL fusion proteins containing either transformation enhancing or nonenhancing mutations at serine residues was generally similar to wild-type GAL4-REL. However, more transforming mutants with mutations at either Ser460 or Ser471 differed from wild-type REL in their ability to transactivate certain kappaB-site reporter genes. In particular, the SOD2 promoter, encoding manganese superoxide dismutase, was activated less strongly by the more transforming REL mutant REL-S471N in transient assays, but REL-S471N-transformed chicken spleen cells had increased levels of MnSOD protein as compared to wild-type REL-transformed cells. Taken together, our results show that mutations of certain serine residues can enhance REL's transforming ability in vitro and suggest that these mutations increase REL-mediated transformation by altering REL's ability to modulate the expression of select target genes. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Ser471 may be involved in REL-mediated modulation of transformation-specific target gene expression. Lastly, these results suggest that similar mutations in the REL transactivation domain contribute to the development of certain human B-cell lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2042766259,"Two variants of the renal Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2), called NKCC2A and NKCC2F, display marked differences in Na+, Rb+, and Cl- affinities, yet are identical to one another except for a 23-residue membrane-associated domain that is derived from alternatively spliced exons. The proximal portion of these exons is predicted to encode the second transmembrane domain (tm2) in the form of an α-helix, and the distal portion, part of the following connecting segment (cs1a). In recent studies, we have taken advantage of the A–F differences in kinetic behavior to determine which regions in tm2-cs1a are involved in ion transport. Functional characterizations of chimeras in which tm2 or cs1a were interchanged between the variants showed that both regions are important in specifying ion affinities, but did not allow delineating the contribution of individual residues. Here, we have extended these structure-function analyses by studying additional mutants in which variant residues between A and F were interchanged individually in the tm2-cs1a region (amino acid number 216, 220, 223, 229, or 233 in NKCC2). None of the substitutions were found to affect Km (C1-), suggesting that the affinity difference for anion transport is conveyed by a combination of variant residues in this domain. However, 2 substitutions in the tm2 of F were found to affect cation constants specifically; interestingly, one of these mutations (residue 216) only affected Km (Rb+) while the other (residue 220) only affected Km (Na+). We have thus identified two novel residues in NKCC2 that play a key role in cation transport. Because such residues should be adjacent to one another on the vertical axis of the tm2 α-helix, our results imply, furthermore, that the ion transport sites in NKCC2 could be physically linked.

The main function of both NKCC1 and NKCC2 is to couple the movement of Na+-K+-Cl- across the cell surface. Based on various studies, the stoichiometry of ion transport has been shown to be 1Na-:1K-:2Cl+, implying that there is no net movement of charge during the translocation cycle (13Haas M. Forbush B.

In previous work, we have exploited such differences to identify residues that are involved in ion movement by the transporters. Indeed, structure-function studies of wild-type and chimeric NKCCs have shown that the kinetic characteristics of these proteins are specified, at least in part, by variant residues that are localized in the tm2 and/or cs1a regions (18Gagnon E.

Chimera approaches can be used quite effectively to identify variant residues that convey differences in the operations of homologous carriers. The main disadvantage of such studies is that key residues will be missed if they are fully conserved between the carriers. This limitation is illustrated by recent analyses in which the behavior of various chimeras led to slightly different interpretations of where affinity-modifying domains are localized depending on which NKCC was used to generate the mutants. Based on these analyses, for instance, it was not possible to determine whether the cs1a region of NKCC1 is involved in ion transport (18Gagnon E. Bergeron M.J. Brunet G.M. Daigle N.D. Simard C.F.

The NKCC ion binding sites are known to be functionally interdependent; that is, a change in ion affinity at one site induces a change in ion affinity at another site (18Gagnon E. Bergeron M.J.

One implication of this characteristic is that it could be difficult to determine which ion constants are modified directly as a result of a residue substitution. Fortunately, we have recently determined the manner in which these constants are interrelated based on kinetic studies of wild-type NKCC1 expressed in HEK-293 cells (24Isenring P. Jacoby S.C.

One of the structure-function studies that was discussed above led to the identification of five candidate residues in tm2-cs1a that play a definite role in Cl- transport by NKCC2, but the same degree of resolution concerning the structural determinants of cation transport was not obtained (18Gagnon E.

The approach that was used here was valuable in this regard, allowing us to uncover two residues that are important in determining Na+ and Rb+ affinities. Quite interestingly, our kinetic studies also suggest that the residues identified belong to distinct ion binding sites in the tm2-cs1 region. Overview—Structure-function studies were carried out to identify affinity-modifying residues in the tm2-cs1a region of Squalus acanthias (sa) NKCC2A and saNKCC2F (called saA and saF in this work). Mutant saNKCC2A and saNKCCF were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and characterized through flux assays. Unless mentioned otherwise, chemicals, reagents, and kits were from different suppliers or collaborators. cDNAs—A total of 10 different cDNA constructs were used in these assays.

They correspond to wild-type saA and saF, and to a pair of complementary chimeras in which tm2 or cs1a was interchanged between saA and saF. These chimeras are called saA/F (tm2 from A, cs1a from F) and saF/A (tm2 from F, cs1a from A). The wild-type saA and the tm2-cs1a regions of saA, saF, saA/F, and saF/A are represented in Fig. 1 through hydropathy plot models to illustrate how they differ between each other and to show where the junction point of the chimeras occur, thereby providing a rationale for the choice of substitutions that were created in the current work. saA(I216V), saF(V216I), saA(I220L), saF(L220I), saA(L223I), saF(I223L), saA(S229C), saF(C229S), saA(C233V), and saF(V233C)—These constructs consist of saA or saF inserts in which one of the tm2-cs1a codons was interchanged between the variants.

However, based on the behavior of saNKCC1 and human (h) NKCC1 chimeras, both these carriers also exhibit dramatic differences in ion affinities, we had predicted that nonconserved residues between the two NKCC1s as well as between high and low affinity wild-type NKCCs (from shark, rat, rabbit, human) would be important in determining cation affinities, whereas nonconserved residues between high affinity and low affinity NKCC2s (from shark, rat, rabbit) would be important in determining anion affinity (17Gagnon E.

Forbush (Yale University), was used as primary antibody, whereas the goat Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit anti-IgG (Molecular Probes, A11008) was used as secondary antibody. Kinetic Studies—Ion transport rates were determined by 86Rb+ influx measurements at ∼22 °C using different types of media (shown in TABLE TWO). Each of these media is derived from a regular (R) medium that is iso-osmolar relative to plasma for the X. laevis frog. One of the modified media (called R+) was obtained by adding 84 mOsm sucrose, and the other types of media (called RΔ) were obtained by replacing the ions of medium R with K+ or N-methyl gluconate (as cation substituents) or with gluconate ± SO42- (as anion substituents). Before, the flux assay per se, furosemide was first removed through several rinses in medium R. Eggs were then subjected to two consecutive incubation steps: one of 60 min in medium R+ to activate the cotransporter and another of 45 min in various medium RΔ + 1–2 μCi/ml 86Rb+ + 10 μm ouabain ± 250 μm bumetanide to measure NKCC-specific accumulation of the isotope. During this second 45-min time interval, transport activity versus time is in a linear range, regardless of the ion concentration used. Here, the various medium RΔ were produced by varying [Na+] from 0 to 87 mm, [Rb+] from 0.1 to 20 mm or [Cl-] from 0 to 86 mm (see TABLE TWO and figure legends). Fluxes were terminated with washes in a high K+ medium RΔ + 10 μm ouabain ± 250 μm bumetanide, and oocytes were transferred to 96-well plates (1 oocyte/well) prefilled with 2% SDS and scintillation fluid. After a short stabilization period, accumulated 86Rb+ was detected with the TopCountNXT microplate counter (Packard). To minimize cell damage during the flux assays, all of the incubation steps were carried out in 12-well plates by transferring oocytes with a Pasteur pipette from one prefilled well to another, rather than by changing the media through aspiration and refilling of the same well. To avoid solution contamination, however, each of these steps was performed using three different wells prefilled with the same solution, the first two wells to incubate oocytes for a very short period of time, and the last well to complete the incubation step per se (except for the final wash during which all of the incubation times were brief). With this method, we have found that ion concentrations in the final incubating solutions change by less than 0.5%. 4E. Gagnon, L. Caron, and P. Isenring, unpublished results. In each experiment, counts among several oocytes (generally 4–6) were averaged and transposed into flux rates (FRs). The equation used for this calculation was FRs = (counts/oocyte × [85Rb+] in the flux solution) ÷ ([counts] in the flux solution × time of incubation in the flux solution), assuming that mean membrane surface areas between groups of stage V-VI oocytes are very similar; for kinetic determinations (see below), mean FRs were also normalized to those obtained at the highest ion concentration. All of these mean normalized or non-normalized values were subsequently reaveraged from several replicate experiments (n = 2–5), and the data obtained were expressed as mean ± S.E. Ion constants (expressed as Km) and closeness of fits were calculated with the programs PLOT (Biff Forbush) or SigmaPlot 4.00 for Windows using the Michaelis-Menten equation (for a one binding site model), the Hill equation with a coefficient (n) of 2 (for a two binding site model), or the Hill equation with an undetermined value of n. In each case, least square analyses were carried out with a 3 or 4 parameter equation (variables: Vmax, Km, and Vmin± Hill) to allow a 0 offset, assuming that 86Rb+ influx is never completely absent even if one of the cotransported ions is removed from the flux solution (as occurs when the transporter is in the K+/K+ exchange mode for example). In the current study, these kinetic parameters are presented as 1) averages of mean values from replicate experiments (in which case differences between variables were analyzed through Student's two tailed t-tests, assuming a null hypothesis for p values > 0.05), and as 2) the results of single fits using activity versus concentration data points that were also obtained by averaging mean values from replicate experiments. The latter method was employed to adjust for intra-experimental variability, which could introduce systematic errors, and because it is not possible to obtain time-matched data for all of the conditions tested. The types of calculations carried out, and variables that were used are specified further in the legends of tables or figures. Last of all, it should be noted that kinetic parameters were calculated without subtracting bu"

Photoautotrophic growth of the CP47 mutant was also restored by in vivo inhibition of ferrochelatase by a specific inhibitor. The decrease in ferrochelatase activity in pseudorevertants was followed by increased steady-state levels of Chl precursors and Chl, leading to CP47 accumulation and photosystem II assembly. Similarly, supplementation of the CP47 mutant with the Chl precursor Mg-protoporphyrin IX increased the number of active photosystem-II centers, suggesting that synthesis of the mutated CP47 protein is enhanced by an increased Chl availability in the cell.

These proteins are assembled into the PSII complex in an ordered manner, and the mutation or inactivation of a single protein frequently leads to PSII destabilization and its disappearance from the thylakoids (2Komenda J.

From several cofactors that are associated with the PSII core, chlorophyll (Chl) has been shown to be essential for PSII biogenesis. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses of expression and accumulation of PSII chlorophyll-binding proteins have suggested that cotranslational binding of Chl is required for correct apoprotein folding and stable integration into the thylakoid membrane (4Müller B. Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Eichacker L.A. Helfrich M. Rüdiger W. Müller B. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutation studies of Chl ligands and in vitro reconstitution of Chl-binding proteins indicate that, without Chl, apoproteins do not fold correctly and are recognized and degraded by specific proteases (7Manna P. Vermaas W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8Shen G. Vermaas W.F.J.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the process of delivery and incorporation of Chl into apoproteins, as well as the role of Chl in protein folding, remain to be elucidated. It is generally accepted that expression of Chl-binding proteins is synchronized with Chl biosynthesis to ensure formation of a proper amount of Chl for assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus and to avoid harmful accumulation of non-assembled (free) Chl and its precursors (10Yaronskaya E. Ziemann V. Walter G. Averina N. Börner T. Grimm B. Plant J. 2003; 35: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Thomas H. New Phytol. 1997; 136: 163-181Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This regulation is rather complicated: because Chl shares a common biosynthetic pathway with heme, and demand for these cofactors varies considerably depending on environmental and growth conditions (reviewed in Ref. 12Cornah J.E. Terry M.J. Smith A.G. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 224-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, photosynthetic organisms have to balance fluxes through these two biosynthetic branches and coordinate them with apoprotein formation. An important role in this process may be played by Mg- and Fe-chelatases lying at the branch point of the common tetrapyrrole pathway. Here, magnesium chelatase and ferrochelatase (FeCH) compete for the same substrate, protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX), to insert either magnesium for Chl biosynthesis or ferrous ion for heme, and in cyanobacteria also for phycobilin biosynthesis. To guarantee a balanced flow of precursors in the pathway, expression or activities of these chelatases are apparently controlled by light (13Hihara Y. Kamei A. Kanehisa M. Kaplan A. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), diurnal and circadian rhythmicity (14Papenbrock J. Mock H.P. Kruse E. Grimm B.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1719-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, Tichy and Vermaas (1Tichy M. Vermaas W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6296-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) described a C1.8 mutant of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 carrying a mutation in the Chl-binding CP47 protein comprising the core antenna of PSII (see Fig. 1). The mutant exhibited very poor photoautotrophic growth, however fully autotrophic pseudorevertants were formed at high frequency. Interestingly, in two C1.8 pseudorevertants (P1.8.1 and P1.8.2), complementing mutations were mapped to the FeCH gene, and their sequencing revealed point mutations in this gene (see Fig. 1). In this study we have characterized the Synechocystis C1.8 mutant and its photoautotrophic pseudorevertants in detail to explain how mutations in FeCH may functionally complement mutation in the CP47 protein. The results clearly indicate that, at least in this mutant, FeCH activity is controlling PSII assembly, most probably by modulation of chlorophyll availability in the cell. Strains and Growth Conditions—The ΔCP47 deletion mutant, in which most of the psbB gene coding for CP47 is replaced by a spectinomycin-resistance cassette, was prepared by Eaton-Rye and Vermaas (29Eaton-Rye J.J. Vermaas W.F.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The deletion mutant Δ1CP47 (Δ1), lacking four amino acid residues (Ile265–Phe268, Fig. 1) of the CP47 protein, has been prepared by Haag et al. (17Haag E. Eaton-Rye J.J. Renger G. Vermaas W.F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The poorly photoautotrophic C1.8 mutant has been constructed by combinatorial mutagenesis performed on Δ1 (1Tichy M. Vermaas W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6296-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Two photoautotrophic pseudorevertants originating from C1.8–P1.8.1 and P1.8.2 carry point mutations in the FeCH gene that cause amino acid substitution S50Y and S321F, respectively (1Tichy M. Vermaas W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6296-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).

Synechocystis strains were grown in liquid BG-11 medium (20Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen.

Strains were grown on 5 mm glucose unless photoautotrophic conditions are indicated. Oxygen Evolution—Light-saturated (3500 μmol m–2 s–1) steadystate rate of oxygen evolution was measured directly with samples taken from liquid cultures (OD730 = 0.5–0.7) using a Clark-type electrode in the presence of 1 mm potassium ferricyanate and 0.1 mm dimethyl-p-benzoquinone at 29 °C. Determination of Chl and Carotenoids—Chl and carotenoids were extracted from cell pellets (50 ml, OD730 ∼ 0.5) by 100% methanol. Chl content was measured spectrophotometrically on a Spectronic Unicam UV500 spectrophotometer (21Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4696) Google Scholar). Carotenoids were separated by HPLC on a Vydac 201TP54 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, C-18 reversed-phase silica gel). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of solvent B (methanol and acetone, 6:4, v/v) in solvent A (methanol and 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 8:2, v/v, pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min as follows: 0–80% in 3 min, 80–100% in the next 10 min, and then followed by 100% solvent B for 5 min. Carotenoid species were identified by their absorption spectra and by their typical retention times. Electron Microscopy—Cells were washed twice in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and fixed in a solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h. This was followed by three washes in phosphate buffer and post-fixated in 1% OsO4 in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h. The cells were again washed three times, and the samples were dehydrated in acetone and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife and post-stained for 30 min with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate for 80 s and examined with a Jeol 1010 electron microscope equipped with charge-coupled device video camera Lhesa 72WA and image acquisition software VideoTIP (Tescan). Radiolabeling of the Cells, Membrane Preparation, and Protein Analysis Using Two-dimensional Native/SDS Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Radiolabeling of cells using a mixture of l-[35S]methionine and l-[35S]cysteine (>1000 Ci mmol–1, Tran35S-label, ICN, final activity, 400 μCi ml–1) and isolation of membranes was performed as described in a previous study (2Komenda J.

For two-dimensional analysis, isolated membranes were solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (n-dodecyl-β-maltoside/Chl = 20, w/w), and the obtained complexes were separated by blue-native electrophoresis at 4 °C in 5–14% polyacrylamide gel according to a previous study (22Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar) in the first dimension, and by electrophoresis in a denaturing 12–20% linear-gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in the second dimension (2Komenda J.

Proteins separated in the gel were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with specific primary antibodies and then with secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). The primary antibodies used in the study were raised in rabbits against: (i) residues 58–86 of the spinach D1 polypeptide; (ii) 12 last residues of the Synechocystis D2 polypeptide; (iii) residues 380–394 of barley CP47; and (iv) the whole isolated CP43 (2Komenda J.

For autoradiography, the gel or the membrane with labeled proteins was exposed to x-ray film at laboratory temperature for 2–3 days. Ferrochelatase Activity Assay—For the determination of FeCH activity in thylakoids, 50 ml of cells (OD730 ∼ 0.5) were washed in the thylakoid buffer containing 100 mm Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol (v/v). The cell suspension was transferred into 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, mixed with glass beads, and broken in a MiniBeadBeater. The homogenate was centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pelleted thylakoids were washed in EDTA-free thylakoid buffer and centrifuged at 32,000 × g. Finally, thylakoids were re-suspended in EDTA-free thylakoid buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and frozen at –70 °C. The standard assay was performed in a cuvette containing 1.5 ml of assay buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.03% Tween 80, 0.1 μm ZnSO4, and 0.3 μm protoporphyrin IX) at 35 °C. The reaction was started with thylakoids and the formation of zinc-protoporphyrin IX recorded spectrofluorometrically using a Spectronic Unicam series 2 spectrofluorometer (23Camadro J.M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11675-11682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and zinc-protoporphyrin IX (Sigma) as a standard. Quantification of Chlorophyll Intermediates—For quantitative determination of protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX), Mg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-proto IX) monomethyl ester, and protochlorophyllide (PChlide), pigments were extracted from cell pellets (150 ml, OD730 ∼ 0.5) by three successive extractions with methanol containing 0.1% of NH4OH. Supernatants were combined, and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum to dryness. Extracts were dissolved in a small volume of basic methanol and immediately subjected to HPLC analysis with a Vydac 201TP54 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, C-18 reversed-phase silica gel). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of solvent B (methanol and acetone, 9:1, v/v) in solvent A (methanol and 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 7:3, v/v, pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The 100% of solvent B was reached after 20 min. HPLC peaks corresponding to PChlide were identified from their absorption spectra. Positions corresponding to Proto IX and Mg-proto IX monomethyl ester were identified from comparison with authentic standards (Sigma and Frontier Scientific, Logan, UT). HPLC fractions containing PChlide (retention time, 12.5–13.5 min), Mg-proto IX monomethyl ester (14–14.5 min), and Proto IX (17–17.8 min) were collected and concentrations of the corresponding compounds determined fluorometrically using a Spectronic Unicam series 2 spectrofluorometer. Protoheme Determination—Protoheme was extracted from 0.5 liter of cells (OD730 ∼ 0.5) by acidic acetone according to Ref. 24Xu H. Vavilin D. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42726-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, and its concentration was determined from the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum as described by Stillman and Gassman (25Stillman L.C. Gassman M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with ammonium persulfate used for sample oxidation. Chlorophyll Fluorescence Induction—A P.S.I. fluorometer (Photon System Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic) was used to record Chl fluorescence induction in the presence of 10 μm DCMU. PSII fluorescence was induced by a 60-ms pulse of light supplied by blue light-emitting diodes. Induction curves were measured directly in liquid cultures (OD730 = 0.5) after 2-min dark adaptation. The cells treated by Mg-proto IX were washed three times in BG-11 medium to eliminate traces of this compound. Mutant Characterization—The growth characteristics, Chl content and oxygen evolution of strains used in this study are listed in Table I. In normal light, all three CP47 mutants (ΔCP47, Δ1, and C1.8) exhibited slower growth rate and lower Chl accumulation than WT. Interestingly, growth impairment and decrease in Chl level were more pronounced in the Δ1 mutant with a short deletion in the E loop of the CP47 protein (Fig. 1A) than in the ΔCP47 strain lacking most of the CP47 gene. The growth rates and Chl levels were not affected in low light, indicating the light sensitivity of the CP47 mutants. This is supported by the significantly increased levels of carotenoids shown in normal light. Particularly myxoxanthophyll, important in defense against light stress (26Steiger S. Schäfer L. Sandmann G. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B: Biol. 1999; 52: 14-18Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), was highly increased in all CP47 mutants (see Supplemental Table S1). In contrast, carotenoid levels in both strains were comparable to WT in low light (data not shown). The phenotype of the poorly photoautotrophic C1.8 mutant was consistent with its original characterization (1Tichy M. Vermaas W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6296-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Table IGrowth rate, Chl content, and oxygen evolution of Synechocystis 6803 strainsNormal lightLow lightStrainDoubling timeChlorophyll,bμg·ml-1·OD730-1. +glu.O2 evolution,cμmol·O2·mg Chl-1·h-1. +glu.Doubling time, +glu.Chlorophyll, +glu.-glu.a5 mm glucose (glu.).+glu.h50 μmol·m-2·s-1h5 μmol·m-2·s-1WT14104.5 ± 0.2550193.7 ± 0.2ΔCP47NGdNG, no growth (strain did not grow under these conditions).133.2 ± 0.20193.6 ± 0.2Δ1NG171.9 ± 0.10193.7 ± 0.2C1.865143.4 ± 0.2250193.6 ± 0.2P1.8.114106.6 ± 0.2530194.4 ± 0.2Pl.8.215105.4 ± 0.2500194.4 ± 0.2a 5 mm glucose (glu.).b μg·ml-1·OD730-1.c μmol·O2·mg Chl-1·h-1.d NG, no growth (strain did not grow under these conditions). Open table in a new tab Transmission electron microscopy revealed that cells of Δ1 growing in normal light were much smaller than WT cells and displayed highly fragmented thylakoid membranes (Fig. 2). This was in contrast to the almost normal membrane organization in the corresponding ΔCP47 mutant (Fig. 2), confirming the strong adverse effect of the Δ1 mutation. Membrane organization in C1.8 was similar to that in the ΔCP47 mutant (not shown). The rate of photoautotrophic growth and oxygen-evolving capacity of the pseudorevertants were comparable to that of WT (Table I), however, significantly higher levels of Chl, carotenoids and phycobilinoproteins accumulated in both strains (Table I and Supplemental Fig. S1). This concomitant increase of photosynthetic pigments in pseudorevertants suggests a higher abundance of photosystems and phycobilisomes in their cells. Indeed, electron microscopy revealed an atypical organization of thylakoid membranes in the cells of the P1.8.1 pseudorevertant. In addition to several concentric thylakoid membranes typical for Synechocystis 6803, new centric membranes were found in P1.8.1 (Fig. 2, C–E). CP47 Accumulation and Photosystem II Assembly—We analyzed the effect of the mutation in the Δ1 and C1.8 strains on stability and accumulation of PSII core proteins and PSII assembly in CP47 mutants and pseudorevertants. To follow the accumulation of PSII core proteins, solubilized thylakoid membranes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins blotted and exposed to a mix of antisera against CP47, CP43, D1, and D2. As shown in Fig. 3, the Δ1 mutant has no detectable amounts of CP47, similar to that of the deletion mutant ΔCP47. In the C1.8 mutant, about 20% of the WT steady-state level of CP47 was estimated, showing an improved CP47 translation/stability in comparison to Δ1. The accumulation of CP47 in pseudorevertants was comparable to WT (Fig. 3). De novo synthesis and assembly of mutated CP47 into PSII was followed by a combination of protein pulse-chase radiolabeling and two-dimensional native/SDS electrophoresis. In thylakoid membranes of Δ1, no signal of CP47 was detected and the synthesis of labeled proteins was essentially identical to that of ΔCP47 (data not shown, for ΔCP47 see Ref. 2Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B.C. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), indicating that the synthesis and/or incorporation of CP47 into the thylakoid membrane was completely disrupted. In C1.8, only a very weak signal of labeled proteins assembled into the PSII complex and RC47 subcomplex (consisting of D1, D2, cytochrome b559, and CP47) was detected (Fig. 4). Instead, the D1-D2-cytochrome b559 subcomplex and free CP43 accumulated substantially, suggesting that PSII assembly was blocked at the CP47 insertion step. The very low level of unassembled CP47 indicates that the C1.8 mutation does not affect the assembly of CP47 into PSII. In the pseudorevertants, the amount of synthesized CP47, as well as the rate of its assembly into PSII, were found to be very similar to WT. After a 30-min chase, the signal intensity of CP47 did not significantly decline, implying normal stability of the newly synthesized CP47 carrying the C1.8 mutation (Fig. 4). This indicates that the C1.8 strain is impaired at the level of CP47 synthesis. The mutated CP47 protein, once synthesized, is stable and is assembled normally into a functional PSII. In Vitro FeCH Activity in C1.8 Strains—Because the effect of both complementing mutations on FeCH was not evident from the sequence alignments, and it was hypothesized that they may influence FeCH activity (1Tichy M. Vermaas W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6296-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we decided to compare in vitro FeCH activity in the CP47 mutants and both pseudorevertants. Because no FeCH activity was found in the soluble fraction, isolated thylakoid membranes were used for the FeCH assay using Proto IX and zinc as a substrate. Surprisingly, in both the C1.8 and Δ1 mutants, FeCH activity was significantly higher than in WT (Fig. 5A). In the pseudorevertants, FeCH activity decreased dramatically below the WT level resulting in a 30- to 40-fold decrease in comparison to the C1.8 mutant (Fig. 5A). This indicates that both complementing mutations strongly inhibit FeCH activity. To determine whether the increase in FeCH activity observed in the Δ1 and C1.8 mutants is characteristic only of a mutation in this region of CP47, we also measured FeCH activity in other strains with impaired PSII assembly. In all PSII mutants tested, a significant increase in FeCH activity was observed, showing that up-regulation of FeCH activity is related to partly or completely destabilized PSII (Fig. 5B). To exclude the possibility that increased FeCH activity results from changes induced by photoheterotrophic metabolism in PSII mutants, FeCH activity was also measured in WT grown in the presence of a PSII inhibitor, DCMU. No significant increase in FeCH activity was observed under such conditions (Fig. 5B). In Vivo Inhibition of FeCH—To test whether decreased FeCH activity in the pseudorevertants is responsible for their photosynthetic phenotype, we used N-methylprotoporphyrin IX, which is a specific and potent inhibitor of FeCH (27De Matteis F. Gibbs A.H. Smith A.G. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10 μm N-methylprotoporphyrin IX in the growth medium, photoautotrophic growth of C1.8 dramatically improved (doubling time changed from 65 to 16 h), whereas growth of WT was slightly inhibited (see Supplemental Fig. S2). No growth was observed in the Δ1 strain, even when the concentration of the inhibitor was increased to 50 μm (not shown). To show that the improved photoautotrophic growth is due to increased PSII accumulation in the pseudorevertants, 77K fluorescence emission spectroscopy was used to monitor the accumulation of PSII in vivo. Upon Chl excitation at 435 nm, the presence of the 695-nm emission peak, which is characteristic of CP47 assembled into PSII, can be used to monitor the assembly of PSII core complexes (8Shen G. Vermaas W.F.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7379-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Absence of the 695-nm peak in the C1.8 strain corresponds to low levels of assembled PSII in this strain. After treatment of C1.8 with N-methylprotoporphyrin IX, significant 695-nm emission was observed (Fig. 6A). Moreover, appearance of the 695-nm emission peak was accompanied by increased oxygen-evolving capacity of the cells (Fig. 6B). The improved PSII activity was also accompanied by increased overall Chl accumulation in C1.8 cells (Fig. 6B). No changes in Chl accumulation were observed when 10 μm N-methylprotoporphyrin IX was added to the WT and Δ1 strains (not shown). These data show that the decreased FeCH activity in the C1.8 strain is necessary for PSII assembly and for the improved photoautotrophic growth. Chlorophyll and Heme Precursor Levels—To determine the effect of CP47 and FeCH mutations on the Chl/heme biosynthetic pathway, levels of Proto IX, Mg-proto IX monomethyl ester, PChlide, and protoheme were quantified in the WT, Δ1, and C1.8 mutants, and the two pseudorevertants were grown in normal light. The Δ1 and C1.8 mutations in CP47, which lead to the increased FeCH activity, caused about 5-fold decrease in the level of Proto IX, the last common intermediate of both Chl and heme biosynthesis, and ∼2-fold decrease of the Chl precursors Mg-proto IX monomethyl ester and PChlide (Fig. 7). In contrast, in the pseudorevertants with decreased FeCH activity, precursor levels increased above WT levels (∼3-fold increase in the level of Proto IX and ∼2-fold increase in the level of Chl precursors). These data demonstrate that the decrease in FeCH activity in pseudorevertants resulted in a significant increase in the Chl precursor levels. Unexpectedly, drastic changes in FeCH activity had no effect on protoheme accumulation (Fig. 7). To determine whether the increased accumulation of Chl precursors in the pseudorevertants is sufficient to restore PSII assembly in C1.8, the formation of the 695-nm Chl emission peak was followed after supplementation with Mg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-proto IX), an early precursor of Chl. In C1.8 cultures supplemented with 200 μm Mg-proto IX for 2 days, the 695-nm peak became visible and was even more pronounced in cells supplemented with 400 μm Mg-proto IX (Fig. 6C). No such increase was detected in Δ1. No effect of Mg-proto IX on the FeCH activity was detected, suggesting that the improved PSII assembly is the direct effect of Mg-proto IX supplementation. The improved PSII assembly in the C1.8 mutant after Mg-proto IX supplementation was further confirmed by measurement of variable fluorescence of Chl (Fv), which is specific for photochemically active PSII. In untreated C1.8 cells, Fv reached only ∼20% of that in WT (Fig. 6D), which is in agreement with the expected PSII accumulation in this strain. After 48-h incubation in 400 μm Mg-proto IX, Fv in C1.8 significantly increased, indicating a higher accumulation of PSII. No fluorescence induction was found in the Δ1 mutant (not shown). Deletion of the Δ1 Region of CP47 Protein Disrupts Its Expression and Is Responsible for the Photosensitivity of the Mutant—The Chl-binding protein CP47 possesses six transmembrane domains with a large lumenal loop joining helices 5 and 6 (Fig. 1). The function of this loop has been extensively probed by partial deletions in which domains consisting of several amino acid residues have been removed (reviewed in Ref. 28Bricker T.M. Frankel L.K. Photosyn. Res. 2002; 72: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Deletion of four amino acid residues in the Δ1 domain resulted in a non-photoautotrophic phenotype (17Haag E. Eaton-Rye J.J. Renger G. Vermaas W.F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the complete loss of CP47 protein from thylakoid membranes (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the phenotype of the Δ1 deletion mutant was different from that of the ΔCP47 mutant lacking most of the psbB gene (29Eaton-R"
https://openalex.org/W2108588969,"The purpose of this study was to use the microarray technology to define expression profiles characteristic of thyroid autonomous adenomas and relate these findings to physiological mechanisms. Experiments were performed on a series of separated adenomas and their normal counterparts on Micromax cDNA microarrays covering 2400 genes (analysis I), and on a pool of adenomatous tissues and their corresponding normal counterparts using microarrays of 18,000 spots (analysis II). Results for genes present on the two arrays corroborated and several gene regulations previously determined by Northern blotting or microarrays in similar lesions were confirmed. Five overexpressed and 24 underexpressed genes were also confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in some of the samples used for microarray analysis, and in additional tumor specimens. Our results show: (1) a change in the cell populations of the tumor, with a marked decrease in lymphocytes and blood cells and an increase in endothelial cells. The latter increase would correspond to the establishment of a close relation between thyrocytes and endothelial cells and is related to increased N-cadherin expression. It explains the increased blood flow in the tumor; (2) a homogeneity of tumor samples correlating with their common physiopathological mechanism: the constitutive activation of the thyrotropin (TSH)/cAMP cascade; (3) a low proportion of regulated genes consistent with the concept of a minimal deviation tumor; (4) a higher expression of genes coding for specific functional proteins, consistent with the functional hyperactivity of the tumors; (5) an increase of phosphodiesterase gene expression which explains the relatively low cyclic AMP levels measured in these tumors; (6) an overexpression of antiapoptotic genes and underexpression of proapoptotic genes compatible with their low apoptosis rate; (7) an overexpression of N-cadherin and downregulation of caveolins, which casts doubt about the use of these expressions as markers for malignancy."
