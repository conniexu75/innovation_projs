https://openalex.org/W2130737480,"The identification of human broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting the hemagglutinin (HA) stem revitalized hopes of developing a universal influenza vaccine. Using a rational design and library approach, we engineered stable HA stem antigens (""mini-HAs"") based on an H1 subtype sequence. Our most advanced candidate exhibits structural and bnAb binding properties comparable to those of full-length HA, completely protects mice in lethal heterologous and heterosubtypic challenge models, and reduces fever after sublethal challenge in cynomolgus monkeys. Antibodies elicited by this mini-HA in mice and nonhuman primates bound a wide range of HAs, competed with human bnAbs for HA stem binding, neutralized H5N1 viruses, and mediated antibody-dependent effector activity. These results represent a proof of concept for the design of HA stem mimics that elicit bnAbs against influenza A group 1 viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1143127356,"Human calprotectin (CP) is a metal-chelating antimicrobial protein of the innate immune response. The current working model states that CP sequesters manganese and zinc from pathogens. We report the discovery that CP chelates iron and deprives bacteria of this essential nutrient. Elemental analysis of CP-treated growth medium establishes that CP reduces the concentrations of manganese, iron and zinc. Microbial growth studies reveal that iron depletion by CP contributes to the growth inhibition of bacterial pathogens. Biochemical investigations demonstrate that CP coordinates Fe(II) at an unusual hexahistidine motif, and the Mössbauer spectrum of (57)Fe(II)-bound CP is consistent with coordination of high-spin Fe(II) at this site (δ = 1.20 mm/s, ΔEQ = 1.78 mm/s). In the presence of Ca(II), CP turns on its iron-sequestering function and exhibits subpicomolar affinity for Fe(II). Our findings expand the biological coordination chemistry of iron and support a previously unappreciated role for CP in mammalian iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1920917137,"This longitudinal research examined the directions of the relationships between job burnout and secondary traumatic stress (STS) among human services workers. In particular, using cross-lagged panel design, we investigated whether job burnout predicts STS at 6-month follow up or whether the level of STS symptoms explains job burnout at 6-month follow-up. Participants in Study 1 were behavioral or mental healthcare providers (N = 135) working with U.S. military personnel suffering from trauma. Participants in Study 2 were healthcare providers, social workers, and other human services professions (N = 194) providing various types of services for civilian trauma survivors in Poland. The cross-lagged analyses showed consistent results for both longitudinal studies; job burnout measured at Time 1 led to STS at Time 2, but STS assessed at Time 1 did not lead to job burnout at Time 2. These results contribute to a discussion on the origins of STS and job burnout among human services personnel working in highly demanding context of work-related secondary exposure to traumatic events and confirm that job burnout contributes to the development of STS."
https://openalex.org/W1928049461,"Emerging evidence suggests that there is interplay between the frequency and circadian timing of eating and metabolic health. We examined the associations of eating frequency and timing with metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers putatively associated with breast cancer risk in women participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination 2009–2010 Survey. Eating frequency and timing variables were calculated from 24-hour food records and included (1) proportion of calories consumed in the evening (5pm-midnight), (2) number of eating episodes per day, and (3) nighttime fasting duration. Linear regression models examined each eating frequency and timing exposure variable with C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Each 10 percent increase in the proportion of calories consumed in the evening was associated with a 3 percent increase in CRP. Conversely, eating one additional meal or snack per day was associated with an 8 percent reduction in CRP. There was a significant interaction between proportion of calories consumed in the evening and fasting duration with CRP (p = 0.02). A longer nighttime fasting duration was associated with an 8 percent lower CRP only among women who ate less than 30% of their total daily calories in the evening (p = 0.01). None of the eating frequency and timing variables were significantly associated with HOMA-IR. These findings suggest that eating more frequently, reducing evening energy intake, and fasting for longer nightly intervals may lower systemic inflammation and subsequently reduce breast cancer risk. Randomized trials are needed to validate these associations."
https://openalex.org/W1828503213,"In both physiological and cell culture systems, EGF-stimulated ERK activity occurs in discrete pulses within individual cells. Many feedback loops are present in the EGF receptor (EGFR)-ERK network, but the mechanisms driving pulsatile ERK kinetics are unknown. Here, we find that in cells that respond to EGF with frequency-modulated pulsatile ERK activity, stimulation through a heterologous TrkA receptor system results in non-pulsatile, amplitude-modulated activation of ERK. We further dissect the kinetics of pulse activity using a combination of FRET- and translocation-based reporters and find that EGFR activity is required to maintain ERK activity throughout the 10–20-minute lifetime of pulses. Together, these data indicate that feedbacks operating within the core Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade are insufficient to drive discrete pulses of ERK activity and instead implicate mechanisms acting at the level of EGFR.

We have speculated that insertion of the caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD), a conserved amphipathic region implicated in interactions with signaling proteins, is crucial for caveola formation. We now define the core membrane-juxtaposed region of Cav1 and show that the oligomerization domain and CSD are protected by tight association with the membrane in both mature mammalian caveolae and a model prokaryotic system for caveola biogenesis. Cryoelectron tomography reveals the core membrane-juxtaposed domain to be sufficient to maintain oligomerization as defined by polyhedral distortion of the caveolar membrane. Through mutagenesis we demonstrate the importance of the membrane association of the oligomerization domain/CSD for defined caveola biogenesis and furthermore, highlight the functional significance of the intramembrane domain and the CSD for defined caveolin-induced membrane deformation. Finally, we define the core structural domain of Cav1, constituting only 66 amino acids and of great potential to nanoengineering applications, which is required for caveolin-induced vesicle formation in a bacterial system.

The C terminus of Cav1 is composed of two separate domains, the intramembrane domain (IMD, amino acids 102–135) and the remaining residues (amino acids 136–178). It has been hypothesized that the C terminus functions in lipid association as truncations consisting of this region in Cav1 and Caveolin-3 (Cav3) were constitutively associated with intracellular lipid droplets (9Pol A.

The interaction between the scaffolding domain and a consensus sequence termed the caveolin binding motif (CBM, proposed to have the sequence ΩXΩXXXXΩ, ΩXXXXΩXXΩ, or ΩXΩXXXXΩXXΩ where Ω is an aromatic residue and X is any amino acid) has been hypothesized to regulate signaling via direct protein-protein-mediated sequestration of interacting proteins in an inactive state within caveolae (2Couet J.

However, a number of observations have questioned the likelihood of Cav1 regulating signaling in this manner. Most critically, many of the proposed CBMs appear unavailable for interaction with caveolin, often comprising the highly hydrophobic core structural backbone of the proposed binding protein (28Byrne D.P.

Finally, the constitutive and irreversible association of signaling proteins with the caveolin CSD does not explain how reversible interactions with signaling proteins can occur. The availability of the CSD for interaction with CBMs has received less attention yet remains another crucial aspect of the caveolin signaling hypothesis.

The intrinsic propensity for Cav1 to generate vesicles in a heterologous system underlies the basic function of the protein in the general cellular context. Cav1, like many other proteins in the mammalian cell, is involved in sculpting cellular membranes although how this deformation is achieved remains poorly understood (34Stachowiak J.C. Brodsky F.M. Miller E.A. A cost-benefit analysis of the physical mechanisms of membrane curvature.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the current study we utilize this heterologous expression system and purified mammalian caveolae to analyze the insertion of Cav1 in the membrane, map the exact amino acids tightly associated with the membrane, and analyze the effects of deletions on h-caveola formation and structural regulation. We define the minimal domain of Cav1 required for h-caveola formation in bacteria and show that, remarkably, uniform vesicle formation can occur upon the expression of less than 100 amino acids. E. coli (Rosetta pLysS DE3) were grown at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 1 in Terrific Broth. Caveolin fusion protein constructs, under the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Astral Scientific) to express for either 3 h (for EM) or overnight at 30 °C (for purification). E. coli were lysed using a Cell Disruptor (Constant Systems) and h-caveolae were purified using affinity chromatography with amylose resin (New England Biolabs), eluted with maltose (100 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and concentrated with 100,000 MWCO Amicon Ultracel Centifugal Filter (Millipore). The MBP-CAV1-His6 fusion protein was engineered with two tobacco etch virus protease cleavage sites between the maltose-binding protein (MBP) and CAV1. Purified h-caveolae were incubated with AcTEV (Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight to remove the MBP affinity tag. Purified h-caveolae were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2 m DTT, 2.5% SDS, and 1% bromphenol blue) and proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide). Gel staining was performed with Coomassie stain (0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, 40% methanol, and 10% acetic acid in water). Western blots were blocked in 5% milk powder dissolved in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST, pH 7.4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and incubated with various antibodies (MBP, New England Biolabs; polyclonal caveolin, BD Transduction Labs, VIPN (30Monier S.

Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells stably expressing GFP or GFP-Cavin-1 were scraped at 4 °C in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA), syringe lysed, and spun at high speed (100,000 × g) in an ultracentifuge. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in TNE buffer and incubated with MBP-tagged GFP-trap. GFP/GFP-Cavin1·GFP-trap complex was bound to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) by the MBP tag. The MBP-bound protein complex was washed repeatedly with high salt PBS and GFP/GFP-Cavin-1 protein was eluted with maltose and concentrated in 100,000 MWCO Amicon Ultracel Centrifugal Filters (Millipore). ProK treatment was performed as described previously, however, 0.5% SDS for 30 min at 37 °C was utilized for detergent treatment as caveolae are resistant to disruption by Triton X-100. E. coli extracted lipids (Avanti) in chloroform (Sigma) were deposited on the sides of a round-bottom flask by evaporating the organic solvent under a nitrogen atmosphere. To ensure the complete removal of chloroform, a formed lipid layer was stored overnight under vacuum. Dried lipids were then hydrated with an aqueous buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) at a concentration 1 mg/ml. To prepare 50-nm liposomes, a mini-extruder block (Avanti) was heated to 65 °C. Liposomes were extruded 21 times through 50-nm polycarbonate filters (Avanti) and plunge frozen immediately after preparation. Protein bands were excised and destained in 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm NH4HCO3, reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide, adjusted to pH 8 with 50 mm NH4HCO3, dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile, and dried with a SpeedVac. The dried gel pieces were rehydrated and incubated overnight with 0.2 μg of trypsin per gel band (in 10% acetonitrile, 50 mm NH4HCO3). The digest was terminated with 5% formic acid and peptides were extracted with a solution of 60% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid. The extracted peptides were dried and resuspended in 5% formic acid for mass spectrometric analysis. Tryptic peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using an Agilent 6520 QTOF coupled with a Chip CUBE and 1200 HPLC. The nano pump flow was set at 0.3 μl/min and the capillary pump flow at 4 μl/min. The HPLC-chip contained a 160-nl C18 trapping column, and a 150-mm C18 resolving column (Agilent G4240–62010). Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid and buffer B was 0.1% formic acid in 90% acetonitrile. The samples were analyzed with a 50-min LC gradient, which increased from 5 to 50% Buffer B in 45 min, increased up to 95% Buffer B in 1 min, was held at 95% Buffer B for 3 min, and then was returned to 10% buffer B in 1 min. The mass spectrometer was programmed to acquire 8 precursor MS1 spectra and 4 MS/MS spectra per second. Dynamic exclusion was applied after 2 spectra and released within 0.25 min. LC-MS/MS raw data generated was processed with Agilent's Spectrum Mill. Data were extracted with carbamidomethylated cysteine as fixed modifications. The data were searched against the species Canis familiaris of the SwissProt database, with carbamidomethylated cysteine as fixed modification, a maximum missed cleavage of 2, precursor mass tolerance of ±20, and product mass tolerance of ±50. Results were filtered by protein score of >11.0, peptide score of >10, and % Scored Peak Intensity of >60. Negative staining and immunolabeling of purified h-caveolae, caveolae, and bacteria expressing different caveolin truncations were performed as previously described (32Walser P.J. Ariotti N. Howes M.

Agave produces high yields of energy-rich biomass, and the sugar-rich stem tissue has traditionally been used to make alcoholic beverages. Here, the compositions of Agave americana and Agave tequilana leaves are determined, particularly in the context of bioethanol production. Agave leaf cell wall polysaccharide content was characterized by linkage analysis, non-cellulosic polysaccharides such as pectins were observed by immuno-microscopy, and leaf juice composition was determined by liquid chromatography. Agave leaves are fruit-like--rich in moisture, soluble sugars and pectin. The dry leaf fiber was composed of crystalline cellulose (47-50% w/w) and non-cellulosic polysaccharides (16-22% w/w), and whole leaves were low in lignin (9-13% w/w). Of the dry mass of whole Agave leaves, 85-95% consisted of soluble sugars, cellulose, non-cellulosic polysaccharides, lignin, acetate, protein and minerals. Juice pressed from the Agave leaves accounted for 69% of the fresh weight and was rich in glucose and fructose. Hydrolysis of the fructan oligosaccharides doubled the amount of fermentable fructose in A. tequilana leaf juice samples and the concentration of fermentable hexose sugars was 41-48 g/L. In agricultural production systems such as the tequila making, Agave leaves are discarded as waste. Theoretically, up to 4000 L/ha/yr of bioethanol could be produced from juice extracted from waste Agave leaves. Using standard Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains to ferment Agave juice, we observed ethanol yields that were 66% of the theoretical yields. These data indicate that Agave could rival currently used bioethanol feedstocks, particularly if the fermentation organisms and conditions were adapted to suit Agave leaf composition."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 3The abbreviations used are: miRNAmicroRNAmiRNPmicro-ribonucleoproteinmiRmiRNAERendoplasmic reticulumrERrough ERMVBmultivesicular bodyRISCRNA-induced silencing complexRT-qPCRRT-quantitative PCRTGthapsigarginmutmutant. are ∼22-nucleotide-long RNAs that base-pair with the 3′-UTR of mRNAs of target genes and play an important role in gene regulation in animal and plant cells (1Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar). miRNAs associate to a specific class of proteins known as Argonaute to form miRNPs that bind the targets to induce miRNA-mediated repression in animal cells (2Hutvagner G. Simard M.J. Argonaute proteins: key players in RNA silencing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Translation of an mRNA involves different factors that are engaged in the recruitment process of ribosomal subunits and to ensure the correct initiation of protein synthesis. There are increasing evidences that miRNAs interfere with the translation initiation process (3Pillai R.S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Artus C.G. Zoller T. Cougot N. Basyuk E. Bertrand E. Filipowicz W.

However, whether translation of target messages is a prerequisite for miRNA-mediated inhibition is an unanswered question. microRNA micro-ribonucleoprotein miRNA endoplasmic reticulum rough ER multivesicular body RNA-induced silencing complex RT-quantitative PCR thapsigargin mutant. In the classical view, soluble proteins are preferentially synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes, whereas secretory and membrane integral proteins are translated on ER-bound ribosomes. Recent investigations, however, suggest that membrane-bound ribosomes can also participate in synthesis of soluble cytosolic proteins (5Lerner R.S. Seiser R.M. Zheng T. Lager P.J. Reedy M.C. Keene J.D. Nicchitta C.V. Partitioning and translation of mRNAs encoding soluble proteins on membrane-bound ribosomes.RNA. 2003; 9: 1123-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). De novo translation initiation on ER-bound ribosomes serves as a mechanism for localizing cytosolic protein-encoding mRNAs to the ER (6Jagannathan S. Reid D.W. Cox A.H. Nicchitta C.V. De novo translation initiation on membrane-bound ribosomes as a mechanism for localization of cytosolic protein mRNAs to the endoplasmic reticulum.RNA. 2014; 20: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Abundant research has already been done to understand the underlying mechanism involved in miRNA-mediated gene regulation. However, few studies have been able to identify the subcellular site where this process can take place. RNA processing bodies or P-bodies are cytoplasmic RNA granules that play a role in mRNA degradation and storage. Earlier evidences indicate localization of miRNA target messages along with the Ago2 and the cognate miRNAs to P-bodies in mammalian cells (3Pillai R.S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Artus C.G. Zoller T. Cougot N. Basyuk E. Bertrand E. Filipowicz W.

MicroRNA-dependent localization of targeted mRNAs to mammalian P-bodies.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Recently, the role of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), organelles that control cellular miRNP trafficking, in miRNA-mediated repression process has also been reported (8Gibbings D.J. Ciaudo C. Erhardt M. Voinnet O. Multivesicular bodies associate with components of miRNA effector complexes and modulate miRNA activity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Apart from that, some evidence might be indicative of a possible role of membranous structure in miRNA function. Most miRNAs have been found to co-sediment with polyribosomes, which could be a consequence of miRNA targeting to actively translating mRNAs (9Maroney P.A. Yu Y. Fisher J. Nilsen T.W. Evidence that microRNAs are associated with translating messenger RNAs in human cells.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Not only the miRNAs but also the Ago2 are associated with the actively translating polyribosomes (10Nottrott S. Simard M.J. Richter J.D. Human let-7a miRNA blocks protein production on actively translating polyribosomes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 11Ghosh S. Bose M. Ray A.

Cell. 2015; 26: 1072-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Two recent studies suggested ER as the site of miRNA-mediated translation repression. In Arabidopsis, miRNA-mediated translation inhibition, but not mRNA cleavage, requires AMP1, an ER integral membrane protein what interacts with Argonaute1 (12Li S. Liu L. Zhuang X. Yu Y. Liu X.

Another group has identified rough ER (rER) membrane as the central nucleation site of miRNA/siRNA loading to Ago2 proteins. They also reported that components of the RISC loading complex (RLC) co-sediment with rER membranes and identified TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) and protein kinase RNA activator (PACT) as key factors that anchor RISC to ER membranes in an RNA-independent manner (13Stalder L. Heusermann W. Sokol L. Trojer D. Wirz J. Hean J. Fritzsche A. Aeschimann F. Pfanzagl V. Basselet P. Weiler J. Hintersteiner M. Morrissey D.V. Meisner-Kober N.C. The rough endoplasmatic reticulum is a central nucleation site of siRNA-mediated RNA silencing.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this study, we report preferential attachment of mRNAs having miRNA binding sites to the ER membrane. After de novo synthesis, the target messages get localized to the ER membrane and more specifically to the ER-bound polysomes. Here it becomes associated with the Argonaute proteins and miRNAs. Detail time course experiments have revealed that polysome localization of target messages followed by Ago2 miRNP binding on the ER membrane occurs before the miRNA-mediated translation repression sets in. HEK293 and Huh7 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated FCS. RAW264.7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium. All cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies. All plasmid transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) using the manufacturer's protocol. For siRNA transfection, RNAiMAX was used. Ribosomal protein S3- and calnexin-specific antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-Ago2 antibody was from Abnova; anti-HA antibody was from Roche Applied Science; GAPDH- and β-actin-specific antibodies were from Sigma. RL-con, RL-3×bulge-let7a, and RL-3×bulge-miR-122 plasmids were kind gifts from Prof. Witold Filipowicz. Fragments encoding HMGA2 3′-UTR/HMGA2 3′-UTR mut were cloned in the XbaI and NotI sites of RL-con plasmids to get RL-HMGA2 3′-UTR/RL-HMGA2 3′-UTR mut plasmids. Tet-on advanced plasmids were from Clontech. The fragment encoding RL-3×bulge-miR-122 was re-cloned in the NheI and NotI sites of the pTRE-tight-BI vector from Clontech to get the iRL-3×bulge-miR-122 plasmid. For experiments using tetracycline-inducible constructs, induction was done using 300 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma). Treatment with thapsigargin (Sigma) was done overnight. Expression of the HA- and N-HA-tagged versions of Ago proteins was achieved by transfecting cells with the desired plasmids obtained either from Prof. Witold Filipowicz or from Prof. Gunter Meister. SiRNA against the 3′-UTR of Ago2 was obtained from Eurogentec. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). Northern blotting of total cellular RNA (5–10 μg) was performed as described by Pillai et al. (3Pillai R.S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Artus C.G. Zoller T. Cougot N. Basyuk E. Bertrand E. Filipowicz W.

For detection, γ-32P-labeled 22-nucleotide miRCURY complementary LNA probes for let-7a (Exiqon) or complementary DNA probes for U6 snRNA were used. Phosphorimaging of the blots was performed in the Cyclone Plus storage phosphor system (PerkinElmer), and the Quant One software was used for quantification. For mRNA quantification, cDNA were prepared using random nonamers (Eurogentec reverse transcriptase core kit), and PCR was performed with gene-specific primers using the MESA GREEN qPCR Master Mix Plus (Eurogentec) following the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitation of tagged AGO2 was done as per published protocols (14Bhattacharyya S.N. Habermacher R. Martine U. Closs E.I. Filipowicz W.

Briefly, cell homogenate obtained with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate was cleared by centrifugation before being used for immunoprecipitation using the specific antibodies bound to protein G-agarose beads. For digitonin fractionation, 1 × 106 cells were lysed in the digitonin lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (Sigma), 1 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science), and 50 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem)) for 10 min on ice. The membrane fraction was collected by spinning at 2,500 × g for 5 min followed by washing the membrane pellet with the same lysis buffer without digitonin. RNA isolation from the each fractions was done using acidic phenol:chloroform (5:1) or TRIzol LS (Invitrogen). For microsome isolation, HEK293 cells were resuspended in 1× hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm KCl) equivalent to three times the packed cell volume and incubated for 20 min on ice. The cells were spun down and resuspended in 1× isotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm KCl, and 250 mm sucrose) twice the packed cell volume and homogenized. The cell lysate was precleared at 1,000 × g for 10 min, followed by a 12,000 × g spin for 10 min to remove the mitochondrial fraction. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was incubated for 15–20 min with 8 mm CaCl2, followed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the microsomal pellet (16Hamilton R.L. Moorehouse A.

The extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the ribosomal fraction as supernatants and the non-ribosomal membrane fraction as pellet as described (17Schenkman J.B. Cinti D.L.

Cell fractionation using OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation and total polysome isolation were carried out as described previously (19Mazumder A. Bose M. Chakraborty A. Chakrabarti S. Bhattacharyya S.N. A transient reversal of miRNA-mediated repression controls macrophage activation.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All graphs and statistical analyses were done in GraphPad Prism 5.00 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Nonparametric paired t test was used for analysis, and p values were determined. Error bars indicate mean ± S.E. We wanted to identify the cytoplasmic compartments with which miRNAs, Ago proteins, and target messages are associated with in mammalian cells. To do so, we treated HEK293 human cells with digitonin, a detergent that, when used at a lower concentration, preferentially permeabilizes plasma membranes with higher cholesterol contents while leaving low cholesterol-containing internal organelles intact. Digitonin treatment of HEK293 cells yielded a detergent-insoluble ER marker protein GRP78-positive membrane fraction, and a β-actin-positive cytoplasmic fraction. We found enrichment of Ago2 in the digitonin-insoluble membrane fraction (Fig. 1A). As an alternative approach, we have isolated rER from isotonic lysates of HEK293 cells. The isolated rER was positive for the ER marker calnexin and negative for MVBs and the late endosomal marker Alix. The isolated rER or microsomes were found to be enriched for both Ago2 and miRNA (Fig. 1B). To confirm the association of miRNA and Ago2 protein with rER and associated structures, we fractionated isotonic HEK293 cell lysates on a 3–30% OptiPrep gradient and analyzed the individual fractions. We observed that the majority of Ago2 and let-7a miRNA accumulated with the ER-positive fractions (Fig. 1C). With isolated RNAs, we detected that enhanced accumulation of let-7a repressed target message RL-3×bulge-let-7a with rER (Fig. 1, D and E). Individually tested, two different let-7a reporter mRNAs also showed significant enhancement in their association with the rER and digitonin-insoluble membrane fractions (Fig. 1, E and F). We also found that almost 71% of the total mRNA transcripts were ER-bound for let-7a target message when only 29% of total non-target mRNAs are ER-attached. More than 38% of let-7a miRNAs are rER-attached. miRNA dependence of target message accumulation on rER in the steady state was confirmed in cells inactivated for let-7a where the corresponding target message failed to accumulate on rER (Fig. 1E). This phenomenon is not HEK293- or let-7a miRNA-specific, and we documented a similar observation for a let-7a reporter in RAW264.7 mouse monocyte/macrophage cells and also for an miR-122 reporter in Huh7 cells expressing miR-122 (Fig. 1, G–I). The Ago2 dependence of the phenomenon was noted when depletion of the cellular Ago2 level caused decreased association of miRNA targets with rER in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1H). With ectopic expression of miR-122 in HEK293 cells, we could also document membrane association of two endogenous miR-122 targets, aldolase and CAT-1 mRNAs, in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1J). Therefore, both miRNPs and their targets could accumulate on rER in mammalian cells. The ER association of target message is dependent on ER function. Thapsigargin (TG), an inducer of ER stress, has been shown previously to affect protein translation (20Wong W.L. Brostrom M.A. Kuznetsov G. Gmitter-Yellen D. Brostrom C.O. Inhibition of protein synthesis and early protein processing by thapsigargin in cultured cells.Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we documented a gross reduction in association of miRNA-targeted messages with rER upon application of TG, although no major effect was seen on the total cellular content of target mRNAs (Fig. 1K). Importantly, our results also showed the compromised binding of mRNA with Ago2. (Fig. 1L). To identify and characterize the rER-associated miRNPs and target messages, we treated rER with KCl and puromycin to extract the polysomes associated with rER. Upon treatment, we found the majority of miRNA, Ago2, and target messages, along with ribosomal components, in the supernatant (Fig. 2, A–C). Polysome association of the miRNA and Ago2 on rER was further validated when the extract of rER was analyzed on a 15–55% sucrose density where a large fraction of Ago2 and the majority of let-7a were found to be with the polysomal fraction (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the let-7a targets also showed enhanced accumulation in the rER-attached polysomes in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2E). From the observations documented in the previous section, association of target messages along with Ago2 on the ER-bound ribosomes was evident. To investigate whether ER targeting is a prerequisite for miRNA-mediated repression, we generated a tetracycline-induced expression system where expression of RL-3×bulge-miR-122, an miR-122 reporter mRNA, is dependent on doxycycline (Fig. 3A). As expected, upon application of the drug, we found a sharp increase of reporter mRNA level with time in the total cell lysates of HEK293 cells. Interestingly, on the ER membrane, de novo formed RL-3×bulge-miR-122 also accumulates against time (Fig. 3B). Targeting of RL reporter to rER was much faster in HEK293 cells in the presence of miR-122. However, Ago2 binding kinetics of miR-122 in the inducible expression system was much faster for pools of Ago2 associated with rER as compared with its binding rate with total Ago2 (Fig. 3, C and D). Other Ago proteins also showed time-dependent increase in association with de novo synthesized target messages on rER membranes (Fig. 3D). Does this indicate that de novo formed ER-bound target messages are already repressed? To answer this, we measured the expression level of the RL-3×bulge-miR-122 reporter against time in the presence and absence of miR-122 and found translation repression only after 8 h when targeting and binding of mRNA to ER-attached Ago2/miRNPs have already occurred (Fig. 3E). Therefore, Ago2 binding of de novo synthesized mRNAs on the ER precedes the miRNA-mediated repression process in mammalian cells. In the steady state, we found enrichment of induced mRNA within the ribosomal pool associated with rER (Fig. 3F). Do de novo formed target messages attach to the ribosomal pool of the ER membrane even before Ago2 or miRNA interaction? To determine that, we measured the level of RL-3×bulge-miR-122 associated with polysomes after induction and found rapid association of this level with the ribosomal pool of ER within 4 h, which was much faster than what we observed with cytoplasmic polysomes (Fig. 3G). To find out the sequence of events, we measured the induced RL-3×bulge-miR-122 level within a short time window after the induction of its transcription and found, within 4 h, a visible enrichment of this mRNA on polysomes. However, during the same time, we did not find any significant increase in its interaction with the Ago2 (Fig. 3H). Taken together our data suggest the targeting of an mRNA bearing an miRNA binding site on its 3′-UTR to the ER membrane-bound polysomes after its synthesis and before its interaction with Ago2 and repression. Our observation thus has helped to elucidate the exact sequence of this de novo target message localization to the subcellular compartments before repression. These data revealed that the polysome localization was the initial event for a de novo formed target mRNA. Ago2 protein binding on the ER membrane would be the next event, followed by the miRNA-driven repression of the target messages. It was predicted and shown earlier that translation repression by miRNA happens at the translation initiation step, followed by the degradation of the miRNA-targeted mRNAs in mammalian cells (21Djuranovic S. Nahvi A. Green R. miRNA-mediated gene silencing by translational repression followed by mRNA deadenylation and decay.Science. 2012; 336: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 22Béthune J. Artus-Revel C.G. Filipowicz W. Kinetic analysis reveals successive steps leading to miRNA-mediated silencing in mammalian cells.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, the exact sequence of events in the miRNA-mediated repression process was not known. Here we have documented that in human cells, miRNA target messages are getting enriched on the ER membrane, along with Ago2 and cognate miRNAs. The ER membrane acts as the site where a de novo synthesized target mRNA becomes associated with miRNA and Ago2 proteins. These target messages are preferentially co-extracted with the membrane-attached ribosomes. We also showed evidence that de novo formed target mRNAs destined to bind to membrane bound to the polysomes first, followed by Ago2/miRNP association on the ER membrane and repression. Our study recognized the ER membrane as the primary site of target mRNA binding with Ago2 proteins. Conventionally, the ER is the established site for translation of mRNA-encoding membrane-bound or secretory proteins. These mRNAs are recruited to the ER via a signal recognition particle in a translation-dependent manner. However, many studies report the puzzling observations that soluble cytosolic proteins are translated on membrane-bound ribosomes and that soluble protein-coding mRNA visits ER in a signal sequence- and translation-independent manner (5Lerner R.S. Seiser R.M. Zheng T. Lager P.J. Reedy M.C. Keene J.D. Nicchitta C.V.

Keene J.D. Reedy M.C. Nicchitta C.V. Signal sequence- and translation-independent mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum.RNA. 2008; 14: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A few other studies have proposed that the ER membrane acts as the site of translation regulation. Most miRNAs are associated with actively translating mRNAs and co-sedimented with polyribosomes (9Maroney P.A. Yu Y. Fisher J. Nilsen T.W. Evidence that microRNAs are associated with translating messenger RNAs in human cells.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Ago2 also co-sediments with polyribosomes (10Nottrott S. Simard M.J. Richter J.D. Human let-7a miRNA blocks protein production on actively translating polyribosomes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In our study, we ascertained that the ER membrane acts as the site of target message assembly. Target mRNA localization to the membrane-bound polysome initializes the sequence, which is followed by Ago2 binding on ER membrane. Target mRNA binding with ER-bound Ago2 leads to translation repression as an ultimate event on the membrane. Additionally, we have been able to conclusively show that translation of mRNA is the default step that precedes miRNA-mediated repression. This is useful information toward understanding the mechanism of miRNA-mediated gene regulation in mammalian cells. The advantage of compartmentalization of the repression process is not apparent, but it could ensure rapid shuttling of the messages to the storage- or degradation-specific compartments in successive steps in mammalian cells.

In efforts that aim to mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress on crops, a variety of genetic tools are being used to develop plants with improved thermotolerance. The characterization of important regulators of heat stress tolerance provides essential information for this aim. In this study, we examine the wheat (Triticum aestivum) NAC transcription factor gene TaNAC2L. High temperature induced TaNAC2L expression in wheat and overexpression of TaNAC2L in Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced acquired heat tolerance without causing obvious alterations in phenotype compared with wild type under normal conditions. TaNAC2L overexpression also activated the expression of heat-related genes in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants, suggesting that TaNAC2L may improve heat tolerance by regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes. Notably, TaNAC2L is also regulated at the post-translational level and might be degraded via a proteasome-mediated pathway. Thus, this wheat transcription factor may have potential uses in enhancing thermotolerance in crops."
https://openalex.org/W1121061885,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) is a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair, chromatin remodeling and gene expression. PARP1 interactions with chromatin architectural multi-protein complexes (i.e. nucleosomes) alter chromatin structure resulting in changes in gene expression. Chromatin structure impacts gene regulatory processes including transcription, splicing, DNA repair, replication and recombination. It is important to delineate whether PARP1 randomly associates with nucleosomes or is present at specific nucleosome regions throughout the cell genome. We performed genome-wide association studies in breast cancer cell lines to address these questions. Our studies show that PARP1 associates with epigenetic regulatory elements genome-wide, such as active histone marks, CTCF and DNase hypersensitive sites. Additionally, the binding of PARP1 to chromatin genome-wide is mutually exclusive with DNA methylation pattern suggesting a functional interplay between PARP1 and DNA methylation. Indeed, inhibition of PARylation results in genome-wide changes in DNA methylation patterns. Our results suggest that PARP1 controls the fidelity of gene transcription and marks actively transcribed gene regions by selectively binding to transcriptionally active chromatin. These studies provide a platform for developing our understanding of PARP1’s role in gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1950527675,"The aim of this study was to determine the optimal route of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation. To this end, gene expression profiling was performed to compare the effects of intratracheal (IT) versus intravenous (IV) MSC administration. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of each route to protect against neonatal hyperoxic lung injury was also determined. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to hyperoxia (90% oxygen) from birth for 14 days. Human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs labeling with PKH26 were transplanted through either the IT (5×105) or IV (2×106) route at postnatal day (P) 5. At P14, lungs were harvested for histological, biochemical and microarray analyses. Hyperoxic conditions induced an increase in the mean linear intercept and mean alveolar volume (MAV), indicative of impaired alveolarization. The number of ED-1 positive cells was significantly decreased by both IT and IV transplantations. However, IT administration of MSCs resulted in a greater decrease in MAV and ED-1 positive cells compared to IV administration. Moreover, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly decreased in the IT group, but not in the IV group. Although the IT group received only one fourth of the number of MSCs that the IV group did, a significantly higher number of donor cell-derived red PKH 26 positivity were recovered in the IT group. Hyperoxic conditions induced the up regulation of genes associated with the inflammatory response, such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1 α, tumor necrosis factor-α and inter leukin-6; genes associated with cell death, such as p53 and caspases; and genes associated with fibrosis, such as connective tissue growth factor. In contrast, hyperoxic conditions induced the dwon-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor. These hyperoxia-induced changes in gene expression were decreased in the IT group, but not in the IV group. Thus, local IT MSC transplantation was more effective than systemic IV MSC administration in protecting against neonatal hyperoxic lung injury."

Using specimens from 41 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we studied the factors that might contribute to clinical response or resistance. For this purpose, thawed aliquots of primary AML samples were immunophenotypically characterized and subjected to various doses of AMG 330 in the presence or absence of healthy donor T-cells. After 48 hours, drug-specific cytotoxicity was quantified and correlated with CD33 expression levels, amounts of T-cells present, and other disease characteristics. AMG 330 caused modest cytotoxicity that was correlated with the amount of autologous T-cells (P = 0.0001) but not CD33 expression, as AMG 330 exerted marked cytotoxic effects in several specimens with minimal CD33 expression. With healthy donor T-cells added, AMG 330 cytotoxicity depended on the drug dose and effector:target (E:T) cell ratio. High cytotoxic activity was observed even with minimal CD33 expression, and AMG 330 cytotoxicity and CD33 expression correlated only at high E:T cell ratio and high AMG 330 doses (P<0.003). AMG 330 resulted in significantly higher cytotoxicity in specimens from patients with newly diagnosed AML than those with relapsed/refractory disease despite similar levels of CD33 on myeloblasts. AMG 330 cytotoxicity also appeared greater in specimens from patients with favorable-risk disease as compared to other specimens. Together, our data demonstrate that AMG 330 is highly active in primary AML specimens across the entire disease spectrum, while suggesting the presence of yet undefined, CD33-independent, relative resistance mechanisms in specific patient subsets."
https://openalex.org/W1798304585,"The final step of peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis in bacteria involves cross-linking of peptide side chains. This step in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is catalyzed by ld- and dd-transpeptidases that generate 3→3 and 4→3 transpeptide linkages, respectively. M. tuberculosis PG is predominantly 3→3 cross-linked, and LdtMt2 is the dominant ld-transpeptidase. There are four additional sequence paralogs of LdtMt2 encoded by the genome of this pathogen, and the reason for this apparent redundancy is unknown. Here, we studied one of the paralogs, LdtMt5, and found it to be structurally and functionally distinct. The structures of apo-LdtMt5 and its meropenem adduct presented here demonstrate that, despite overall architectural similarity to LdtMt2, the LdtMt5 active site has marked differences. The presence of a structurally divergent catalytic site and a proline-rich C-terminal subdomain suggest that this protein may have a distinct role in PG metabolism, perhaps involving other cell wall-anchored proteins. Furthermore, M. tuberculosis lacking a functional copy of LdtMt5 displayed aberrant growth and was more susceptible to killing by crystal violet, osmotic shock, and select carbapenem antibiotics. Therefore, we conclude that LdtMt5 is not a functionally redundant ld-transpeptidase, but rather it serves a unique and important role in maintaining the integrity of the M. tuberculosis cell wall."

https://openalex.org/W1662841919,"Few data are available about the regional or local extinction of tropical butterfly species. When confirmed, local extinction was often due to the loss of host-plant species. We used published lists and recent monitoring programs to evaluate changes in butterfly composition on Barro Colorado Island (BCI, Panama) between an old (1923-1943) and a recent (1993-2013) period. Although 601 butterfly species have been recorded from BCI during the 1923-2013 period, we estimate that 390 species are currently breeding on the island, including 34 cryptic species, currently only known by their DNA Barcode Index Number. Twenty-three butterfly species that were considered abundant during the old period could not be collected during the recent period, despite a much higher sampling effort in recent times. We consider these species locally extinct from BCI and they conservatively represent 6% of the estimated local pool of resident species. Extinct species represent distant phylogenetic branches and several families. The butterfly traits most likely to influence the probability of extinction were host growth form, wing size and host specificity, independently of the phylogenetic relationships among butterfly species. On BCI, most likely candidates for extinction were small hesperiids feeding on herbs (35% of extinct species). However, contrary to our working hypothesis, extinction of these species on BCI cannot be attributed to loss of host plants. In most cases these host plants remain extant, but they probably subsist at lower or more fragmented densities. Coupled with low dispersal power, this reduced availability of host plants has probably caused the local extinction of some butterfly species. Many more bird than butterfly species have been lost from BCI recently, confirming that small preserves may be far more effective at conserving invertebrates than vertebrates and, therefore, should not necessarily be neglected from a conservation viewpoint."
https://openalex.org/W1926390858,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a consequence of several physiological and pathophysiological conditions including muscle disuse, aging and diseases such as cancer and heart failure. In each of these conditions, the predominant mechanism contributing to the loss of skeletal muscle mass is increased protein turnover. Two important mechanisms which regulate protein stability and degradation are lysine acetylation and ubiquitination, respectively. However our understanding of the skeletal muscle proteins regulated through acetylation and ubiquitination during muscle atrophy is limited. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to conduct an unbiased assessment of the acetylation and ubiquitin-modified proteome in skeletal muscle during a physiological condition of muscle atrophy. To induce progressive, physiologically relevant, muscle atrophy, rats were cast immobilized for 0, 2, 4 or 6 days and muscles harvested. Acetylated and ubiquitinated peptides were identified via a peptide IP proteomic approach using an anti-acetyl lysine antibody or a ubiquitin remnant motif antibody followed by mass spectrometry. In control skeletal muscle we identified and mapped the acetylation of 1,326 lysine residues to 425 different proteins and the ubiquitination of 4,948 lysine residues to 1,131 different proteins. Of these proteins 43, 47 and 50 proteins were differentially acetylated and 183, 227 and 172 were differentially ubiquitinated following 2, 4 and 6 days of disuse, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis identified contractile proteins as being enriched among proteins decreased in acetylation and increased in ubiquitination, whereas histone proteins were enriched among proteins increased in acetylation and decreased in ubiquitination. These findings provide the first proteome-wide identification of skeletal muscle proteins exhibiting changes in lysine acetylation and ubiquitination during any atrophy condition, and provide a basis for future mechanistic studies into how the acetylation and ubiquitination status of these identified proteins regulates the muscle atrophy phenotype."

BALB/c mice were exposed to ETS generated from 3R4F reference research cigarettes (0.73 mg of nicotine/cigarette) from P3 to P14. Spatial reference and working memory were evaluated in the Morris water maze during infancy (P20-P29), adolescence (P37-P42) and adulthood (P67-P72). Synapsin, synaptophysin, PSD95 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were assessed at P15, P35 and P65 by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Mice that were exposed to ETS during the early postnatal period showed poorer performance in the spatial reference memory task. Specifically, the ETS-exposed mice exhibited a significantly reduced time and distance traveled in the target quadrant and in the platform location area than the controls at all ages evaluated. In the spatial working memory task, ETS disrupted the maintenance but not the acquisition of the critical spatial information in both infancy and adolescence. ETS also induced changes in synaptic components, including decreases in synapsin, synaptophysin, PSD95 and BDNF levels in the hippocampus. Exposure to ETS in the early postnatal period disrupts both spatial reference and working memory; these results may be related to changes in synaptogenesis in the hippocampus. Importantly, most of these effects were not reversed even after a long exposure-free period."

PEDF is a potential therapeutic agent for retinal degenerations, and further studies on its mechanism of action are fundamental to develop its therapeutic use. pigment epithelium-derived factor pigment epithelium-derived factor receptor ligand-binding domain nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid surface plasmon resonance postnatal day n. Although the fundamental mechanisms of action remain unclear, there is accumulated evidence that the modular nature of PEDF helps it to participate in multiple cellular functions (16Becerra S.P.

As a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily of serpins, the PEDF protein shares three-dimensional structural homology with other members. However, it does not have a demonstrable serine protease inhibitory activity and belongs to the subclass of noninhibitory serpins, e.g. ovalbumin and maspin (2Becerra S.P.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a serpin with potent anti-angiogenic and neurite outgrowth-promoting properties.Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1677-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The PEDF protein (50,000-Mr) is a monomeric glycoprotein with a homologous serpin reactive center loop toward its C-terminal end, which is distinct and separated from regions for neurotrophic and antiangiogenic activities and for collagen and glycosaminoglycan binding motifs (2Becerra S.P. Focus on Molecules: Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF).Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 82: 739-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is established that PEDF biological effects are independent of its protease inhibitory potential; however, they depend on interactions with receptors on the surface of target cells (16Becerra S.P. Notario V. The effects of PEDF on cancer biology: mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 258-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Structure-function relationship studies have revealed that a region toward the N terminus of the PEDF polypeptide (human amino acid positions 78–121) confers the neurotrophic properties to the molecule. Peptide 44-mer from the neurotrophic region has demonstrable neuronal differentiating activity on retinoblastoma Y-79 cells, as well as survival effects on spinal cord motor neurons, whereas peptide 34-mer from the antiangiogenic region (human position 44–77) does not exhibit neurotrophic activities (19Alberdi E.

We have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that govern the cytoprotective effects of PEDF and have identified PEDF-R protein as a receptor for PEDF. This novel protein encoded by PNPLA2 (patatin-like phospholipase domain containing family) is a membrane-linked lipase enzyme, which PEDF binding can stimulate (22Notari L. Baladron V. Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Balko N. Heredia R. Meyer C. Notario P.M. Saravanamuthu S. Nueda M.L. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Escribano J. Laborda J. Becerra S.P. Identification of a lipase-linked cell membrane receptor for pigment epithelium-derived factor.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38022-38037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes of retina cells contain PEDF-R, which has affinity for PEDF and is essential for cytoprotective activity of PEDF (23Subramanian P. Locatelli-Hoops S. Kenealey J. DesJardin J. Notari L. Becerra S.P. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) prevents retinal cell death via PEDF receptor (PEDF-R): identification of a functional ligand binding site.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23928-23942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have also mapped the ligand-binding domain (LBD) to an extracellular loop of the human PEDF-R (positions 203–232) and shown that peptides derived from this ectodomain act as soluble receptor fragments that block both PEDF/PEDF-R interactions and PEDF-mediating survival action (23Subramanian P. Locatelli-Hoops S. Kenealey J. DesJardin J. Notari L. Becerra S.P. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) prevents retinal cell death via PEDF receptor (PEDF-R): identification of a functional ligand binding site.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23928-23942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the region of PEDF that binds PEDF-R remains to be identified. Therefore, we hypothesized that the neurotrophic region of PEDF interacts with the LBD of PEDF-R to trigger the necessary downstream molecular cascades leading to cell survival. To test this proposition, we designed experiments to map the region of PEDF that interacts with PEDF-R to exert retinoprotective activity. The biological consequences of these interactions were examined in retina cells in culture and in photoreceptors of a mouse model of retina degeneration in vivo. The data support the pharmacotherapeutic potential of PEDF as a neuroprotectant in retinal degeneration. Recombinant human PEDF was expressed, purified, and conjugated with fluorescein using fluorescein-5-EX, succinimidyl ester as outlined previously (24Aymerich M.S. Alberdi E.M. Martínez A. Becerra S.P. Evidence for pigment epithelium-derived factor receptors in the neural retina.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3287-3293PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant PEDF-R with an N-terminal His6/Xpress tag was expressed in the Expressway in vitro transcription/translation system (Life Technologies Corp., Invitrogen), as described previously (22Notari L.

Human PEDF-R peptide P1 (Thr210–Leu249) and human PEDF peptides 34-mer (Asp44–Asn77) and 44-mer (Val78–Thr121) were synthesized as before (19Alberdi E. Aymerich M.S. Becerra S.P.

Mutant SERPINF1[R99A] and SERPINF1[H105A] were generated by targeting WT SERPINF1 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. WT and mutant SERPINF1 cDNA were cloned into p3XFLAG-CMVTM-9 expression vector (Sigma). The resulting expression vectors were transfected into BHK cells using Lipofectamine® 2000. After selection with 0.4 mg/ml neomycin, stably transfected cells were cycled between serum and serum-free media every 24 h. Conditioned serum-free media containing the recombinant proteins were harvested, concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and purified by a two-step ion-exchange column chromatography as described before (24Aymerich M.S.

The retina precursor cell line R28 is widely used and was originally derived from a rat retina at the age of 6 days infected with the psi2 E1A adenovirus and then cloned by limiting dilution (see Kerafast website). R28 cells (Gift from Gail Seigel, University of Buffalo) were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (23Subramanian P. Locatelli-Hoops S. Kenealey J. DesJardin J. Notari L. Becerra S.P. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) prevents retinal cell death via PEDF receptor (PEDF-R): identification of a functional ligand binding site.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23928-23942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cell passages 50–58 were used in experiments in this study. The P1 peptide folding was modeled using the ab initio fragment assembly protocol of Rosetta (25Rohl C.A. Strauss C.E. Misura K.M. Baker D. Protein structure prediction using Rosetta.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 66-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). One million decoys were generated, and the top 0.5% of models by Rosetta score was clustered using MaxCluster (26Siew N. Elofsson A. Rychlewski L. Fischer D. MaxSub: an automated measure for the assessment of protein structure prediction quality.Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The most representative models from the top five clusters by size were globally docked onto the native PEDF structure (Protein Data Bank code 1IMV, chain A) using both the docking protocol of Rosetta (27Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O. Kuhlman B. Rohl C.A. Baker D. Protein-protein docking with simultaneous optimization of rigid-body displacement and side-chain conformations.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) and clusPro (28Comeau S.R. Gatchell D.W. Vajda S. Camacho C.J. ClusPro: a fully automated algorithm for protein-protein docking.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W96-W99Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). For global docking with Rosetta, 10,000 docking models were generated and clustered, and the representative models for each of the top 10 clusters by score were kept, resulting in 50 possible docking models. Each of the 50 possible docking models was subjected to a local refinement docking run, wherein the ligand (P1 peptide) was randomly displaced from its original position and allowed to reposition itself using a least squares search. The hallmark of realistic docking is the so-called “funnel-shaped” plot of score versus distance from the original docking position (25Rohl C.A. Strauss C.E. Misura K.M. Baker D. Protein structure prediction using Rosetta.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 66-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar), and clear funnels were seen in only two of the local refinements. For global docking with clusPro, the 5 possible ab initio models gave a total of 60 possible docking models. Each of these docking models was subjected to the same local refinement docking procedure, and only one showed a clear funnel-shaped plot. Of the three docking models, one of the models generated using the all-Rosetta method and the one from clusPro show the same arrangement of P1 bound to the neurotrophic region of PEDF (positions 44–121). The models were visually inspected, and no unusual steric clashes and chemical bonding violations were seen. The modeling data were generated by an individual with no knowledge of the other data in this paper. A file with coordinates of the models is found at the National Institutes of Health Helix Systems website (supplemental data). To assess the secondary structure of peptide P1 CD was performed. Peptide P1 was diluted in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, and 0.05% Tween 20 to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The CD spectrum was scanned from 190 to 260 nm at 25 °C. Using a water bath to increase the temperature, additional scans were taken at 60, 70, and 80 °C. CD spectra of other peptides used in the study are in Fig. 1D. Binding of fluorescently tagged PEDF or peptides to immobilized P1 peptide was assayed by ligand blot, as reported previously (23Subramanian P. Locatelli-Hoops S. Kenealey J. DesJardin J. Notari L. Becerra S.P. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) prevents retinal cell death via PEDF receptor (PEDF-R): identification of a functional ligand binding site.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23928-23942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). P1 peptide (1 μg) was immobilized on nitrocellulose by vacuum filtration using the convertible filtration manifold system (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Peptides immobilized in the membrane were stained with Ponceau Red (Sigma-Aldrich) to confirm peptide immobilization and relative amount. Strips of the nitrocellulose membrane containing P1 peptide slots were sliced and incubated in blocking solution (1% BSA in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at 25 °C. Then the strips were incubated in solutions (1 ml) containing each fluorescently tagged PEDF or peptides at concentrations, as indicated, in TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. The bound material was detected by imaging the fluorescent tag on a laser scanner (TyphoonTM 9410; GE LifeSciences). Saturation binding experiments were performed from ligand blots with fluorescently tagged ligand at concentrations that varied as indicated. The amount of bound material detected on the scanned images was quantified based on the fluorescence intensity using the analyze gel tool in ImageJ. Each data point was the average of triplicate assays ± standard error. The plots were fit in GraphPad Prism using nonlinear fit with an equation for binding − saturation, one site − specific binding to obtain Kd values. Binding of full-length PEDF-R and PEDF peptides was determined via pulldown assay. Full-length His6/Xpress-tagged PEDF-R was synthesized in an in vitro translation system (yield of ∼933 ng per 50 μl of reaction) as described before (23Subramanian P. Locatelli-Hoops S. Kenealey J. DesJardin J. Notari L. Becerra S.P. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) prevents retinal cell death via PEDF receptor (PEDF-R): identification of a functional ligand binding site.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23928-23942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 34-mer and 44-mer peptides chemically synthesized containing FITC at their N terminus end were used. The in vitro expression reaction was divided into two equal aliquots to ensure equal amounts of recombinant PEDF-R protein (approximate 420 ng) in each of the 34-mer and 44-mer pulldown mixtures, and then FITC labeled 34-mer or 44-mer in Tris buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) was added to each (final concentration, 300 nm). Mixtures were at an estimated molar ratio of 1:6 for PEDF-R:peptide. After incubation under rotation for 2 h at 4 °C, a suspension of Ni-NTA resin (50 μl of bed volume) (Invitrogen) prewashed in TBS-T, was added to the binding reaction mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Following the incubation, the resin mixture was sedimented by centrifugation at 800 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. Then the resin was washed three times with 500 μl of TBS-T to remove unbound material, and the bound proteins were removed from the resin by adding 20 μl of 1× NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies; 141 mm Tris base, 2% LDS, 10% glycerol, 0.51 mm EDTA, 0.22 mm SERVA Blue G, 0.175 mm Phenol Red, pH 8.5) containing 1.25 mm DTT and heating the resin at 95 °C for 5 min. The bound material was subjected to SDS-PAGE to separate the His6/Xpress-tagged PEDF-R and FITC peptides. The bound fractions were loaded on a NuPAGE® Novex® 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gel (1.5 mm, 10 well; Life Technologies, Inc.) and electrophoresed at 170 V for 40 min in NuPAGE® MES SDS running buffer (Novex®; Life Technologies). Low range standards (20,700–103,000 molecular weight), prestained mixture of six proteins were used (Bio-Rad prestained SDS-PAGE standards 161-0305, catalogue no. 161-0305). The proteins and peptides were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The FITC of peptides were detected with a laser scanner (TyphoonTM 9410; GE LifeSciences). His6/Xpress-tagged PEDF-R was detected via Western blot using anti-Xpress (Invitrogen, diluted at 1:10,000) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse (KPL, diluted at 1:200,000). Binding of 34-mer and 44-mer peptides to immobilized P1 determined by SPR was performed using a Biacore3000, as described previously (22Notari L. Baladron V. Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Balko N. Heredia R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 38022-38037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Briefly, P1 peptide (5 μg/ml diluted into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore) via amine-coupling chemistry (1500 reference units). A reference surface without peptide was prepared using the same procedure. During binding analysis, the P1 chip was paired with a reference chip, and the binding of 300 μl of PEDF peptide (5 μm in TBS50-T) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min was measured. Subsequently, the chips were washed with TBS50-T, and peptide dissociation was followed for 3 h at the 5 ml/min. The chips were regenerated with regeneration buffer (1% octyl-glucoside, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaOH) at a flow rate of 20 ml/min. The binding assessment of the 17-mer alanine scan peptides was performed using fluorescence polarization. FITC-P1 peptide (20 pm) in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 was mixed with each of the 17-mer alanine scanning peptides at 0.2 μm, or as indicated, in 50 μl final volume per reaction mixture and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. The fluorescence polarization was measured with Envision (PerkinElmer) plate reader. The polarization (mP) of each sample was calculated using Equation 1, where S is light detected parallel to the excitation plane, and P is light detected perpendicular to the excitation plane. mP=(s−ps+p)1000(Eq. 1) The change in polarization (ΔmP) is the polarization for the sample normalized to the polarization of free FITC-P1 peptide. The biologic activity of PEDF-derived peptides was determined by the ability to protect retinal cells from serum starvation-mediated cell death, as described (23Subramanian P. Locatelli-Hoops S.

https://openalex.org/W2230541670,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents an anomalous subset of breast cancer with a greatly reduced (30%) 5-year survival rate. The enhanced mortality and morbidity of TNBC arises from the high metastatic rate, which requires the acquisition of AnR, a process whereby anchorage-dependent cells become resistant to cell death induced by detachment. In this study TNBC cell lines were selected for AnR, and these cell lines demonstrated dramatic enhancement in the formation of lung metastases as compared with parental cells. Genetic analysis of the AnR subclones versus parental cells via next generation sequencing and analysis of global alternative RNA splicing identified that the mRNA splicing of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding 2 (CPEB2), a translational regulator, was altered in AnR TNBC cells. Specifically, increased inclusion of exon 4 into the mature mRNA to produce the CPEB2B isoform was observed in AnR cell lines. Molecular manipulations of CPEB2 splice variants demonstrated a key role for this RNA splicing event in the resistance of cells to anoikis. Specifically, down-regulation of the CPEB2B isoform using siRNA re-sensitized the AnR cell lines to detachment-induced cell death. The ectopic expression of CPEB2B in parental TNBC cell lines induced AnR and dramatically increased metastatic potential. Importantly, alterations in the alternative splicing of CPEB2 were also observed in human TNBC and additional subtypes of human breast cancer tumors linked to a high metastatic rate.

Anoikis-resistant cells detach from the primary tumor and become circulating tumor cells, which arrest in a foreign organ and give rise to distant metastases. Indeed, a number of laboratories have used this process to study the mechanisms leading to metastasis (6Kotiyal S. Bhattacharya S. Breast cancer stem cells, EMT, and therapeutic targets.Biochem.

Anoikis has also been linked by multiple groups to autophagy as well as multiple other signaling pathways including the EMT pathway, Notch signaling pathways, and STAT3 signaling pathways (8Krawczyk N.

Some seminal studies have also been performed characterizing the influence of alternative splicing events in cancer development, cancer cell signaling, and EMT pathways. For example, CD44 alternative splicing, which has been linked to many cancers including breast cancer, has been shown to be regulated by splicing factors heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M and ESRP1 (15Warzecha C.C.

Regardless of these links between alternative splicing and cancer phenotypes, the role of alternative RNA splicing (AS) in the acquisition of AnR by TNBC cells has been overlooked. In this study a novel link was discovered between the AnR of TNBC cells and the AS of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 (CPEB2), a stress-activated regulator of polyadenylation, via the inclusion/exclusion of exon 4. This novel dysregulation of RNA splicing led to the increased expression of the functionally uncharacterized CPEB2 splice variant, CPEB2B, which we demonstrate is required for AnR, and thus, the metastatic capacity of TNBC cells. Therefore, this study has identified a new mechanism required for AnR that provides new insight into mechanisms associated with the metastasis of TNBC. The MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and BT549 cell lines (validated and purchased from American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI (Life Technologies). All cell lines were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). All cell lines were maintained in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were passaged once every 3–5 days (∼90% confluence), and all experiments were performed during the first 12 passages. Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling with the exception of anti-CPEB2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Water soluble tetrazoium salt (WST) assay kits were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Annexin-V 7-aminoactinomycin D assay reagents were purchased from SouthernBiotech. To select for cells resistant to anoikis, poly(2-hydrocyethylmethacrylate) (poly-HEMA)-coated dishes (10 cm) were manufactured as in Sun et al. (9Sun L. Li T. Wei Q. Zhang Y. Jia X. Wan Z. Han L. Upregulation of BNIP3 mediated by ERK/HIF-1α pathway induces autophagy and contributes to anoikis resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Future Oncol. 2014; 10: 1387-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 ml of poly-HEMA (10 mg/ml) dissolved in 95% methanol, 5% sterile H2O was allowed to evaporate from 10-cm dishes. Two coatings of poly-HEMA were applied. 1 × 107 MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-468 cells were then added to the poly-HEMA-coated dishes in normal media for a period of 3–5 weeks. Cell debris and cells killed by the detachment were eliminated by centrifugation every 3 days. Custom CPEB2A (NM_182646.2) and CPEB2B (NM_182485.2) constructs were made to our specifications using Celtek Genes service and then subsequent cloning into pcDNA3.1(+) vector. Custom siRNA molecules designed to down-regulate CPEB2A (5′-ACCCUUACAGGAUCGAAGUAGAAUGUAU-3′) or CPEB2B (5′-CAGCCGGAACAUCCAGAAUAGACCA-3′) were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid transfections were accomplished using the Effectene system (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, plasmid DNA was incubated in the presence of DNA condensation buffer (EC buffer, supplied with the kit) and a 150:18 dilution of the Enhancer reagent for 10 min followed by the addition of the Effectene reagent (at a 168:20 dilution). Plasmid samples were incubated for a further 10 min then diluted to 1 ml with complete medium and added by single drops to the sample. Cells were allowed to accumulate the recombinant proteins for 24–48 h.

The resulting PCR samples were electrophoresed on 3.5% polyacrylamide gels in a Tris borate EDTA buffer system and stained with SYBR Gold according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were then imaged using a Typhoon 7000 imager (GE Healthcare). Densitometry was performed using Image J, and ratios were determined for each sample. This ratio-based method is considered quantitative, as each splice variant acts as a competitive internal standard to the other variant (21Goehe R.W. Shultz J.C. Murudkar C. Usanovic S. Lamour N.F.

Survival assays were undertaken as described previously (22West N.W. Garcia-Vargas A. Chalfant C.E.

Briefly, single cells (150–300 cells per well) were plated onto 6-well plates. Plates were incubated 10–14 days to allow colonies to form. Colonies were stained with crystal violet, and colonies with >50 cells were counted. Cells were treated as indicated, then trypsinized, washed, and plated onto either normal (polylysine-coated) or poly-HEMA-coated plates. Cells were incubated an additional for 24 h and then stained with Annexin V-phycoerythrin and 7-aminoactinomycin D using the ApoScreen Annexin V Apoptosis kit (Southern Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were detected using a BD Biosciences FACSCanto II and analyzed using the accompanying FACSDIVA software as in West et al. (22West N.W. Garcia-Vargas A. Chalfant C.E. Park M.A. OSU-03012 sensitizes breast cancers to lapatinib-induced cell killing: a role for Nck1 but not Nck2.BMC Cancer. 2013; 13: 256Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Proliferation was determined using a traditional WST assay (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells (1 × 103) were plated onto each well of a 96-well plate. WST dye was added at 0-, 3-, and 5-day intervals and measured on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Victor X3 plate reader at an absorbance of 450 nm. The Affymetrix Expression Console software version 1.1 was used to evaluate the quality of the hybridizations and to process .CEL_les files. The robust multi-array average method for extended probe sets was used to obtain the probe set expression summary. For each probe set, a moderated t test was used to compare AnR versus parental samples using the limma Bioconductor package in the R programming environment. Probe sets having an false discovery rate < 0.10 were considered significant. FASTQ files used in this experiment can be found in the SRA database (Short Read Archives: PRJNA278375). The CLC Genomics Workbench was used to calculate transcript-level expression, which uses gene and mRNA-specific annotation for mapping reads against the gene and all known transcripts. Transcript-level expression values were reported as reads per kilobase per million (RPKM). Subsequently a linear regression model was used to regress the log transformed RPKM and identify differentially expressed transcripts as those outside the 95% prediction interval. All transcripts within the 95% prediction interval were retained as having equivalent expression. All transcripts with an RPKM < 1 were removed. To identify transcripts differentially expressed when comparing parental versus AnR samples, for each gene we summed the RPKMs over all transcripts to represent gene-level RPKM, which was used in calculating the proportion of transcript-specific expression, as the RPKM transcript/RPKM gene. The difference in proportion of transcript-specific expression was calculated. For each transcript included in the final analysis, a one-sample t test was performed to determine whether the difference in proportion of transcript-specific expression differed significantly from zero. A conservative p value of 0.05 was used in identifying transcripts having differential expression. In addition to transcriptomic analysis, a secondary analysis was performed as follows (CASPER); TopHat version 2.0.9, in conjunction with Bowtie2 version 2.1.0, was used to align the four paired-end RNA-seq data to the human reference transcriptome and genome (UCSC hg19). Using the resulting bam files, cufflinks version 2.1.1 was used to assemble transcripts and estimate their abundances where we excluded reads from rRNAs and tRNAs by creating a mask file using UCSC Genome Browser. To identify differences between the AnR and parental samples, we tested for differential isoform expression in the two paired samples independently using Cuffdiff. The resulting isoform_exp.diff files that include transcript expression comparisons were read into the R programming environment. For within cell line comparisons, the p values were used to estimate the false discovery rate using the q-value method. Additionally, Fisher's method for combining p values was used to combine the p values across the two independent comparisons. First, all breast cancer sample metadata were downloaded from the TCGA website (cancergenome.nih.gov). Samples were then divided into three categories (control, triple negative, and HER2-overexpressing). Samples not corresponding to either TNBC or HER2-overexpressing breast cancer were discarded. Samples were considered to be triple negative if they scored negative for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors and HER2 overexpressing if the samples scored a 2+ or above as determined by an in situ hybridization assay. Transcript-level text files were downloaded for the selected samples, and CPEB2A/CPEB2B ratios were determined using the RPKM values for these transcripts. Outliers and samples that had RPKM values of 0 for both CPEB2A and CPEB2B were discarded. Female NOD scid gamma were allowed to acclimatize for 1–2 weeks. After acclimatization, 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 10 μl of matrigel:collagen (1:1) and injected into the upper mammary fat pad of NOD scid gamma mice (The Jackson Laboratory) as in Rashid et al. (23Rashid O.M. Nagahashi M. Ramachandran S. Dumur C. Schaum J. Yamada A. Terracina K.P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Takabe K.

Tumors were allowed to form for a period of 50–60 days. At morbidity (or after 60 days), mice were sacrificed, and both lungs and primary tumors were harvested for analysis. Animals that failed to develop primary tumors after 50 days were sacrificed and excluded from the study. Biostatistical analyses were performed using either SPSS or R. Statistical tests used include Student's t test (in the case of only two test conditions), ANOVA (in the case of multiple test conditions), the Mann-Whitney rank sum test (when normality fails, as in Fig. 2D), and an false discovery rate-adjusted p value (Benjamini-Hochberg correction) calculation (Cuffdiff). All human tumor samples were de-identified and procured from the VCU Tissue and Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (TDAAC) under the approved IRB protocol number HM12702_Ame2. This resource has been approved by the VCU IRB in accordance to all United States rules and regulations and is housed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA 1988) certified Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in the VCU Department of Pathology and the Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center. Animal experiments were conducted at Virginia Commonwealth University. The research protocol was approved by the VCU IACUC involving animal care in accordance with the United States Department of Agriculture Animal Welfare Regulations, the Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the United States Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training (#AD10000529). VCU is in compliance with all provisions of the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals. VCU is registered under the Animal Welfare Act as a class R research facility with the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Animal Welfare (registration number 52-R-0007). The Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) approved the VCU Animal Welfare Assurance in compliance with the Public Health Service Policy (assurance number A3281-01). To examine the possible role of RNA splicing in AnR and the metastasis of TNBC, we first constructed AnR models of TNBC by isolating subclones of the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. Specifically, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were chronically cultured on poly-HEMA-coated dishes. Poly-HEMA is a Teflon-like polymer that when applied to tissue culture dishes prevents cells from adhering to the surface. Exposing cells to dishes coated with this polymer, therefore, led to the selection of cells resistant to anoikis, which propagated independent of attachment (Fig. 1A). These AnR subclones of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 demonstrated significant enhancement of cellular phenotypes associated with higher tumorigenic capacity and metastatic potential. Specifically, these AnR subclones demonstrated dramatically increased phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK, Fig. 1B), enhanced cell survival/colony formation (Fig. 1C), and enhanced proliferation (Fig. 1D). Although the survival/colony formation and proliferation assays are indicators of transformation/metastatic potential, a more accurate"
https://openalex.org/W1932668966,"Rice stripe virus (RSV) has become a major pathogen of rice. To determine how the rice transcriptome is modified in response to RSV infection, we used RNA-Seq to perform a genome-wide gene expression analysis of a susceptible rice cultivar. The transcriptomes of RSV-infected samples were compared to those of mock-treated samples at 3, 7, and 15 days post-infection (dpi). From 8 to 11% of the genes were differentially expressed (>2-fold difference in expression) in RSV-infected vs. noninfected rice. Among them, 532 genes were differentially expressed at all three time points. Surprisingly, 37.6% of the 532 genes are related to transposons. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that many chloroplast genes were down-regulated in infected plants at 3 and 15 dpi. Expression of genes associated with cell differentiation and flowering was significantly down-regulated in infected plants at 15 dpi. In contrast, most of the up-regulated genes in infected plants concern the cell wall, plasma membrane, and vacuole and are known to function in various metabolic pathways and stress responses. In addition, transcripts of diverse transcription factors gradually accumulated in infected plants with increasing infection time. We also confirmed that the expression of gene subsets (including NBS-LRR domain-containing genes, receptor-like kinase genes, and genes involving RNA silencing) was changed by RSV infection. Taken together, we demonstrated that down-regulation of genes related to photosynthesis and flowering was strongly associated with disease symptoms caused by RSV and that up-regulation of genes involved in metabolic pathways, stress responses, and transcription was related to host defense mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1903768763,"The influence of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation on transglutaminase 1 (TGase 1), a major factor that regulates skin keratinization, has not been sufficiently characterized especially at the gene or protein level. Thus, we determined whether UVB affects the expression of TGase 1 in human keratinocytes and clarified the intracellular stress signaling mechanism(s) involved. Exposure of human keratinocytes to UVB significantly up-regulated the expression of TGase 1 at the gene and protein levels. Treatment with inhibitors of p38, MEK, JNK or NFκB significantly abolished the UVB-stimulated protein expression of TGase 1. Treatment with astaxanthin immediately after UVB irradiation did not attenuate the increased phosphorylation of Ser536/Ser468NFκBp65, c-Jun, ATK-2 and CK2, and did not abrogate the increased or diminished protein levels of c-Jun/c-Fos or I-κBα, respectively. However, the same treatment with astaxanthin significantly abolished the UVB-stimulated expression of TGase 1 protein, which was accompanied by the attenuated phosphorylation of Thr565/Ser376/Ser360MSK1, Ser276NFκBp65 and Ser133CREB. The MSK1 inhibitor H89 significantly down-regulated the increased protein expression of TGase 1 in UVB-exposed human keratinocytes, which was accompanied by an abrogating effect on the increased phosphorylation of Ser276NFκBp65 and Ser133CREB but not Thr565/Ser376/Ser360MSK1. Transfection of human keratinocytes with MSK1 siRNA suppressed the UVB-stimulated protein expression of TGase 1. These findings suggest that the UVB-stimulated expression of TGase 1 is mediated predominantly via the NFκB pathway and can be attenuated through a specific interruption of the p38/MSK1/NFκBp65Ser276 axis."
https://openalex.org/W1904935534,"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of anatomical and behavioral problems in children who are exposed to alcohol during the prenatal period. There is no effective treatment for FASD, because of lack of complete characterization of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this condition. Alcohol has been previously characterized to affect integrins and growth factor signaling receptors. Integrin Linked Kinase (ILK) is an effector of integrin and growth-factor signaling which regulates various signaling processes. In FASD, a downstream effector of ILK, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β (GSK3β) remains highly active (reduced Ser9 phosphorylation). GSK3β has been known to modulate glutamate receptor trafficking and channel properties. Therefore, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits accompanying FASD are associated with impairments in the ILK signaling pathway. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats consumed a ""moderate"" amount of alcohol throughout gestation, or a calorie-equivalent sucrose solution. Contextual fear conditioning was used to evaluate memory performance in 32-33-day-old pups. Synaptic plasticity was assessed in the Schaffer Collateral pathway, and hippocampal protein lysates were used to evaluate ILK signaling. Alcohol exposed pups showed impaired contextual fear conditioning, as compared to control pups. This reduced memory performance was consistent with decrease in LTP as compared to controls. Hippocampal ILK activity and GSK3β Ser21/9 phosphorylation were significantly lower in alcohol-exposed pups than controls. Increased synaptic expression of GluR2 AMPA receptors was observed with immunoprecipitation of post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of ILK revealed a decreased interaction with GluR2. The ILK pathway appears to play a significant role in memory and synaptic plasticity impairments in FASD rats. These impairments appear to be mediated by reduced GSK3β regulation and increased synaptic stabilization of the calcium-impermeable GluR2 AMPA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1171415056,"Studies of mammalian tissue culture cells indicate that the conserved and distinct NDR isoforms, NDR1 and NDR2, play essential cell biological roles. However, mice lacking either Ndr1 or Ndr2 alone develop normally. Here, we studied the physiological consequences of inactivating both NDR1 and NDR2 in mice, showing that the lack of both Ndr1/Ndr2 (called Ndr1/2-double null mutants) causes embryonic lethality. In support of compensatory roles for NDR1 and NDR2, total protein and activating phosphorylation levels of the remaining NDR isoform were elevated in mice lacking either Ndr1 or Ndr2. Mice retaining one single wild-type Ndr allele were viable and fertile. Ndr1/2-double null embryos displayed multiple phenotypes causing a developmental delay from embryonic day E8.5 onwards. While NDR kinases are not required for notochord formation, the somites of Ndr1/2-double null embryos were smaller, irregularly shaped and unevenly spaced along the anterior-posterior axis. Genes implicated in somitogenesis were down-regulated and the normally symmetric expression of Lunatic fringe, a component of the Notch pathway, showed a left-right bias in the last forming somite in 50% of all Ndr1/2-double null embryos. In addition, Ndr1/2-double null embryos developed a heart defect that manifests itself as pericardial edemas, obstructed heart tubes and arrest of cardiac looping. The resulting cardiac insufficiency is the likely cause of the lethality of Ndr1/2-double null embryos around E10. Taken together, we show that NDR kinases compensate for each other in vivo in mouse embryos, explaining why mice deficient for either Ndr1 or Ndr2 are viable. Ndr1/2-double null embryos show defects in somitogenesis and cardiac looping, which reveals their essential functions and shows that the NDR kinases are critically required during the early phase of organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1898890134,"The fundamental repeating unit of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome. Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a ""ground state"" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this ""ground state"" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the final spliced mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions. Genes marked by the active modification H3K4m3 are characterized by lower nucleosome occupancy before the transcription start site compared to genes marked by the inactive modification H3K27m3, while bivalent domains, genes associated with both marks, lie exactly in the middle. Combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks (chromatin states) are associated with unique nucleosome profiles. Nucleosome organization varies around transcription factor binding in enhancers versus promoters. DNA methylation is associated with increasing nucleosome occupancy and different types of methylations have distinct location preferences within the nucleosome core particle. Finally, computational analysis of nucleosome organization alone is sufficient to elucidate much of the circuitry of pluripotency. Our results, suggest that nucleosome organization is associated with numerous genomic and epigenomic processes and can be used to elucidate cellular identity."

However, FOXP3+ T cells are paradoxically increased in the intestines of patients with the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD). We determined whether these FOXP3+ cells in IBD patients share or lack the phenotype of such cells from patients without IBD. Methods We quantified and characterized FOXP3+ Treg populations, as well as FOXP3- CD4+ T cells, in the lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) of intestine surgically resected from patients with and without IBD, and in the blood of controls or Crohn’s patients with or without disease activity. Results In all samples, a similar fraction of FOXP3+ cells expressed the “natural” Treg (nTreg) marker Helios, suggesting that, in IBD, these cells are not entirely “induced” Tregs (iTregs) derived from activated effector T cells. Helios+ and Helios- FOXP3+ T cells demonstrated similar expression of maturation markers, activation markers, and inhibitory molecules between IBD patients and controls, while FOXP3- cells paradoxically expressed more of the inhibitory receptors CD39, CTLA4, and PD-1 in inflamed mucosa. Greater expression of activation markers was also seen in both Helios+ and Helios- Tregs, relative to FOXP3- cells, in both IBD patients and controls, indicating that Tregs are effectively activated by antigen in IBD. Conclusions Extensive immunophenotyping revealed that Helios+ and Helios- mucosal Tregs exist at a similar frequency, and have a similar expression of inhibitory molecules and activation markers in patients with IBD as in healthy controls."

https://openalex.org/W2270228161,"Iron is implicated in fatty liver disease pathogenesis. The human hepcidin gene, HAMP, is the master switch of iron metabolism. The aim of this study is to investigate the regulation of HAMP expression by fatty acids in HepG2 cells. For these studies, both saturated fatty acids (palmitic acid (PA) and stearic acid (SA)) and unsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid (OA)) were used. PA and, to a lesser extent, SA, but not OA, up-regulated HAMP mRNA levels, as determined by real-time PCR. To understand whether PA regulates HAMP mRNA at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D was employed. PA-mediated induction of HAMP mRNA expression was not blocked by actinomycin D. Furthermore, PA activated HAMP 3′-UTR, but not promoter, activity, as shown by reporter assays. HAMP 3′-UTR harbors a single AU-rich element (ARE). Mutation of this ARE abolished the effect of PA, suggesting the involvement of ARE-binding proteins. The ARE-binding protein human antigen R (HuR) stabilizes mRNA through direct interaction with AREs on 3′-UTR. HuR is regulated by phosphorylation-mediated nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. PA activated this process. The binding of HuR to HAMP mRNA was also induced by PA in HepG2 cells. Silencing of HuR by siRNA abolished PA-mediated up-regulation of HAMP mRNA levels. PKC is known to phosphorylate HuR. Staurosporine, a broad-spectrum PKC inhibitor, inhibited both PA-mediated translocation of HuR and induction of HAMP expression. Similarly, rottlerin, a novel class PKC inhibitor, abrogated PA-mediated up-regulation of HAMP expression.

Due to the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide, metabolic syndrome, characterized by visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, is becoming a major public health problem.

The accumulation of fat in the liver, which occurs in the absence of significant alcohol consumption, is a key feature of NAFLD (1Ratziu V. Bellentani S. Cortez-Pinto H. Day C. Marchesini G.

Increased lipolysis as a result of insulin resistance and excess lipid uptake from the diet both contribute to the elevated levels of free fatty acids in the circulation. The increase in the uptake of free fatty acids by hepatocytes and de novo fatty acid synthesis lead to fat accumulation in the livers of NAFLD patients (2Donnelly K.L. Smith C.I. Schwarzenberg S.J.

Although lipid accumulation alone may be benign, more aggressive forms of NAFLD can develop. Iron has been shown to be one of the risk factors in the pathogenesis of NAFLD (3Nelson J.E. Klintworth H.

Iron acts as a risk factor by inducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (3Nelson J.E. Klintworth H. Kowdley K.V. Iron metabolism in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Curr. Gastroenterol. Rep. 2012; 14: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Hepcidin is the key iron-regulatory protein, which is primarily synthesized in the liver (7Courselaud B. Pigeon C. Inoue Y. Inoue J.

Besides being an iron-regulatory protein, hepcidin also acts as an acute phase protein. In NAFLD patients, HAMP expression has been suggested to be regulated by both systemic iron levels (6Nelson J.E. Brunt E.M. Kowdley K.V.

A role for lipids in the regulation of HAMP expression has not been established. A microarray study, however, reported that the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA), modulates HAMP expression in HepG2 cells, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown (11Vock C. Gleissner M.

Acta. 2007; 1770: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previous studies on hepcidin expression have mainly focused on the transcriptional regulation of HAMP. Inflammatory cytokines, serum transferrin, erythropoiesis, and hepatic iron stores have all been shown to stimulate the promoter activities of both human and mouse hepcidin genes via the activation of specific transcription factors (12Wrighting D.M.

It should, however, be noted that other iron-regulatory proteins, transferrin receptor 1 and ferritin, are regulated at the post-transcriptional and translational level, respectively, by iron-regulatory RNA-binding proteins (IRPs), IRP1 and IRP2 (16Rouault T.A. The role of iron regulatory proteins in mammalian iron homeostasis and disease.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Although no IRP recognition sequences have been identified in HAMP mRNA, the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms warrants further investigation. The limited studies conducted up to now examined mainly the role of microRNAs in this process. An indirect role for miR-122 and miR-130a has been reported in the regulation of mouse and human hepcidin gene expression. Namely, miR-122 and miR-130a modulated HAMP expression by altering the mRNA stability of transcriptional activators, which are known to activate HAMP transcription (17Castoldi M. Vujic Spasic M. Altamura S. Elmén J. Lindow M. Kiss J. Stolte J. Sparla R. D'Alessandro L.A. Klingmüller U. Fleming R.E. Longerich T. Gröne H.J. Benes V. Kauppinen S. Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U.

Other mechanisms besides microRNAs might be involved in direct targeting of HAMP 3′-UTR and post-transcriptional regulation of hepcidin expression. HAMP 3′-UTR harbors a single AU-rich element (ARE), but its functional role in in the post-transcriptional regulation of HAMP expression is unknown. AU-rich element-binding proteins (ARE-BPs) participate in the regulation of mRNA stability by recognizing the AU-rich element (i.e. AUUUA pentamer) embedded in a U-rich context (19Schoenberg D.R. Maquat L.E. Regulation of cytoplasmic mRNA decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 246-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). ARE-BPs include human antigen R (HuR), tristetraprolin, butyrate response factor 1, ARE/poly(U)-binding/degradation factor 1, and KH-type splicing regulatory protein (19Schoenberg D.R. Maquat L.E. Regulation of cytoplasmic mRNA decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 246-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Unlike other ARE-BPs, which mostly act as negative regulators and induce mRNA decay, HuR has been shown to exert a stabilization effect on the target mRNA (19Schoenberg D.R. Maquat L.E. Regulation of cytoplasmic mRNA decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 246-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is important for HuR function. HuR harbors several phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC) and has been shown to be phosphorylated by diverse isoforms of PKC (20Doller A. Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W. Signalling pathways regulating nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the mRNA-binding protein HuR.Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 2165-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation, HuR translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (19Schoenberg D.R. Maquat L.E. Regulation of cytoplasmic mRNA decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 246-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 20Doller A. Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W. Signalling pathways regulating nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the mRNA-binding protein HuR.Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 2165-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation-mediated nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of HuR is essential for its mRNA stabilization function (20Doller A. Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W.

However, the role of HuR or PKCs in HAMP regulation has not been investigated. The objective of this study is to understand the mechanisms by which hepatic HAMP mRNA expression is regulated by saturated fatty acids. We have identified a functional role for ARE in HAMP 3′-UTR and the ARE-BP, HuR, in post-transcriptional regulation of HAMP expression by lipids in human hepatoma cells. These findings will help us to further understand the role of hepcidin and iron in obesity and fatty liver disease pathogenesis.

Rottlerin and Go6976 were kindly provided by Dr. Todd Wyatt (University of Nebraska Medical Center). HepG2 human hepatoma cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (Atlantic Biologicals). 12–24 h prior to experiments, 1.3 × 106 or 3.9 × 106 cells were seeded in 25- or 75-cm2 flasks, respectively. Cells were treated with fatty acids or solvent (0.375% isopropyl alcohol) as control for 8 h. Negative control microRNA (miRNA) or miR-214 mimic was introduced into HepG2 cells with Nucleofector (Lonza). Plasmids and siRNA were transfected by using Lipofectamine 3000 or Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Life Technologies), respectively, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For siRNA experiments, two consecutive transfections were performed. Following treatment, HepG2 cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) at room temperature for 15 min. The fixed cells were stained with 0.2 mg/ml Nile Red (ACROS Organics) for 5 min at room temperature. The nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). Fluorescent images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse E400 fluorescence microscope using a CC-12 digital camera and analySIS software (Soft Imaging System). RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were performed as described previously (26Harrison-Findik D.D. Schafer D. Klein E. Timchenko N.A. Kulaksiz H. Clemens D. Fein E.

The Taqman microRNA assay kit (Life Technologies) was employed to determine the expression of microRNAs by qPCR, according to the manufacturer's instructions. HepG2 cells were treated with PA or solvent in the presence of actinomycin D for various time periods as indicated. The level of HAMP mRNA expression, as measured by qPCR, was expressed as -fold change relative to that in control cells, which were treated with solvent in the presence of DMSO, at corresponding time points. The rate constant for RNA decay (kdecay) was determined with linear regression (least-square) analysis. RNA half-life was calculated with the equation, t½ = ln 2/kdecay, as described (27Chen C.-Y. A.

The 1.5-kbp HAMP promoter region (+36 to −1544) was amplified by PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) and specific primers containing restriction sites (forward primer with MluI site, 5′-GGACGCGTCTGGGCCTGGTAGTGGAAAG-3′; reverse primer with XhoI site, 5′-GACTCGAGTGAGCTTGCTCTGGTGTCTG-3′). Following restriction digestions, PCR product was inserted into pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega). The ligated plasmid was electroporated into competent DH5α bacterial cells with the MicroPulse electroporator system (Bio-Rad). The cloned plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing. The 101-bp full-length HAMP 3′-UTR region was amplified by PCR using specific primers harboring a 5′-phosphate group (forward, 5′-AACCTACCTGCCCTGCCC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTTGGAAAACAAAAGAACCAGCC-3′). PCR product was inserted into the PmeI site of the pMIR-REPORT reporter vector (Life Technologies) by blunt end cloning. DNA sequencing was employed to identify the clone harboring 3′-UTR in the “forward” direction. Plasmids were purified with a plasmid maxikit (Qiagen). HepG2 cells were transfected with either empty (as control) or recombinant reporter vector using Lipofectamine 3000. pRL-SV40 plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase was co-transfected to standardize transfection efficiency. Dual-Luciferase reporter assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The ARE sequence in HAMP 3′-UTR was deleted using a commercial mutagenesis kit (QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis, Agilent Technologies) and specific primers (forward, 5′-CTGGGGCAGCAGGAATTAAGGAAGGGAGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCTCCCTTCCTTAATTCCTGCTGCCCCAG-3′), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare whole cell lysates, HepG2 cells were incubated for 15 min in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture, pepstatin A (Sigma-Aldrich), and activated sodium orthovanadate (Acros Organics). The lysates were sonicated (50% amplitude, three 5-s cycles) with ultrasonic dismembrator 150T (Fisher) to facilitate cell lysis. Following centrifugation (3000 × g for 5 min) at 4 °C, supernatants were collected and used for Western blotting. To isolate cytosolic and nuclear fractions, HepG2 cells were trypsinized and washed twice with PBS. The cell pellets were subsequently resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Following centrifugation at 1700 × g for 10 min, supernatants were collected and used as cytosolic fractions. The nuclear pellets were then washed twice with hypotonic buffer to eliminate residual cytosol contamination. Washed pellets were resuspended in an extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 420 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1% IGEPAL, 0.5% deoxycholate) and sonicated (30% amplitude, three 5-s cycles). Sonicated lysates were centrifuged at 2800 × g for 10 min to remove any debris. The supernatants were utilized as nuclear fractions. Western blots were performed as described (26Harrison-Findik D.D.

Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in 24-well plates. After treatments, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min prior to blocking with 5% BSA for 1 h. After washes with 1× PBS, cells were incubated with an anti-HuR (1:50 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-5261) primary antibody at 4 °C rotating overnight. Control cells were incubated with normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in parallel. The next day, cells were washed three times with TBS buffer containing 1% Tween 20 (Sigma) (TBST) and incubated with a secondary Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:300 dilution; Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, coverslips were washed with TBST three times and mounted with VECTASHIELD® Hard-Set Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescent images were obtained as described above. ImageJ software was used to process microscopic images. The merging of HuR and DAPI images into a two-channel image was performed for co-localization analysis using the ImageJ plug-in Squassh as described (30Rizk A. Paul G. Incardona P. Bugarski M.

Protoc. 2014; 9: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The percentage of nuclei-localized HuR (Csignal) was calculated by computing the percentage of HuR pixels that are co-localizing with DAPI pixels. The percentage of cytosolic HuR was subsequently calculated by using the formula, 100% − Csignal. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (IP) assays were performed as described (31Lal S. Burkhart R.A.

Briefly, 30 μg of HuR antibody (MBL International, RN004P) or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was preconjugated to 100 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. HepG2 cells were trypsinized and lysed to obtain the cytosolic fractions. Purified lysates were precleared with 50 μl of plain protein A-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. For IP, precleared lysates were then mixed with 100 μl of antibody-conjugated protein A-agarose and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The supernatants were discarded, and the beads were washed twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.05% Nonidet P-40). 10 μl of IP aliquots were saved for immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitated RNA were eluted using 0.1% SDS and proteinase K (1 unit/μl) and purified with TRIzol (Life Technologies). HAMP mRNA was quantified by qPCR as described above. As a negative control, 18S rRNA, which has been shown not to interact with HuR (32Lal A. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Kawai T. Yang X. Martindale J.L. Gorospe M.

The mRNAs are differentially edited in bloodstream form (BF) and procyclic form (PF) life cycle stages, and this correlates with the differential utilization of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation between the stages. The mechanism that controls this differential editing is unknown. Editing is catalyzed by multiprotein ∼20S editosomes that contain endonuclease, 3′-terminal uridylyltransferase, exonuclease, and ligase activities. These editosomes also contain KREPB5 and KREPA3 proteins, which have no functional catalytic motifs, but they are essential for parasite viability, editing, and editosome integrity in BF cells. We show here that repression of KREPB5 or KREPA3 is also lethal in PF, but the effects on editosome structure differ from those in BF. In addition, we found that point mutations in KREPB5 or KREPA3 differentially affect cell growth, editosome integrity, and RNA editing between BF and PF stages. These results indicate that the functions of KREPB5 and KREPA3 editosome proteins are adjusted between the life cycle stages. This implies that these proteins are involved in the processes that control differential editing and that the 20S editosomes differ between the life cycle stages.

https://openalex.org/W1875306770,"In polymorphic damselflies discrimination of females from males is complex owing to the presence of androchrome and gynochrome females. To date there is no evidence that damselflies use sensory modalities other than vision (and tactile stimuli) in mate searching and sex recognition. The results of the present behavioural and electrophysiological investigations on Ischnura elegans, a polymorphic damselfly, support our hypothesis that chemical cues could be involved in Odonata sex recognition. The bioassays demonstrate that males in laboratory prefer female to male odour, while no significant difference was present in male behavior between stimuli from males and control. The bioassays suggest also some ability of males to distinguish between the two female morphs using chemical stimuli. The ability of male antennae to perceive odours from females has been confirmed by electrophysiological recordings. These findings are important not only to get insight into the chemical ecology of Odonata, and to shed light into the problem of olfaction in Paleoptera, but could be useful to clarify the controversial aspects of the mating behavior of polymorphic coenagrionids. Behavioural studies in the field are necessary to investigate further these aspects."
https://openalex.org/W1839773000,"Human HCF-1 (also referred to as HCFC-1) is a transcriptional co-regulator that undergoes a complex maturation process involving extensive O-GlcNAcylation and site-specific proteolysis. HCF-1 proteolysis results in two active, noncovalently associated HCF-1N and HCF-1C subunits that regulate distinct phases of the cell-division cycle. HCF-1 O-GlcNAcylation and site-specific proteolysis are both catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which thus displays an unusual dual enzymatic activity. OGT cleaves HCF-1 at six highly conserved 26 amino acid repeat sequences called HCF-1PRO repeats. Here we characterize the substrate requirements for OGT cleavage of HCF-1. We show that the HCF-1PRO-repeat cleavage signal possesses particular OGT-binding properties. The glutamate residue at the cleavage site that is intimately involved in the cleavage reaction specifically inhibits association with OGT and its bound cofactor UDP-GlcNAc. Further, we identify a novel OGT-binding sequence nearby the first HCF-1PRO-repeat cleavage signal that enhances cleavage. These results demonstrate that distinct OGT-binding sites in HCF-1 promote proteolysis, and provide novel insights into the mechanism of this unusual protease activity."
https://openalex.org/W1847692113,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy has remarkably improved quality of life of HIV-1-infected patients. However, this treatment has been associated with the so-called lipodystrophic syndrome, which conveys a number of adverse metabolic effects and morphological alterations. Among them, lipoatrophy of subcutaneous fat in certain anatomical areas and hypertrophy of visceral depots are the most common. Less frequently, lipomatous enlargements of subcutaneous fat at distinct anatomic areas occur. Lipomatous adipose tissue in the dorso-cervical area (""buffalo hump"") has been associated with a partial white-to-brown phenotype transition and with increased cell proliferation, but, to date, lipomatous enlargements arising in other parts of the body have not been characterized. In order to establish the main molecular events associated with the appearance of lipomatosis in HIV-1 patients, we analyzed biopsies of lipomatous tissue from ""buffalo hump"" and from other anatomical areas in patients, in comparison with healthy subcutaneous adipose tissue, using a marker gene expression approach. Both buffalo-hump and non-buffalo-hump lipomatous adipose tissues exhibited similar patterns of non-compromised adipogenesis, unaltered inflammation, non-fibrotic phenotype and proliferative activity. Shorter telomere length, prelamin A accumulation and SA-β-Gal induction, reminiscent of adipocyte senescence, were also common to both types of lipomatous tissues. Buffalo hump biopsies showed expression of marker genes of brown adipose tissue (e.g. UCP1) and, specifically, of ""classical"" brown adipocytes (e.g. ZIC1) but not of beige/brite adipocytes. No such brown fat-related gene expression occurred in lipomatous tissues at other anatomical sites. In conclusion, buffalo hump and other subcutaneous adipose tissue enlargements from HIV-1-infected patients share a similar lipomatous character. However, a distorted induction of white-to-""classical brown adipocyte"" phenotype appears unique of dorso-cervical lipomatosis. Thus, the insults caused by HIV-1 viral infection and/or antiretroviral therapy leading to lipomatosis are acting in a location- and adipocyte lineage-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1889189085,"Background HIV in Israel started with a subtype-B epidemic among men who have sex with men, followed in the 1980s and 1990s by introductions of subtype C from Ethiopia (predominantly acquired by heterosexual transmission) and subtype A from the former Soviet Union (FSU, most often acquired by intravenous drug use). The epidemic matured over the last 15 years without additional large influx of exogenous infections. Between 2005 and 2013 the number of infected men who have sex with men (MSM) increased 2.9-fold, compared to 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold for intravenous drug users (IVDU) and Ethiopian-origin residents. Understanding contemporary spread is essential for effective public health planning. Methods We analyzed demographic and virologic data from 1,427 HIV-infected individuals diagnosed with HIV-I during 1998–2012. HIV phylogenies were reconstructed with maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results Subtype-B viruses, but not A or C, demonstrated a striking number of large clusters with common ancestors having posterior probability ≥0.95, including some suggesting presence of transmission networks. Transmitted drug resistance was highest in subtype B (13%). MSM represented a frequent risk factor in cross-ethnic transmission, demonstrated by the presence of Israeli-born with non-B virus infections and FSU immigrants with non-A subtypes. Conclusions Reconstructed phylogenetic trees demonstrated substantial grouping in subtype B, but not in non-MSM subtype-A or in subtype-C, reflecting differences in transmission dynamics linked to HIV transmission categories. Cross-ethnic spread occurred through multiple independent introductions, with MSM playing a prevalent role in the transmission of the virus. Such data provide a baseline to track epidemic trends and will be useful in informing and quantifying efforts to reduce HIV transmission."

Therefore, the recently reported hydroquinone 1,2-dioxygenases add to the diversity of ring cleavage reactions. Two-subunit hydroquinone 1,2-dioxygenase PnpCD, the key enzyme in the hydroquinone pathway of para-nitrophenol degradation, catalyzes the ring cleavage of hydroquinone to γ-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. Here, we report three PnpCD structures, named apo-PnpCD, PnpCD-Fe3+, and PnpCD-Cd2+-HBN (substrate analog hydroxyenzonitrile), respectively. Structural analysis showed that both the PnpC and the C-terminal domains of PnpD comprise a conserved cupin fold, whereas PnpC cannot form a competent metal binding pocket as can PnpD cupin. Four residues of PnpD (His-256, Asn-258, Glu-262, and His-303) were observed to coordinate the iron ion. The Asn-258 coordination is particularly interesting because this coordinating residue has never been observed in the homologous cupin structures of PnpCD. Asn-258 is proposed to play a pivotal role in binding the iron prior to the enzymatic reaction, but it might lose coordination to the iron when the reaction begins. PnpD also consists of an intriguing N-terminal domain that might have functions other than nucleic acid binding in its structural homologs. In summary, PnpCD has no apparent evolutionary relationship with other iron-dependent dioxygenases and therefore defines a new structural class.

Given that angiogenesis is impaired in the presence of diabetes mellitus, we would like to investigate whether and how aliskiren enhances endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and improves ischemic-induced neovasculogenesis by an effect independent of blood pressure reduction in diabetic animals.Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were administered with either aliskiren (5 or 25 mg/kg/day) using an osmotic pump or hydralazine (2 or 10 mg/kg/day) given in drinking water for two weeks prior to a hind-limb ischemia surgery. Laser Doppler imaging and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the degree of neovasculogenesis and the circulating levels of EPCs, respectively.In streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, aliskiren enhanced the recovery of limb perfusion and capillary density, increased the number of circulating Sca-1+/Flk-1+ EPC-like cells, and elevated the levels of the plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α in a dose-dependent manner, whereas there were no such effects in hydralazine-treated mice. Intraperitoneal administration of anti-SDF-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies abolished the effects of aliskiren.Independent of the reduction of blood pressure, aliskiren enhanced ischemia-induced neovasculogenesis in a dose-dependent manner via VEGF/SDF-1α related mechanisms in diabetic mice."

Uniformly distributed scattering objects are assumed around the Mobile Station (MS) bounded within an ellipsoidal shaped Scattering Region (SR) hollowed with an elliptically-cylindric scattering free region in immediate vicinity of MS. To ensure the degree of expected accuracy, the proposed model is designed to be tunable (as required) with nine degrees of freedom, unlike its counterparts in the existing literature. The outer and inner boundaries of SR are designed as independently scalable along all the axes and rotatable in horizontal plane around their origin centered at MS. The elevated Base Station (BS) is considered outside the SR at a certain adjustable distance and height w.r.t. position of MS. Closed-form analytical expressions for joint and marginal Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) and Time-of-Arrival (ToA) are derived for both up- and down-links. The obtained analytical results for angular and temporal statistics of the channel are presented along with a thorough analysis. The impact of various physical model parameters on angular and temporal characteristics of the channel is presented, which reveals the comprehensive insight on the proposed results. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed analytical model, a comparison with experimental datasets and simulation results is also presented. The obtained analytical results for PDF of AoA observed at BS are seen to fit a vast range of empirical datasets in the literature taken for various outdoor propagation environments. In order to establish the validity of the obtained analytical results for spatial and temporal characteristics of the channel, a comparison of the proposed analytical results with the simulation results is shown, which illustrates a good fit for 10(7) scattering points. Moreover, the proposed model is shown to degenerate to various notable geometric models in the literature by an appropriate choice of a few parameters."
https://openalex.org/W1917195100,"Incorporating the perspectives and insights of stakeholders is an essential component of ecosystem-based fisheries management, such that policy strategies should account for the diverse interests of various groups of anglers to enhance their efficacy. Here we assessed fishing stakeholders’ perceptions on the management of Atlantic striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and receptiveness to potential future regulations using an online survey of recreational and commercial fishers in Massachusetts and Connecticut (USA). Our results indicate that most fishers harbored adequate to positive perceptions of current striped bass management policies when asked to grade their state’s management regime. Yet, subtle differences in perceptions existed between recreational and commercial fishers, as well as across individuals with differing levels of fishing experience, resource dependency, and tournament participation. Recreational fishers in both states were generally supportive or neutral towards potential management actions including slot limits (71%) and mandated circle hooks to reduce mortality of released fish (74%), but less supportive of reduced recreational bag limits (51%). Although commercial anglers were typically less supportive of management changes than their recreational counterparts, the majority were still supportive of slot limits (54%) and mandated use of circle hooks (56%). Our study suggests that both recreational and commercial fishers are generally supportive of additional management strategies aimed at sustaining healthy striped bass populations and agree on a variety of strategies. However, both stakeholder groups were less supportive of harvest reductions, which is the most direct measure of reducing mortality available to fisheries managers. By revealing factors that influence stakeholders’ support or willingness to comply with management strategies, studies such as ours can help managers identify potential stakeholder support for or conflicts that may result from regulation changes."

NadA belongs to the class of oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins and is able to mediate adhesion and invasion of human epithelial cells. As a vaccine antigen, NadA has been shown to induce high levels of bactericidal antibodies; however, the domains important for protective response are still unknown. In order to further investigate its immunogenic properties, we have characterized the murine IgG1 mAb (6E3) that was able to recognize the 2 main antigenic variants of NadA on the surface of MenB strains. The epitope targeted by mAb 6E3 was mapped by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and shown to be located on the coiled-coil stalk region of NadA (aa 206-249). Although no serum bactericidal activity was observed for murine IgG1 mAb 6E3, functional activity was restored when using chimeric antibodies in which the variable regions of the murine mAb 6E3 were fused to human IgG3 constant regions, thus confirming the protective nature of the mAb 6E3 epitope. The use of chimeric antibody molecules will enable future investigations of complement-mediated antibody functionality independently of the Fc-mediated differences in complement activation."

This source is expected to provide a new power generation system for the low-power electrical equipment used in forestry. However, the voltage is weak, which has caused great difficulty in application. Consequently, the development of a method to increase the voltage is a key issue that must be addressed in this area of applied research. As the front-end component for energy harvesting, a metal electrode has a material effect on the level and stability of the voltage obtained. This study aimed to preliminarily ascertain the rules and mechanisms that underlie the effects of electrode material on voltage. Electrodes of different materials were used to measure the tree-source voltage, and the data were employed in a comparative analysis. The results indicate that the conductivity of the metal electrode significantly affects the contact resistance of the electrode-soil and electrode-trunk contact surfaces, thereby influencing the voltage level. The metal reactivity of the electrode has no significant effect on the voltage. However, passivation of the electrode materials markedly reduces the voltage. Suitable electrode materials are demonstrated and recommended."

All patients were monitored using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) after pre-surgical evaluation. Clinical data (demographics, electrophysiology, and neuroimaging) were reviewed retrospectively. Surgical outcomes were evaluated at 1, 2, 5 years after surgery, and at the end of the study. After 1 year, 56 patients (62.2%) became Engel class I and at the last follow-up, 47 patients (52.2%) remained seizure-free. Furthermore, non-localized 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), identifying hypometabolic areas not concordant with ictal onset zones, significantly correlated with seizure recurrence after 1 year. Non-lesional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and left-sided resection correlated with poor outcomes. In the last follow-up, non-localized PET and left-sided resection significantly correlated with seizure recurrence. Both localized PET and ictal-interictal SPECT subtraction co-registered to MR (SISCOM) predicted good surgical outcomes in the last follow-up (69.2%, Engel I). This study suggests that PET and SISCOM may predict postoperative outcomes for patients after multilobar epilepsy and shows comparable long-term surgical outcomes after multilobar resection."
https://openalex.org/W2253511574,"Sensory systems have mechanisms to respond to the external environment and adapt to them. Such adaptive responses are effective for a wide dynamic range of sensing and perception of temporal change in stimulus. However, noise generated by the adaptation system itself as well as extrinsic noise in sensory inputs may impose a limit on the ability of adaptation systems. The relation between response and noise is well understood for equilibrium systems in the form of fluctuation response relation. However, the relation for nonequilibrium systems, including adaptive systems, are poorly understood. Here, we systematically explore such a relation between response and fluctuation in adaptation systems. We study the two network motifs, incoherent feedforward loops (iFFL) and negative feedback loops (nFBL), that can achieve perfect adaptation. We find that the response magnitude in adaption systems is limited by its intrinsic noise, implying that higher response would have higher noise component as well. Comparing the relation of response and noise in iFFL and nFBL, we show that whereas iFFL exhibits adaptation over a wider parameter range, nFBL offers higher response to noise ratio than iFFL. We also identify the condition that yields the upper limit of response for both network motifs. These results may explain the reason of why nFBL seems to be more abundant in nature for the implementation of adaption systems."

One way to achieve this is to use random numbers derived from a discrete binomial distribution to create a 'full random training schedule' (FRS). When using FRS, however, sporadic but long laterally-biased training sequences occur by chance and such 'input biases' are thought to promote the generation of laterally-biased choices (i.e., 'output biases'). As an alternative, a 'Gellerman-like training schedule' (GLS) can be used. It removes most input biases by prohibiting the reward from appearing on the same location for more than three consecutive trials. The sequence of past rewards obtained from choosing a particular discriminative stimulus influences the probability of choosing that same stimulus on subsequent trials. Assuming that the long-term average ratio of choices matches the long-term average ratio of reinforcers, we hypothesized that a reduced amount of input biases in GLS compared to FRS should lead to a reduced production of output biases. We compared the choice patterns produced by a 'Rational Decision Maker' (RDM) in response to computer-generated FRS and GLS training sequences. To create a virtual RDM, we implemented an algorithm that generated choices based on past rewards. Our simulations revealed that, although the GLS presented fewer input biases than the FRS, the virtual RDM produced more output biases with GLS than with FRS under a variety of test conditions. Our results reveal that the statistical and temporal properties of training sequences interacted with the RDM to influence the production of output biases. Thus, discrete changes in the training paradigms did not translate linearly into modifications in the pattern of choices generated by a RDM. Virtual RDMs could be further employed to guide the selection of proper training schedules for perceptual decision-making studies."
https://openalex.org/W2112601820,"Background Few modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer are known. Recently, disruption of the circadian system has been proposed to affect risk, as it entails an inhibited melatonin production, and melatonin has demonstrated beneficial effects on cancer inhibition. This suggests a potential role of traffic noise in prostate cancer. Methods Road traffic and railway noise was calculated for all present and historical addresses from 1987–2010 for a cohort of 24,473 middle-aged, Danish men. During follow-up, 1,457 prostate cancer cases were identified. We used Cox Proportional Hazards Models to calculate the association between noise exposure and incident prostate cancer. Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) were calculated as crude and adjusted for smoking status, education, socioeconomic position, BMI, waist circumference, physical activity, calendar year, and traffic noise from other sources than the one investigated. Results There was no association between residential road traffic noise and risk of prostate cancer for any of the three exposure windows: 1, 5 or 10-year mean noise exposure before prostate cancer diagnosis. This result persisted when stratifying cases by aggressiveness. For railway noise, there was no association with overall prostate cancer. There was no statistically significant effect modification by age, education, smoking status, waist circumference or railway noise, on the association between road traffic noise and prostate cancer, although there seemed to be a suggestion of an association among never smokers (IRR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.00–1.36). Conclusion The present study does not support an overall association between either railway or road traffic noise and overall prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1782045326,"Predicting the sensory consequences of saccadic eye movements likely plays a crucial role in planning sequences of saccades and in maintaining visual stability despite saccade-caused retinal displacements. Deficits in predictive activity, such as that afforded by a corollary discharge signal, have been reported in patients with schizophrenia, and may lead to the emergence of positive symptoms, in particular delusions of control and auditory hallucinations. We examined whether a measure of delusional thinking in the general, non-clinical population correlated with measures of predictive activity in two oculomotor tasks. The double-step task measured predictive activity in motor control, and the in-flight displacement task measured predictive activity in trans-saccadic visual perception. Forty-one healthy adults performed both tasks and completed a questionnaire to assess delusional thinking. The quantitative measure of predictive activity we obtained correlated with the tendency towards delusional ideation, but only for the motor task, and not the perceptual task: Individuals with higher levels of delusional thinking showed less self-movement information use in the motor task. Variation of the degree of self-generated movement knowledge as a function of the prevalence of delusional ideation in the normal population strongly supports the idea that corollary discharge deficits measured in schizophrenic patients in previous researches are not due to neuroleptic medication. We also propose that this difference in results between the perceptual and the motor tasks may point to a dissociation between corollary discharge for perception and corollary discharge for action."
https://openalex.org/W1903945705,"The biological significance of STK17A, a serine/threonine kinase, in the liver is not known. We analyzed STK17A expression in HepG2 cells and human liver tissue. Accordingly, we investigated whether STK17A could help in identifying earlier changes during the evolution of chronic rejection (CR) after liver transplantation. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence were used to analyze STK17A expression in HepG2 cells. Antibody microarray was performed using human liver samples from CR and healthy donors. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify the clinical utility of STK17A on sequential biopsies for the subsequent development of CR. A novel short isoform of STK17A was found in HepG2 cells. STK17A was localized in the nuclei and bile canaliculi in HepG2 cells and human livers. Microarray of STK17A revealed its decrease in failed liver allografts by CR. During the evolution of CR, the staining pattern of bile canalicular STK17A gradually changed from diffuse linear to focal intermittent. The focal intermittent staining pattern was observed before the definite diagnosis of CR. In conclusion, the present study was the first to find localization of STK17A in normal bile canaliculi. Abnormal expression and localization of STK17A were associated with CR of liver allografts since the early stage of the rejection process."
https://openalex.org/W2291053726,"The small GTPase Ran coordinates retrograde axonal transport in neurons, spindle assembly during mitosis, and the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of mRNA. Its localization is tightly regulated by the GTPase-activating protein RanGAP1 and the nuclear guanosine exchange factor (GEF) RCC1. We show that loss of the neuronal E3 ubiquitin ligase MYCBP2 caused the up-regulation of Ran and RanGAP1 in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) under basal conditions and during inflammatory hyperalgesia. SUMOylated RanGAP1 physically interacted with MYCBP2 and inhibited its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Stimulation of neurons induced a RanGAP1-dependent translocation of MYCBP2 to the nucleus. In the nucleus of DRG neurons MYCBP2 co-localized with Ran and facilitated through its RCC1-like domain the GDP/GTP exchange of Ran. In accordance with the necessity of a GEF to promote GTP-binding and nuclear export of Ran, the nuclear localization of Ran was strongly increased in MYCBP2-deficient DRGs. The finding that other GEFs for Ran besides RCC1 exist gives new insights in the complexity of the regulation of the Ran signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1185563673,"Large quantities of data have been generated from multiple sources at exponential rates in the last few years. These data are generated at high velocity as real time and streaming data in variety of formats. These characteristics give rise to challenges in its modeling, computation, and processing. Hadoop MapReduce (MR) is a well known data-intensive distributed processing framework using the distributed file system (DFS) for Big Data. Current implementations of MR only support execution of a single algorithm in the entire Hadoop cluster. In this paper, we propose MapReducePack (MRPack), a variation of MR that supports execution of a set of related algorithms in a single MR job. We exploit the computational capability of a cluster by increasing the compute-intensiveness of MapReduce while maintaining its data-intensive approach. It uses the available computing resources by dynamically managing the task assignment and intermediate data. Intermediate data from multiple algorithms are managed using multi-key and skew mitigation strategies. The performance study of the proposed system shows that it is time, I/O, and memory efficient compared to the default MapReduce. The proposed approach reduces the execution time by 200% with an approximate 50% decrease in I/O cost. Complexity and qualitative results analysis shows significant performance improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2177030540,"The genetic structure and function of MHC class I chain-related (MIC) genes in the pig genome have not been well characterized, and show discordance in available data. Therefore, we have experimentally characterized the exon-intron structure and functional copy expression pattern of the pig MIC gene, SLA-MIC2. We have also studied the genetic diversity of SLA-MIC2 from seven different breeds using a high-resolution genomic sequence-based typing (GSBT) method. Our results showed that the SLA-MIC2 gene has a similar molecular organization as the human and cattle orthologs, and is expressed in only a few tissues including the small intestine, lung, and heart. A total of fifteen SLA-MIC2 alleles were identified from typing 145 animals, ten of which were previously unreported. Our analysis showed that the previously reported and tentatively named SLA-MIC2*05, 07, and 01 alleles occurred most frequently. The observed heterozygosity varied from 0.26 to 0.73 among breeds. The number of alleles of the SLA-MIC2 gene in pigs is somewhat lower compared to the number of alleles of the porcine MHC class I and II genes; however, the level of heterozygosity was similar. Our results indicate the comprehensiveness of using genomic DNA-based typing for the systemic study of the SLA-MIC2 gene. The method developed for this study, as well as the detailed information that was obtained, could serve as fundamental tools for understanding the influence of the SLA-MIC2 gene on porcine immune responses."
