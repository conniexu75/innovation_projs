https://openalex.org/W1516316082,"The molecular control of self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells has remained enigmatic. Transgenic loss-of-function and overexpression models now show that the dosage of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), produced by Sertoli cells, regulates cell fate decisions of undifferentiated spermatogonial cells that include the stem cells for spermatogenesis. Gene-targeted mice with one GDNF-null allele show depletion of stem cell reserves, whereas mice overexpressing GDNF show accumulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia. They are unable to respond properly to differentiation signals and undergo apoptosis upon retinoic acid treatment. Nonmetastatic testicular tumors are regularly formed in older GDNF-overexpressing mice. Thus, GDNF contributes to paracrine regulation of spermatogonial self-renewal and differentiation."

Strains producing the CagA antigen ( cagA + ) induce strong gastric inflammation and are strongly associated with gastric adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma. We show here that such strains translocate the bacterial protein CagA into gastric epithelial cells by a type IV secretion system, encoded by the cag pathogenicity island. CagA is tyrosine-phosphorylated and induces changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of distinct cellular proteins. Modulation of host cells by bacterial protein translocation adds a new dimension to the chronic Helicobacter infection with yet unknown consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1974000520,"Many protein enzymes use general acid-base catalysis as a way to increase reaction rates. The amino acid histidine is optimized for this function because it has a pK(a) (where K(a) is the acid dissociation constant) near physiological pH. The RNA enzyme (ribozyme) from hepatitis delta virus catalyzes self-cleavage of a phosphodiester bond. Reactivity-pH profiles in monovalent or divalent cations, as well as distance to the leaving-group oxygen, implicate cytosine 75 (C75) of the ribozyme as the general acid and ribozyme-bound hydrated metal hydroxide as the general base in the self-cleavage reaction. Moreover, C75 has a pK(a) perturbed to neutrality, making it ""histidine-like."" Anticooperative interaction is observed between protonated C75 and a metal ion, which serves to modulate the pK(a) of C75. General acid-base catalysis expands the catalytic repertoire of RNA and may provide improved rate acceleration."
https://openalex.org/W2090688283,"Bovine endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is phosphorylated directly by the protein kinase Akt at serine 1179. Mutation of this residue to the negatively charged aspartate (S1179D eNOS) increases nitric oxide (NO) production constitutively, in the absence of agonist challenge. Here, we examine the potential mechanism of how aspartate at 1179 increases eNOS activity using purified proteins. Examination of NO production and cytochrome creduction resulted in no substantial changes in theK m/EC50 for l-arginine, calmodulin, and calcium, whereas there was a 2-fold increase in the rate of NO production for S1179D and a 2–4-fold increase in reductase activity (based on cytochrome c reduction). The observed increase in activity for both assays of NOS function indicates that a faster rate of electron flux through the reductase domain is likely the rate-limiting step in NO formation from eNOS. In addition, S1179D eNOS did show an increased resistance to inactivation by EGTA compared with wild type eNOS. These results suggest that a negative charge imposed at serine 1179, either by phosphorylation or by replacement with aspartate, increases eNOS catalytic activity by increasing electron flux at the reductase domain and by reducing calmodulin dissociation from activated eNOS when calcium levels are low.

These two domains are joined by a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain, and the reductase domain contains an autoinhibitory loop in the carboxyl-terminal domain, which regulates electron flow in the protein. Calcium-dependent CaM activation is essential for NO production by purified endothelial and neuronal NOS isoforms. In all NOS isoforms, NO is generated by a two step process utilizing the electrons donated by NADPH to reduce the heme iron, permitting activation of molecular oxygen followed by oxidation of a guanidino N group of arginine to form NO, l-citrulline, and H2O (1.Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). For activation of eNOS, there is a consensus that calcium-activated CaM is necessary for eNOS activity in vitro (2.Forstermann U. Pollock J.S. Schmidt H.H. Heller M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although the molecular basis for these observations is not known, it is likely that CaM is bound under both circumstances because CaM is an essential regulator of intra- and interdomain electron flux (9.Abu-Soud H.M.

Furthermore, the serine/threonine kinase Akt was identified as the downstream kinase that specifically phosphorylates eNOS (at serines 1179 and1177 for bovine and human eNOS, respectively (10.Michell B.J.

Phosphorylation on this residue is associated with an increase in NO production and activation of the enzyme at lower calcium/CaM concentrations than nonphosphorylated eNOS (10.Michell B.J.

Mutation of serine 1179 to aspartate (S1179D eNOS), to mimic the negative charge afforded by phosphate, increased NO production in the absence of agonist challenge, whereas mutation to alanine (i.e. S1179A) blocked Akt-dependent eNOS phosphorylation and NO release (12.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar, 14.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential mechanisms of how aspartate at 1179 increases NOS activity and basal NO production using purified proteins. Trizma base, EDTA, EGTA, l-arginine, calmodulin, NADPH, HEPES, Dowex AG50WX8, and cytochrome cwere obtained from Sigma. Tetrahydrobiopterin was acquired from J. B. Schircks (Jona, Switzerland). The Bradford protein assay kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. 2′5′-ADP Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine (55 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Wild type bovine eNOS in the plasmid pCW was expressed as described previously with groELS in E. coli BL21 cells (15.Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The S1179D mutant eNOS for expression in E. coli was generated as follows. eNOS S1179D in pcDNA 3 (14.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar) was digested withXhoI/XbaI, subcloned into the identical sites of eNOS in pCW, and co-expressed with groELS. Isolation of recombinant eNOS was preformed as reported previously (16.Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 17.Martasek P. Miller R.T. Roman L.J. Shea T. Masters B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. eNOS was eluted from 2′5′-ADP Sepharose with either 10 mm NADPH or 10 mm 2′-AMP. The amount of eNOS was quantitated using the peak absorbance at 409–412 nm, with an extinction coefficient for heme content of 0.1 μm−1 cm−1. The purity of eNOS was determined by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Low temperature SDS-PAGE was performed identically, except that samples were not boiled and the electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C in a slurry of ice/water (18.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In experiments in which NOS cofactors (l-arginine, calmodulin, and NADPH) were titrated, they were omitted from the purification and storage of the enzymes and were incubated as described below. NO production was measured by the hemoglobin capture assay as described (19.Kelm M. Feelisch M. Spahr R. Piper H.M. Noack E. Schrader J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained eNOS (0.5–2.5 μg), oxyhemoglobin (8 μm), l-arginine (100 μm), BH4 (5 μm), CaCl2 (120 μm), calmodulin (120–200 nm), and NADPH (100 μm) in HEPES buffer (50 mm), pH 7.4. In the determination of calcium EC50 value for eNOS, the above reaction mixture was modified as follows: MOPS buffer (10 mm, pH 7.6), KCl (100 mm) and CaM (250 nm) were substituted. Under these conditions, free calcium was calculated using the WinMAXC program, version 1.8 (Stanford University), with a K d of 2.2 × 10−8m. The precise free calcium concentration was achieved by mixing an appropriate proportion of 10 mmK2EGTA and 10 mm CaEGTA stock solutions (Molecular Probes). NOS activity was monitored for linearity over 2 min at 401 nm, and NO production was calculated based on the change of absorbance using the extinction coefficient of 60 mm−1 cm−1. All reactions were carried out at 23 °C, and each data point represents 3–8 observations. The extinction coefficient of 0.0033 μm−1 cm−1 at 276 nm was used for determination of calmodulin concentration. The production of NO using this method was completely blocked by the addition of nitro-l-arginine (1 mm). When the inactivation of eNOS was determined by the addition of EGTA (200–800 μm) to the reaction mixture, chelator was added 1 min after initiation of the reaction by NADPH. Identical conditions were used when NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity was examined. These reactions contained CaM (120 nm) and CaCl2 (200 μm) in a 0.5-ml volume with eNOS (0.5 μg). The conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline was assayed as described previously (20.Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). Briefly, eNOS (0.25–2 μg) was incubated for 3–10 min at 23 °C in the following reaction mixture: 3 pmol of l-[3H]arginine (55 Ci/mmol), 10–300 μm arginine, 1 mm NADPH, 120–200 nm calmodulin, 2 mm CaCl2, and 30 μm BH4 in a final reaction volume of 50–100 μl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 5.5, containing 2 mm EGTA and EDTA. The reaction mixture was placed over Dowex AG50WX8, and the flow-through was counted on a Packard 1500 liquid scintillation analyzer. NADPH-cytochrome creductase activity and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) reduction were measured as a change in absorbance at 550 nm as described previously (17.Martasek P. Miller R.T. Roman L.J. Shea T. Masters B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21.Masters B.S. Williams C.H. Kamin H. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 565-573Crossref Scopus (623) Google Scholar), using an extinction coefficient of 0.021 μm−1 cm−1 for both cytochromec and DCIP. Briefly, a reaction mixture (1 ml) contained either cytochrome c (90 μm); DCIP (36 μm), HEPES buffer (50 mm) at pH 7.6, NaCl (250 mm), NADPH (100 μm), calmodulin (120 nm), and CaCl2 (200 μm); or other substances as indicated. The reaction was monitored for 60 s (at 23 °C) after the addition of eNOS. When inactivation of reductase activity was determined by the addition of EGTA (200–800 μm), chelator was added 1 min after initiation of the reaction and monitored for an additional 1 min. The reaction contained HEPES buffer (50 mm) at pH 7.6, CaM (120 nm), and CaCl2 (200 μm) and was initiated with NADPH (100 μm). No NaCl was added in experiments that examined EGTA inactivation of eNOS to mimic the conditions used in the hemoglobin capture experiments. The addition of NOS inhibitors did not influence the rate of cytochrome c reduction (not shown). Determination of the calcium EC50 for eNOS was performed as described above for the hemoglobin capture assay. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. At least triplicate determinations were performed with a minimum of three different batches of enzymes for each data set. Wild type and mutant enzymes were purified simultaneously to control for activity variations between preparations. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test, andp < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both wild type and S1179D eNOS were expressed and purified from E. coli. In a culture of 1.6 liters, approximately 2.5–4.0 mg of eNOS was typically recovered using 2′5′-ADP Sepharose 4B chromatography. As seen in Fig.1 A, both enzymes were >90% pure based on Coomassie staining. These results are typical, as seen from seven independent preparations of both wild type and S1179D eNOS prepared side-by-side. Both enzymes were primarily in their dimeric form, as shown by low temperature SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Next we compared the activities of wild type and S1179D eNOS by measuring the rate of NO production. S1179D eNOS exhibited a higher turnover number (under optimal conditions) compared with wild type enzyme (84 ± 6 versus 27 ± 1 min−1, n = 6 separate and paired preparations of enzymes). The K m values withl-arginine were similar for wild type and S1179D eNOS (Fig.2 A, 1.8 versus 2.5 μm, respectively; see TableI).Table IKinetic parameters for wild type and S1179D eNOSSubstrate/cofactorsAssayCatalytic determinationWild typeS1179DArginineHemoglobin captureK cat27 ± 1 min−184 ± 6 min−1K m1.8 μm2.5 μmNADPHHemoglobin captureK cat17 ± 1 min−153 ± 3 min−1K m8 μm36 μmCytochromecK cat +CaM460 ± 18 min−1840 ± 59 min−1K cat −CaM70 ± 5 min−1290 ± 9 min−1K m+CaM0.75 μm1.9 μm−CaM0.40 μm2.0 μmCaMl-CitrullineK cat22 ± 2 min−143 ± 2 min−1EC508 nm7 nmCytochromecK cat620 ± 78 min−11140 ± 75 min−1EC5013 nm21 nmCa2+Hemoglobin captureK cat58 ± 1 min−1100 ± 3 min−1(100 mm KCl)EC50310 nm250 nmCytochrome cK cat1909 ± 33 min−13798 ± 54 min−1(100 mm KCl)EC50290 nm220 nm Open table in a new tab Because the rate of electron flux from the reductase domain to the oxygenase domain is critical for NOS catalysis, we examined whether this increase in S1179D eNOS activity could be attributed to enhanced reductase activity. When both DCIP and cytochrome creduction were examined, a significant increase in activity for S1179D compared with wild type eNOS was observed (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that a possible mechanism for the increased activity may lie within the reductase domain. Furthermore, this increase was accentuated by the presence of CaM, which increased the overall activity for both enzymes. Basal cytochrome c reduction, in the absence of CaM, was 4-fold higher for S1179D compared with wild type eNOS. The magnitude of CaM-stimulated cytochrome c reduction was higher for S1179D eNOS (749 ± 35 versus 1272 ± 55 min−1 for wild type and S1179D eNOS, respectively,n = 3–5); however, the level of stimulation by CaM was 8-fold for wild type eNOS compared with only 3-fold for S1179D eNOS. Next, we examined the possibility that S1179D eNOS may produce more superoxide than wild type eNOS, which could reduce cytochromec. As expected, no superoxide dismutase inhibitable cytochrome c reduction was observed (as an index of superoxide anion generation) in the absence of CaM, as reported earlier for wild type eNOS (86 ± 6 versus 95 ± 8 min−1) and for S1179D eNOS (278 ± 9versus 288 ± 7 min−1, n = 3–5). However, in the presence of CaM, superoxide dismutase reduced the rate of cytochrome c reduction for both wild type (610 ± 51 versus 866 ± 8 min−1) and S1179D (1179 ± 43 versus 1518 ± 19 min−1) eNOS. The relative decrease in cytochromec activity in the presence of superoxide dismutase was similar with both enzymes (30% for wild type and 22% for S1179D eNOS), suggesting that the enhanced reductase activity of S1179D compared with wild type eNOS (assayed by cytochrome creduction) was not due to uncoupling of the enzyme. The NADPH dependence of NO production and cytochrome c reduction were examined because the NADPH binding site lies close in proximity to the Ser-1179 in eNOS. S1179D eNOS had a higher maximum turnover number (k cat) than did wild type enzyme based on NO production, assayed in the presence of CaM (Fig.3 A). The increasedk cat was associated with a 4-fold increase in the K m for NADPH for S1179D eNOS compared with wild type eNOS (36 versus 8 μm, respectively). Thek cat for NADPH-dependent cytochromec reduction in the absence of CaM was greater for eNOS S1179D than wild type eNOS (290 versus 70 min−1, respectively; Fig. 3 B). In the presence of CaM, the k cat for cytochrome creduction was considerably higher for S1179D compared with wild type eNOS (840 versus 460 min−1, respectively). TheK m values for NADPH were unchanged in the absence or presence of CaM (0.40 and 0.75 μm for wild type eNOS and 2.0 and 1.9 μm for S1179D eNOS in the absence and presence of CaM, respectively). To assess whether the increased activity of S1179D eNOS was attributable to changes in the affinity of the enzyme for CaM, we examined the kinetics of NOS activity and cytochrome creduction assayed in the presence of all NOS cofactors in excess as a function of CaM concentration. The k cat for CaM activation of NOS activity was 22 min−1 for wild type and 43 min−1 for S1179D eNOS. Transformation of the data, normalizing for the differences in k cat, revealed a slight shift in the curve to the left for S1179D eNOS but little difference in the EC50 values for CaM, consistent with reported data on phospho-eNOS (10.Michell B.J. Griffiths J.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Tiganis T. Bozinovski S. de Montellano P.O. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The EC50 values were 8 nm for wild type and 7 nm S1179D eNOS (Fig. 4 A). We then measured NADPH-mediated cytochrome c reduction. Thek cat for CaM activation of cytochromec reduction was about 2-fold higher for S1179D eNOS compared with wild type enzyme (1140 and 620 min−1 for S1179D and wild type eNOS, respectively). Transformation of the data normalized for the differences in k cat, revealed small differences in the EC50 values for CaM between wild type and S1179D eNOS (21 versus 13 nm; Fig.4 B). In previous experiments, it was demonstrated that the “apparent calcium sensitivity” of eNOS was enhanced in cells expressing either a majority of phospho-eNOS or S1179D eNOS, suggesting that phosphorylation changed the affinity of calcium/CaM activation (12.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar,14.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4 C, after normalization for the differences in maximal activity, the calcium dependence was slightly increased for S1179D eNOS (p < 0.05, two-way analysis of variance). The EC50 values for calcium with wild type and S1179D eNOS were slightly different also (310 and 250 nm calcium, respectively), as determined by NO production (in the presence of 250 nm CaM). As seen in theinset to Fig. 4 C, increasing concentrations of free calcium did indeed enhance S1179D eNOS turnover to a greater extent then that seen with wild type enzyme. Furthermore, the EC50 value for calcium assaying cytochrome creduction were similar to those obtained measuring NO production (Fig.4 D; 290 and 220 nm for wild type and S1179D eNOS, respectively). Again, the V max for calcium activation of S1179D eNOS turnover was greater than wild type (Fig.4 D, inset). To examine whether the inactivation of S1179D eNOS was different than that of wild type enzyme, we measured the decay in eNOS activity after chelation of calcium with EGTA. In these experiments, all NOS cofactors were added in the presence of calcium (200 μm), and NO production was monitored for 1 min, followed by the addition of different concentrations of EGTA and monitoring for an additional 1 min. As seen in Fig. 5 A, the addition of EGTA to wild type and S1179D eNOS reduced NO production in a concentration-dependent manner. However, NO production from S1179D eNOS was less sensitive to the addition of EGTA;i.e. wild type eNOS activity declined more rapidly at lower concentrations of EGTA than did S1179D eNOS activity. The greatest difference in activity between the enzymes was seen at 400 μm EGTA. Furthermore, at 600 μm EGTA, no activity was detected for wild type eNOS, whereas residual activity was still detected for S1179D eNOS. Similar results were obtained using cytochrome c reduction (Fig. 5 B), with significant differences in activity seen with 400 and 600 μm chelator added to the reaction. However, at the highest concentration of EGTA, residual reductase activity was found for both wild type and S1179D eNOS. In a cellular context, the production of NO from eNOS is regulated by calcium-calmodulin (2.Forstermann U. Pollock J.S. Schmidt H.H. Heller M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutation of serine 1179 to aspartate, to mimic the negative charge afforded by the phosphate, results in a form of eNOS that constitutively produces NO when the mutant cDNA is transfected into cells (12.Dimmeler S.

Moreover, increasing the ratio of phospho- to dephospho-eNOS by infection of endothelial cells with an adenovirus that expresses constitutively active Akt results in greater NOS activity at lower free calcium levels, whereas a dominant negative kinase reduces calcium-dependent activation of eNOS (12.Dimmeler S.

In order to elucidate the mechanism of how phosphorylation may regulate NO synthesis, we have compared the activities of wild type and S1179D eNOS. Here, we show that, using recombinantly expressed and purified proteins, mutation of serine 1179 to aspartate increases thek cat of eNOS without substantially changing the apparent affinities for l-arginine, CaM, and calcium. However, the increase in the k cat of S1179D eNOS may be explained, in part, by markedly increased basal and CaM-stimulated reductase activities and reduced inactivation by EGTA. These data suggest that aspartate 1179 can influence electron flux through the reductase domain and CaM dissociation during catalysis. The low specific activity of eNOS relative to inducible and neuronal NOSs is a subject of intense investigation. Recent studies have suggested that the rate of cytochrome c reduction and electron flux through eNOS is much slower than that measured in inducible NOS and neuronal NOS, suggesting that regulation of electron flux from NADPH through the flavins in the reductase portion of the protein to the heme domain in the oxygenase domain may control the rate of NO synthesis (27.Nishida C.R.

Commun. 1999; 265: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It has been shown for all NOS isoforms that CaM can regulate electron flux from the flavin centers to heme, as well as electron flow within the reductase domain (1.Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The presence of a CaM autoinhibitory loop in the FMN domain of eNOS and neuronal NOS, missing in inducible NOS (30.Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), suggests that removal of this loop is necessary prior to CaM binding to the canonical CaM binding motif and activation of NOS as seen in other CaM requiring proteins (31.Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). This issue has been recently addressed by Nishida and Ortiz de Montellano (27.Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), who have shown that deletion of the autoinhibitory loop in eNOS increases basal cytochrome c reductase activities while reducing CaM-stimulated reductase activity, and Daff et al. (32.Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30589-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that deletion of the 42-amino acid loop abolished the calcium/CaM dependence of neuronal NOS. The former authors also demonstrated that “loopless” eNOS has a 3-fold higher specific activity and exhibits a greater sensitivity toward free calcium assayed at fixed CaM levels relative to wild type enzyme. This suggests that the loop, per se, negatively regulates NO synthesis even in the presence of CaM and affects the calcium dependence of eNOS. In the present study, mutation of serine 1179 to aspartate in eNOS increased the rate of NO synthesis (2-fold) and basal cytochromec reductase activity (2–4-fold), consistent with loopless eNOS. Moreover, CaM-stimulated reductase activity was always greater in S1179D eNOS, but the fold enhancement of CaM-stimulated cytochromec reduction was less for S1179D eNOS compared with the wild type protein. Simply stated, mutation of serine to aspartate improves basal electron flux through the reductase domain, and augments CaM-stimulated activation of reductase activity to a level greater than that seen with maximally activated wild type eNOS, analogous to loopless eNOS. In contrast to deletion of the autoinhibitory loop, the increase in specific activity of S1179D eNOS occurred without a substantial change in the apparent affinity of eNOS for calcium, CaM, and l-arginine. In experiments using loopless eNOS, theK D(app) for calcium was 20 nm, compared with 150 nm for wild type enzyme, whereas the differences in calcium activation in the present experiments were not as great for wild type versus S1179D eNOS. These data imply that the increase in basal NO production in cells transfected with S1179D eNOS or after phosphorylation at this site is unlikely, due to complete displacement of the autoinhibitory domain (mimicked by loopless eNOS), but more likely is due to a higher rate of turnover with little change in the apparent calcium sensitivity of the enzyme. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional sites of phosphorylation or other posttranslational control mechanisms may regulate autoinhibitory loop displacement, in vivo. The only observed difference in cofactor utilization was for NADPH. S1179D eNOS had a 4-fold higher K m for NADPH than did wild type eNOS when NO production was measured and a 2–5-fold higher K m when cytochrome c reduction was quantified. Although the apparent affinity of NADPH was lower in S1179D eNOS, the rates of NO production and reductase activity were greater than those of wild type eNOS. The reasons for this are not known, but they may relate to the equilibrium of NADPH/NADP+ with the enzyme. Another interesting finding of this paper is that eNOS inactivation by EGTA was dramatically different in S1179D eNOS compared with wild type enzyme. Because the rate of NO production was linear during our measurements, the ability of EGTA to slow NOS activity was likely due to rapid chelation of free calcium in the buffer followed by changing the equilibrium of calcium-dependent activation of CaM and the subsequent binding of activated CaM to the enzyme. The relative EGTA resistance of S1179D eNOS can be interpreted in at least two ways,i.e. either that aspartate at 1179 prevents the ability of EGTA to access calcium tightly bound to CaM or that the negative charge at 1179 slows the dissociation of CaM from NOS when free calcium levels are diminishing. Regardless of the precise mechanism, aspartate at 1179 results in greater NOS activity at any free calcium level, consistent with greater NO release and NOS activity in cells transfected with S1179D or in endothelial cells expressing constitutively active Akt. In summary, our findings suggest that phosphorylation of eNOS at serine 1179 (mimicked by aspartate) increases NOS catalytic activity by enhancing electron flux through the reductase domain and by reducing CaM dissociation. This novel mechanism may explain, in part, why S1179D eNOS and phospho-eNOS produce NO at resting levels of calcium. Our data also implies that the “calcium-independent NO production” following shear stress or insulin activation of Akt and eNOS phosphorylation may be more correctly stated as NO production that occurs without a further rise in intracellular calcium because phosphorylation permits greater eNOS activation to occur at any level of calcium without substantially changing the affinity of calcium-activated CaM for eNOS. At this time, we cannot rule out the possibility that removal of the autoinhibitory loop occurs, in conjunction with eNOS phosphorylation, in vivo. However, phosphorylation at Ser-1179 is critical for NO release because mutations that block Akt-induced phosphorylation also block agonist- and shear-induced NO release. As a corollary to this hypothesis, it is possible that Akt-dependent phosphorylation of serine 1179 stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor, a calcium/CaM-dependent agonist for NO synthesis (5.Papapetropoulos A. Garcia-Cardena G. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar), permits transient, burst-like NO release that is contemporaneously attenuated by a calcium/CaM-dependent inactivation process. This inactivation process would remove CaM tightly bound to eNOS and would most likely be different from the inactivation mechanism triggered by shear stress, which is a persistent stimulus for NO release in the absence of a change in cytoplasmic calcium. This concept is supported by results demonstrating that CaM binding to eNOS increases its phosphorylation by Akt (10.Michell B.J. Griffiths J.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Tiganis T.

We investigated the cis-acting elements of the COX-2 5'-flanking sequence, the transcription factors and signaling pathways responsible for transcriptional activation of the COX-2 gene in endotoxin-treated murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. Luciferase reporter constructs with alterations in presumptive cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements demonstrate that the cyclic AMP-response element and two nuclear factor interleukin-6 (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)) sites of the COX-2 promoter are required for optimal endotoxin-dependent induction. In contrast, the E-box and NF-kappaB sites are not required for endotoxin-dependent induction. Inhibition of endotoxin-induced NF-kappaB activation by expression of an inhibitor-kappaB alpha mutant does not block endotoxin-dependent COX-2 reporter activity. Overexpression of c-Jun, C/EBPbeta, and C/EBPdelta enhances induction of the COX-2 reporter, while overexpression of cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein or C/EBPbeta represses COX-2 induction. In addition, endotoxin rapidly and transiently elicits c-Jun phosphorylation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Cotransfection of the COX-2 reporter with dominant negative expression vectors shows that endotoxin-induced COX-2 gene expression requires signaling through a Ras-independent pathway involving the adapter protein ECSIT and the signaling kinases MEKK1 and JNK. In contrast, endotoxin-induced COX-2 reporter activity is not blocked by overexpression of dominant-negative forms of Raf-1, ERK1, or ERK2."

The difference in size of the recombinant (∼1.4 MDa) and native (∼700 kDa) apoptosome complexes led us to question the relative significance of these two large complexes in processing caspases during dATP-dependent activation and apoptotic cell death.

However, only the ∼700-kDa complex is capable of processing and activating effector caspases.

Sun X-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23.Zhu H. Dinsdale D. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Lysates (100,000 × gsupernatants) from THP.1 cells were prepared as described previously and activated by incubation (10 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C with 2 mm dATP and 2 mm MgCl2 (19.Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These cell lysates contained low but detectable levels of cytochromec and did not require the addition of exogenous cytochromec for full caspase activation. DEVDase activity (i.e. primarily caspase-3 and -7) of lysates or column fractions was measured (λex/λem = 405/510 nm) at 37 °C in 96-well plates in 200 μl of assay buffer (20 μm Z-DEVD.AFC, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm HEPES, and 10% sucrose, pH 7.0) using a Wallac Victor2 1420 Multilabel counter. The 96-well plates were assayed for 10 cycles, and cleavage rates were determined by linear regression. The protease activities were expressed as either pmol/min/mg protein or pmol/min/fraction. Lysates were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, using a fast protein liquid chromatography protein purification system on analytical (16/60), preparative (26/60) Hi-Prep S300 Sephacryl high-resolution (19.Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and Superose 6 HR 10/30 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Herts, UK). The Sephacryl columns were eluted at 4 °C with 5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.0, and fractions collected. The Superose 6 column was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 50 mmNaCl, at 0.4 ml/min, and 0.5- or 1.0-ml fractions were collected. The columns were calibrated with protein standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), including blue dextran, thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and bovine heart cytochromec (Sigma) with some of their sizes (kDa) indicated in Fig.1. Some differences (see Results) were noted in the elution profiles of the effector caspases on S300 and Superose 6 columns. This was most probably because of addition of 50 mm NaCl in the buffer, which ensured good separation of large protein complexes on Superose 6 columns. To assess the biological activities of the ∼1.4-MDa and ∼700-kDa apoptosome complexes, we developed a simple in vitro assay. Briefly, apoptosome complexes were isolated from apoptotic or dATP-treated lysates by Superose 6 gel filtration as described above. The appropriate column fractions (100 μl aliquots) were then incubated with procaspases (25 μg of protein) for 30 min before assaying for DEVDase activity. The procaspases were obtained following fractionation of control lysates (fractions 18–20) by gel filtration on a preparative (26/60) Hi-Prep S300 Sephacryl high-resolution column. These fractions, which contained procaspase-3, -7, and -9, were concentrated in Vivaspin 4 (Vivascience, Lincoln, UK) concentrators (10 kDa cut-off) to a final concentration of 8–14 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C prior to use. In preliminary experiments, it was determined that the isolated active apoptosome complexes required neither dATP/ATP nor cytochrome c to process added procaspases, presumably because these cofactors are only required for the proper oligomerization of Apaf-1. Thus, this assay measures the ability of an assembled Apaf-1 complex to both process and activate effector caspase-3 and -7. In our previous study, a Sephacryl S300 column was used to characterize the apoptosome as an ∼700-kDa complex (19.Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Because this column cannot accurately resolve complexes of 700–1500 kDa, we used a Superose 6 high-resolution analytical gel filtration column, which can resolve complexes up to 4 MDa. In control lysates, both procaspase-9 and -3 eluted as their free unprocessed zymogens (Fig. 1 A,fractions 22–28) and Apaf-1 eluted as a single peak (Fig.1 A, fractions 18–24), with an estimatedM r ≤ 158,000, indicating that it was most likely a monomer. After dATP activation of the lysate for 1 h, a dramatic change in the elution behavior of Apaf-1 and the caspases was observed. Apaf-1 was now associated predominantly with ∼1.4-MDa and ∼700-kDa apoptosome complexes (Fig. 1 B, fractions 6–8 and fractions 10–15, respectively) with a small amount remaining as monomeric Apaf-1 (Fig. 1 B,fractions 19–22). After dATP activation, most of the procaspase-9 was processed to its catalytically active large subunits (p35/p37 subunits), which eluted with the ∼1.4-MDa and ∼700-kDa apoptosome complexes, and also as the free processed caspase (Fig.1 B). Procaspase-3 was completely processed to its catalytically active large subunits (p17/19) (Fig. 1 B), which co-eluted with all the DEVDase activity (Fig. 1 C,fractions 21–28, M r = ∼60,000). The ∼1.4-MDa and ∼700-kDa apoptosome complexes were also assayed for their ability to activate exogenous effector caspases. Only the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex (Fig. 1 C, fractions 10–15) actively processed the effector caspases as assayed by the induced DEVDase activity. Thus, following dATP activation, two large apoptosome complexes of ∼700 kDa and ∼1.4 MDa were formed, but only the ∼700-kDa complex appeared to constitute the correctly assembled and functionally active apoptosome. To understand the relationship between the ∼700-kDa and ∼1.4-MDa apoptosome complexes, we studied their time-dependent formation and activities following dATP activation. The ∼700-kDa complex was more rapidly formed than the ∼1.4-MDa complex (Fig. 2 A). Production of the ∼700-kDa complex was maximal within 5 min of initiating dATP activation, whereas assembly of the ∼1.4-MDa complex did not reach a maximum until after 20 min (Fig. 2 A). However, only the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex exhibited significant biological activity as assessed by its ability to process caspases to yield active effector caspase activity (DEVDase, Fig. 2 B). The biological activity of the assembled ∼700-kDa complex was almost maximal 5 min after activation was initiated, whereas the ∼1.4-MDa complex was virtually inactive at all time points measured (Fig.2 B). To determine whether the ∼700-kDa and/or ∼1.4-MDa apoptosome complexes were formed during apoptosis, lysates were prepared from control and apoptotic cells and fractionated using a Superose 6 column. Apoptosis was induced in THP.1 cells by two different stimuli, i.e. etoposide and TPCK (22.MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23.Zhu H. Dinsdale D. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which gave 30 and 38% apoptosis, respectively, as determined by Annexin V binding. All of the Apaf-1 in lysates isolated from control cells eluted as the free ∼130-kDa monomeric form (Fig.3 A). In marked contrast, Apaf-1, in lysates from etoposide or TPCK-treated THP.1 cells, eluted mainly as the free monomeric form or as the ∼700-kDa complex, and little if any Apaf-1 eluted as an ∼1.4-MDa complex (Fig. 3,B and C). Furthermore, only the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex processed and activated effector caspases (Fig. 3,B and C), suggesting that this was the biologically active complex which was formed during etoposide- or TPCK-induced apoptosis. Thus, in THP.1 cells, induction of apoptosis by either etoposide or TPCK resulted in the formation of an ∼700-kDa caspase processing complex. Reconstitution studies with recombinant proteins have shown that Apaf-1 and caspase-9 in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP forms a very large (∼1.4 MDa) apoptosome complex (17.Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 18.Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). This complex was active as judged by its ability to process 35S- labeled procaspase-9 and -3. However, in the current study we have demonstrated that, during dATP-dependent activation of cell lysates, two large apoptosome complexes with M rvalues of ∼700 kDa and ∼1.4 MDa were formed (Figs. 1 and 2). The rate of formation of the ∼700-kDa complex was very rapid (within 5–10 min) compared with the formation of the ∼1.4-MDa complex (∼20 min). Moreover, the ∼700-kDa complex efficiently processed exogenous caspases, whereas the ∼1.4-MDa complex was relatively inactive (Figs.1 and 2). Why the ∼1.4-MDa apoptosome complex was incapable of caspase processing is unclear because both complexes contained oligomerized Apaf-1 and processed caspase-9 (Fig. 1). We cannot rule out the possibility that an inhibitor is associated with the larger complex or alternatively that the ∼1.4-MDa complex may be inappropriately oligomerized and structurally different from the ∼1.4-MDa complex previously described (17.Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 18.Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the ∼700-kDa complex does not appear to be formed when reconstitution of the apoptosome is carried out with recombinant Apaf-1, procaspase-9, cytochrome c, and dATP (17.Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 18.Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). The biological significance of two large Apaf-1 apoptosome complexes is as yet unclear. However, our experiments with apoptotic lysates provide important evidence which indicates that the ∼700-kDa complex is the biologically significant complex that is formed during apoptosis. Thus, in THP.1 cells using two unrelated stimuli, i.e. a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide) and a serine chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitor (TPCK), we have demonstrated that the predominant complex formed is an ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex (Fig. 3). Taken together our results suggest that the ∼700-kDa complex is the major form of the apoptosome formed in vivo and that the correct assembly of the apoptosome may require other factors present in cell lysates, in addition to Apaf-1, cytochrome c, dATP, and caspase-9. Thus, clear differences exist in the apoptosome complexes formed in vitro from recombinant proteins when compared with those assembled in cell lysates and during apoptosis. In summary, following dATP activation of lysates, two Apaf-1-containing complexes are formed, a biologically inactive ∼1.4-MDa and a biologically active ∼700-kDa apoptosome. Kinetic analysis demonstrates a more rapid formation of the smaller ∼700-kDa complex, which exhibits significant caspase-activating activity. In apoptotic cells, the ∼700-kDa complex predominates, and we therefore propose that the ∼700-kDa complex is the functionally active form of the apoptosome in apoptosis.

We now report that treatment of TSE-infected animals with three such compounds increased survival time from 50 to 300%.

Defective Cl−transport occurs in hereditary and acquired human diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CFTR1deficiency), nephrolithiasis (ClC5 deficiency), and cholera. Cl− transport across intracellular vesicle membranes in the endosomal and secretory compartments has been proposed to facilitate vesicular acidification and regulate trafficking events. However, there have been no measurements of Cl−concentration or transport in subcellular organelles in living cells. Cl− concentration in cytoplasm and Cl−transport across cell plasma membranes has been measured using Cl− sensitive fluorescent indicators. Our laboratory introduced quinolinium-type Cl− indicators whose fluorescence is quenched by Cl− by a collisional mechanism (1.Mansoura M. Biwersi J. Ashlock M. Verkman A.S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 861-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2.Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C375-C388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Analysis of YFP crystallographic structure indicated several cavities in the vicinity of the chromophore and that the substitution of His148 to Gly permitted solvent access to the chromophore (22.Wachter R.M.

It was found that YFP fluorescence was sensitive not only to pH, but also to various anions (23.Wachter R.M. Remington S.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R628-R629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to establish the mechanism of YFP Cl− sensitivity by spectroscopic measurements on purified protein and to examine the utility of YFP as an intracellular Cl−/halide sensor. The mutant YFP-H148Q was studied because of its relatively high Cl− sensitivity at cytoplasmic pH. Steady-state titrations, time-resolved fluorescence, circular dichroism, photobleaching, and stopped-flow kinetic analysis indicated a ground-state Cl−/YFP-H148Q binding mechanism. Anion transport measurements in mammalian cells expressing YFP-H148Q established the utility of YFP-H148Q as a cellular halide indicator.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFig. 1 A shows steady-state fluorescence pH titrations of purified YFP-H148Q in aqueous solutions containing specified [Cl−]. In the absence of Cl−, the data fitted well to a single site titration model (Hill coefficient 0.90) with pK a7.14 ± 0.02. Apparent pK a values increased by nearly one unit with increasing [Cl−] with Hill coefficients remaining near unity. The increased pK awith Cl− indicates stabilization of the protonated form of YFP-H148Q.Fig. 1 B shows the decrease in YFP-H148Q fluorescence with increasing [Cl−] at constant pH. At a typical cytoplasmic pH, a 10% change in fluorescence occurs for an increase in [Cl−] from 0 to 40 mm. The fluorescence decrease was saturable with a maximal ∼2-fold reduction in fluorescence at high [Cl−]. The fluorescence intensity of YFP-H148Q was more sensitive to I− with a >50% decrease in fluorescence at 30 mm I−. Similar titrations at pH 7.5 indicated that YFP-H148Q fluorescence is sensitive to many anions with relative potencies: F− ∼ ClO4− > I− > SCN− > NO3− > Br− > Cl− > formate > acetate (TableI). YFP-H148Q fluorescence was not sensitive to sulfate, gluconate, isethionate, phosphate, and cations. The anion selectivity sequence correlates with the lyotropic series, ClO3− > I− > SCN− > NO3− > Br− > Cl− > acetate > sulfate > F− (based on the ion dehydration energies) (26.Halm D.R. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 339-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), with the exception of fluoride, suggesting that the bigger ions having lower dehydration energies bind more strongly to the putative anion binding site. The anomalous strong fluoride binding may result from steric effects.Table IBinding constants and maximal fluorescence decrease for YFP-H148Q quenching by anions at pH 7.5AnionK dΔFmm%F−688Cl−10050Br−15054I−2185NO3−6266SCN−4086ClO4−2188Formate12048Gluconate00SO42−00Phosphate00Isethionate00K d is the anion concentration at half-maximal fluorescence decrease. ΔF is the maximum percentage decrease in fluorescence at high [anion]. Open table in a new tab Time-resolved fluorescence measurements showed a lifetime of 3.1 ns and apparent rotational correlation time of 13 ns, consistent with that of ∼10 ns predicted for a 27,000-kDa spherical protein (YFP-H148Q monomeric size). These values were independent of pH (6.0–8.0) and [Cl−] (0–400 mm). The rotational correlation time increased with solution viscosity without evidence for segmental depolarizing rotations, indicating that theYFP-H148Q chromophore is rigidly fixed in its β-barrel structure. These results implicate a static Cl− sensitivity mechanism probably involving binding of Cl− to site(s) on the YFP-H148Q protein.Absorption and CD spectroscopy provided further support for a Cl− binding mechanism. Fig. 1 C shows absorption titrations of YFP-H148Q at pH 6.4 at different [Cl−]. Two absorption peaks were observed, at 514 and 416 nm, corresponding to the neutral and anionic forms of the YFP-H148Q chromophore. The parallel [Cl−]-dependent changes in absorbance and fluorescence indicates that Cl− affects YFP-H148Q molar absorbance rather than quantum yield, as predicted by the lifetime results. The absence of a distinct isosbestic point indicates an equilibrium involving more than two absorbing species. The 10–20 nm blue shift in the absorption maximum at 416 nm suggests that destabilization of the transition dipole of neutral form results from a decrease in the polarity of the environment near the chromophore, providing evidence for ground-state Cl−/YFP-H148Q binding. CD analysis in the visible region showed two negative peaks at 415 and 516 nm (Fig. 1 D), corresponding to the anionic and neutral forms of the chromophore, respectively. Cl− or F− addition induced a blue shift of the peak at 415 nm and a change in molar ellipticity at both wavelengths, indicating that anion binding alters the symmetry of the chromophore environment and destablizes the absorption transition dipole of the protonated form of YFP-H148Q.Stopped-flow fluorescence measurements were done to establish a kinetic mechanism for the interactions of Cl− with the protonated and deprotonated forms of YFP-H148Q. Aqueous YFP-H148Q solutions were subjected to rapid changes in pH or [Cl−]. Fig.2 A shows the fluorescence response to a 1.0 unit pH increase and decrease in the absence (top) and presence (bottom) of 100 mmCl−. The time course data for the pH change from 8 to 7 in the absence of Cl− was reversible and fitted well to a monoexponential decay with a t 12 of 7 ms. The time course data in the presence of Cl− was biexponential with a fast component of t 12 8–12 ms and a slow component of t 12 102–106 ms. The fast component corresponded to the prototropic equilibrium of unbound YFP-H148Q. Fig.2 B shows the response at pH 8.1 and pH 6.4 to rapid Cl− addition and dilution at constant pH. At pH 8.0, Cl− binding and dissociation were relatively slow (t 12 190 and 230 ms, respectively); at pH 6.4, thet 12 were 66 and 76 ms. A kinetic model which incorporates all of these quantitative results is given in Fig.2 C. The model contains four equilibria involving YFP-H148Q protonation and Cl− binding. The rate constants for each process and the relative fluorescence for the four YFP-H148Q species are given in the figure legend.Figure 2A, stopped-flow kinetic analysis of YFP-H148Q fluorescence response to rapid changes in pH from 8 to 7, and 7 to 8, in the absence (top) and presence (bottom) of 100 mm [Cl−].

Hanson G.T. Kallio K. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5296-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Spot photobleaching measurements were done to examine the accessibility of the chromophore to exogenously added triplet-state quenchers. Fig. 2 D(top) shows irreversible photobleaching of YFP-H148Q giving a diffusion coefficient of 1.1 × 10−6cm2/s, similar to that of GFP (27.Swaminathan R. Hoang C.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In addition, a fast reversible fluorescence recovery process was identified with exponential time constants in the range 3–5 ms (bottom,left curve). Similar recovery processes in GFP-S65T and fluorescein were shown to arise from triplet-state quenching processes (27.Swaminathan R. Hoang C.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 28.Periasamy N. Bicknese S. Verkman A.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The efficiency (bleach depth) and recovery rates for reversible fluorescein photobleaching were sensitive to triplet state quenchers, including the small molecules oxygen, azide, and Mn2+, whereas the reversible photobleaching of GFP-S65T and YFP-H148Q (Fig. 2 D, bottom curves) are not, suggesting that the chromophore in YFP-H148Q is not exposed directly to aqueous-phase quenchers. Together, the biophysical analysis indicates that Cl− modifies YFP-H148Q fluorescence by binding to a site close to the chromophore where it alters the electrostatic environment producing a change in apparent pK a.YFP-H148Q was expressed in mammalian cells to test its utility as a cellular Cl− indicator. As reported for various GFPs, YFP-H148Q was expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus with an aqueous-phase staining pattern (Fig.3 A). Titrations using solutions containing high K+ and ionophores were done to determine the sensitivity of intracellular YFP-H148Q fluorescence to pH and [Cl−]. Fig. 3 B shows reversible changes in YFP-H148Q fluorescence in response to pH changes at 0 Cl− with an apparent pK a of 6.84, similar to that measured in aqueous solutions in the absence of Cl−. Fig. 3 C shows reversible changes in YFP-H148Q fluorescence at pH 7.4 in response to changes in [Cl−], with 50% decrease in fluorescence at ∼140 mm Cl−, similar to that measured in aqueous solutions.Figure 3YFP-H148Q expression in transfected Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts.

An important application of fluorescent halide indicators has been in the functional analysis of CFTR and cystic fibrosis-causing CFTR mutations. CFTR functions as a cAMP-activated channel that effectively conducts Cl−, NO3− and I−, with lesser conductance for gluconate (29.Dawson D.C. Smith S.S. Mansoura M.K. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S47-S75Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In cells expressing CFTR and bathed in forskolin-containing solutions to activate CFTR, replacement of solution Cl− by gluconate (to drive Cl−efflux) produced a small (∼12%) increase in cellular fluorescence (Fig. 4 A, top). The increase was not observed in control cells not expressing CFTR (data not shown). In response to Cl−/NO3− exchange, cellular fluorescence was slightly decreased (Fig. 4 A,middle), as predicted, since YFP-H148Q fluorescence is more sensitive to NO3− than to Cl−. The small change in cellular YFP-H148Q fluorescence is in agreement with that predicted for a ∼25 mm change in cytoplasmic [Cl−] produced by Cl−/NO3− exchange in cells with a normal interior negative potential.Figure 4CFTR-mediated Cl− transport detected by changes in intracellular YFP-H148Q fluorescence. A, CFTR-expressing cells were perfused with PBS containing forskolin to activate CFTR. Where indicated Cl− was replaced with gluconate (top), NO3− (middle), or I− (bottom). B, forskolin-stimulated Cl−/I− transport. Cells (top, CFTR-expressing; bottom, control) were initially perfused with a phosphate buffer containing 100 mm I−followed by perfusion with PBS and then addition of 20 μmforskolin as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To increase the signal size for assays of anion transporters like CFTR, we exploited the observations that YFP-H148Q fluorescence is substantially more sensitive to I− than to Cl− (Fig. 1 B) and that anion channels conduct I− efficiently. Cl−/I− exchange is the protocol generally used in fluorescence assays of CFTR conductance (1.Mansoura M. Biwersi J. Ashlock M. Verkman A.S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 861-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A (bottom) shows large changes in fluorescence with Cl−/I− exchange. Fig. 4 B shows a Cl−/I− exchange protocol in which cells were initially perfused with a 100 mm iodide buffer and then with PBS. Addition of the cAMP agonist forskolin produced a substantial increase in fluorescence as cytoplasmic I− was replaced by Cl−. This large signal change is comparable with that observed for the best chemical halide indicator developed to date, LZQ (6.Jayaraman S. Teitler L. Skalski B. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1008-C1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The biophysical and cellular studies establish the mechanism of YFP-H148Q anion sensitivity and its utility as a sensitive fluorescent halide indicator for quantitative transport measurements in living cells. Changes in YFP-H148Q fluorescence are rapid, reversible, and halide-specific for suitable experimental protocols as used here. The excellent brightness and iodide sensitivity of YFP-H148Q, together with its targetable cellular expression, make it extremely useful in a wide variety of biological applications. The noninvasive loading and perfect cell retention of YFP-H148Q make it preferable to chemical halide indicators, such as SPQ and LZQ, for many studies. For example, a major goal in cystic fibrosis research is the identification of compounds that restore normal halide conductance in cells expressing ΔPhe508 CFTR, the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis. High throughput screening of compound libraries would be efficiently carried out in cells stably expressing YFP-H148Q and ΔPhe508 CFTR. Similarly, mammalian expression cDNA libraries would be efficiently screened for novel anion channels using YFP-H148Q expressing cells as the host cell. Finally, YFP mutants provide a possible approach to study halide concentrations and transport in subcellular organelles. Transport of Cl− across cell plasma membranes is required in many cellular processes such as cell volume regulation and epithelial fluid absorption and secretion. Defective Cl−transport occurs in hereditary and acquired human diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CFTR1deficiency), nephrolithiasis (ClC5 deficiency), and cholera. Cl− transport across intracellular vesicle membranes in the endosomal and secretory compartments has been proposed to facilitate vesicular acidification and regulate trafficking events. However, there have been no measurements of Cl−concentration or transport in subcellular organelles in living cells. Cl− concentration in cytoplasm and Cl−transport across cell plasma membranes has been measured using Cl− sensitive fluorescent indicators. Our laboratory introduced quinolinium-type Cl− indicators whose fluorescence is quenched by Cl− by a collisional mechanism (1.Mansoura M. Biwersi J. Ashlock M. Verkman A.S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 861-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2.Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C375-C388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These indicators have been used widely to study Cl− transport mechanisms in mammalian cells, including cells expressing mutant CFTR Cl− channels and cells obtained from human subjects in CFTR gene therapy trials (1.Mansoura M. Biwersi J. Ashlock M. Verkman A.S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 861-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Various cell-permeable (3.Biwersi J. Verkman A.S.

Physiol. 1999; 277: C1008-C1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) halide indicators have been synthesized to facilitate cell measurements. The existing Cl−/halide indicators require cell loading, are not retained perfectly within cells, and cannot be targeted easily to subcellular organelles. An alternative to exogenously added indicators is the use of an endogenously expressed chromophore such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). Using appropriate targeting sequences, GFPs have been targeted selectively to numerous intracellular sites (7.De Giorgi F. Brini M. Bastianutto C. Marsault R. Montero M. Pizzo P. Rossi R. Rizzuto R.

We have isolated the mouse Smad6 promoter and identified the regions responsible for transcriptional activation by BMPs. The proximal BMP-responsive element (PBE) in the Smad6 promoter is important for the transcriptional activation by BMPs and contains a 28-base pair GC-rich sequence including four overlapping copies of the GCCGnCGC-like motif, which is a binding site for DrosophilaMad and Medea. We generated a luciferase reporter construct (3GC2-Lux) containing three repeats of the GC-rich sequence derived from the PBE. BMPs and BMP receptors induced transcriptional activation of 3GC2-Lux in various cell types, and this activation was enhanced by cotransfection of BMP-responsive Smads, i.e. Smad1 or Smad5. Moreover, direct DNA binding of BMP-responsive Smads and common-partner Smad4 to the GC-rich sequence of PBE was observed. These results indicate that the expression of Smad6 is regulated by the effects of BMP-activated Smad1/5 on the Smad6promoter.

Smads can be classified into three subclasses based on their structure and function, i.e. receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common-partner Smads (Co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads). Among the various R-Smads in mammals, Smad1, Smad5, and presumably Smad8 are activated by BMP receptors, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by TGF-β or activin receptors. R-Smads then form complexes with the Co-Smad Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate transcription of various target genes. I-Smads, including Smad6 and Smad7, stably interact with activated type I receptors and compete with R-Smads for activation by the receptors (3.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-i.

Importantly, expression of some of these signal-regulating molecules is controlled through the activities of TGF-β-like factors themselves (23.Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H.

Expression of I-Smads is regulated by various extracellular stimuli, including peptide growth factors (28.Afrakhte M. Morén A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Interferon-γ induces the expression of Smad7; cells treated with interferon-γ thus become resistant to the effect of TGF-β (29.Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). I-Smads are also induced by TGF-β superfamily signaling (4.Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R.

Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and I-Smads may thus terminate TGF-β/BMP signaling through a negative feedback loop after certain lag time periods. However, it remains to be determined whether R-Smads-Co-Smads are directly involved in the induction of I-Smads or whether other non-Smad pathways participate in this process. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the autocrine switch-off signaling by Smad6, we have characterized the promoter region of the mouseSmad6 gene. We have also generated a BMP-responsive reporter construct using the Smad6 promoter. Our results demonstrated that Smad6 is induced by Smad1/5 through the activation of the BMP receptors. The 5′-region of the mouse Smad6 gene was cloned from a 129SV mouse genomic library (Stratagene) using a 701-bp SacI-SacI fragment of the mouse Smad6 cDNA (3.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-i. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) corresponding to a part of the 5′-untranslated region and N-terminal region of the mouse Smad6 as a probe. Cloning and purification of the Smad6promoter was performed as described (32.Beppu H. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells (gift of T. Momoi), human HaCaT keratinocytes (gift of N. E. Fusenig), Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells, C2C12 mouse mesenchymal cells, and COS7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured as described (7.Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Sampath T.K.

For transient transfection, 60–80% confluent cells in 6-well plates were transfected using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The original constructions of the constitutively active type I receptors and Smads have been described (3.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-i. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 34.Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Reporters containing the promoter region of the mouseSmad6 were generated by inserting the DNAs into pGL2-Basic (Promega). Reporters containing three copies of the GC-rich sequences flanked by two adenine residues were constructed by inserting the DNAs into 90COLXLUC (gift of S. Harada) containing the core promoter of the mouse collagen X ( COLX ) gene in pGL2-Basic (35.Harada S. Sampath T.K. Aubin J.E. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1832-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing the wild-type or mutant GC-rich sequences were prepared by polymerase chain reaction. After transient transfection of DNAs, cells were incubated for 24 h, and luciferase activity in the cell lysates was determined using a luminometer. Luciferase activities were normalized to sea-pansy luciferase activity under control of the thymidine kinase promoter. Gel mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (34.Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 36.Yagi K. Goto D Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole-cell extracts were prepared from COS7 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Smad5, Myc-tagged Smad4, and a constitutively active BMP type IB receptor (ALK6QD) expression constructs. For supershift analysis, antibodies were added to the whole-cell lysates. Whole-cell lysates were added to a premix solution containing poly(dI-dC), and probes were subjected to [α-32P]dCTP Klenow labeling. The final concentration of NaCl in the samples was adjusted to 50 mmusing hypotonic and hypertonic lysis buffers. Complexes were then resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by autoradiography. We obtained three overlapping clones covering the 5′ part of the mouse Smad6gene, using a part of the mouse Smad6 cDNA as a probe. Fragments obtained from the 9.5-kilobase pair region of the 5′-untranslated region of the mouse Smad6 gene (Fig.1 A) were inserted into the pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter and examined for responsiveness to BMP signaling using the BMP type II receptor (BMPR-II) and a constitutively active form of BMP type IB receptor (ALK6QD). We used P19 cells to determine the responsiveness to BMPs, because this cell line is highly transfectable and demonstrates up-regulation of the Smad6mRNA in response to BMPs. 2W. Ishida, unpublished data. Similar to the mouseSmad7 promoter recently reported by Nagarajan et al. (37.Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), a TATA box could not be found in the 5′-untranslated region of the Smad6 gene. However, multiple Sp1 sites were observed in this region (data not shown), which is common in most promoters lacking a TATA box (38.Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed a basal transcription activity, which was more than 100-fold compared with the values obtained from the parental pGL2-Basic vector, indicating the presence of a transcription initiation site in this region. As shown in Fig. 1 B, decreases in luciferase activity were observed after deletions of nucleotides −3213 to −2384, −2383 to −1912, and −1911 to −1697 (numbers from the ATG start codon). Among them, the decrease in luciferase activity was most prominent after deletion of nucleotides −1911 to −1697. These results suggest that theSmad6 promoter may contain multiple BMP-responsive regions, one of which resides in the nucleotide −1911 to −1697 region. Because the proximal region of the Smad6promoter containing nucleotides −1911 to −1697 responded to BMPs, we further examined the structure of this region. Nucleotide sequencing of PBE revealed the presence of a 28-bp GC-rich sequence (Fig.2 A), which contained three overlapping GCCGnCGC-like sequences in the 5′-portion and another GCCGnCGC-like sequence in the 3′-portion. The GCCGnCGC motif has been shown to bind Drosophila Mad and Medea (12.Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 13.Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Moreover, our current study revealed that this motif binds to mammalian Smad1 and Smad4 and that artificial promoter reporter constructs containing multiple repeats of the GCCGnCGC motif respond to BMPs (39.Kusanagi, K., Inoue, H., Ishidou, Y., Mishima, H. K., Kawabata, M., and Miyazono, K. (2000) Mol. Biol. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). Because there are no Smad binding motifs except a CAGA box, which is a binding site for Smad3/Smad4 (10.Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 11.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar), we generated various reporter constructs with or without the GC-rich sequence and CAGA box and examined responsiveness to BMPs using BMPR-II and ALK6QD in P19 cells (Fig.2 B). Deletion of the GC-rich sequence, but not the CAGA box, resulted in a slight decrease in transcriptional activity. To further study the functional importance of the GC-rich sequence in the Smad6 PBE, we constructed a heterologous luciferase reporter termed 3GC2-Lux, containing three tandemly repeated GC-rich sequences fused to the COLXpromoter inserted into pGL2-Basic. Constitutively active forms of BMP type I receptors, including ALK2 (ALK2QD), ALK3/BMPR-IA (ALK3QD), and ALK6/BMPR-IB (ALK6QD), only weakly induced transcriptional activation of 3GC2-Lux in P19 cells (Fig.3 A). Similarly, BMP-responsive R-Smads, i.e. Smad1 and Smad5, induced weak transcriptional activation. However, in the presence of Smad1 or Smad5, the BMP type I receptors strongly induced transcriptional activation of 3GC2-Lux. In contrast, the constitutively active forms of TGF-β or activin type I receptors (TβR-I/ALK5TD or ActR-IB/ALK4TD, respectively) did not activate the luciferase reporter in the presence or absence of the TGF-β/activin-responsive R-Smads, Smad2 or Smad3. Similar responsiveness to BMP type I receptors and BMP-responsive R-Smads was observed in other cell types, including HaCaT human keratinocytes (Fig. 3 B), Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells (Fig. 3 C), and C2C12 mouse mesenchymal cells (Fig.3 D). ALK2QD and ALK6QD were more potent in the transcriptional activation than ALK3QD in most cell types, although ALK3QD was more potent than the other BMP type I receptors in HaCaT cells (Fig. 3 B). In addition, Smad5 was more potent in the transcriptional activation than Smad1 in most experiments, even though expression levels of the Smad1 and Smad5 proteins were comparable when determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). We also examined the effects of various ligands on transcriptional activation of 3GC2-Lux in P19 cells (Fig. 3 E). OP-1/BMP-7 induced transcriptional activation of 3GC2-Lux, which was dramatically enhanced by transfection of Smad1 or Smad5. Smad5 was more potent than Smad1 in the transcriptional activation, similar to the results using constitutively active type I receptors. In contrast to OP-1/BMP-7, TGF-β or activin did not induce transcriptional activation in the presence and absence of Smad2 or Smad3. Interestingly, 3GC2-Lux was activated by TGF-β in Mv1Lu cells (Fig.3 F), whereas it was not activated by the constitutively active form of TβR-I/ALK5 (ALK5TD) (Fig. 3 C) or by Smad2/3 (Fig. 3 F). Moreover, Smad1/5 enhanced the transcriptional activity of TGF-β in mink lung cells. Transcriptional activation of 3GC2-Lux by TGF-β was not observed in other cell types examined in the present study (data not shown). These results suggest that TGF-β may bind to a type I receptor other than ALK5 in mink lung cells and activate 3GC2-Lux through Smad1/5 but not through Smad2/3. In agreement with this notion, TGF-β was shown to activate Smad1 in certain cell types (40.Liu X. Yue J. Frey R.S. Zhu Q. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4752-4757PubMed Google Scholar). We have also found that TGF-β binds to ALK1 in human umbilical endothelial cells and activates Smad1 and Smad5. 3T. Imamura, unpublished data. We next mutated the GC-rich sequence in 3GC2-Lux (Fig.4 A) and compared their transcriptional responses with those of the wild-type 3GC2-Lux. Mutation in the GCCGnCGC-like sequence in the 5′ portion of PBE (3GC2 mut1-Lux) resulted in the loss of transcriptional activation by BMP stimulation in the presence and absence of Smad1/5 (Fig.4 B). In contrast, mutation in the GCCGnCGC-like sequence in the 3′-portion of PBE (3GC2 mut2-Lux) rather enhanced the transcriptional activation by BMP stimulation compared with the wild-type 3GC2-Lux. These results indicate that the GCCGnCGC-like sequence in the 5′ portion of PBE is important for the BMP-responsiveness of PBE. We then examined the direct DNA binding of Smad5 and Smad4 to the GC-rich sequence of PBE. As shown in Fig. 4 C, Smad5 or Smad4 alone bound to DNA only weakly. When both Smad5 and Smad4 were transfected into COS7 cells and stimulated by cotransfection with ALK6QD, they formed DNA-binding complexes in a gel mobility shift assay (Fig.4 C, open arrowhead). Incubation of the gel shift mixture with FLAG antibody toward Smad5, or Myc or Smad4 antibody to Myc-Smad4, resulted in supershifts of DNA-binding complexes (Fig. 4 C, closed arrowheads). Binding of Smad5 was stronger than binding of Smad1 (data not shown), consistent with the higher transcriptional activity of Smad5 over Smad1 on 3GC2-Lux. Smad5 and Smad4 bound to the 3GC2 mut2 DNA but not to the mut1 DNA. Novel bands were observed when the 3GC2 mut1 DNA was used as a probe, but these bands were not significantly supershifted by the antibodies to Smad5 or Smad4. Moreover, binding of Smad5 and Smad4 to the wild-type 3GC2 probe was prevented by the unlabeled 3GC2 wild-type or mut2 DNA but only weakly by the mut1 DNA (data not shown). These results suggest that BMP-responsive R-Smads and Smad4 bind to the GCCGnCGC-like motif preferentially at the 5′ portion in the GC-rich sequence, which may be crucial for efficient transcriptional activation of the Smad6 promoter. Signaling of the members of the TGF-β superfamily is negatively regulated by multiple mechanisms. These regulatory molecules are often induced by the TGF-β-like factors themselves. Although Smads are the central molecules in the TGF-β signaling pathways, it has not been fully determined whether such negative feedback regulation occurs as a direct effect of Smads or indirectly through other non-Smad pathways. Recently, expression of the mouse Smad7 has been reported to be induced by direct binding of Smad3 activated by TGF-β/activin receptors and Smad4 to the CAGA box (37.Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Our present findings revealed that the Smad6 mRNA is directly induced by Smad1/5 activated by the BMP receptors. Because Smad6 preferentially inhibits the effects of BMPs, our results indicate that Smad6 terminates BMP signaling of Smad1/5-Smad4 through a negative feedback loop. We thank Dr. T.

Maspin expression was detected in normal breast and prostate epithelial cells, whereas tumor cells exhibited reduced or no expression. However, the regulatory mechanism of maspin expression remains unknown. We report here a rapid and robust induction of maspin expression in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, DU145, and PC3) and breast tumor cells (MCF7) following wild type p53 expression from an adenovirus p53 expression vector (AdWTp53). p53 activates the maspin promoter by binding directly to the p53 consensus-binding site present in the maspin promoter. DNA-damaging agents and cytotoxic drugs induced endogenous maspin expression in cells containing the wild type p53. Maspin expression was refractory to the DNA-damaging agents in cells containing mutant p53. These results, combined with recent studies of the tumor metastasis suppressor geneKAI1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1), define a new category of molecular targets of p53 that have the potential to negatively regulate tumor invasion and/or metastasis.

Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The maspin gene encodes a 42-kDa protein and belongs to the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily with tissue type plasminogen activator as the possible protease target (2.Sheng S. Truong B. Fredrickson D. Wu R. Pardee A.B. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Maspin expression was detected in normal breast and prostate epithelial cells; however, tumor cells showed a decreased expression or absence of expression. Expression of maspin in breast tumor cells inhibit tumor cell invasionin vitro and tumor cell metastasis in vivo (1.Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Neutralization of maspin by an anti-maspin antibody abolished the invasion suppressive effect of conditioned medium from cultured breast myoepithelial cells on tumor cells (3.Shao Z.M. Nguyen M. Alpaugh M.L. O'Connell J.T. Barsky S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A recent report also suggests that the tumor suppressive effects of manganese-containing superoxide dismutase in human breast cancer cells could result from the up-regulation of maspin (4.Li J.J. Colburn N.H. Oberley L.W. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Gamma linolenic acid, an essential fatty acid with anticancer properties, is reported to induce maspin expression and affect the motility of cancer cells (5.Jiang W.G. Hiscox S. Horrobin D.F. Bryce R.P. Mansel R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity of maspin expression differed between prostate normal and tumor cells (6.Zhang M. Maass N. Magit D. Sager R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 179-186PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that maspin expression plays important roles in regulating tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Thus, an understanding of the regulation of maspin expression is important in designing therapeutic agents for the cancer treatment. Molecular targets of p53, e.g. p53-regulated genes or p53-interacting proteins, have provided critical information central to the current understanding of the biochemical and biologic function of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The function of p53 as check point protein is now well established (7.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). p53-regulated genes have also defined the role of p53 in apoptosis, hypoxia, and angiogenesis (8.Bouvet M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2288-2292PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Dameron K.M. Science. 1994; 265: 1582-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 10.Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). However, the downstream targets of p53 remain to be defined in the process of cancer cell invasion/metastasis. In our search for molecular targets of p53 involved in cell invasion and metastasis, we have now discovered that maspin expression is regulated by wild type (wt)1 p53. In this report, we provide biochemical and cellular biologic evidence demonstrating that maspin is directly regulated by p53. Prostate tumor cell lines DU145, LNCaP, and PC3, breast tumor cell line MCF7, and colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and were maintained in the growth medium recommended by the supplier. Experimental conditions for infection of the cells with recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing wild type p53, p21 waf/cip1, or p27 have been described previously (11.Craig C. Wersto R. Kim M.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1207-1212PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells by RNAzol method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ten μg of total RNA were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with a solution (5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5) containing a randomly labeled 32P cDNA probes at 40 °C for 18–20 h. The membrane was washed twice at room temperature with a 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS solution followed by two washes with a 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS solution at 50 °C. The membrane was then exposed to x-ray film. The DNA fragments used for hybridization were generated by PCR from normal prostate cDNA (CLONTECH). The maspin probe was a 585-bp PCR product spanning nucleotides 576–1160. The p21 waf1/cip1 was a 318-bp fragment spanning nucleotides 1745–2035 of the p21 waf1/cip1 cDNA. The p27 probe was a 597-bp fragment spanning nucleotides 1–597 of the p27 cDNA. The identity of PCR-derived probes was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A maspin monoclonal antibody was obtained from PharMingen. Total cellular lysate was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed using the ECL system. The wild type and mutant p53 expression plasmids used in the luciferase assay were described previously (13.Srivastava S. Wang S. Tong Y.A. Pirollo K. Chang E.H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2449-2456PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter region of maspin was amplified by PCR according to the reported DNA sequence (6.Zhang M. Maass N. Magit D. Sager R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 179-186PubMed Google Scholar). The pM-Luc(−759) was generated by primers GAGACTCGAGGCTGAAGTACAGTGGTTAG (with theXhoI site) and GAGAAAGCTTAGAAGCAGCGGTGGCTCACC (with theHindIII site). The pM-Luc(−596) was generated by primers GAGACTCGAGGTTGGTCTCAAACTCCTG (with the XhoI site) and GAGAAAGCTTAGAAGCAGCGGTGGCTCACC (with the HindIII site). The DNA fragment was cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). pM-Luc(−297) was made by deleting the PstI fragment from pM-Luc(−759). The three constructs ended at +87 nucleotides from the transcription start site of the maspin. The sequence of the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. pM-Luc(−297mt1) and pM-Luc(−297mt2) were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using pM-Luc(−297) as the template. The p53 binding site was mutated to the sequence shown in the mutant oligonucleotide used in the gel shift assay. The cells were plated at 5 × 10 5 cells/well (6 wells/plate) 1 day before the transfection. The transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate method (CLONTECH). The maspin promoter-reporter plasmid (5 μg), the p53 plasmid (2.5 μg), and an internal control plasmid, pRL-TK (0.5 μg), were cotransfected into cells for 48 h, and the cells were harvested for the luciferase assay. Luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer using the Dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The results are presented as the -fold induction of the reporter plasmid alone after normalization with the internal control plasmid pRL-TK. The gel mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (14.Nagaich A.K. Appella E. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14842-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled oligonucleotide probes (2 ng) were incubated with 30 ng of nonspecific competitor DNA and 50 ng of wt p53 (purified from the bacculovirus expression system) in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 30 min. The PAb-421 antibody was added after 30 min of incubation with wt p53. The complexes were analyzed on a native 12% polyacrylamide gel. The concentration of the protein was adjusted so that it formed an approximately 50:50 complex with the probes. To determine whether the tumor suppressor p53 regulates maspin expression in prostate tumor cells, maspin mRNA expression was analyzed in the metastatic prostate cancer line DU145 following wt p53 expression via an adenovirus vector, AdWTp53. DU145 cells were infected with AdWTp53 or the control vector dl312 and were harvested at different time points for RNA isolation. The induction of maspin expression was first noted 3 h after AdWTp53 infection and reached a plateau by 6 h that persisted to at least 48 h (Fig.1 A). The control vector did not increase maspin expression under the same conditions. The kinetics of p53-mediated maspin induction was rapid and was similar to the kinetics of expression of the well known p53-regulated gene, p21 waf/cip1. To demonstrate that maspin was specifically induced by p53, DU145 cells infected with adenovirus vectors expressing p21 waf1/cip1 or p27 were analyzed for expression of maspin (Fig. 1 B). p21 waf1/cip1 and p27 were highly expressed but did not induce detectable maspin expression. Only p53 stimulated the maspin expression. These results suggested that maspin expression was specifically induced by p53 and was not the result of nonspecific effects of cell growth arrest and/or apoptosis. p53 induction of maspin expression was also noted in prostate tumor cell lines PC3 and LNCaP and in the breast tumor cell line MCF7 (Fig. 1 C). DNA-damaging agents and cytotoxic drugs are inducers of p53 expression that lead to the induction of downstream target genes, e.g.p21 waf1/cip1. To demonstrate whether maspin expression is inducible in response to DNA damage, cells were UV-irradiated or treated with etoposide (VP16). As shown in Fig.2, UV irradiation or etoposide treatment induced maspin expression in LNCaP cells containing endogenous wt p53; however, DU145 cells harboring mutant p53 did not respond to such treatment. UV irradiation increased maspin expression in MCF7 cells containing wild type p53 but not in PC3 cells null for p53 protein (data not shown). We repeated this experiment in colon tumor cells (HCT116) that contain wt p53. In addition to UV and etoposide (VP16), maspin expression was also induced by γ irradiation and adriamycin in HCT116 cells (data not shown). To demonstrate that p53 directly regulates maspin expression, we conducted gel shift assays to analyze the binding of purified p53 protein to the maspin promoter. Sequence analysis of the maspin promoter revealed three imperfect consensus p53 binding sites in the region between −297 and the transcription start site. As shown in Fig.3, p53 protein exhibited binding to two of the oligonucleotides (CCCGAACATGTTGGAGGCCTTTTGA and TGTGGACAAGCTGCCAAGAGGCTTGAGTAGG) that contain the p53 consensus sequence. The binding was supershifted by adding the p53 antibody, Pab421. When mutations (indicated by underlining) were introduced in the following oligonucleotides, the p53 protein failed to bind to the oligonucleotides: CCCTATATACAACGAGGCCTTTTGGA, TGTCCTGTAGCTACCTAGACCGTTGAGTAGG. These results provides evidence that p53 has the potential to bind the maspin promoter. Although we demonstrated that wt p53 activated the transcription of the endogenous maspin gene, to further confirm that p53 directly regulates maspin expression, we used a maspin promoter-luciferase reporter assay to examine whether p53 activates the promoter of the maspin gene. Three constructs with varying lengths of the maspin promoter were cloned into a luciferase reporter pGL3-basic vector as described under “Materials and Methods” and as indicated in the top panel of Fig.4. The promoter region used in these constructs contains the full promoting activity as demonstrated previously (6.Zhang M. Maass N. Magit D. Sager R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 179-186PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of wt p53 or mt p53 (codon 245, Gly → Asp) was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter (pcDNA3). The maspin promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid was co-transfected with the wt p53 or mt p53 expression vector. The results showed that wt p53 induced luciferase activity of the maspin promoter-reporter by more than 3–4-fold compared with the activity of the reporter plasmid alone (Fig. 4). The mt p53 expression vector was not able to induce luciferase activity under similar conditions. All three constructs showed similar induction by the wt p53. These results suggest that the p53-responsive element must reside within the −297 to +87 region relative to the transcription start site. There are two p53 binding sites in this region. The shortest promoter construct, pM-Luc(−297), was then mutated by site-directed mutagenesis at the p53 binding sites to generate constructs pm-Luc(297mt1) and pm-Luc(−297mt2). The mutant sequences in these constructs were the same as the mutant oligonucleotides used for gel shift assays (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4, with the construct containing a mutant binding site 1, pm-Luc(−297mt1), the activation of the promoter was completely abolished. When binding site 2, pm-Luc(−297mt2), was mutated, the activation of the promoter was not affected. This result suggests that binding site 1 is likely to be the functional site for p53 activation. In this report we demonstrate a rapid wt p53-dependent induction of maspin expression in prostate and breast tumor cells. These results suggest a role for wt p53 in the regulation of the maspin function involved in cell invasion or metastasis. A recent study has shown that p53 activates the expression of the metastasis suppressor gene KAI1 (15.Mashimo T. Watabe M. Hirota S. Hosobe S. Miura K. Tegtmeyer P.J. Rinker-Shaeffer C.W. Watabe K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11307-11311Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). KAI1 expression was decreased during prostate tumor progression and low expression of KAI1 correlates with the loss of p53 function. Despite the variable frequency of p53 mutations reported in primary prostate tumors, metastatic tumors consistently exhibit a higher incidence of p53 mutations (16.Heidenberg H.B. Bauer J.J. McLeod D.G. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Urology. 1996; 48: 971-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17.Effert P.J. Neubauer A. Walther P.J. Liu E.T. J. Urol. 1992; 147: 789-793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is only one report on the analysis of maspin expression in prostate cancer cells, it is notable that maspin expression was down-regulated in prostate tumor cell lines similar to the findings in mammary tumors cell lines (18.Zhang M. Magit D. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5673-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In an earlier report, Zou et al. (1.Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) have already demonstrated that breast cancer cell-harboring maspin expression vectors exhibit decreased cell invasion in vitro and reduced metastasis in vivo. On the basis of the known biologic functions of maspin and this study showing regulation of maspin expression by wt p53, we suggest a functional interaction of p53 and maspin in cell invasion. This report, along with other studies (15.Mashimo T. Watabe M. Hirota S. Hosobe S. Miura K. Tegtmeyer P.J. Rinker-Shaeffer C.W. Watabe K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3710-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), underscores the broader implications of these findings and emphasizes the role of p53 in the negative regulation of cell invasion and metastasis. p53 may suppress tumor metastasis by up-regulating metastasis suppressor genes,e.g. maspin, KAI1, and PAI1. This newly emerging p53 function may provide a mechanistic explanation for the increased metastatic susceptibility of tumors harboring p53 mutations."

The partial intron/exon structure of the corresponding geneCACNA1G was defined and several α1G isoforms were identified, especially two isoforms that exhibit a distinct III-IV loop: α1G-a and α1G-b. Northern blot and dot blot analyses indicated that α1G mRNA is predominantly expressed in the brain, especially in thalamus, cerebellum, and substantia nigra. Additional experiments have also provided evidence that α1G mRNA is expressed at a higher level during fetal life in nonneuronal tissues (i.e.kidney, heart, and lung). Functional expression in HEK 293 cells of a full-length cDNA encoding the shortest α1G isoform identified to date, α1G-b, resulted in transient, low threshold activated Ca2+ currents with the expected permeability ratio (I Sr >I Ca ≥ I Ba) and channel conductance (∼7 pS). These properties, together with slowly deactivating tail currents, are typical of those of native T-type Ca2+ channels. This α1G-related current was inhibited by mibefradil (IC50 = 2 μm) and weakly blocked by Ni2+ ions (IC50 = 148 μm) and amiloride (IC50 > 1 mm). We showed that steady state activation and inactivation properties of this current can generate a “window current” in the range of −65 to −55 mV. Using neuronal action potential waveforms, we show that α1G channels produce a massive and sustained Ca2+ influx due to their slow deactivation properties. These latter properties would account for the specificity of Ca2+ influx via T-type channels that occurs in the range of physiological resting membrane potentials, differing considerably from the behavior of other Ca2+ channels.

Functional identification of voltage-dependent calcium channel subtypes based on their biophysical properties have distinguished low voltage-activated (LVA)1 and high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ currents. LVA calcium currents, mainly referred to as “T-type currents” due to their fast inactivation and small conductance, have been described in a wide variety of cell types (1.Bean B.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 367-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Although their physiological functions still remain obscure, they are thought to play a role in neuronal burst firing (2.Huguenard J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), pacemaker activity in heart (3.Hagiwara N. Irisawa H. Kameyama M. J. Physiol.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4817-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), or fertilization (6.Arnoult C. Cardullo R.A. Lemos J.R. Florman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13004-13009Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). T-type currents are mainly detected at early stages of development as well as at a given transition (G1/S) of the cell cycle (7.Kuga T. Kobayashi S. Hirakawa Y. Kanaide H. Takeshita A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8.Guo W. Kamiya K. Kodama I. Toyama J. J. Mol. Cell.

In addition, it has been reported that enhanced expression of T-type current is associated with a variety of diseases that include cardiac hypertrophy (10.Nuss H.B. Houser S.R Circ. Res. 1995; 73: 777-782Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar), hypertension (11.Self D.A Bian K. Mishra S.K. Hermsmeyer K. J. Vasc. Res. 1994; 31: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and epilepsy (12.Tsakiridou E. Bertollini L. de Curtis M. Avanzini G. Pape H.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the lack of specific T-type channel blockers has considerably impaired their functional characterization. The identification of the molecular structure of T-type channels has therefore become an important challenge in order to unravel their implication in cellular functions (13.Bean B.P. McDonough S.I. Neuron. 1998; 20: 825-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The low level of knowledge about the molecular nature of T-type channels contrasts with the extensive molecular and functional characterization of HVA channels (L-, N-, P/Q-, and R-types) related to the discovery of specific drugs and toxins. HVA calcium channels exhibit an oligomeric structure composed of a pore-forming α1 subunit containing voltage sensors and drug/toxin binding sites, associated with regulatory subunits (β, α2/δ, and γ). The functional diversity of HVA calcium channels is primarily related to the existence of several α1 subunits (α1A–F and α1S) encoded by distinct genes, many of which generate splice variants with specific properties, as described for the α1A isoforms that generate P/Q-type channels (14.Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G. Nargeot J. Snutch T. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). A search in the genetic data bases for sequences homologous, but not identical, to known Ca2+ channel α1 subunits was an alternative to conventional molecular cloning strategies for the identification of novel α1 subunits, and a major advance in T-type Ca2+ channel studies has resulted from the identification of several ESTs and genomic sequences corresponding to a subset of distantly related α1 subunits (15.Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.H Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNAs encoding three distinct α1 subunits (α1G, α1H, and α1I) have recently been identified, which give rise, in expression systems, to Ca2+ channel currents exhibiting hallmarks of native T-type currents (15.Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.H Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 16.Cribbs L.L Lee J.H. Yang J. Satin J.

Pereverzev A. Klockner U. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes that encode mammalian α1G, α1H, and α1I proteins are related to theCaenorhabditis elegans gene c54d2.5 described as a putative Ca2+ channel. These recent data (15.Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L.

Stauderman K.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) provide clear evidence that genes encoding T-type channels are members of a third subfamily in addition to the gene family encoding neuronal calcium channels (α1A, α1B, and α1E) and the gene family encoding L-type calcium channels (α1C, α1D, α1F, and α1S). An important issue now is to elucidate the molecular basis for the functional diversity of T-type Ca2+channels (2.Huguenard J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we have cloned and expressed a human α1G subunit. The molecular data presented here describe several new findings concerning the α1G subunit, such as the existence of several splice variants, the partial gene structure, and the mRNA expression pattern in adult and fetal human tissues. Functional expression was achieved in order to determine the electrophysiological and pharmacological profiles of the human α1G-related currents, and we show that the α1G subunit generates a sustained Ca2+current with specific features. Characterization of the human α1G subunit is an important step that significantly extends our knowledge of the molecular and functional properties of the T-type Ca2+ channels. Genetic data bases were searched for cDNA and genomic sequences homologous, but not identical, to known α1 subunit cDNAs using (i) sequence similarity search (BLAST; Ref. 19.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) and (ii) a search for conserved motifs, such as a voltage sensor S4 = ((R/K)XX)4(BioMotif). 2G. Mennessier, submitted for publication. Among the various human sequences that were identified, we focused on sequences homologous to the C. elegans gene c54d2.5(GenBankTM accession no. U37548). Two EST clones, H06096and H19230, available from the IMAGE consortium (20.Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), were sequenced and compared with a large set of calcium channel α1 and sodium channel α cDNAs, using the ClustalW1.7 multialignment software (21.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar). These cDNA sequences were thus defined as candidates for putative new calcium channel α1 subunits in humans and subsequently used as probes for both Northern blot analysis and screening of cDNA libraries. The genomic region of chromosome 17q22 that contains the CACNA1G gene was recently sequenced (AC004590). The identification of the intron/exon structure was performed using the GRAIL software (22.Xu Y. Einstein J.R. Mural R, J. Shah M. Uberbacher E.C. Ismb. Proc. 1994; 2: 376-384Google Scholar) for the search of putative exons. Alignment of the cDNA sequences characterized in this study, together with the genomic sequence, led us to identify the exons of theCACNA1G gene that form α1G transcripts. A λgt10 human cerebellum cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened by conventional filter hybridization according to the manufacturer's protocols, using a probe generated by PCR using H06096cDNA as template. This probe covers nucleotides 3660–4590 of the final cDNA. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 16–20 h in a solution containing 50% formamide using a random primed [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe that was added at a concentration of 5 × 106 cpm/ml. The membranes were then washed with a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Three λgt10 clones named CC1/CC2/CC3 were identified. An additional EST (H19230) corresponding to the 3′ region of the messenger was also identified. The completion of the 5′ region of the sequence was achieved using long reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols (23.Martinez J.M. Breidenbach H.H. Cawthon R. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) on mRNA from human total brain (CLONTECH) using primers defined from the rat sequence (Ref. 15.Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.H Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar; AF027984) and RACE-PCR (24.Edwards J.B. Delort J. Mallet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5227-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). CC1 and CC3 are overlapping clones that correspond to a splice variation of the human α1G. The resulting isoforms were designated α1G-a (AF126966) and α1G-b (AF126965). The cDNA structure and sequence encoding these subunits was further identified following the characterization of two overlapping cDNA fragments of 4056 bp (nt −120 to 3936) and 3432 bp (nt 2840–6272), according to AF126965 (see Fig. 1 A). Nucleotide sequences were determined using automatic sequencing (Applied Biosystems) with the dye terminator strategy. A full-length cDNA encoding the human α1G isoform designated α1G-b was constructed using the unique restriction sites mentioned in Fig.1 A and subsequently subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene). A search for native isoforms of the α1G subunit was further performed using long range RT-PCR (23.Martinez J.M. Breidenbach H.H. Cawthon R. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and sequence examination of the cDNA fragment covering from nt 2840 (domain II) to nt 6272 (C-terminal region), according to AF126966. The size of this fragment varied from ∼3.4 to ∼3.8 kb, as a function of the α1Gisoform detected. This analysis was achieved using four different sources of human mRNA: adult whole brain, adult cerebellum, adult thalamus, and fetal kidney (CLONTECH). First strand cDNA synthesis (reverse transcription) was performed using Superscript 2 (Life Technologies) with a sequence-specific primer (5′-GCTTTCTCCCAACAGCTTC-3′) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The enzyme was then heat-inactivated (15 min, 70 °C). After cooling on ice, the samples were treated with ribonuclease H (Life Technologies, 4 units) for 20 min at 37 °C. PCR amplification was performed with 2 μl of the reverse transcription mixture in a final volume of 50 μl using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 10× buffer 1 (10× buffer 1: 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 160 mm(NH4)2SO4, 17.5 mmMgCl2) supplemented with Me2SO to a final concentration of 5%, 200 nm dNTP, 50 pmol of forward primer (5′-CTTCGGCAACTACGTGCTCTTC-3′), 50 pmol of reverse primer (5′-TCCTGAAATCCAGCTCAGCTCC-3′), and 2.6 units of DNA polymerase mix. A hot start PCR procedure was performed with the following parameters for initial denaturation: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles (10 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 10 s, annealing at 65 °C for 30 s, extension at 68 °C for 6 min; and 20 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 10 s, annealing at 65 °C for 30 s, extension at 68 °C for 6 min plus a 20-s increment/cycle) and a final extension (at 68 °C for 7 min). The cDNA fragments were subcloned in pUC18 using the Sureclone ligation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sixty-eight positive clones were randomly chosen and fully sequenced using automatic sequencing (Applied Biosystems) with the dye terminator technology. A similar RT-PCR strategy was used for the identification of cDNA fragments covering from nt −120 to 3936 with the forward and reverse primers 5′-TAGAGCCCACCAGATGTGCC-3′ and 5′-GAGATGAGCACCAACAGCCC-3′, respectively. No evidence for sequence variation has been identified to date in this region. Commercial human Northern blot membranes (CLONTECH) were hybridized using a 930-bp fragment (nt 3660–4590) generated by PCR amplification and random-primed with [α-32P]dCTP. The membranes were treated according to the manufacturer's protocol. Relative amounts of mRNA in each line were evaluated using two probes: a ubiquitin probe and a β-actin probe as internal controls. Two independent dot blot membranes, normalized in their mRNA abundance by the manufacturer according to the expression profile of eight housekeeping genes (Master-blot mRNA membrane; CLONTECH) were treated in similar conditions using a probe covering the C-terminal region (nt 6440–6970). The exposure time for Northern and dot blot membranes was 6 days. Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms was performed using an AlphaImager system (Alpha Innotech Corp.) in order to provide semiquantitation of α1G mRNA in each condition. No signal was observed for internal DNA controls, except for human genomic DNA. A plasmid encoding the reporter geneCD8 (25.Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar) was used in transient transfection experiments, together with the pBK-CMV construct that encodes for the α1G-b subunit, in a 1:10 ratio. Human embryonic kidney cells HEK-293 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Eurobio) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v). For optimal transfection, cells were plated at 30–40% confluence on Petri dishes coated with poly-l-ornithine (Sigma). A standard calcium phosphate transfection procedure was performed. Positively transfected cells were identified with anti-CD8 antibody-coated beads (Dynal) and further analyzed by voltage clamp experiments. cDNAs encoding the rat brain α1A-a, α2/δ1b, and β1b subunits were inserted in the vertebrate expression vector pMT2 (14.Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G. Nargeot J. Snutch T. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and cotransfected in HEK 293 cells as a mix of α1A-a, α2/δ1b, β1b, and CD8 cDNAs at a molar ratio of 1:1:1:0.1. Macroscopic currents were recorded by the whole-cell patch clamp technique at room temperature (∼21 °C) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Data were acquired on a PC computer using the pClAMP6 software suite (Axon Instruments). Records were filtered at 5 kHz. Leak and capacitive currents were subtracted using aP/−5 procedure when needed (i.e. for tail current recordings). Extracellular solution contained 2 mmCaCl2 (or 2 mm BaCl2 or 2 mm SrCl2), 160 mm TEACl, 10 mm HEPES (pH to 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). Pipettes made of borosilicate glass with a typical resistance of 1–2 megaohms were filled with an internal solution containing 110 mm CsCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm Mg-ATP, 0.6 mm GTP (pH to 7.2 with CsOH). For pharmacological experiments, drugs were prepared daily in the external medium, freshly (amiloride and mibefradil) or from a stock solution (NiCl2). The various dilutions were applied to cells by a gravity-driven homemade perfusion device, controlled by solenoid valves. Single channel recordings were done in the cell-attached mode. Sylgard coated pipettes (resistance of 7–15 mega-ohms) were filled with a solution containing 110 mm BaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH to 7.2 with TEAOH). Membrane potential was reduced toward 0 mV by bathing the cells in a high potassium solution containing 140 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mmEGTA, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH to 7.3 with KOH). The sampling frequency for acquisition was 10 kHz, and data were filtered at 1 kHz. Data were analyzed using pCLAMP6 (Axon Instruments), Excel (Microsoft), and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Inc.) software programs. Whole cell current-voltage curves were fitted using a modified Boltzmann equation as described previously (26.Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Stea A. Soong T.W. Lewis B.A. Jones L.P. Yue D.T. Snutch T.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4983-4993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation and inactivation curves were fitted with a Boltzmann equation. Apparent dissociation constants (K d) were obtained from the fitting of the drug dose-response curves using a sigmoidal function. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E., where n is the number of cells used. Several cDNA clones covering from domain II to the C-terminal region of the human α1G isoform were isolated from a cerebellum cDNA library using a probe designed from the identified EST H06096 (Fig.1 A). Additional cDNA clones that cover the entire coding region of the human α1G were identified using RT-PCR and RACE-PCR from human total brain mRNA. Finally, two overlapping cDNA fragments of 4 and 3.4 kb covering from nt −120 to 6272 were obtained by RT-PCR from human total brain mRNA to further confirm the cDNA structure of human α1G isoforms. A full-length cDNA encoding the α1G-b isoform was then constructed using the overlapping cDNAs (Fig. 1 A). Alignment of our cDNA sequences to the corresponding genomic region of chromosome 17q22 (AC004590), together with the use of GRAIL software (22.Xu Y. Einstein J.R. Mural R, J. Shah M. Uberbacher E.C. Ismb. Proc. 1994; 2: 376-384Google Scholar) for the identification of putative exons in the genomic sequence, led us to identify the partial intron/exon structure of theCACNA1G gene that encodes the α1G isoforms (Fig. 1 B). The CACNA1G gene covers <70 kb in the 17q22 region. A total of 41 putative exons was predicted using GRAIL software (Fig. 1 B). The 5′-end of CACNA1G (∼500 bp), which has been determined recently (27.Toyota M. Ho C. Ohe-Toyota M. Baylin S.B. Issa J.P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4535-4541PubMed Google Scholar), is comprised within a single exon. Accordingly, this exon that also contains the first ATG codon was designated exon 1. This ATG is comprised within a consensus site for initiation of translation: AXXATGG (28.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The coding region of the two human α1G subunits described later in this study is composed of 34 exons. One of these two variants which has the highest homology with the original rat sequence (15.Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.H Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), was named α1G-a. The isoform α1G-b resulted from the use of an alternate 5′-splice donor site of exon 25 combined with the acceptor site on exon 27 (Fig. 2,A and B). Four additional exons were identified in RT-PCR experiments conducted on mRNAs from human total brain, cerebellum, thalamus, and fetal kidney. These exons encode insertions within the II-III loop (insertion e), within the III-IV loop (insertion c), and within the COOH-terminal region (insertions f and d) (Fig.2 A). In our experiments, the insertion c, which corresponded to the use of exon 26 (Fig. 2 B), was found only in combination with variation b. Three other predicted exons that are included in Fig. 1 B have not been retrieved experimentally to date. Sequencing of cDNA fragments obtained using long range RT-PCR experiments was performed in order to determine the potential association of the a/b, c, d, e, and f regions in α1Gtranscripts as well as their relative abundance in native human tissues. A total of 68 cDNA fragments obtained from human total brain, cerebellum, thalamus, and fetal kidney mRNAs was analyzed (Fig. 2 C). A majority of α1G-a isoform alone, or in combination with insertion e, was found in neuronal tissues. By contrast, only the α1G-b isoform, mostly associated with insertion c, was detected in fetal kidney. The construct α1G-a encodes a 2250-amino acid (aa) protein with a calculated molecular mass of 249.333 Da. Primary sequences of the two variants α1G-a and α1G-b were compared with the rat and mouse α1G proteins (Fig. 3). The four transmembrane domains are highly conserved (98–100% identity). The connecting loops between domains I and II and between domains II and III, as well as the NH2 and COOH-terminal regions are more divergent (85–95% identity). Within the II-III loop, overall identity is 90% without taking into account insertion e (23 aa), which occurs in human, rat, and mouse (Fig. 3 A). The two variants α1G-a and α1G-b encode a distinct intracellular III-IV loop (Fig. 3 B). By contrast with the mouse α1G sequence, insertion c (18 aa) was found associated only with the splice variant b in our experiments (Fig.2 C). Nevertheless, this intracellular loop is shorter (50–70 aa) compared with others (∼300 aa). The III-IV loop in isoform α1G-a is 100% identical to the rat α1G sequence. The other isoform, α1G-b, exhibits a shorter III-IV linker resulting from a 21-bp deletion described above. Sequence comparison of the III-IV loop of several α1G, α1H, and α1I subunits, as well as the putative c54d2 gene product, revealed that sequence variability within this intracellular loop is highly related to the length of this region. The sequences surrounding this insertion are more homologous, and several aa are conserved (Fig. 3 B). The aa sequences corresponding to insertions f (48 aa) and d (45 aa) in the C-terminal region of the human α1G subunit that are presented in Fig. 3 C have not been described to date. The search for putative regulatory sites, such as consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A and protein kinase C, led us to identify eight protein kinase A and up to 20 protein kinase C sites contained within the intracellular regions. Most of these consensus sites are conserved among human and rat sequences. Interestingly, a protein kinase A/protein kinase C consensus site identified in loop III-IV for α1G-a is removed in the isoform α1G-b, as a consequence of splicing of exon 25 (Fig. 3 B). Northern blot analysis of a large variety of adult human tissues showed that α1G mRNA is predominantly present in the brain (Fig. 4 A). Nonneuronal tissues that were positive were ovary and placenta. A very weak band was also observed in testis, small intestine, colon, and heart. Positive tissues exhibited a major band of approximately 8.5 kb along with discrete larger bands. The reason for a smaller band in the prostate mRNA lane is currently unknown. Considering neuronal tissues, cerebellum as well as thalamus and substantia nigra displayed a strong signal (Fig. 4 B). Several other tissues from the central nervous system also revealed a significant level of α1G expression, while other areas, like hippocampus, showed a weaker α1G mRNA signal. The pattern of α1G mRNA expression identified in Northern blots was mostly confirmed using dot blot analysis with densitometric quantification (Fig. 5). Two independent dot blot membranes were examined (see “Materials and Methods”). Brain tissues showed the strongest signal (thalamus > occipital lobe > cerebellum). The only difference between dot blot and Northern blot analyses concerns the spinal cord, since expression of α1G mRNA was undetectable on Northern blot, although the use of two independent internal controls, ubiquitin and β-actin, suggested that the quality this mRNA sample was correct on the Northern blot membrane. Altogether, dot blot experiments revealed a level of α1G expression in good agreement with Northern blot analysis for other neuronal tissues.Figure 5Dot blot analysis of adult and fetal tissues. Dot blot analysis of human α1G transcripts with commercial membranes (CLONTECH) using a probe that covers the 3′-end of the transcript (exon 38, nt 6440–6970) is shown. A, relative intensities of the spots were determined using the AlphaImager system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). B, comparison and quantitation of α1G transcripts in fetal (black bar) and adult (white bar) tissues were determined by the densitometric analysis on two independent master blot membranes (designated dot 1 and dot 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is worth underlining the fact that analysis of two independent dot blot membranes revealed that the α1G mRNA expression level was significantly higher in fetal peripheral tissues, heart, kidney, lung, spleen, and thymus, compared with adult tissues (Fig.5 B). This pattern of expression was not displayed in the brain, since the amount of α1G mRNA was equivalent in adult and fetal brain. Since dot blot membranes are normalized for the amount of mRNA present in each dot (see “Materials and Methods”), we have performed a densitometric analysis that shows the relativ"

Endogenous CED-9 and CED-4 proteins localized to mitochondria in wild-type embryos, in which most cells survive. By contrast, in embryos in which cells had been induced to die, CED-4 assumed a perinuclear localization. CED-4 translocation induced by the cell-death activator EGL-1 was blocked by a gain-of-function mutation in ced-9 but was not dependent on ced-3 function, suggesting that CED-4 translocation precedes caspase activation and the execution phase of programmed cell death.

https://openalex.org/W1982826106,"Iron regulatory proteins (IRP-1 and IRP-2) control the synthesis of transferrin receptors (TfR) and ferritin by binding to iron-responsive elements, which are located in the 3'-untranslated region and the 5'-untranslated region of their respective mRNAs. Cellular iron levels affect binding of IRPs to iron-responsive elements and consequently expression of TfR and ferritin. Moreover, NO(*), a redox species of nitric oxide that interacts primarily with iron, can activate IRP-1 RNA binding activity resulting in an increase in TfR mRNA levels. Recently we found that treatment of RAW 264.7 cells (a murine macrophage cell line) with NO(+) (nitrosonium ion, which causes S-nitrosylation of thiol groups) resulted in a rapid decrease in RNA binding of IRP-2 followed by IRP-2 degradation, and these changes were associated with a decrease in TfR mRNA levels (Kim, S., and Ponka, P. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 33035-33042). In this study, we demonstrated that stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) increased IRP-1 binding activity, whereas RNA binding of IRP-2 decreased and was followed by a degradation of this protein. Moreover, the decrease of IRP-2 binding/protein levels was associated with a decrease in TfR mRNA levels in LPS/IFN-gamma-treated cells, and these changes were prevented by inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, LPS/IFN-gamma-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells showed increased rates of ferritin synthesis. These results suggest that NO(+)-mediated degradation of IRP-2 plays a major role in iron metabolism during inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2155149275,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the effects of agonists like 2,3, 7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. In the current model for AHR signaling, the unliganded receptor is found in the cytosol as part of a complex with a dimer of the 90-kDa heat shock protein and an immunophilin-like molecule, ARA9. In yeast, expression of ARA9 results in an increase in the maximal agonist response and a leftward shift in the AHR dose-response curve. To better understand the mechanism by which ARA9 modifies AHR signal transduction, we performed a series of coexpression experiments in yeast and mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that ARA9's influence on AHR signaling is not due to inhibition of a membrane pump or modification of the receptor's transactivation properties. Using receptor photoaffinity labeling experiments, we were able to show that ARA9 enhances AHR signal transduction by increasing the available AHR binding sites within the cytosolic compartment of the cell. Our evidence suggests that ARA9's effects are related to its role as a cellular chaperone; i.e. we observed that expression of ARA9 increases the fraction of AHR in the cytosol and also stabilized the receptor under heat stress."
https://openalex.org/W1971792026,"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii activates the transcription of the Cyc6 and the Cpx1genes (encoding cytochrome c6 and coprogen oxidase) in response to copper deficiency. Mutational analysis of promoter regions of the Cyc6 and Cpx1 genes revealed a four nucleotide sequence, GTAC, which was absolutely essential for copper responsiveness. The Cyc6 promoter contains two copper response elements, each with a functionally important GTAC sequence, whereas the Cpx1 promoter contains only one. This may contribute to the stronger and more tightly regulated expression of the Cyc6 gene. Mutation or deletion of sequences flanking the GTACs implicates additional nucleotides contributing to copper-responsive expression, but none are absolutely essential. Metal ion selectivity of Cpx1 expression is identical to that described previously for Cyc6 and is restricted to the copper deficiency-induced Cpx1transcript. The Cyc6 and Cpx1 genes are also induced by oxygen deficiency. Reporter gene constructs indicate that the induction occurs at the level of transcription and requires the same GTAC sequence that is critical for copper responsiveness.

For most organisms, especially respiring eukaryotes, copper is an essential micronutrient owing to its function in various enzymes including particularly cytochrome oxidase, ceruloplasmin, and superoxide dismutase. Symptoms of acquired or inherited copper deficiency have been documented in most organisms, humans, plants, yeast, and fungi, but is studied at the molecular level mainly inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (1.Askwith C.

Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2514-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For example, copper-deficient cells induce uptake mechanisms involving cupric reductases and a family of plasma membrane permeases, whereas cells treated with excess copper synthesize metallothioneins like Cup1p and Crs5p to sequester the copper and prevent potentially deleterious Fenton chemistry. Copper is a positive effector of Ace1p (6.Furst P. Hu S. Hackett R. Hamer D. Cell. 1988; 55: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), whose function is critical for tolerance to toxic amounts of copper (7.Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell.

Much less is known about copper metabolism in photosynthetic eukaryotes. In plants, some well known copper enzymes include plastocyanin, an electron transfer protein in the thylakoid lumen, plastid CuZn-superoxide dismutase, polyphenol oxidase, also in the thylakoid lumen, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, the ethylene receptor in the plasma membrane, extracellular laccase involved in lignification, and several oxidases. Copper is an essential micronutrient for plants (13.Sommer A.L. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1939; 14: 339-345Google Scholar). Copper deficiency prevents growth, inhibits flowering, and leads to necrosis. One of the primary targets of copper deficiency in plants is plastocyanin, which can account for most of the copper in photosynthetic tissue (14.Hewitt E.J. Robb D.A. Pierpoint W.S. Metals and Macronutrients: Uptake and Utilization by Plants. Academic Press, London1983: 277-323Google Scholar, 15.Droppa M. Terry N. Horvath G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2369-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many green algae and cyanobacteria can tolerate severe copper deficiency in nature and also in the laboratory because they have specific genetic mechanisms for adaptation (16.Wood P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 8-19Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17.Sandmann G. Reck H. Kessler E. Boger P. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 23-27Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18.Sandmann G. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 76-79Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is one of these (19.Merchant S. Silver S. Walden W. Metal Ions in Gene Regulation. Chapman and Hall, New York1998: 450-467Crossref Google Scholar, 20.Merchant S. Rochaix J.-D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. Molecular Biology of Chlamydomonas: Chloroplasts and Mitochondria. 7. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1998: 597-611Google Scholar). The green algae contain fewer copper enzymes than plants. They lack both CuZn-superoxide dismutase and polyphenol oxidase, which are abundant enzymes in plant chloroplasts, and probably also lack laccase and the ethylene receptor. Accordingly, plastocyanin and cytochrome oxidase are, metabolically, the most important copper enzymes in Chlamydomonas. The occurrence of a well defined adaptive mechanism and the dearth of copper enzymes in the green algae relative to plants makesChlamydomonas an excellent model for the study of copper metabolism in the context of deficiency. Chlamydomonas exhibits multiple adaptations to conditions of copper deficiency; the best understood of these is the replacement of plastocyanin function by a heme-containing cytochrome (19.Merchant S. Silver S. Walden W. Metal Ions in Gene Regulation. Chapman and Hall, New York1998: 450-467Crossref Google Scholar, 20.Merchant S. Rochaix J.-D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. Molecular Biology of Chlamydomonas: Chloroplasts and Mitochondria. 7. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1998: 597-611Google Scholar). Copper-deficient cells cannot support holoplastocyanin formation. Therefore, they degrade apoplastocyanin, which requires a copper-repressible protease, and induce the synthesis of cytochrome (cyt)1 c6 by transcriptional activation of theCyc6 gene (21.Merchant S. Bogorad L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 22.Merchant S. Bogorad L. J. Biol.

Besides apoplastocyanin degradation andCyc6 transcription, copper-deficientChlamydomonas cells display several other responses including transcriptional activation of the Cpx1 gene encoding coproporphyrinogen oxidase and enhanced ability to assimilate copper (25.Hill K.L. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26.Hill K.L. Hassett R. Kosman D. Merchant S. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 112: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Each of these responses appears to occur coordinately. For instance, the amount of copper required to turn off the induced processes is the same and it occurs with similar kinetics. A wild-typeChlamydomonas cell maintains plastocyanin at an abundance of 8 × 106 molecules/cell (24.Merchant S. Hill K. Howe G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). If copper is available at or greater than this concentration, the cells are in a copper-sufficient state; when copper concentrations fall below this level, the cells perceive a deficiency and induce the adaptive mechanisms to the extent required to compensate for this deficiency (24.Merchant S. Hill K. Howe G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the copper content in the medium corresponds to 4 × 106/cell, a plastocyanin deficiency of 50% is anticipated and the Cyc6 gene is induced to 50% of maximal levels (27.Hill K.L. Merchant S. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1992; 100: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The Cpx1 gene and the copper assimilation pathway likewise show the same behavior (25.Hill K.L. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26.Hill K.L. Hassett R. Kosman D. Merchant S. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 112: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the adaptive processes (Cyc6 and Cpx1transcription, plastocyanin degradation, and copper transport) are targets of the same signal transduction pathway as is the case forS. cerevisiae (see above). In previous work, we showed that the Cyc6 gene contains at least two copper-response elements (CuREs) (28.Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 623-638PubMed Google Scholar). These elements reside within an 80-base pair fragment, which can be separated into two segments, corresponding to positions −129 to −110 and −110 to −50 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site, each with CuRE activity. Each functions as a target for an activator in copper-deficient cells. The Cpx1 gene also has an associated copper response element that lies between positions −197 and +1 (29.Quinn J.M. Nakamoto S.S. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14444-14454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). If the two genes are targets of the same signal transduction pathway, it might be possible to identify a copper-response element by comparison of the three CuRE-containing regions (two from theCyc6 gene and one from the Cpx1 gene), and if theChlamydomonas pathway were related to the one inSaccharomyces, then it might be possible to identify a binding site for a Mac1p-type protein. Nevertheless, this is not the case. A CuRE could not be identified by inspection, and the CuRE-containing sequences do not show any similarity to theSaccharomyces Mac1p binding site. The latter is not surprising, because the metal selectivity of theChlamydomonas copper sensor is distinct from that noted for Mac1p, suggesting a Cu(II) binding site in the protein fromChlamydomonas rather than a Cu(I) binding site as in Ace1p and Mac1p (24.Merchant S. Hill K. Howe G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30.Casas-Finet J.R. Hu S. Hamer D. Karpel R.L.

In the original work describing the induction of cytochromec6 in copper-deficient cells, Wood (16.Wood P.M. Eur. J.

The increase in cyt c6 correlated with a decrease in oxygen in the culture and occurred even when a huge excess of copper (>1000 × 106/cell) was provided (16.Wood P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 8-19Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These results raised several questions. Is theCyc6 gene induced by oxygen deprivation? Is theCpx1 gene also induced by oxygen deprivation? Is the mechanism of oxygen-responsive gene expression related to the mechanism of copper-responsive expression? Do the signal transduction pathways share components? To address these questions we analyzedCyc6 and Cpx1 expression in oxygen-depleted cultures of Chlamydomonas and used a reporter gene construct (Cpx1-Ars2) to test whether the regulation occurred by transcriptional activation and whether CuRE(s) were involved. C. reinhardtiistrain CC425 (arg2, cw15) was the recipient strain used for all transformations. CC425 was cultured in copper-supplemented or copper-deficient TAP liquid medium (34.Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) supplemented with 200 μg ml−1 arginine. Transformants of strain CC425 were grown on +Cu or −Cu TAP liquid medium at 200 rpm or on agar plates without arginine at 22–25 °C and ∼100 μmol m−2s−1 light intensity. Strain CC125 was cultured under the same conditions in +Cu or −Cu TAP medium without added arginine. The glass bead method was used for transformation (35.Kindle K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. . 1990; 87: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Each construct (4 μg) was cotransformed with 4 μg of plasmid pArg7.8 (encoding the argininosuccinate lyase gene) (36.Debuchy R. Purton S. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) into strain CC425, arginine prototrophs were selected on copper-supplemented TAP medium, and individual isolates were spotted on +Cu versus −Cu TAP plates. Arg+ transformants expressing the cotransformed reporter were identified by treatment of the replica plates with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl sulfate (Sigma), and single colony isolates of these were analyzed for gene expression by RNA blot analysis and by quantitative enzyme assay on cell suspensions as described (28.Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 623-638PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, arylsulfatase activity in the medium was measured after removal of the cells by centrifugation. For CC425-derived strains, either method of assay (cell suspensions versusmedium alone) gave the same result. The cotransformation frequency for each construct was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA, isolated as described below, from 16 randomly chosen Arg+ transformants. A vector-specific primer was used in conjunction with an Ars2 specific primer to amplify introduced constructs. Amplification conditions were 95 °C for 5 min prior to Taq polymerase addition, 4 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 40 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min followed by 26 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, with a final 15 min extension at 72 °C. Five ml cultures of Arg+ transformants in +Cu TAP medium were grown on a tissue culture wheel at 25 °C and ∼50 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity until late log to early stationary phase. All centrifugation steps were carried out at room temperature in a microfuge at 14,000 rpm (16,000 × g). Cells (1.5 ml) were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min, resuspended in 20 μl of water, and 50 μl of lysis buffer (100 μm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 40 μm EDTA, 400 μm NaCl, 2% SDS, 100 μg ml−1 RNase A) was added. Samples were heated at 50 °C for 15 min, and then 480 μl of 6 m NaI was added. Lysates were mixed by inversion, and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min. Supernatants were removed (avoiding the green film floating at the top) to fresh tubes containing 10-μl silica gel suspension (37.Boyle J.S. Lew A.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), incubated at room temperature for 5 min, with occasional (once/minute) mixing by inversion to keep the silica gel suspended. The silica gel was collected by centrifugation for 10 s, washed three times with 120 μl of ice-cold New Wash (Bio 101, Vista, CA), resuspended in 25 μl of water, and incubated at 55 °C for 5 min. The silica gel was removed by centrifugation for 1 min, the supernatants were removed to fresh tubes, and 8 μl were used for polymerase chain reaction analysis. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by RNA blotting as described by Hill et al. (38.Hill K.L. Li H.H. Singer J. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15060-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) forCpx1 and Cyc6, and as described by Quinn and Merchant (28.Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 623-638PubMed Google Scholar) for Ars2. The following cDNAs were used as probes: the cpx440 fragment (25.Hill K.L. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for detection of Cpx1 RNA, the 710-base pair insert from pTZ18Cr552–7A (39.Merchant S. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9062-9067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for Cyc6transcripts, the ∼7 × 102-base pair insert from pM1 (40.Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rahire M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) for transcripts encoding the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RbcS2), the 11 × 102-base pair BamHI fragment from pJD27 (41.de Hostos E.L. Schilling J. Grossman A.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to detect Ars2 transcripts, and the 577-base pair insert of pTZ18R:CrPC6–2 (42.Merchant S. Hill K. Kim J.H. Thompson J. Zaitlin D. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12372-12379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to detect Pcy1 transcripts. Specific activities of probes ranged from 3 to 5 × 108 cpm μg−1 DNA. The reporter gene vectors pJD54 and pJD100 (43.Davies J.P. Weeks D.P. Grossman A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2959-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 44.Davies J.P. Grossman A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5165-5174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing the promoterless arylsulfatase-encoding gene Ars2 or Ars2 driven by a minimal β-tubulin promoter sequence (Tub2-Ars2), respectively, were used to generate all Cyc6-Ars2 and Cpx1-Ars2constructs. Mutations in the Cyc6 promoter sequences were generated by amplification of Cyc6 genomic DNA (38.Hill K.L. Li H.H. Singer J. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15060-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using one primer containing the target mutation and a second primer outside the CuRE containing region (−127 to −110 or −110 to −50 relative to the 5′-end of the Cyc6 transcript (28.Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 623-638PubMed Google Scholar)). Mutations in theCpx1 promoter were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (45.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Mutated fragments were cloned into theKpnI site of pJD54 or pJD100 or into the EcoRI site of EcoRI-pJD100 (in which the KpnI site mutated to an EcoRI site). The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by sequencing. CC125 and representative Cpx1-Ars2 transformants grown in copper-supplemented liquid TAP medium were inoculated at a starting density of 1–2 × 106 cells ml−1 in 200 ml of +Cu TAP in 250-ml flasks. Cultures were allowed to grow at room temperature (21–23 °C) with shaking at 200 rpm under dim light (12 μmol m−2 sec−1). Cultures were bubbled with various gas mixtures consisting of either 0 or 1% air, 0 or 2% CO2, and 97 or 100% N2. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the cultures was monitored with an Orion model 810 DO meter and a model 081010 electrode. Total soluble proteins were extracted and analyzed by immunoblotting with antiserum to plastocyanin, cyt c6 , or coprogen oxidase (29.Quinn J.M. Nakamoto S.S. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14444-14454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,34.Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by hybridization as described above. In previous work, we found that the regulatory region of the Cyc6 gene could be separated into 2 fragments, from −129 to −110 and −110 to −50 nucleotides (designated region I and region II, respectively), each of which could separately confer copper-responsive expression on theArs2 reporter gene (28.Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 623-638PubMed Google Scholar). To identify a copper-response element within these fragments, we undertook a scanning mutagenesis experiment, initially with region I because of its smaller size. The “wild-type” construct contained region I (−129 to −110) fused to a reporter gene (Ars2) driven by a minimal promoter from theChlamydomonas Tub2 gene. In the test constructs (Table I, lines 1–5), groups of 3–6 nucleotides were transversionally mutated to the noncomplementary nucleotides. Each construct was introduced intoChlamydomonas in co-transformation experiments as described previously. Because integration of reporter gene constructs into theChlamydomonas nuclear genome does not usually occur via homologous recombination, the position of the reporter gene construct in the genome of each transformant will have an effect on expression. Expression can be affected also by the number of copies of the construct present at each integration site or in each transformant and by gene silencing. Therefore, for each test construct we analyzed multiple independent transformants 2For several of the constructs analyzed in this work (e.g. 3, 10, 13, and 45 in Tables I and III) no (or very few) arylsulfatase-expressing cotransformants were recovered. To verify that the lack of arylsulfatase expression was due to the mutation in the construct and not due to low cotransformation frequency, genomic DNA from 16 randomly chosen Arg+ transformants was amplified to estimate the cotransformation frequency. Cotransformation frequencies ranged from 50 to 87% for all constructs, and there was no correlation found between the cotransformation frequencies and arylsulfatase expression (data not shown). for copper-responsive reporter gene expression by comparing arylsulfatase activity (Table I, lines 1–5) or Ars2 mRNA abundance (Fig. 1 A) in copper-supplemented versus copper-deficient cells of the same transformant. Thus we are assaying only the response to copper rather than the absolute level of gene expression from each construct. On this basis we concluded that mutations encompassing the sequence from −126 to −119, 5′-CTGTACCT-3′, affected copper-responsive expression. The analysis was refined by changing each of these eight nucleotides individually (Table I, lines 7–23; Fig.1 B) and testing for copper-responsive expression. Mutations at four positions, corresponding to the sequence from −124 to −121, 5′-GTAC-3′, abolished copper-responsive expression. The effect is generally independent of the particular nucleotide substitution (for example, lines 10–12, 13–15, and16–18). A few other mutations (e.g. −127C → A and −120C → A; lines 6 and 22) also affected copper responsiveness (only 2-fold activation in −Cu conditions) but apparently not as strongly as the ones altering the GTAC sequence. We concluded, therefore, that the sequence GTAC was a critical determinant of a CuRE. Mutation of any one of these nucleotides must affect drastically the affinity of a putative CuRE-binding protein for this sequence.Table IMutagenesis of region I, the −129 to −110 nucleotide CuRE-containing fragmenta Nanomoles p-nitrophenol/min/109cells.

We sought to assess the relative contribution of each of these nucleotides to the affinity of the CuRE/CuRE-binding protein interaction by testing each mutation in the context of a tandem duplication of the CuRE (Table I, column on right side), the rationale being that the native Cyc6 promoter contains at least two CuREs, and in general DNA-binding proteins exhibit cooperative interactions when multiple binding sites are available. Mutations within the GTAC sequence were just as drastic in the two copy context as in the one copy context, except for the −121C → G mutation (Table I, line 20), where copper responsiveness is retained in the two-copy context. When the mutations with a milder phenotype were tested in the two copy context, copper responsiveness was retained (compare Fig. 1, B and C; constructs 6 and 22). It would appear that the Cs at position −127 and −120 contribute less to sequence-specific binding than does the GTAC sequence. When the mutations in constructs 6 and 22 are combined (TableI, Fig. 1, B and C, construct 24), the effect is not significantly different from that seen in constructs carrying single mutations. Examination of region II (−110 to −50) (TableII and Fig.2) showed that it contained two GTAC sequences; both were part of the KpnI restriction sites defining the ends of the fragment. Mutation of the distalKpnI site (GGTACC) at position −110 to an EcoRI site (GAATTC) did not affect copper responsiveness (construct 25), but if the proximal site was also mutated (construct 38), copper responsiveness was abolished, suggesting that the proximal site might be part of a CuRE. To confirm this and to determine whether the distalKpnI site might independently be important for CuRE activity, each site was mutated individually in the context of the native"

The importance of the VEGF/KDR signaling system is further emphasized by the demonstration that neutralization of VEGF or inhibition of KDR/Flk1 blocks the growth and spread of cancers in animals (20.Strawn L.M.

The role of KDR in promoting endothelial growth and survival together with the observation that this receptor plays an obligate role in the progression of pathologies dependent on angiogenesis led us to search for proteins that might be components of the VEGF/KDR signaling pathway. The approach used was to screen two-hybrid libraries for proteins that directly bind the cytoplasmic domain of KDR (KDR-IC). Because KDR/Flk1 is expressed by hematopoietic cell types, as well as endothelial cells, that share a common lineage (23.Choi K. Kennedy M. Kazarov A. Papadimitriou J.C. Keller G. Development. 1998; 125: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), human endothelial and B cell two-hybrid libraries were screened. This has led to the identification of the cDNA for an adaptor protein that binds KDR. The VEGF receptor-associated protein, VRAP, contains an N-terminal SH2 domain and a C-terminal proline-rich motif. VRAP mRNA is well expressed in the endothelium, blood cells, liver, lung, and heart. VRAP constitutively binds PLCγ and PI 3-kinase, and stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with VEGF results in recruitment of VRAP to KDR. These observations suggest that VRAP is an adaptor protein that shuttles important cytoplasmic effector proteins to KDR such that they can be used to promote VEGF action. Recombinant VEGF and the cDNA for KDR were gifts from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). The human B-cell two-hybrid library was obtained from CLONTECH. Anti-KDR/Flk1 conjugated to agarose and anti-KDR were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibody directed against PLCγ was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The antibody directed against the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). HUVEC obtained as described previously (24.Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar) were grown on 0.2% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in endothelial cell growth medium (EGM, Clonetics, Inc.) in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Subconfluent HUVEC were starved in endothelial cell basal medium (EBM, Clonetics, Inc.) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 16 h and then treated with various reagents as described in the figure legends. Yeast strains for two-hybrid experiments were obtained from CLONTECHas components of the MATCHMAKER Two-hybrid System. Strains SFY526 and Y190 were used to assay protein-protein interactions and for library screening, respectively. The intracellular domain of KDR spanning amino acids 788 to 1339 was polymerase chain reaction amplified usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned into theSalI and ScaI restriction sites of pGBT9 to produce pGBT9-KDR-IC. Two-hybrid assays using the GAL4 system were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (CLONTECH). For library screening, Y190 yeast cells were transformed with a human B cell two-hybrid library and pGBT9-KDR-IC. For characterizing interactions of KDR and VRAP, KDR-IC or KDR-IC point mutants in pGBT9 were cotransformed into the SFY526 yeast strain together with VRAP truncation mutants. To prepare truncated versions of VRAP, cDNAs amplified by polymerase chain reaction corresponding to the N-terminal domain (codon 1–94, VRAP-NH2), the SH2 domain (codon 95–186, VRAP-SH2), or the C-terminal proline-rich domain (codon 187–389, VRAP-Pro) were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned intoBamHI/EcoRI-digested pGAD424. Protein-protein interactions were then identified based on the lacZ phenotype. Using pGBT9-KDR-IC as a template, three tyrosine residues (Tyr-951, Tyr-996, and Tyr-1175) were individually mutated to phenylalanine, generating Y951F, Y996F, and Y1175F, respectively. The mutations were effected using the Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from low passage (<4) HUVEC using Qiagen and Oligotex kits. The RNA was fractionated and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Northern blotting of this and human multiple tissue RNA blots purchased fromCLONTECH were carried out in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). VRAP and β-actin cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random priming kit from Promega, Inc. After treatments, HUVEC were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by incubation in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.2% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting were then conducted as described previously (25.Guo D. Jia Q. Song H-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To identify proteins involved in KDR signal transduction, KDR-IC fused with the GAL4 DNA binding domain was used as bait to screen human B cell and endothelial cell two-hybrid libraries cloned into the GAL4 activation domain. Using the B cell library, a total of 620,000 colonies were screened. From among eight His+/lacZ+ colonies isolated, one was a true positive. DNA sequence analysis and data bank searches revealed that the VRAP clone encodes a previously described T cell-specific protein of unknown function (26.Spurkland A. Brinchmann J.E. Markussen G. Pedeutou F. Munthe E. Lea T. Vartdal F. Ansheim H-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4539-4546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). VRAP is a 389-amino acid protein comprised of an N-terminal sequence of 94 amino acids, an SH2 domain (amino acids 95–186), and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 187–389) that contains a proline-rich region (Fig.1 A). The specificity and nature of the interaction between KDR-IC and VRAP was characterized by co-transformation of various constructs into the SFY526 yeast strain. pGBT9 (GAL4-BD) and Lam5′ (lamin) were tested for interaction with VRAP and did not activate β-galactosidase. β-Galactosidase activity was detected only in yeast co-transformed with VA3 (p53) and TD1 (the SV40 large T antigen), a positive control, or KDR-IC and VRAP. These results confirm the KDR/VRAP interaction and rule out the possibility that VRAP contains intrinsic transcriptional activity or interacts with other proteins nonspecifically. Because SH2 domains bind phosphotyrosine, we conducted experiments to determine whether tyrosines in KDR are necessary for interaction with VRAP. Tyrosines corresponding to amino acids 951, 996, 1054, and 1059 in KDR are phosphorylated in bacteria (27.Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and are likely sites for phosphorylation in mammalian cells. Tyrosines 951 and 996 are in the kinase insert domain of KDR, whereas Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1059 are in the catalytic domain. Tyr-1175 in the C-terminal domain of KDR corresponds to Tyr-1169 in Flt1, a binding site for PLCγ (28.Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29.Cunningham S.A. Pia Arrate M. Brock T.A. Waxhm M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Given that Tyr-951, Tyr-996, and Tyr-1175 are outside of the KDR catalytic domain, these were mutated to phenylalanine to produce Y951F, Y996F, and Y1175F. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, it was found that Tyr-951 in KDR plays an obligate role in the KDR/VRAP interaction (Fig.1 B). Surprisingly, the VRAP SH2 domain by itself was incapable of interaction with KDR in the two-hybrid system. Further analysis revealed that N- and C-terminal domains of VRAP also did not bind KDR. These observations suggested that each of the domains within VRAP may play a role in sustaining a conformation conducive to receptor binding and that the SH2 domain may have a somewhat unique structure. This latter supposition was confirmed by a search of GenBankTM , which revealed that the amino acid sequence of the SH2 domain in VRAP is quite different from those in other proteins. Alignment of SH2 domains showed that VRAP shares some homology with the SH2 domains of corkscrew, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, LNK, a cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase, the c-Src kinase and PLCγ, with which it is most closely related. Northern blot analysis defined the tissue expression pattern of VRAP. Multiple tissue blots revealed VRAP mRNA in peripheral leukocytes, the spleen and thymus and also in the heart, lung, and liver, which are well perfused with blood (Fig.2 A). Transcripts of varying sizes which may arise from alternative splicing were present in these tissues and also in RNA from HUVEC (Fig. 2 B). VRAP expression was much lower, or nondetectable, in brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, and colon. Furthermore, using the polyclonal VRAP antibody described below, we detected VRAP in human foreskin fibroblasts (data not shown), as well as HUVEC (see below), indicating that the protein may be expressed in many cell types. Thus, VRAP expression is not restricted to T cells, as first reported (26.Spurkland A. Brinchmann J.E. Markussen G. Pedeutou F. Munthe E. Lea T. Vartdal F. Ansheim H-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4539-4546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but is strongly expressed in blood cell lineages, the endothelium, and other cell and tissue types. A polyclonal antibody to the proline-rich domain of VRAP was raised in rabbits. The antibody recognized a protein of about 52 kDa in lysates of HUVEC (Fig. 3 A). Neutralization of antibody with the immunogen (the proline-rich domain of VRAP) abrogated the ability of anti-VRAP to detect the 52-kDa protein. Having a characterized antibody made it possible to determine whether KDR and VRAP associate. To accomplish this, KDR was immunoprecipitated from control- and VEGF-treated HUVEC. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, the proteins associate, and VEGF stimulation promotes this process. These observations validate the results derived from two-hybrid screening, which first identified VRAP as a protein that interacts with KDR-IC. Also, the ability of VEGF, which promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR (18.Wu L-W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Baerwald M.R. Jaffe E.A. Wang D. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5096-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), to promote formation of VRAP/KDR complexes provides support for the view that the SH2 domain of VRAP, although somewhat unique, is functionally competent. The presence of proline-rich motifs in its C-terminal domain led us to test whether VRAP would interact with proteins that contain SH3 domains, among which are PLCγ and PI 3-kinase. These proteins were selected for investigation as we recently showed that, by signaling through KDR, VEGF promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), which plays a role in VEGF-induced MAPK activation and endothelial cell proliferation (18.Wu L-W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Baerwald M.R. Jaffe E.A. Wang D. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5096-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Also activated by signaling through KDR is the Akt serine threonine kinase, a downstream target for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and an important cell survival factor (18.Wu L-W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Baerwald M.R. Jaffe E.A. Wang D. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4, Aand B, Western blot analysis of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with PLCγ or PI 3-kinase revealed that each effector protein interacts with VRAP. Furthermore, the interactions were constitutive, and the level of association was not augmented by stimulation of HUVEC with VEGF. These observations indicate that VRAP binds cytoplasmic signaling proteins and then acts as a shuttle to bring these into a complex with KDR. Tyrosine 951 in KDR is a binding site not only for VRAP, but for PLCγ as well (18.Wu L-W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Baerwald M.R. Jaffe E.A. Wang D. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5096-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), suggesting that PLCγ may complex with KDR directly or through the intermediacy of VRAP. It is interesting to consider that competition between VRAP and PLCγ for Tyr-951 may affect the array of other signaling proteins that can be brought into a complex with KDR and thereby affect VEGF action. This situation is not unprecedented as the Nck adaptor protein and PI 3-kinase share a phosphotyrosine-containing binding site in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (30.Nishimura R. Li W. Kashishian A. Mondino A. Zhou M. Cooper J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6889-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Overall, our observations define VRAP as an adaptor that facilitates and regulates interaction of KDR with effector proteins important to endothelial cell survival and proliferation."

The dihydropyridine-sensitive l-type Ca2+ channels in cardiac cells provide a major pathway for entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cytoplasm (1.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992: 83-114Google Scholar). The cardiac l-type Ca2+ channel molecule consists of three subunits, the channel pore-forming α1 subunit, an intracellular β subunit, and the largely extracellular α2/δ subunit (2.Mikama A. Imoto K.

The α1 subunit contains four domains denoted I–IV, with N and C termini located in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 4 A), as is also the case for sodium and potassium channels (the latter having four subunits) (10.Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev Biochem. 1995; 64: 491-531Crossref Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Each domain is composed of six hydrophobic segments, S1–S6, which span the plasma membrane. Owing to the unique presence of positively charged residues (arginine or lysine) at every three or four residues, the S4 segment has been recognized as the voltage sensor (10.Catterall W.A. Annu.

The P region connecting the S5 and S6 segments forms the external mouth of the channel pore, where a ring of four negatively charged glutamate residues contributes to the Ca2+selectivity of the channel (14.Heinemann S.H.

Functional expression studies have demonstrated that the α1 subunit has the ability to constitute a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel on its own. However, the ancillary subunits, in particular the β subunit, are essential to form fully functioning channels (2.Mikama A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

The precise structural domains responsible for the interaction between the α1 subunit and the β subunit have been defined; the interaction domain on the α1 subunit has been identified on the cytoplasmic loop connecting domains I and II (20.Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 21.De Waard Scott V.E.S. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4 A), whereas the complementary interaction region is located on a conserved domain of the β subunit (22.De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Second messenger-activated protein kinase phosphorylation has been well documented to be a crucial physiological regulation mechanism of cardiac l-type Ca2+ channels (6.Hosey M.M. Chien A.J. Puri T.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9.Xiong Z.L. Sperelakis N. J. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1994; 140: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For instance, the N-terminal region of the rabbit α1Csubunit has been identified as being important for the ability of protein kinase C (PKC)1 to regulate Ca2+ channel currents (25.Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of the C-terminal region by cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) has been demonstrated to increase Ca2+ channel currents (26.Perets T. Blumenstein Y. Shistik E. Lotan I. Dascal N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27.De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colin A.A. Hell J.W. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Cyclic GMP is recognized as being an important second messenger in native cells (29.Waldman S.A. Murad F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1987; 39: 163-196PubMed Google Scholar), leading to inhibition of calcium currents via activation of protein kinase G. However, the mechanism of action of PKG on calcium channels has not previously been studied at the molecular/structural level. Regulation by cGMP is an important mechanism, especially because of the key role of nitric oxide in activating guanylate cyclase (30.McDonald L.J. Murad F. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 211: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, nitric oxide donors cause vasodilatation in vascular smooth muscle, and this may occur in part by a decrease in l-type calcium channel currents, which is known to occur via the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (9.Xiong Z.L. Sperelakis N. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 75-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24.Sperelakis N. Xiong Z.L. Haddad G. Masuda H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism is found in cardiac muscle, where phosphorylation by PKG again decreases calcium channel currents (31.Haddad G.E. Sperelakis N. Bkaily G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 148: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32.Schulz R. Triggle C.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 255-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and this could explain the negative inotropic effects of nitric oxide on the heart. Kinetic analysis of the effect of cGMP on single Ca2+ channel activity in patch-clamped cardiac cells indicates that cGMP-induced activation of PKG prolongs the closed time with no effect on open time and single channel conductance (33.Tohse N. Sperelakis N. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although it therefore seems clear that PKG can inhibit calcium channel currents, the situation is complicated because, in some (but not all) cell preparations, the PKG-mediated effect may only be observable after PKA activation by cAMP; under basal conditions, activation of PKG may have no detectable effect upon Ca2+ channel currents (34.Levi R.C. Alloatti G. Fischmeister R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 413: 685-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 35.Wahler G.M. Dollinger S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C45-C54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To complicate matters further, there is also evidence that the inhibitory effects of cGMP on frog cardiac l-type Ca2+ channel currents may be mediated by cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase activity rather than activation of PKG. This mechanism may involve the breakdown of intracellular cAMP by the phosphodiesterase, which then results in the subsequent reduction in the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the Ca2+ channels and consequent reduction in currents (36.Hartzell H.C. Fischmeister R. Nature. 1986; 323: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,37.Mery P. Pavoine S.M. Water U. Fischmeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26286-26295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is therefore much evidence for an important role for cGMP/PKG in the regulation of cardiac l-type channels, the site of phosphorylation remains to be determined. For instance the effect may not be mediated by direct phosphorylation of the channel. Alternatively, if the channel itself is phosphorylated, it is not known which subunit, or indeed which residue, is phosphorylated. There is some evidence that the α1 and β subunits can be phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase G (8.Hell J.W. Yokoyama C.T. Wong S.T. Warner C. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19451-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Jahn H. Nastainczyk W. Rohrkasten A. Schneider T. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 178: 535-542Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, there is still no direct evidence that functional effects accompany any such phosphorylation. Here, we have attempted to gain a better understanding of the mechanism involved in the cGMP-mediated inhibition of the cardiac l-type Ca2+ channel currents. By expressing cloned rabbit calcium channels inXenopus oocytes, we have investigated the molecular/structural basis of the functional effect of cGMP; in particular, direct effects on the channel, the subunit concerned, and the residue phosphorylated have been studied. cDNA clones for rabbit cardiac l-type Ca2+ channel α1Csubunit (2.Mikama A.

The cDNA encoding the rabbit α1C subunit was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) between the HindIII andKpnI restriction sites in the vector multiple cloning sequence (the first nonessential 171 bases of the 5′-untranslated region of the α1C cDNA were deleted, as was a short fragment containing an unwanted EcoRI site betweenAsp718 and XbaI within the multiple cloning region of the vector). This construct was then used as the template for PCR mutagenesis of S533A and S1371A using the method of Sarkar and Sommer (41.Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was carried out using Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolab) for 30 cycles (40 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60–64 °C, and at a 1 kb/min extension rate at 72 °C). To make mutant S533A, first round PCR was carried out using a forward mutagenic primer (5′-AGT CGA AAT TCG CCC GCT ACT GGC) and a reverse primer (5′-CAC GGC CTT CTC CTT AAG GTG) to produce a 1.1-kb product. Second round PCR was then undertaken using a forward primer (5′-TCT ACA TCT CTC CTG GAG GTT C) and the 1.1-kb first round PCR product as the reverse “megaprimer” to produce a 2.6-kb product. This 2.6-kb product was then digested with restriction endonucleasesClaI and EcoRI to produce a ∼2.0-kb fragment. The wild type α1C cDNA was similarly digested withClaI and EcoRI, and the mutagenic 2-kb fragment was then ligated into the α1C cDNA. For mutant S1371A, PCR mutagenesis was carried out similarly. First round PCR was undertaken using a forward mutagenic primer (5′-CAA GCT GCT GGC CCG CGG GGA G-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GCC GGA GGA GGG TCA CCA CA-3′), again using the wild type α1C-pcDNA3 template to synthesize a first round product of ∼0.6 kb. Second round PCR was undertaken with a forward primer (5′-TCC ATT ACA GCT GAT GGA GAG T) and the 0.6-kb product as the reverse megaprimer. The 2.1-kb PCR product synthesized was digested with AflII and BstEII to produce a 1.9-kb fragment. The wild type α1C cDNA was similarly digested with AflII and BstEII, and the mutagenic fragment was then ligated into the α1C cDNA. The introduced mutations were both sequenced and verified; the S1371A mutant also had an additional mutation G1375A outside the consensus phosphorylation sequence (see Fig. 4). For making RNA, the cDNAs for α1C (in pcDNA3) and β1 (in pSPORTS2) were first linearized byAsp718 and SalI, respectively, and β2 (in pBluescript or pcDNA3) and α2δ-1 (in pcDNA3) were linearized byNotI. Capped cRNAs were synthesized in vitrounder T7 polymerase using MEGAscript (Ambion). The RNA concentration was estimated using a formaldehyde gel, comparing with standard markers. The preparation of oocytes from Xenopus laevis frogs, microinjection of RNA, and maintenance of injected oocytes have been detailed elsewhere (42.Wilson G. O'Neill C.A. Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Wray D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 428: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, each oocyte was injected with 50 nl containing cRNA for α1C alone (∼25 ng) or together with 8 ng of RNA for β1 or β2. The α2δ-1 subunit was not normally co-injected, except where specifically stated in the text (amounts of RNA injected: α1C, 15 ng; β2, 5.1 ng; and α2δ, 7.5 ng). Oocytes were incubated at 19.8 °C for 2–3 days in modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 7.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 104 units/liter penicillin, and 10 mg/liter streptomycin) before examining the expression of Ca2+ channels. The oocytes were held in a 50-μl recording chamber and perfused by a high barium solution containing 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mmNaOH, 2 mm KOH, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with methanesulfonic acid (22–25 °C). The calcium channel currents using Ba2+ as charge carrier were measured with the two-electrode voltage clamp using the Geneclamp500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) as described previously (42.Wilson G. O'Neill C.A. Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Wray D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 428: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Currents were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 4 kHz by using a CED1401Plus interface with CED data acquisition software. The membrane potential of oocytes was held at −80 mV. To construct the current-voltage relationships, Ba2+ currents were elicited by a series of 200-ms depolarizing pulses every 10 s, from −70 mV to +60 mV in 10-mV increments, followed by 20 200-ms hyperpolarizing pulses every 2 s stepping to −90 mV for subsequent leak and capacitative current subtractions. In experiments investigating the effects of 8-bromo-cyclic GMP (Sigma) or KT5823 (Calbiochem), 200-ms depolarizing pulses to +10 mV were applied every 30 s (or exceptionally where stated every 10 s) from the holding potential of −80 mV; the agents were then applied by continuous superfusion while repetitively stimulating. In some experiments, the oocytes were perfused first with KT5823 for 15–20 min before application of 8-Br-cGMP as above. 8-Br-cGMP was directly dissolved in the bathing solution prior to use, whereas KT5823 was diluted from 1 mm stock in Me2SO to the specified final concentration (final concentration of Me2SO was always less than 0.1% v/v). Experiments using 8-Br-cGMP were carried out in a darkened room to prevent breakdown. All data were presented as the means ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Comparisons between means were made using the Student's ttest, with a significance level at p < 0.05. COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm glutamine and maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C prior to their use. COS cells were transfected using the Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) transfection procedure. For this, cells were seeded to a confluency of ∼20% 24 h prior to transfection. For each plate of cells, cDNA (5 μg of α1C and 5 μg of β2) was diluted in 2 ml of OPTI-MEM medium and then mixed by agitation for 15 min with 25 μg of Lipofectin also suspended in 2 ml of OPTI-MEM medium. Cells were washed twice with OPTI-MEM medium and then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with the DNA-Lipofectin mix for 12 h. Culture medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were allowed to recover for a further 48 h prior to their use. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against anα 1C subunit fragment (comprising IIS6 and the II/III linker) was prepared as follows. A GST-α 1C fusion protein was made by subcloning the cDNA encoding amino acids Asn739–His896 (between EcoRI andAflII sites) of the rabbit α 1Csubunit into the pGEX-3X vector at the SmaI site of the vector multiple cloning sequence. The construct was expressed inE. coli and purified by batch adsorption to glutathione-agarose beads, and the eluted fusion protein was used to immunize rabbits. Anti-GST antibody was removed from the rabbit serum by adsorption to GST on nitrocellulose and checked by Western blotting. Transfected COS cells expressing the α1C and β2 subunits were lysed by homogenization at 4 °C in 1 ml of RIPA lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 7.5. This was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-α1c serum (10 μl) conjugated to protein A-Sepharose. The antibody-protein complexes were then collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and washed three times with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were probed with anti-α1c antibody (1:1000 dilution) and detected with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody followed by ECL. Oocytes were injected with cRNA, and the expression of Ca2+ channels was confirmed in samples taken from each batch using electrophysiological recording prior to their use in labeling experiments. Batches of 50 oocytes were pooled and incubated for 3 h at 25 °C with [32P]inorganic phosphate (1 mCi/5 ml) in modified Barth's solution. After incubation, oocytes were washed twice and resuspended in fresh Barth's solution and then reincubated in the dark in the presence or absence of 8-Br-cGMP (1 mm) for 20 min. Oocytes were then washed twice with fresh Barth's solution and then resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer. The lysed oocytes were subjected to preclearing by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with preimmune rabbit serum that had been preconjugated to protein A-Sepharose, followed by separation by centrifugation. Lysates were precleared three times prior to immunoprecipitation with the anti-α1C subunit antibody as described above for COS cells. Before studying the effects of cGMP, the characteristics of the wild type channels expressed in oocytes were determined. Inward currents were observed for oocytes injected with α1C subunit alone or in combination with either β1 or β2 subunit. It can be seen (Fig.1) that currents were small for the α1C subunit, whereas the additional presence of either β1 or β2 subunit produced larger inward currents, which shifted the I-V curve to the left. The presence of the β subunits led to faster activation and to some inactivation in the case of β1 (but hardly any inactivation for β2) (Fig. 1). The sensitivity of the expressed calcium channel currents to dihydropyridines was checked using the agonist BAY K8644 for oocytes injected with α1C β2subunits. It can be seen from Fig. 1 E that BAY K8644 gave the expected increase in current and shift to the left of the I-V curve. In uninjected oocytes there were no appreciable inward currents. In summary, the data reported in this section indicate that the injected α1C and β subunits behaved in our hands in a similar manner to previous reports (3.Perez-Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim H.S.

Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), constituting anl-type calcium channel with expected voltage dependence and kinetics. To study the effects of phosphorylation by protein kinase G, the membrane-permeable cGMP analogue, 8-Br-cGMP, was applied by perfusion in the bath. The roles of the different subunits in phosphorylation were examined by applying this reagent to oocytes expressing either α1C subunit alone or in combination with β1 or β2 subunits. During repetitive depolarizations to +10 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV, oocytes were continuously perfused with 8-Br-cGMP. For oocytes expressing the α1C subunit alone, there was a reduction in calcium channel currents by 8-Br-cGMP (Fig.2 A). Reductions in calcium channel currents were also observed when 8-Br-cGMP was applied in the same manner to oocytes expressing either α1Cβ1 subunits or α1C β2subunits (Fig. 2, B and C). The extent of reduction in currents produced by 8-Br-cGMP was similar for both α1C β1 and α1Cβ2 combinations. The effect seemed to be greater in the case of α1C subunit alone, but this did not attain statistical significance. Example currents are also displayed in Fig. 2(insets), which show that there were no obvious effects of 8-Br-cGMP on the activation and inactivation kinetics of the Ca2+ channel currents. Further experiments were carried out to investigate whether the above effects are indeed caused via the activation of protein kinase G or by some other mechanism (such as direct 8-Br-cGMP action). For this, oocytes expressing α1C β2 subunits were pretreated with the protein kinase G inhibitor, KT5823 (43.Grider J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G334-G340PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.3 A shows that the inhibitor alone had no effect on calcium channel currents, but, as can be seen from Fig. 3 B, the reduction in current by 8-Br-cGMP was essentially abolished by previous incubation with the inhibitor, KT5823. The I-V curves shown in Fig. 3 C have been normalized at +10 mV and show that neither 8-Br-cGMP nor the inhibitor had an effect on the voltage dependence of the calcium channel currents. In summary, the results in this section indicate that 8-Br-cGMP caused reductions in wild type calcium channel currents whether or not a β subunit was present and that the effect is indeed due to modulation by protein kinase G. Because the data so far described suggest a role for the α1C subunit in phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase G, we have therefore analyzed the amino acid sequence of the α1C subunit for potential PKG consensus sequences. Based on previously recognized PKG consensus sequences (44.Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) together with a basic arginine residue downstream (45.Edelman A.M. Blumenthal D.K. Krebs E.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), two potential PKG phosphorylation sites were identified at serine 533 and serine 1371 of the rabbit α1C subunit used in the present studies (Fig. 4). Each of these serines was mutated to alanine (which introduces only a substitution of -OH by -H), and the effect of these mutations on the regulation of the Ca2+ channel by 8-Br-cGMP was investigated. The S1371A/G1375A mutant α1C subunit was first investigated and coexpressed with the β2 subunit in oocytes. Channel currents for this mutant were similar in magnitude (data not shown) and exhibited similar voltage dependence to wild type currents (normalized I-V curves shown in Fig.5 B). Perfusion of the cells with 8-Br-cGMP resulted in a significant reduction (p< 0.05) of Ca2+ channel currents (Fig. 5 A), as for wild type. Normalized I-V curves showed that this effect was voltage-independent (Fig. 5 C), also as for wild type. Again, pretreatment of cells with the PKG inhibitor KT5823 reduced the effect of 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 5 B). Clearly these experiments show that mutation of serine 1371 (and glycine 1375) are not concerned with functional effects of phosphorylation by protein kinase G. The mutant S533A α1C subunit was also co-expressed with the β2 subunit in oocytes. Again the calcium channel currents were similar in magnitude (data not shown) and voltage dependence (normalized I-V curve, Fig.6 B). However, as can be seen from Fig. 6 A, 8-Br-cGMP perfusion on oocytes expressing this mutant did not inhibit the Ca2+ channel currents (Fig.6 A). Furthermore, the I-V curves for mutant currents before and after 8-Br-cGMP treatment were not significantly different (Fig.6 B). The results for this mutant indicate that (in contrast to residue Ser1371) residue Ser533 on the α1C subunit is essential for cGMP-induced regulation of calcium channel currents via phosphorylation by protein kinase G"

The shorter chain fatty acid isoforms of Gb3 (primarily C16 and C18) are elevated and VT is internalized to the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope as we have reported for other hypersensitive cell lines. P-gp (but not MRP) inhibitors, e.g. ketoconazole or cyclosporin A (CsA) prevented the increased Gb3 and VT sensitivity, concomitant with increased vinblastine sensitivity. Gb3synthase was not significantly elevated in MDR1-MDCK cells and was not affected by CsA. In MDR1-MDCK cells, synthesis of fluorescentN-[7-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)]-aminocaproyl (NBD)-lactosylceramide (LacCer) and NBD-Gb3 via NBD-glucosylceramide (GlcCer) from exogenous NBD-C6-ceramide, was prevented by CsA. We therefore propose that P-gp can mediate GlcCer translocation across the bilayer, from the cytosolic face of the Golgi to the lumen, to provide increased substrate for the lumenal synthesis of LacCer and subsequently Gb3. These results provide a molecular mechanism for the observed increased sensitivity of multidrug-resistant tumors to VT and emphasize the potential of verotoxin as an antineoplastic. Two strains (I and II) of MDCK cells, which differ in their glycolipid profile, have been described. The original MDR1-MDCK parental cell was not specified, but the MDR1-MDCK GSL phenotype and glycolipid synthase activities indicate MDCK-I cells. However, the partial drug resistance of MDCK-I cells precludes their being the parental cell. We speculate that the retroviral transfection per se, or the subsequent selection for drug resistance, selected a subpopulation of MDCK-I cells in the parental MDCK-II cell culture and that drug resistance in MDR1-MDCK cells is thus a result of both MDR1 expression and a second, previously unrecognized, component, likely the high level of GlcCer synthesis in these cells.

Analysis of the neutral glycolipid content of ovarian tumors showed that Gb3 was elevated for most tumors, but the elevation was markedly greater for metastases and multidrug-resistant tumors (5.Arab S. Russel E. Chapman W. Rosen B. Lingwood C. Oncol. Res. 1997; 9: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar). Such tumors showed a noticeable increase in Gb3 species that migrated more slowly on TLC, consistent with shorter chain fatty acid isoforms. Similarly, human astrocytoma cell lines, which show high sensitivity to verotoxin in vitro (6.Arab S. Murakami M. Dirks P. Boyd B. Hubbard S. Lingwood C. Rutka J. J. Neuro. Oncol. 1998; 40: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and as nude mice xenografts in vivo (7.Arab S. Rutka J. Lingwood C. Oncol. Res. 1999; 11: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar), showed increased content of short chain fatty acid containing Gb3. The presence of the short chain fatty acid Gb3 species was correlated with an altered intracellular trafficking of verotoxin within the sensitive cells, such that toxin was targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear envelope, and nucleus, as opposed to the Golgi in cells deficient in such receptor isoforms (4.Arab S. Lingwood C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 646-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the known (glyco)lipid translocase activity of P-gp itself (8.van Helvoort A. Smith A. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A. Borst P. van Meer G.

Our studies show MDR1 plays an important role in glycolipid biosynthesis. In addition, our results cast doubt on the parental origin of the MDR1-MDCK transfectants and show that the drug resistance of these cells is due in part to an additional, non-MDR1 mechanism.

Biochem. 1994; 217: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). VT1B was conjugated with Texas Red (Molecular Probes) as described by the manufacturer. MDCK cells retrovirally infected with the human MDR1 cDNA were a gift from Dr. M. Gottesman (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (11.Pastan I. Gottesman M. Ueda K. Lovelace E. Rutherford A. Willingham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4486-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Wild type MDCK cells (which we have termed MDCK-wt in this study) were from ATCC, MDCK-I cells were kindly provided by Dr. G. van Meer (University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 40 μg/ml gentamycin (MDR1-MDCK medium also contained 80 ng/ml colchicine). For P-gp inhibition studies, cells were grown in medium supplemented with 4 μm cyclosporin A (CsA) for 4 days or 5 μm ketoconazole for 6 days. 107 cells were scraped from the culture dish, centrifuged, and extracted with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1) as described previously (12.Pudymaitis A. Armstrong G. Lingwood C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was resuspended in water and extracted with 20 volumes chloroform/methanol (1:1). The extract was dried, redissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1), and partitioned against water. The lower phase was dried, redissolved in chloroform/methanol (98:2) and applied on a silica column. The column was washed extensively with chloroform, and the glycolipid fraction was eluted with acetone/methanol (9:1). Fatty acid analysis of purified Gb3 was performed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the fatty acid methyl esters as previously (4.Arab S. Lingwood C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 646-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13.Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Pind S. Lipids. 1989; 24: 396-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Verotoxin binding glycolipids were detected by VT overlay as described (14.Yui S.C.K. Lingwood C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using human renal neutral glycolipid fraction as standard. Log phase cells were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of verotoxin or vinblastine for a period of 3 days. Surviving adherent cells were stained with crystal violet, which was subsequently solubilized in 10% acetic acid for spectrophotometric quantitation. In some assays, cyclosporin A (4 μm) was added 3 days prior to VT or vinblastine and maintained during the cytotoxicity assay, to inhibit P-gp function. MDR1-MDCK cells were grown to confluence ± 4 μm CsA. After 30 min in the absence of serum, cells were treated with a liposome preparation containing a fluorescent ceramide analog,N-[7-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)]-ε-aminocaproyl (16.Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Martin O. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4439-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells were washed and incubated in serum-free media ± CsA for 4 h at 37 °C to allow cellular metabolism of C6CerNBD (8.van Helvoort A. Smith A. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed, trypsinized, and counted, and glycolipids were extracted, separated by TLC, and viewed under UV illumination. A separate plate was also visualized by VT1 TLC overlay. 5 × 107 cells were washed, scraped into 2 ml of PBS, and pelleted. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of dH2O, exposed to two freeze-thaw cycles, and sonicated for 30 s. The lysate was spun briefly to pellet membrane debris, and the supernatant (microsomal fraction) was analyzed for protein content by BCA assay (Pierce); the final protein concentration was adjusted to 2.5 mg/ml. In glass tubes, 20 μg of lipid substrate (LacCer, Gb3, or Gb4) and 10 μl of Triton X-100 in CHCl3 (10 mg/ml) were dried under N2. To this mixture the following reagents were added (final concentrations indicated): 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.4, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.2 μCi of UDP-[14C]galactose (Gb3 synthase assay) or 0.5 μCi of UDP-[3H]-N-acetylgalactosamine (Gb4 and Gb5 synthase assays) (NEN Life Science Products), 60 μl of microsomal extract (150 μg of protein), ddH2O to 100 μl final reaction volume. This mixture was vortexed briefly and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min, with shaking. Subsequently, 0.3 ml of PBS and 2 ml of 2:1 CHCl3/CH3OH were added, vortexed, and allowed to partition overnight. The lower phase was collected and run on TLC as described above; the plate was sprayed with enhancing reagent (EN3HANCE; NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to x-ray film in a phosphoimaging cassette for 6 days. MDR-MDCK cells were seeded on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. For cell surface Gb3 localization, cells were exposed to 1 μg/ml Texas Red-labeled VT1B (or FITC-VT1B) (18.Khine A.A. Lingwood C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. (For internalization, cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and fixed). Co-staining for human P-gp was performed using the MRK-16 monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml; Kamiya), followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, also at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing, coverslips were fixed, mounted, and examined using a Polyvar fluorescent microscope under incident UV illumination. For immunostaining of intracellular P-gp, cells were grown on glass coverslips to ∼50% confluence, then washed, fixed in 2% formalin, quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl, and permeabilized for 15 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Antibodies to P-gp (MRK-16) or the 58-kDa Golgi protein (19.Bloom G. Brashear T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (1:50; Sigma), and after washing a secondary Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody were added to the cells in permeabilization buffer. Cells were washed, fixed again, mounted, and examined. The glycosphingolipids (GSL) from MDCK-wt cells and MDR1-MDCK cells are distinct (Fig. 1,i). In MDCK-wt cells, Forssman glycolipid (Gb5) is the major species detected, as reported by others for high passage cultures (20.Nichols G.E. Lovejoy J.C. Borgman C.A. Sanders J.M. Young Jr., W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 887: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21.Hansson G.C. Simons K. van Meer G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Low levels of ceramide tetra-, tri-, di-, and monohexosides are detected. No Gb3 was detected in MDCK-wt cells by VT TLC overlay (Fig. 1, ii). In contrast, MDR1- MDCK cells show a major concentration of Gb3, and increased levels of ceramide di- and monohexosides. While glycolipids normally migrate on TLC as doublets as a result of heterogeneity within the lipid moiety, it is primarily the lower species of each GSL that is enhanced in the MDR1-MDCK cells (Fig. 1). No Gb4 or Forssman antigen are detected in the transfected cells. Two variants of MDCK cells with differing glycolipid profiles have been described (21.Hansson G.C. Simons K. van Meer G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the original report (11.Pastan I. Gottesman M. Ueda K. Lovelace E. Rutherford A. Willingham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4486-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), the subtype of MDCK cell used for transfection was not specified but, according to the glycolipid profile in Fig. 1, the MDCK-wt cells are MDCK-II, which express Forssman glycolipid but low levels of globoseries GSL (21.Hansson G.C. Simons K. van Meer G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore also compared the glycolipid profile of MDR1-MDCK cells with that of MDCK-I cells (Fig. 1) that do not express Gb4 or Forssman but do express GM3 (21.Hansson G.C. Simons K. van Meer G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). MDCK-I cells showed high GlcCer expression (unlike MDCK-wt cells) and low levels of LacCer and Gb3 (Fig. 1). As in MDCK-MDRI cells, the GlcCer and LacCer of MDCK-I cells was primarily the species migrating more slowly on TLC. MDCK-I Gb3 resolved as a doublet and only the slower species was dramatically elevated in the MDR1-MDCK cells (Fig.1 b). The fatty acid profiles of the elevated Gb3, LacCer, and GlcCer in MDR1-MDCK cells (TableI) were similar; the major species were C16 and C18 (GlcCer contained C18:1 in addition) fatty acids, but very few long chain species were present.Table IMDR1-MDCK GSL fatty acid compositionFatty acid methyl esterGlycolipidGb3LacCerGlcCer%%%14:08.396.912.4916:029.2425.9516.5016:1 n-78.304.551.0518:027.2328.5632.0118:1 n-96.929.1823.6518:2 n-60.739.993.6220:01.352.770.7322:04.061.2612.1920:4 n-61.261.620.8223:0NDaND, not detected.ND4.2324:06.135.651.6724:16.403.561.04100.00100.00100.00a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab The increased Gb3 content of theMDR1-transfected cells results in a 105- to 106-fold increase in sensitivity to VT as compared with either MDCK-I or MDCK-wt cells (Fig.2 a). The P-gp inhibitor, CsA (or ketoconazole; data not shown) caused a marked reduction in the Gb3 (and LacCer and GlcCer) content of MDR1-MDCK cells (Fig. 1) and a reduction in VT cytotoxicity to that of untransfected MDCK cells, coincident with inducing increased sensitivity to vinblastine (Fig. 2 b). Despite the expression of endogenous MDR activity (22.Hunter J. Hirst B.H. Simmons N.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the overall glycolipid profile of untransfected MDCK cells was not affected by CsA (data not shown). Although the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) has also been shown to act as a lipid translocase (23.Raggers R.J. van Helvoort A. Evers R. van Meer G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 415-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), probenecid, a specific inhibitor of MRP (24.Gollapudi S. Kim C. Tran B. Sangha S. Gupta S. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) had no effect on Gb3 synthesis (Fig. 1), VT, or vinblastine sensitivity (data not shown). As expected, MDR1-MDCK cells are resistant to vinblastine and this is abrogated in the presence of CsA (Fig. 2 b). However, MDCK-wt cells are significantly more susceptible to vinblastine than MDCK-I cells, and this sensitivity was not increased by CsA (or probenecid; data not shown) (Fig. 2 b). The vinblastine sensitivity of CsA-treated MDR1-MDCK cells is increased to the equivalent of that of MDCK-I cells. Double labeling of MDR1-MDCK cells with Texas red-conjugated VT1B and anti-P-gp at 4 °C (Fig. 3,a and b) showed significant surface VT1B staining. Surface staining by VT1B and anti-P-gp were in part, coincident. Plasma membrane VT staining was lost following cyclosporin A treatment (Fig. 3 c) as expected. Less expected was the similar loss of surface P-gp (Fig. 3 d). Fluorescent-VT1B incubated with MDR1-MDCK cells and allowed to internalize at 37 °C, accumulated around the nucleus (Fig. 3 e) consistent with an ER/nuclear membrane location. This pattern was distinct from that of the Golgi, as labeled with antibodies against the 58-kDa Golgi marker protein (Fig. 3 f). In contrast, intracellular P-gp showed the same crescent juxtanuclear Golgi location (Fig. 3 g). The fluorescent ceramide analogue C6-NBD-ceramide was taken up and converted to glucosyl NBD-ceramide (NBD-GlcCer) and NBD-sphingomyelin (NBD-SM) in MDR1-MDCK cells, together with lower levels of NBD-LacCer and NBD-Gb3 (Fig.4 a).While NBD-SM levels were unchanged, reduced conversion to NBD-GlcCer and higher residual NBD-ceramide was seen in the presence of CsA. Conversion of NBD-ceramide to NBD-LacCer and NBD-Gb3 was prevented in the presence of CsA. NBD-Gb3 was bound by VT, together with the endogenous elevated Gb3 of MDR1-MDCK cells (Fig.4 b). This binding was lost after cell CsA treatment. Gb3, Gb4 and Forssman synthase activities were assayed in the extracts of MDR1-MDCK, MDCK-I, and MDCK-wt cells. Gb3synthase was detected in all cell lines (slightly less in MDCK-I cells) (Fig. 5 a). Radiolabeled LacCer was seen for MDCK-I cells only, likely due to their high endogenous GlcCer content. The MDR1-MDCK Gb3 synthase assay was unaffected by CsA pretreatment of cells or the direct addition of CsA in the assay, indicating that P-gp does not play any direct role in Gb3 synthesis. The expected high activity of the Forssman α-N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase in MDCK-wt cells was demonstrated by the fact that [14C]Gb4synthesized from exogenous Gb3 was partially converted to Forssman in the Gb4 synthase assay. Exogenous Gb4 was readily converted to [14C]Forssman in the MDCK-wt extract. Neither Gb4 nor Forssman synthase activities were detected in MDCK-I or MDR1-MDCK extracts. We have proposed that verotoxin may provide a new approach to cancer treatment (5.Arab S. Russel E. Chapman W. Rosen B. Lingwood C. Oncol. Res. 1997; 9: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Arab S. Murakami M. Dirks P. Boyd B. Hubbard S. Lingwood C. Rutka J. J. Neuro. Oncol. 1998; 40: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7.Arab S. Rutka J. Lingwood C. Oncol. Res. 1999; 11: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar) and have observed that drug resistant tumor cells are hypersensitive to VT (3.Farkas-Himsley H. Rosen B. Hill R. Arab S. Lingwood C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6996-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4.Arab S. Lingwood C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 646-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The present studies indicate that this may be based on altered expression of the verotoxin glycolipid receptor, Gb3. The first glycosylation step in GSL biosynthesis occurs on the cytosolic face of the Golgi apparatus (25.Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The second enzyme, lactosylceramide synthase, the product of which is the precursor for most GSLs, is within the lumen of the Golgi (26.Lannert H. Bunning C. Jeckel D. Wieland F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27.Lannert H. Gorgas K. Meiner I. Wieland F.T. Jeckel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2939-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus a mechanism for the translocation of the substrate, glucosylceramide, for this enzyme from the cytosolic face to the lumen of the Golgi must exist. We propose that P-gp acts at this point. The subsequent steps in the globo-series biosynthesis occur in a stepwise fashion via Golgi-located lumenal transferases (27.Lannert H. Gorgas K. Meiner I. Wieland F.T. Jeckel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2939-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Earlier studies had shown, in polarized epithelial cells, that P-gp acts as a lipid translocase of limited specificity (8.van Helvoort A. Smith A. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). P-gp could flip glucosylceramide containing a short fatty acid derivatized with the NBD fluorescent marker from one side of the membrane to the other. Such a “flippase” activity has also been postulated as a mechanism by which P-gp can pump cytotoxic drugs out of resistant cells (28.Higgins C. Gottesman M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Other studies in drug-resistant cancer have indicated increased GlcCer synthesis is a marker of MDR in vitro and in vivo(29.Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 30.Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Lisovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32380-32383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It is proposed (31.Lucci A. Cho W. Han T. Giuliano A. Morton D. Cabot M. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar) that utilization of ceramide in GlcCer biosynthesis prevents ceramide-induced apoptosis. This would explain the partial drug resistance of MDCK-I as opposed to MDCK-wt cells (Fig.4). Transfection of cells with glucosylceramide synthase can generate a modest drug resistant phenotype (32.Liu Y.-Y. Han T.-Y. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1140-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and inhibitors of GSL biosynthesis have been shown to reverse the MDR phenotype (29.Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Stimulation of GSL synthesis by P-gp may provide a further route for depletion of ceramide pools to effect drug resistance. The glycolipid species that accumulated in MDR1-MDCK cells were primarily the more slowly migrating bands on TLC (corresponding to shorter fatty acid chain containing species (Table I) for GlcCer, LacCer, and Gb3. We therefore speculate that P-gp may be involved in the translocation of glucosylceramide from the cytosolic leaflet of the Golgi bilayer to the lumen but that this translocase activity may be biased toward short fatty acid containing species. This bias could result from a lower energy barrier to flip a short, as opposed to a long, acyl chain. This increased lumenal short chain fatty acid containing GlcCer provides the substrate for LacCer synthesis, which in turn, is converted to Gb3. Thus, P-gp overexpression results in a preferential accumulation of GSLs in this pathway, which contain shorter fatty acid isoforms. The translocation of short chain fatty acid containing GlcCer across the Golgi membrane may disturb the equilibrium of the GlcCer synthetic reaction and thus stimulate the synthesis of this GlcCer isoform. Alternatively, lumenal translocation may protect GlcCer from cytosolic degradation. Inhibition of P-gp with cyclosporin A (or ketoconazole; data not shown) results in reversal of the Gb3, LacCer, and GlcCer accumulation to levels typical of MDCK-wt cells. The untransfected MDCK-wt cells contained a more slowly migrating species corresponding to Forssman glycolipid, not present in MDR1-MDCK cells. The accumulation of Gb3, but not Gb4 or Forssman in MDR1-MDCK cells, together with our finding that treatment of MDR1-MDCK cells with P-gp inhibitors, while preventing the accumulation of globoseries glycolipids, did not induce Forssman, and that we were only able to detect Gb4 synthase in the “parental” MDCK-wt cells, initially suggested that MDR1 may have a more complex effect on GSL biosynthesis than simply providing GlcCer substrate as we propose. However, since two variants of MDCK cells (33.Richardson J. Scalera V. Simmons N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 673: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) with differing GSLs have been described (21.Hansson G.C. Simons K. van Meer G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the MDR1-MDCK cells might have, in fact, been derived from the other (Forssman negative) MDCK variant. Our initial results were consistent with this hypothesis: MDCK-I cells contain Gb3 but not Gb4 synthase, and express low levels of Gb3 but no Gb4 or Forssman. In terms of sensitivity to VT, MDCK-wt and MDCK-I cells are equally resistant (Fig. 2) and the effect of transfection with MDR1 is equally dramatic no matter which is the parental cell. However, MDCK-I cells contain high levels of lower band GlcCer, and thus the accumulation of short fatty acid chain LacCer and Gb3 in MDR1-MDCK cells may be a consequence of the parental phenotype in this case, rather than a property of P-gp as we propose above. The MDCK variant used in the original transfection was not investigated (11.Pastan I. Gottesman M. Ueda K. Lovelace E. Rutherford A. Willingham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4486-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), but the cell line that has been used as the parent (MDCK-wt) is, from our glycolipid analysis, MDCK-II (21.Hansson G.C. Simons K. van Meer G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). If this is indeed the parent, it is possible that the retroviral transfection was more efficient in a small subpopulation of MDCK-I cells (Gb3-positive and therefore perhaps more sensitive to transfection; Ref. 34.Puri A. Hug P. Jernigan K. Barchi J. Kim H.-Y. Hamilton J. Wiels J. Murray G.J. Brady R.O. Blumenthal R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14435-14440Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) present in the MDCK-wt cell line used. Alternatively, the drug resistance used to select transformants was MDCK-I cell selective, perhaps due, for example, to a functional relationship between Gb3 and MDR1, as is suggested by the cell surface colocalization of these species. The synthesis of high levels of GlcCer might also contribute to this resistance, as proposed by Cabot (35.Cabot M.C. Han T.-Y. Giuliano A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The relative resistance of MDCK-I, as opposed to MDCK-wt cells, to vinblastine (Fig. 4) would appear to preclude MDCK-I cells as being the parental cell, since vinblastine in this concentration range was used in screening in the original selection of MDR1-MDCK after transfection (11.Pastan I. Gottesman M. Ueda K. Lovelace E. Rutherford A. Willingham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4486-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and would not have eliminated untransfected parental cells if they were MDCK-I. This would support our contention that the “MDCK-I phenotype” was selected from the MDCK-wt (MDCK-II) during the original transfection/MDR1 selection. This would have significant implications since the drug-resistant phenotype of the MDR1-MDCK cells would comprise two components: first, MDR1 expression, and second, due to the selection of the “MDCK-I phenotype,” which might compromise the interpretation of data obtained from the comparison of these cell lines (36.Horio M. Chin K. Currier S. Goldenberg S. Williams C. Pastan I Gottesman M. Handler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14880-14884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Horio M. Pastan I. Gottesman M. Handler J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1027: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38.Zhang Y.,. Benet L. Pharm. Res. 1998; 15: 1520-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MDCK-I appears to be the first cell line that contains Gb3but is insensitive to VT; MDCK-I cells have been previously shown to be insensitive to VT (39.Sandvig K. Prydz K. Ryd M. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sensitivity was induced when the cells were pretreated with sodium butyrate (39.Sandvig K. Prydz K. Ryd M. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a procedure known to up-regulate MDR1 (40.Bates S.E. Currier S.J. Alvarez M. Fojo A.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6366-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 41.Morrow C.S. Nakagawa M. Goldsmith M.E. Madden J.J. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10739-10746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which correlated with the induction of intracellular trafficking of the toxin to the ER and nuclear membrane (42.Sandvig K. Ryd M. Garred O. Schweda E. Holm P.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), in manner similar to our observations in astrocytoma and ovarian carcinoma cell lines (4.Arab S. Lingwood C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 646-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). P-gp is located appropriately to carry out GlcCer translocation for GSL biosynthesis, since P-gp can function in both the Golgi (43.Molinari A. Cianfriglia M. Meschini S. Calcabrini A. Arancia G. Int J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 44.Molinari A. Calcabrini A. Meschini S. Stringaro A. Del Bufalo D. Cianfriglia M. Arancia G. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45.Willingham M. Richert N.D. Cornwell M.M. Tsuruo T. Hamada H. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and the nuclear envelope (46.Baldini N. Scotlandi K. Serra M. Shikita T. Zini N. Ognibene A. Santi S. Ferracini R. Maraldi N.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 226-239PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to the plasma membrane. P-gp in MDR1-MDCK cells is, for the most part, localized in the Golgi, consistent with the role we propose. A role for P-gp in the translocation of GlcCer to the Golgi lumen is further supported by our metabolic studies with NBD-ceramide. This fluorescent glycolipid precursor was converted to GlcCer, LacCer, and Gb3 in MDR1-MDCK cells. The fact that the level of NBD-Gb3 was not significantly higher than that of NBD-LacCer (cf. endogenous Gb3 and LacCer) supports our conclusion from the Gb3 synthase assay that MDR1 does not per se increase the activity of this α-galactosyltransferase. In the presence of CsA, anabolism only to glucosylceramide was seen, suggesting that further elongation of the carbohydrate by the Golgi-located transferases of the globoseries, requires the MDR1 pump action to translocate the NBD-GlcCer from its cytosolic site of synthesis to the Golgi lumen. Thus, the NBD-GlcCer is, and in this context, behaves as, an analogue of short chain fatty acid GlcCer. It is noteworthy in this context, that MRP, another drug efflux pump, was able to translocate NBD-GlcCer but, unlike MDR1, not a C6 fatty acid glucosylceramide species (23.Raggers R.J. van Helvoort A. Evers R. van Meer G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 415-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, VT1 bound to MDR1-MDCK cells, but not after CsA treatment. Our observation that the surface expression of P-gp was also lost was not expected. CsA is known to up-regulate the overall expression of P-gp (47.Jette L. Beaulieu E. Leclerc J.M. Beliveau R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F756-F765PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of partial colocalization of P-gp and Gb3 on MDR1-MDCK cells is under investigation. Our present studies provide a molecular explanation for the increased levels of short chain fatty acid containing Gb3 species in multidrug-resistant tumors (4.Arab S. Lingwood C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 646-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5.Arab S. Russel E. Chapman W. Rosen B. Lingwood C. Oncol. Res. 1997; 9: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Lingwood C.A. Khine A.A. Arab S. Acta Biochem. Polonic. 1998; 45: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fatty acid analysis of the Gb3 species elevated in MDR1-MDCK cells showed a restriction to C16 and C18 saturated fatty acids. These same fatty acid isoforms were elevated in MDR variants of ovarian carcinoma cell lines (4.Arab S. Lingwood C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 646-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which were 1000-fold hypersensitive to VT and targeted VT to the ER nucleus as opposed to the Golgi. In MDR1-MDCK cells, VT1B internalization was consistent with ER nucleus, consistent, in turn with the Gb3 fatty acid content of these cells. We suggest P-gp acts to supply increased substrate for the Golgi lumenal synthesis of GSLs. Thus, the pattern of GSL synthesis prior to P-gp expression, may determine the P-gp-dependent phenotype. In tumor cells lacking the globoseries pathway, another glycolipid series might be amplified. The fact that CsA did not have a general inhibitory effect on the GSLs of MDCK-wt or MDCK-I cells and that GM3 synthesis was not increased in MDR1-MDCK cells, indicate that P-gp is not the only mechanism for GlcCer translocation to the Golgi lumen. Different translocators may be required (to give different GlcCer (+LacCer) pools) for the other GSL pathways, which branch from LacCer. This complements Lannert's studies, which indicate GlcCer can translocate to the lumen of different regions of the Golgi for the synthesis of different glycolipid series (27.Lannert H. Gorgas K. Meiner I. Wieland F.T. Jeckel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2939-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). While the basis of the selective use of the increased LacCer for Gb3synthesis is unknown, this may be related to the selective retention of Gb3 in cells treated with fumonisin B (49.Meivar-Levy I. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4607-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ketoconazole has a protective effect for other Gb3-containing cell lines. The CD50 for VT1 is increased 6-fold for Vero cells, 5-fold for HeLa cells, and 11-fold for SF539 astrocytoma cells in the presence of this P-gp inhibitor (data not shown), suggesting that P-gp also plays a role in the Gb3 synthesis of these cells. It is of interest to note that the nephron is a primary site for the localization of P-gp in normal cells (50.Ernest S. Rajaraman S. Megyesi J. Bello-Reuss E.N. Nephron. 1997; 77: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Gb3 is a major glycolipid of the human kidney (51.Boyd B. Lingwood C.A. Nephron. 1989; 51: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) but is not expressed in the adult glomerulus (52.Lingwood C.A. Nephron. 1994; 66: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The kidney is also the major site of verotoxin-induced pathology in HUS (53.Lingwood C.A. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated the importance of lipids in the action of P-gp (54.Sharom F.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Whatever its basis, the up-regulation of short fatty acid chain containing Gb3 species in MDR1-MDCK cells exactly complements the increased efficacy of these species to mediate verotoxin-induced cytopathology in vitro (4.Arab S. Lingwood C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 646-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and in vivo (7.Arab S. Rutka J. Lingwood C. Oncol. Res. 1999; 11: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar), and thereby render multidrug-resistant tumor cells hypersensitive to VT. This effect imbues VT with cytotoxic characteristics ideal to complement current chemotherapy of Gb3-positive tumors. Our finding of up-regulation of these Gb3 isoforms in multiple drug-resistant cell lines (4.Arab S. Lingwood C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 646-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and in drug-resistant human tumors (5.Arab S. Russel E. Chapman W. Rosen B. Lingwood C. Oncol.

https://openalex.org/W1981139948,"Abstract Selenocysteine lyase (SCL) (EC 4.4.1.16) is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme that specifically catalyzes the decomposition of l-selenocysteine tol-alanine and elemental selenium. The enzyme was proposed to function as a selenium delivery protein to selenophosphate synthetase in selenoprotein biosynthesis (Lacourciere, G. M., and Stadtman, T. C. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 30921–30926). We purified SCL from pig liver and determined its partial amino acid sequences. Mouse cDNA clones encoding peptides resembling pig SCL were found in the expressed sequence tag data base, and their sequences were used as probes to isolate full-length mouse liver cDNA. The cDNA for mouse SCL (mSCL) was determined to be 2,172 base pairs in length, containing an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide chain of 432 amino acid residues (M r 47,201). We also determined the sequence of the N-terminal region of putative human SCL. These enzymes were shown to be distantly related in primary structure to NifS, which catalyzes the desulfurization of l-cysteine to provide sulfur for iron-sulfur clusters. The recombinant mSCL overproduced inEscherichia coli was a homodimer with the subunitM r of 47,000. The enzyme was pyridoxal phosphate-dependent and highly specific tol-selenocysteine (thek cat/K m value forl-selenocysteine was about 4,200 times higher than that forl-cysteine). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses revealed that mSCL is cytosolic and predominantly exists in the liver, kidney, and testis, where mouse selenophosphate synthetase is also abundant, supporting the view that mSCL functions in cooperation with selenophosphate synthetase in selenoprotein synthesis. This is the first report of the primary structure of mammalian SCL."

The v-P3k protein is oncogenic in vivo and in vitro; its cellular counterpart, c-P3k, lacks oncogenicity. Fusion of viral Gag sequences to the amino terminus of c-P3k activates the transforming potential. Activation can also be achieved by the addition of a myristylation signal to the amino terminus or of a farnesylation signal to the carboxyl terminus of c-P3k. A mutated myristylation signal was equally effective; it also caused a strong increase in the kinase activity of P3k. Mutations that inactivate lipid kinase activity abolish oncogenicity. The transforming activity of P3k is correlated with the ability to induce activating phosphorylation in Akt. Point mutations and amino-terminal deletions recorded in v-P3k were shown to be irrelevant to the activation of oncogenic potential. Interactions of P3k with the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, p85, or with Ras are not required for transformation.

A possible role of PI 3-kinases in oncogenic transformation was first suggested by the observation that PI 3-kinase activity was associated, via the regulatory subunit p85, with oncogene products such as polyoma middle T antigen (9.Whitman M.

The isolation of a retroviral oncogene, v-p3k, coding for a homologue of p110α established an active role of PI 3-kinase in oncogenic transformation (15.Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 276: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). v-p3k was cloned from the genome of avian sarcoma virus 16 (ASV16), an agent causing hemangiosarcomas in chickens (15.Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 276: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The v-P3k protein differs from its cellular counterpart, c-P3k, in two major points. 1) The first 13 amino acids of c-P3k are deleted in v-P3k and replaced by retroviral Gag sequences, and 2) v-P3k carries several amino acid substitutions; they are located outside the kinase domain. Expression of v-P3k induces oncogenic transformation in cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and hemangiosarcomas in young chickens, suggesting that a constitutively active PI 3-kinase is sufficient for the transformation of chicken cells (15.Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 276: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Recent findings further support the involvement of PI 3-kinase in development of cancer. These include amplification of PIK3CA, the human counterpart of c-p3k, in human ovarian cancer cell lines (16.Shayesteh L. Lu Y. Kuo W.L. Baldocchi R. Godfrey T. Collins C. Pinkel D. Powell B.

Downstream targets of PI 3-kinase, such as the Akt protein kinase (also called protein kinase B α or PKBα) and the related Akt2 (or PKBβ) are also amplified and overexpressed in some cancer cells (19.Cheng J.Q.

Up-regulation of Akt3 (or PKBγ) was found in breast cancers (22.Nakatani K. Thompson D.A. Barthel A. Sakaue H. Liu W. Weigel R.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21528-21532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor protein PTEN was recently shown to dephosphorylate the D3-lipid product of PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, thus interfering with potentially oncogenic signals emanating from PI 3-kinase (23.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 125-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 24.Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). The v-P3k protein is much more potent in inducing oncogenic transformation than the wild type cellular c-P3k. Here we report that this difference in activity is caused by the fusion of v-P3k to viral Gag sequences. We show that membrane localization guided by a myristylation or a farnesylation signal can substitute for Gag in activating the transforming potential. We also describe the isolation of a variant v-p3k gene from a new avian sarcoma virus, ASV8905. An analysis of this variant and of deletion mutants of p110α suggests that oncogenic transformation does not require binding of p110α to the regulatory subunit p85, but is dependent on amino-terminal domains and on lipid kinase activity. CEF cultures were prepared from White Leghorn embryos obtained from SPAFAS (Preston, CT). For focus assays, DNA was transfected into CEF by using the dimethyl sulfoxide/Polybrene method (25.Kawai S. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1172-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Focus assays with virus stocks were performed as described previously (26.Bos T.J. Monteclaro F.S. Mitsunobu F. Ball Jr., A.R. Chang C.H. Nishimura T. Vogt P.K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Foci were counted on day 20 after infection or transfection. After counting foci of transformed cells, the assay plates were stained with crystal violet and photographed. Transfection experiments were performed at least three times. The results shown are from a representative experiment. For serum starvation, subconfluent cultures were maintained in Ham's F-10 medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% chicken serum. After 40 h, the cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB homodimer (Life Technologies, Inc.). A cDNA library of ASV8905-transformed CEF was constructed using λgt10 vector (Stratagene). The library (250,000 independent clones) was screened by plaque hybridization with 32P-labeled LTR, gag, and pol probes derived from an avian retroviral genome. DNA of the λ clone 55-2-1 that was an LTR+,gag +, and pol − clone, was prepared, and the 4.7-kilobase NotI insert was subcloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and sequenced. The full-length v-p3k 8905 gene was reconstructed by fusing the amino-terminal part of the gag gene of v-p3k 16 (from ASV16) with clone 55-2-1 using aNarI restriction site in the gag sequences. The FLAG epitope tag was added to the amino terminus (c-p3k-N and c-p3k-CAAX) or the carboxyl terminus (all the other constructs) of c-p3k by PCR using a 5′-FLAG primer plus a 3′-Hind primer or a 3′-FLAG primer plus a C-4 primer. KOZ-c-p3k with Kozak's consensus sequences for translation initiation, Myr-c-p3k with the amino-terminal sequences (14 amino acids) of c-Src, G2A-Myr-c-p3k with the same sequences containing glycine to alanine mutation were generated by PCR using primers 5′-KOZ, 5′-Myr, and 5′-G2A, respectively. To generate c-P3k-CAAX, the farnesylation signal of H-Ras was added to the caryboxyl terminus of c-P3k-N via PCR using primers 3′-CAAX and B-5. Δ72-c-p3k with a deletion of the first 72 amino acids, Myr-Δ72-c-p3k, and G2A-Δ72-c-p3k were generated using a Seamless (Se) cloning kit with primers SeKOZ1/SeKOZ2 on the KOZ-c-p3k template or with primers SeMyr1/SeMyr2 on Myr-c-p3k and G2A-Myr-c-p3k templates (Stratagene).gag-c-p3k was generated by ligating the partially digested SacI/EcoNI fragment of pBluescript-v-p3k (15.Chang H.W.

Myr-Δ72-c-p3k/K802R and Myr-Δ72-c-p3k/K227E were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with primers K802R1/K802R2 or K227E1/K227E2 (Stratagene).

The carboxyl-terminal deletion of Myr-Δ72-c-p3k(Myr-Δ72-c-p3k-5) was generated by PCR using ΔtailFLAG primer and C-1 primer. Internal deletion mutants of Myr-Δ72-c-p3k were generated in the following way: Myr-Δ72-c-p3k-1 by ligating theNotI/BamHI fragment of Myr-Δ72-c-p3kto Myr-Δ72-c-p3k digested withNotI/BglII; Myr-Δ72-c-p3k-2 by digestion of Myr-Δ72-c-p3k withBglII/KpnI followed by T4 polymerase treatment and self-ligation; Myr-Δ72-c-p3k-3 by digestion of Myr-Δ72-c-p3k with NdeI/BsmI followed by T4 polymerase treatment and self-ligation; Myr-Δ72-c-p3k-4 by digestion of Myr-Δ72-c-p3kwith AatII/BstBI followed by ligation with adapter oligonucleotides ΔKIN1/ΔKIN2.

Cells were labeled for 2 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). The labeled cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 100 KIU/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A. Anti-FLAG antibody (M2, KODAK) was added to the labeled cell lysates. The immune complexes adsorbed to protein G-Sepharose were washed extensively with lysis buffer and then analyzed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by fluorography. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer. For Western blots, lysates consisting of 60 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were then probed with the indicated antibodies. Polyclonal anti-FLAG was obtained fromZymed Laboratories Inc.; polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), polyclonal anti-Akt, monoclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (E10) and polyclonal anti-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs; polyclonal anti-p85 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), bound proteins were detected by incubation with a chemiluminescent substrate (Renaissance plus, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For immunoprecipitation/Western blotting, lysates consisting of 400 μg of proteins were incubated with 2 μl of polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and immunoprecipitates were collected with protein G-Sepharose. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and then extracted by boiling with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The extracts were dissolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to the membrane, and probed with polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody as described above. For in vitro lipid kinase assays, the immune complexes prepared as described above were incubated with 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol (sonicated), 60 μm ATP, 200 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 80 μl of 1 n HCl. The phosphorylated lipids were extracted with 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and the organic phase was dried down. Samples were dissolved in chloroform, spotted onto Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Merck), and developed in a borate buffer system (27.Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The plates were exposed to Kodak X-Omat films for autoradiography. Subcellular fractionation of CEF was performed as described (28.Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In short, CEF were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in low salt buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm EGTA, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 100 KIU/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). The suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min, and then homogenized with 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 × g, and then the supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 120,000 × g. The supernatant was mixed with 10× lysis buffer (10% Triton X-100, 1.5 m NaCl, 200 mm Tris pH 7.5) and used as S100 fraction. The pellet was lysed in lysis buffer and used as P100 fraction. Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. After a wash with PBS, cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, the coverslips were washed with PBS, and then incubated with rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at a dilution of 1:500 for 30 min at room temperature in a humidifying chamber. After three washes with PBS, the coverslips were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 30 min. The coverslips were washed with PBS, and then mounted on glass slides with Slowfade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). v-P3k expressed by the retroviral vector RCAS induced at least 10 times more transformed cell foci per microgram of transfected DNA than did c-P3k expressed by the same vector in CEF cultures. c-P3k foci also took 3–4 weeks to develop as compared with v-P3k-induced foci which came up after 1 week. However, progeny virus released by the c-P3k-transformed CEF was as effective in inducing oncogenic transformation as v-P3k. Hence, c-P3k must have undergone a genetic change during its passage as an insert in the replication-competent retroviral vector. In order to define this genetic change of c-P3k, we isolated and cultured single foci of CEF transformed by RCAS-c-P3k. The c-P3k in this vector was marked at the carboxyl terminus with a FLAG epitope, so it could be distinguished immunologically from the endogenous c-P3k protein. Six cultures, each derived from a different c-P3k-induced focus and therefore representing six independent, discrete genetic events, were characterized by immune precipitation (Fig. 1). All expressed different sized c-P3k proteins, and in each the c-P3k protein was substantially larger than 110 kDa, the expected size for c-P3k. Immunoprecipitation of the same cell lysates with antibody directed against the p19 Gag protein of the RCAS retroviral vector brought down the same proteins and showed that the c-P3k in all six clones was fused to Gag sequences that vary in length from clone to clone. Such fusions would have taken place during replication of the RCAS-c-P3k retrovirus and suggest that an amino-terminal Gag tail can activate the oncogenic potential of c-P3k. The role of Gag in oncogenic transformation by c-P3k was further defined by replacing the p110α-derived coding region in v-P3k by that of c-P3k thus producing a Gag-c-P3k fusion. This construct was as strongly transforming as v-P3k. Addition of Gag to c-P3k sequences is, therefore, sufficient to elicit full oncogenic activity, and the point mutations seen in v-P3k are not essential for transformation (TableI).Table IFocus formation in CEF inoculated with infectious RCAS retrovirusesInfecting constructFocus forming units/mlVector (RCAS)0c-p3k from nontransformed culture1.2 × 104c-p3k from transformed focus clone 11.1 × 106c-p3k from transformed focus clone 21.4 × 106c-p3k from transformed focus clone 32.4 × 106c-p3k from transformed focus clone 41.6 × 106c-p3k from transformed focus clone 51.5 × 106c-p3kfrom transformed focus clone 61.4 × 106v-p3k 16 aDerived from avian sarcoma virus ASV16.1.0 × 106gag-c-p3k2.5 × 106v-p3k 8905 bDerived from avian sarcoma virus ASV8905.3.5 × 106Myr-c-p3k cMyr, myristylation signal of the Src protein.1.6 × 106G2A-Myr-c-p3k dG2A, mutated myristic acid acceptor.1.4 × 106a Derived from avian sarcoma virus ASV16.b Derived from avian sarcoma virus ASV8905.c Myr, myristylation signal of the Src protein.d G2A, mutated myristic acid acceptor. Open table in a new tab c-P3k-transfected CEF that were not selected for the transformed phenotype expressed much lower levels of the c-P3k protein than did cultures derived from transformed cell foci (Fig. 1). This inefficient expression could be the cause for the low degree of transforming activity seen with c-P3k. The cDNA used to express c-P3k in these experiments contained in its 5′ region a poor match of the Kozak consensus sequence for the initiation of translation plus a long 5′-untranslated region. In a modified construct (KOZ-c-P3k), the initiation sequence was changed to CCACCATGCCC with good homology to the consensus except C at position +4 instead of G, and the 5′-untranslated region was deleted. In addition, a construct termed c-P3k-N was made in which c-P3k was amino terminally tagged with a FLAG epitope with a good initiator sequence (Fig.2). Western blots of CEF transfected with these constructs showed levels of P3k expression comparable to those seen in v-P3k-transfected cells (Fig. 3). Yet the efficiency of transformation for these modified c-P3k constructs remained low (Fig. 4 and TableII). The possibility that the FLAG epitope at the amino terminus of P3k could itself interfere with transforming activity was ruled out because addition of a farnesylation signal to the carboxyl terminus of FLAG-tagged c-P3k resulted in efficient transformation (c-P3k-CAAX, Fig. 2 and Table II, see also below). These results suggest that high levels of expressed c-P3k are not sufficient for oncogenic transformation.Figure 3Expression of the P3k proteins.

Virol. 1996; 70: 2664-2668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and membrane localization by myristylation or farnesylation has previously been shown to make PI 3-kinase constitutively active (28.Klippel A.

In order to test for a possible role of membrane localization in c-P3k-induced oncogenic transformation, constructs were produced with either a membrane binding sequence of c-Src that contains a myristylation signal and basic residues at the amino terminus or a farnesylation signal at the carboxyl terminus of c-P3k (Myr-c-P3k and c-P3k-CAAX, Fig. 2). Both constructs were expressed as inserts of the RCAS vector, and both were highly transforming in CEF cultures (Tables I and II). (Differences in focus forming titers between Tables I and II are due to the fact that one represents infection with RCAS viruses, the other transfection with DNA constructs.) In the myristylation signal, MGSSKSKP, the Gly residue functions as the acceptor for myristic acid, and a mutation of this residue to Ala has been shown to prevent myristylation (32.Wyss A. Kaech S. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5163-5166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, such a G to A mutation in the myristylation signal of c-P3k did not reduce transforming activity (G2A-Myr-c-P3k, Fig. 2; see also Table I and Fig. 4). However, in vitrolipid kinase assays of these constructs showed that both Myr-c-P3k and G2A-Myr-c-P3k have much stronger PI 3-kinase activity than c-P3k or even v-P3k of ASV16 (Fig. 5). Immunoprecipitation and Western blots had shown these proteins to be expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3) except c-P3k-CAAX. These results demonstrate that c-P3k proteins with a Src amino terminus contain higher specific kinase activity even if the myristic acid acceptor is mutated. The reason for the low expression of c-P3k-CAAX is unclear (Fig. 3). Higher levels may be toxic to the cells. However, the high specific lipid kinase activity may compensate for the low expression level of c-P3k-CAAX (Fig. 5). Immunofluorescence revealed distinct staining patterns in cells stably transfected with c-P3k and v-P3k constructs (Fig.6 A). KOZ-c-P3k and c-P3k-N showed multivesicular cytoplasmic staining. The Gag-linked v-P3k transfected cells were characterized by vesicular, possibly endosomal staining at the periphery of the cell. Myr-c-P3k or c-P3k-CAAX induced a cytoplasmic staining pattern that was localized in elongated vesicles. In subcellular fractionation, c-P3k was found exclusively in the cytosol (Fig. 6 B). Small but significant fractions of v-P3k, Myr-c-P3k, and G2A-Myr-c-P3k were membrane-"

The His-28 substitution appears to stabilize the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of FNR-L28H in the presence of O2 because air-exposed FNR-L28H did not undergo the rapid [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster conversion or concomitant loss in site-specific DNA binding and dimerization, which are characteristic of WT-FNR under these conditions. This increased cluster stability was not a result of His-28 replacing the WT-FNR cluster ligands because substitution of any of these four Cys residues (cysteine 20, 23, 29, or 122) with Ser resulted in [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster-deficient preparations of FNR-L28H. The Mössbauer spectra of FNR-L28H indicated that the coordination environment of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster did not differ from that of WT-FNR. Whole cell Mössbauer spectroscopy showed that aerobically grown cells overexpressing FNR-L28H had levels of the FNR species containing the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster similar to those of cells grown under anaerobic conditions. Thus, the increase in cluster stability is sufficient to allow accumulation of the [4Fe-4S]2+cluster form of FNR-L28H under aerobic conditions and provides a reasonable explanation for why this mutant protein is functional under aerobic growth conditions. From these results, we present a model to explain how WT-FNR is normally inactivated under aerobic growth conditions.

One emerging feature of such systems is that cofactors with well known roles in either O2 binding (heme and flavins) or in electron transfer (heme, flavins, and Fe-S clusters) also have a regulatory function in O2 sensing (1.Dixon R. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2.Gong W.M. Hao B. Mansy S.S. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Chan M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To understand further the mechanism of Fe-S cluster-based O2 sensing, we have been studying theEscherichia coli global anaerobic regulator, FNR1 (forfumarate and nitrate reduction (5.Lambden P.R. Guest J.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 97: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)), which contains a regulatory [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. Under O2 limiting conditions, FNR plays a key role in the transition of E. coli from an aerobic to anaerobic lifestyle by activating transcription of genes whose products function largely in anaerobic respiratory pathways and by repressing expression of genes that are involved in aerobic energy generation (for review, see Refs.6.Gunsalus R.P. Park S.J. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7.Spiro S. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 8.Lynch, A.

Our studies have focused on the role of the [4Fe-4S]2+cluster in regulating the activity of FNR in response to changes in O2 availability (for review, see Ref. 10.Kiley P.J. Beinert H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 22: 341-352Crossref Google Scholar). The [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster is essential for the function of FNR as a transcription factor because through its specific ligation, the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster increases dimerization and DNA binding (11.Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 12.Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E. Thomson A. Guest J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster is O2-labile and, upon exposure of anaerobically purified wild-type (WT) FNR to air, the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster is converted rapidly to a more O2-stable [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Although the [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster is the first stable intermediate detected on a minute time scale, the exact pathway for conversion from the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster to the [2Fe-2S]2+cluster in the presence of O2 remains to be elucidated (10.Kiley P.J. Beinert H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 22: 341-352Crossref Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the decrease in site-specific DNA binding and in the extent of dimerization that occurs concomitant with cluster conversion provides a reasonable explanation for why FNR is only active as a transcription factor under anaerobic conditions in vitro (11.Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster conversion in FNR has also been observed in vivo following exposure of anaerobically maintained cells to air (15.Popescu C. Bates D. Münck E. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13431-13435Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, inactivation of FNR by O2 appears to be mediated by an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster both in vitro and in vivo. Although these investigations have provided clear insights into how FNR from anaerobic cells is inactivated by O2, much less is known about how FNR is maintained in an inactive state under aerobic growth conditions. Although WT-FNR purified from aerobically grown cells has previously been shown to lack any Fe-S cluster (apo-FNR (16.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,17.Green J. Trageser M. Six S. Unden G. Guest J.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B-Biol. Sci. 1991; 244: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)), it is not known if this apo-FNR arises from the continuous destruction of [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster-FNR (4Fe-FNR) or from the lack of FNR [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster assembly under these growth conditions. Techniques to distinguish between these two possibilities for WT-FNR are not currently available. Therefore, as an alternative approach to address this question, we have studied a FNR mutant protein that can activate transcription under aerobic growth conditions in contrast to WT-FNR. In this study, we report the characterization of this FNR mutant protein, which contains an amino acid substitution of Leu-28 with His (FNR-L28H, (18.Kiley P.J. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 16-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Leu-28 is adjacent to Cys-29, one of the four Cys residues generally accepted to be the ligands of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster (19.Sharrocks A. Green J. Guest J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20.Melville S.B. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18733-18736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although this assignment awaits structural confirmation. Previous studies have shown that FNR-L28H is active in vivo in the presence of air only when all of these four cysteine residues are present (21.Bates D.M. Lazazzera B.A. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3972-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the L28H substitution might increase the stability of the Fe-S cluster to O2. To test this hypothesis, we purified the FNR-L28H protein under anaerobic conditions and found that the L28H substitution stabilizes the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in the presence of O2. This property of FNR-L28H also allowed us to show that assembly of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of FNR-L28H occurs under aerobic growth conditions, suggesting that formation of the O2 sensitive [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in WT-FNR can also occur under aerobic growth conditions. Cysteine to serine substitutions at amino acid positions 20, 23, and 29 were created by site-directed mutagenesis (22.Kunkel T.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

Single-stranded, uracil-containing DNA of pPK1867 (fnr-L28H; Ref. 15.Popescu C. Bates D. Münck E. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized which change base 57, 66, and 84 (base 1 is the A of the initiation codon of fnr-L28H) from T to A, creating C20S, C23S, and C29S, respectively. A NdeI-BamHI fragment from each of the resulting plasmids was then cloned into the same sites of the expression vector pET-11a (23.Dubendorff J.W. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) to generate pPK2024 (fnr-L28H-C20S), pPK2013 (fnr-L28H-C23S), and pPK2022 (fnr-L28H-C29S). NdeI-BamHI fragments of pPK1608 (fnr-C122S; Ref. 16.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J.

An expression vector harboring the allele fnr-L28H-C122S (pPK2020) was constructed by cloning the 3.0-kilobase AvaI fragment of pPK2011 (fnr-C122S) into the same site of pPK1868 (fnr-L28H). FNR proteins were purified from E. coli B strain PK22 (BL21 Δcrp-bs990 Δfnr; Ref. 16.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J.

Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C in 4 liters of glucose-M9 minimal medium (24.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-435Google Scholar) that also contained 20 μm ferric ammonium citrate. When the culture reached an A 600 of 0.3–0.5, FNR synthesis was induced by the addition of isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside (final concentration of 400 μm) for 1 h, and then the culture was sparged with argon at 4 °C for 14 h to deplete O2 from the growth medium and promote Fe-S cluster assembly (13.Khoroshilova N.

To minimize exposure of 4Fe-FNR to O2, all subsequent manipulations were carried out either under a stream of copper-scrubbed argon gas or in an anaerobic chamber (Coy) which had an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% H2, and 90% N2. Harvesting of the cells and preparation of anaerobic cell extracts were carried out as described previously (11.Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) except that the resuspension buffer also contained 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the extract was centrifuged in a Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor for 1 h at 45,000 rpm. The supernatant was then passed through a filter (0.2-μm pore size, Nalgene) and loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a PolyCAT A HPLC column (9.4 × 200 mm, PolyLC) that was connected to a Beckman Nouveau Gold system and maintained at 5 °C. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of anaerobic buffer A (50 mmKPO4, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.7 mmdithionite, and 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, followed by anaerobic buffer A alone (∼3 column volumes). FNR was eluted from the column in a linear gradient of 0.1–1.0 mKCl in anaerobic buffer A at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Fractions containing 4Fe-FNR were identified by the characteristic absorption spectrum using an on-line multichannel scanning array detector (190–600 nm); the peak of 4Fe-FNR typically was eluted at ∼300 mm KCl, and the appropriate fractions were pooled. HPLC-purified FNR was estimated to be >95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For Mössbauer studies on purified FNR-L28H, 57Fe-enriched FNR-L28H was obtained in the same way except PK22 cells containing pPK1868 were grown aerobically in 57Fe-enriched glucose minimal medium (13.Khoroshilova N.

For purification of FNR-L28H from aerobic cells, PK22 cells containing pPK1868 were grown in glucose minimal medium as described above except that the cells were harvested immediately after the 1-h period of FNR synthesis. The cell pellet was resuspended in anaerobic buffer A, containing phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and dithiothreitol but lacking dithionite, and the subsequent purification steps were carried out under anaerobic conditions as described above to prevent any potential loss of the [4Fe-4S]2+cluster from FNR-L28H during purification.

The whole cell samples were prepared for Mössbauer analysis as described previously (15.Popescu C. Bates D. Münck E. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cells were harvested at 4 °C directly after the 1-h period of FNR synthesis, the buffer for washing the cells was prechilled on ice, and for the aerobically grown cultures, all sample handling was done in air. In contrast to our previous experiments where cells were sparged with argon for 14 h at 4 °C to increase the yield of 4Fe-FNR (15.Popescu C. Bates D. Münck E. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13431-13435Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the induction conditions used here were designed to assay the amount of Fe-S cluster assembly under better defined growth conditions. A 1-ml sample of anaerobically purified FNR-L28H protein (242 μm) was placed in a 1.7-ml glass conical tube and stirred slowly in air at 18 °C as described previously (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C.

UV-visible spectra were recorded on protein samples at 25 °C by employing a Lambda 2 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer). Samples were kept anaerobic by placing them in a cuvette sealed with a Teflon cap. To expose FNR to air, the Teflon cap on the anaerobic cuvette was removed temporarily, and the sample (33 μm) was mixed with air by gently inverting the cuvette two or three times at periodic intervals. Iron (25.Kennedy M.C. Kent T.A. Emptage M. Merkle H. Beinert H. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14463-14471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sulfide (26.Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) were analyzed in duplicate. Protein concentrations (reported here for monomers) were determined by a biuret procedure as described previously (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To determine extinction coefficients at 406 nm (ε406) and 278 nm (ε278), anaerobically purified FNR-L28H, containing 3.74 mol of S2− and 4.42 mol of Fe/mol of FNR, was hydrolyzed by acid, and the concentration of amino acids was measured by HPLC (Protein Facility, Medical College of Wisconsin). The UV-visible spectrum of anaerobically purified FNR-L28H was recorded, and the calculated values for ε406 and ε278 were 17.3 ± 1 mm−1 cm−1 and 39 ± 2 mm−1 cm−1, respectively. Site-specific DNA binding by FNR-L28H to a 48-base pair fragment containing the consensus FNR DNA binding sequence (27.Ziegelhoffer E.C. Kiley P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was measured using a gel retardation assay as described previously (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The fraction of the total amount of radioactively labeled DNA (57 pm) bound over a range of protein concentrations was quantified by use of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of protein required to bind 50% of the maximally bound target DNA was calculated as described (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To determine the apparent molecular weight of FNR-L28H, 200 μl of either anaerobic or air-exposed FNR-L28H (20 μm) was passed over a Superose 12 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (10 × 30 mm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Air-exposed FNR-L28H was obtained by slowly stirring ∼400 μl of protein (150 μm FNR-L28H) in a 1.7-ml conical glass in air at 18 °C for 1 h and then diluted prior to gel filtration analysis. The column was maintained within the anaerobic chamber and was equilibrated with anaerobic buffer (50 mm KPO4, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.4m KCl), and the absorbance of the column effluent was monitored between 190 and 600 nm. Bovine serum albumin, carbonic anhydrase, and cytochrome c protein standards (Sigma) were used to calibrate the column. The observation that FNR-L28H, unlike WT FNR, is able to activate transcription under aerobic growth conditions (18.Kiley P.J. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 16-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Bates D.M. Lazazzera B.A. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3972-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in FNR-L28H might be less sensitive to O2 than WT-FNR. To test this possibility directly, we examined the stability of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of purified FNR-L28H by comparing the UV-visible spectrum before and after exposure to air. Like WT-FNR (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), the UV-visible spectrum of anaerobically purified FNR-L28H had an absorption maximum centered at 278 nm, a shoulder at 315 nm, and a broad absorbance centered at 409 nm, characteristic of a protein containing a [4Fe-4S]2+cluster (Fig. 1). Upon exposure of the anaerobically purified FNR-L28H protein to air, no changes in the absorption spectrum were observed until 60 min, when a slight (∼5%) decrease in the absorbance at 409 nm was observed (Fig. 1). This minor effect on the absorption spectrum is in sharp contrast to what was observed previously for WT-FNR where a much larger decrease in the absorbance at 409 nm (∼50%) was observed after only 10 min of air exposure (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), suggesting that the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of FNR-L28H is more stable to air than WT-FNR. Exposure of FNR-L28H to air for 60 min did not yield a red color, nor did it have any of the visible absorption features at 420 and 550 nm (Fig. 1) characteristic of the [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster form of FNR (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, to address whether the slight decrease in absorbance at 409 nm arose from some small amount of [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster conversion, Mössbauer spectroscopy was carried out because it is a more sensitive assay for this process. In contrast to the rapid formation of the [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster (∼50% within 2 min) (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) which occurs with WT-FNR, no cluster conversion was detectable with FNR-L28H following 30 min of air exposure, whereas by 60 min approximately 4% of the total 57Fe was estimated to be in the [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster form (data not shown) Consistent with spectroscopic data, there was no rapid loss of the inorganic sulfide from FNR-L28H which is characteristic of the [4Fe-4S]2+to [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster conversion of WT-FNR (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). Because some protein precipitation of FNR-L28H was routinely noted at time periods past 60 min, we cannot interpret data from longer time points. Taken together, these data indicate that the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of FNR-L28H is much more O2-stable than that of WT-FNR. Comparison of the Fe:S2-:protein ratios from many independent preparations of WT-FNR and FNR-L28H also revealed a higher average Fe-S cluster occupancy for the FNR-L28H protein preparations. Anaerobically purified FNR-L28H contained an average of 3.59 ± 0.49 mol of Fe (n = 32) and 3.03 ± 0.49 mol of S2− (n = 33)/mol of FNR monomer, indicating that, on average, 76% of the protein was occupied with a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster on the basis of the S2−concentration. Anaerobically purified WT-FNR contained an average of 3.12 ± 0.52 mol of Fe (n = 10) and 2.69 ± 0.49 mol of S2− (n = 13)/mol of FNR, indicating that on average, 67% of the protein is occupied with a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, on the basis of the S2−concentration. The higher average occupancy of FNR-L28H suggests that there may be a relationship between cluster stability and occupancy in these purified preparations. To analyze the effects of increasing the stability of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster on FNR function, the amount of site-specific DNA binding by FNR-L28H was assayed in vitro, using a gel retardation assay, before and after air exposure. In the absence of O2, FNR-L28H formed a DNA-protein complex of the same apparent electrophoretic mobility, as did WT-FNR (11.Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The concentration of FNR-L28H required to bind 50% of the DNA was 4–8 nm, similar to that observed for WT-FNR (Fig.3) (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, exposure of FNR-L28H to air did not result in a rapid decrease in site-specific DNA binding as seen with WT-FNR (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Even after 60 min of air exposure, only a small (2-fold) reduction in the apparent affinity for the DNA target site was observed compared with a >100-fold decrease observed with WT-FNR after 8 min (Fig. 3) (13.Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased stability of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster to O2 allows FNR-L28H to retain site-specific DNA binding activity in the presence of air. Because O2-induced dimer dissociation of WT-FNR appears to be mediated by the disruption of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster (11.Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), the increase in cluster stability of FNR-L28H predicts that its size should be largely unaffected by air. Molecular sieve chromatography of anaerobically purified FNR-L28H showed that the fraction of FNR which contained a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster (monitored at 410 nm) was eluted from the gel filtration column with a retention time of 26.9 ± 0.2 min, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 66,000 (Fig.4, dashed line). This is approximately the size expected for an FNR dimer (60,000 Da). After a 1-h exposure of FNR-L28H to air, the relative mobility of the protein did not change significantly (retention time equal to 26.8 ± 0.2 min), indicating very little dissociation to monomers (Fig. 4,solid line). In contrast, the majority of WT-FNR was eluted as a monomer after just 1 min of O2 exposure (11.Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, these data demonstrate that stabilization of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, as in FNR-L28H, results in a significant decrease in the O2-induced dimer dissociation, confirming that the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster is a key element in the dimerization of FNR. Because [4Fe-4S] clusters of some proteins, such as the iron-only hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (28.Peters J.W. Lanzilotta W.N. Lemon B.J. Seefeldt L.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are ligated by a His residue, we considered the possibility that His-28 in FNR-L28H may alter the stability of the [4Fe-4S]2+cluster by providing an alternate ligand for the iron in the cluster. However, two lines of evidence suggest that the [4Fe-4S] cluster of FNR-LH28 has the same four ligands as WT-FNR, indicating that ligand replacement is not likely. First, Fig. 5 B shows the 4.2 K Mössbauer spectra of the WT-FNR protein (hatch marks) and L28H variant (solid line). It can be seen that the spectra are essentially identical, suggesting that the clusters in both proteins have the same coordination, most probably"

By using whole virus, purified HA, or HA ectodomains, we found that shortly after insertion, pores of less than 26 Å in diameter were formed in liposomal membranes. As measured by a novel assay, these pores stay open, or continue to close and open, for minutes to hours and persist after pH neutralization. With virus and purified HA, larger pores, allowing the leakage of dextrans, were seen at times well after insertion. For virus, dextran leakage was simultaneous with lipid mixing and the formation of “fusion pores,” allowing the transfer of dextrans from the liposomal to the viral interior or vice versa. Pores did not form in the viral membrane in the absence of a target membrane. Based on these data, we propose a new model for fusion, in which HA initially forms a proteinaceous pore in the target, but not in the viral membrane, before a lipidic hemifusion intermediate is formed.

Fusion is mediated by the trimeric integral membrane protein hemagglutinin (HA)1 (for reviews see Refs.1.Hernandez L.D. Hoffman L.R. Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Biol. 1995; 5: 265-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and is triggered by the low endosomal pH, which induces a conformational change in the protein. Each monomer of HA consists of two disulfide-linked subunits, the smaller one, HA2, is membrane-anchored at the C terminus. The N terminus of this subunit consists of a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids known as the “fusion peptide,” which is buried in the stem of the HA trimer at neutral pH (3.Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). The conformational change at low pH moves this peptide to the outside of the protein (4.Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar), and studies of liposome-virus fusion have shown that the peptide then enters the hydrophobic interior of the target membrane for fusion (5.Stegmann T. Delfino J.M. Richards F.M. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Tsurudome M. Glück R. Graf R. Falchetto R. Schaller U. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20225-20232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion could perturb the target membrane locally, providing a starting point for fusion. We and others have found that virus (7.Shangguan T. Alford D. Bentz J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4956-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or a single purified trimer of the ectodomain of HA (8.Jiricek R. Schwarz G. Stegmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), prepared by bromelain digestion of HA (BHA), produce a pore in target membranes at low pH, allowing the leakage of water-soluble molecules across these membranes. Whereas the conformational change and insertion of the fusion peptide are clearly required for fusion (9.Günther-Ausborn S. Praetor A. Stegmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,10.Stegmann T. Helenius A. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 89-111Google Scholar), little is known of the mechanism whereby the protein achieves the merger of the lipid bilayers. The formation of either lipidic or proteinaceous intermediate structures has been proposed to precede membrane merger. Lipidic intermediates could be “stalks” of fused outer membrane leaflets, formed after a focal perturbation of the target membrane bilayer by the inserted viral fusion peptides (11.Siegel D.P. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 475-512Google Scholar, 12.Siegel D.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2124-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This “hemifusion” intermediate would then expand laterally, be followed by breakthrough and merger of the inner leaflets at this point, leading to complete fusion. Although several observations are compatible with this theory (13.Chernomordik L.V. Vogel S.S. Sokoloff A. Onaran H.O. Leikina E.A. Zimmerberg J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14.Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2383-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it follows that lipids would line the first aqueous connection between the viral and the target membrane interior, the so-called “fusion pore.” However, electrophysiological measurements have shown that fusion pores form before lipid mixing can be detected (16.Tse F.W. Iwata A. Almers W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, alternatively, it was proposed that the fusion pores may be proteinaceous (17.Lindau M. Almers W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and would expand gradually, incorporating lipids as they open. More recent data suggest, however, that a lipidic connection between the membranes may form before fusion pore formation after all but that extensive lipid mixing would be hindered by the presence of HA in the membrane, thus supporting the first theory while explaining the data that gave rise to the second theory (18.Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Frolov V. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar).Here we show that BHA induces the formation of small pores that stay open, or open and close, for a long time but do not allow the passage of dextrans (mass 3 kDa). Viral HA or purified intact HAs initially create small pores also, but much larger pores are formed later. Large pores also formed in reconstituted viral membranes during fusion with liposomes but not in the absence of target membranes. By taking into account the available evidence for lipidic intermediates containing a hemifusion diaphragm in the literature, we propose that although lipidic hemifusion intermediates are involved in influenza virus-induced fusion, the perturbation of the target membrane at the site of fusion initially leads to formation of a large pore in the target membrane, and we discuss the role of this pore in initiating fusion.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we show that a variety of HA preparations (BHA, HA rosettes, and virus) all induce pores of less than 26 Å in diameter in liposomal membranes at low pH. These pores are long lasting and begin to open shortly after the low pH-induced conformational change in HA. HA rosettes and virus also induced the formation of much larger pores (which we call leakage pores here to distinguish them clearly from all other pores), allowing the leakage of fluorescent dextrans across the liposomal membrane, at times well after the conformational change. For virus and reconstituted viral membranes, the opening of these large leakage pores was simultaneous with the onset of membrane fusion as measured by lipid mixing (Figs. 2 B and 5), and with the formation of fusion pores aqueous connections allowing the passage of dextrans from the liposomal to the viral interior (Fig. 2 B) and vice versa (Fig. 5). Since influenza-induced membrane fusion is characterized by a very typical sigmoidal time course, the onset of fusion being preceded by a lag phase of several minutes at 0 °C, and since molecules of the same size pass through fusion and leakage pores at the same time, these observations suggest that fusion pores and leakage pores are related structures.Formation of the target membrane half of the structure was independent of the presence of a viral membrane, but leakage pores were not formed in viral membranes at low pH in the absence of target membranes. As neutralization of virus-liposome complexes during the lag phase before the onset of fusion arrested lipid mixing (35.Stegmann T. White J.M. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4231-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), but not leakage pore formation (Fig. 6), it is clear that formation of leakage pores alone does not suffice to induce fusion. Therefore, these data suggest that fusion pores may start out as leakage pores in the target membrane, with the viral membrane still separating the viral and liposomal interior (Fig. 7).Formation of Small and Large Leakage PoresThe small pores that are formed shortly after the conformational change are clearly the result of insertion of the fusion peptide into the target membrane, perturbing the bilayer; with virus >50% of the calcein leaks out before fusion even starts (Fig. 2 B). The structure of this pore is not clear. Given that they have a defined size and prolonged lifetimes, it is difficult to imagine that the pores are lipid defects, given the flexibility and fast diffusion of lipids. Also, as we have argued before, these are not classical “barrel stave” pores (8.Jiricek R. Schwarz G. Stegmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other types of peptide-induced pores have a lifetime of milliseconds (37.Rex S. Schwarz G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2336-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), or open and close continuously for a long time (38.Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fuji N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12553-12559Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although our measurements do not allow us to distinguish between pores that stay open or those that close and open for a long time, and flickering fusion pores induced by influenza hemagglutinin have been described (39.Spruce A.E. Iwata A. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3623-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the small pores that we see are not fusion pores. Therefore, the small pores that we observe must be of a novel type, unlike a lipid defect but also different from the known pores induced by peptides.With virus, the development of small pores was followed by that of large (leakage and fusion) pores (small and large pores are clearly resolved at 0 °C, Fig. 2 B). Pore enlargement does not lead to lysis of the membranes, as witnessed by the intact resonance energy transfer between lipidic probes and the quenching of dextrans in fusion products (Fig. 3). The increase in fluorescence was more limited with dextrans than with calcein. Whereas some of this difference may be due to dextran remaining quenched in fusion products (Fig. 3), the data obtained with rosettes seem to suggest that large pores developed in fewer liposomes than small pores (Fig. 4). Rosettes do not induce fusion pores and give rise to slower and less extensive leakage of TMRD-10,000 than TMRD-3,000 leakage. TMRD-3,000 leakage is again slower and less extensive than calcein leakage (Fig. 4). Given a random distribution of HA trimers over the liposomes, fewer liposomes will have a large number of bound HAs than a lower amount of bound HA. Therefore, these data suggest that more HA trimers were required to form a pore allowing the passage of TMRD-10,000 than a pore allowing the passage of TMRD-3,000, and we know that 1 trimer suffices to allow the passage of calcein (8.Jiricek R. Schwarz G. Stegmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). With virus, multiple trimers are presented to the target membrane together (on the viral membrane), so the difference between calcein and dextrans is much smaller. Thus, most likely, pores increase in size gradually by recruiting additional trimers. Such behavior has been described for HA-induced fusion pore formation, and large pores are thought to be formed following complex formation by multiple HA trimers (17.Lindau M. Almers W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 18.Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Frolov V. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 40.Bentz J. Ellens H. Alford D. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 41.Blumenthal R. Sarkar D. Durell S. Howard D.E. Morris S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), again suggesting that fusion and leakage pores are related structures. A new element contributed by our observations is that since large leakage pores would be formed in a similar way, the target membrane half of the fusion pore may initially be a leakage pore (Fig. 7 c).BHA does not give rise to large pore formation. These data appear to suggest that the transmembrane anchor of HA, lacking in BHA, plays a role in this process. Cells expressing HA mutants that are anchored by a phosphatidylinositol (GPI-HA) do not induce fusion as measured by the transfer of aqueous dyes from one cell to the other (14.Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), but the mutants do induce lipid mixing of outer membrane leaflets (hemifusion). Therefore, the anchor probably does not have a structural role in organizing the HA complex giving rise to large pore formation. We suggest that it may instead be the higher local concentration of HA in rosettes, viral membranes, or cellular membranes containing GPI-anchored HA that facilitates large pore formation. Under the circumstances of the experiments shown in this paper, we have found that 25 BHA trimers bind per liposome (results not shown). At pH 5.1, 0 °C, 5% of the added BHA is active in pore formation (8.Jiricek R. Schwarz G. Stegmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Of course, this interpretation implies that GPI-HA should induce large pore formation at low pH; we have tried this experiment but find that, in our hands, not only GPI-HA but also wild type-HA, at the densities at which they are expressed on the surface of cells, induce no significant fusion or hemifusion with liposomes.Proteinaceous Versus Lipidic Fusion PoresOur data would be quite compatible with the numerous models proposing that fusion is the result of complex formation by multiple HA molecules in a ring-like structure (35.Stegmann T. White J.M. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4231-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40.Bentz J. Ellens H. Alford D.

Virol. 1986; 60: 833-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), assuming that the small pores correspond to the action of individual HA trimers before complex formation (Fig.7 a) and that the large pores are caused by the complex. Two completely different pathways have been proposed to lead from HA complex formation to fusion as follows: complexes could either be proteinaceous fusion pores, whose lateral expansion would break the ring and lead to lipid merger (reviewed in (17.Lindau M. Almers W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)), or they could induce the formation of a lipidic connection between the two membranes, which would then break through to form a fusion pore lined by lipids (11.Siegel D.P. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 475-512Google Scholar, 18.Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Frolov V. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4231-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).All the data reported in this paper are compatible with a proteinaceous nature of the fusion pore. Evidence for proteinaceous pores was provided by experiments showing that an aqueous connection forms between cells expressing HA and other cells at low pH, before lipid merger can be detected (16.Tse F.W. Iwata A. Almers W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Frolov V. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1885-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, strong experimental evidence for the formation of lipidic intermediates in hemagglutinin-mediated fusion is also available (14.Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 15.Klotz K.-H. Bartoldus I. Stegmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2383-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18.Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Frolov V. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J.

This evidence is mostly interpreted in terms of one of the versions of the stalk theory for fusion (11.Siegel D.P. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 475-512Google Scholar, 47.Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Kozlov M.M. Frolov V. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In theory, an unspecified initial membrane perturbation at the site of fusion first leads to fusion of the outer leaflets of the two membranes. In one version, lateral expansion of this stalk connecting the membranes gives rise to a special bilayer, the “hemifusion diaphragm,” and breakthrough of this diaphragm would finally lead to fusion of the inner leaflets also (48.Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Melikyan G.B. Abidor I.G. Markin V.S. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 643-655Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar). No leakage would be expected to occur at any stage during fusion involving stalk intermediates.The more recent observations of Chernomordik et al. (18.Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Frolov V. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) appeared to reconcile the proteinaceous and the lipidic fusion pathways. Following an earlier suggestion (14.Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), they showed that limited outer leaflet fusion occurs before fusion pore formation but that the lipids cannot spread beyond the area of this initial defect, because of steric constraints imposed by the presence of the complex of HA molecules. Expansion of the complex would allow lipid mixing. These data are compatible with both the observed aqueous fusion pore opening before the onset of extensive lipid mixing and the existence of lipidic intermediates (16.Tse F.W. Iwata A. Almers W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Frolov V. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 41.Blumenthal R. Sarkar D. Durell S. Howard D.E. Morris S.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1885-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).We think that there is sufficient evidence for the involvement of lipidic intermediates, involving a hemifusion diaphragm, in fusion, but neither the stalk theory nor this recent model sufficiently take into account the leakage of large molecules during fusion as observed by us and others (7.Shangguan T. Alford D. Bentz J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4956-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We therefore propose a different model for fusion (Fig.7). Initially, small stable pores resulting from insertion of the fusion peptide form anywhere in the target membrane (Fig.7 a). HA complex formation, involving a pH-independent, viral membrane-independ-ent, interaction between HA trimers, then leads to the formation of larger leakage pores in the membrane (Fig.7 b). This process takes several minutes at low temperature. With HA present in the horizontal position as shown in Fig. 7, consistent with recent models of fusogenic HA structure and alternative models (35.Stegmann T. White J.M. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4231-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 49.Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), as well as indications that HA may tilt with respect to the membrane normal during fusion (50.Gray C. Tamm L.K. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2359-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 51.Tatulian S.A. Hinterdorfer P. Baber G. Tamm L.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5514-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), viral and target membranes remain separated. However, lateral expansion of the pore and thermal motion of the viral membrane would bring the viral membrane into contact with the edges of the leakage pores after some time. We propose that if leakage pores come into contact with the viral membrane, they can initiate fusion. The edge of the expanding pore, which is probably at least partially (and increasingly) hydrophobic, would attack the viral membrane (Fig. 7 c), leading to fusion of the outer leaflet of the target membrane with the outer leaflet of the viral membrane, producing a hemifusion diaphragm. The latter step is not different from that figuring in other lipidic fusion models (18.Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Frolov V. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), although stalk formation would not seem necessary; hemifusion diaphragms could be formed directly if the pore is sufficiently large. From then on, fusion would proceed as previously suggested in the stalk model (not shown).Future experiments will have to establish why breakthrough of the viral monolayer requires a wild type-HA anchor, only occurs at low pH even after the conformational change in HA, and in the presence of a target membrane as observed. The crucial difference between our present fusion model and previous models is the presence of a largely proteinaceous pore in the target membrane, providing a falsifiable hypothesis for the type of membrane perturbation that would lead to lipid mixing and explaining the leakage we and others (7.Shangguan T. Alford D. Bentz J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4956-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) observe during fusion. Influenza virus enters its host cells by endocytosis, followed by fusion between the endosomal and the viral membrane. Fusion is mediated by the trimeric integral membrane protein hemagglutinin (HA)1 (for reviews see Refs.1.Hernandez L.D. Hoffman L.R. Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 627-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar and 2.Hughson F.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 265-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and is triggered by the low endosomal pH, which induces a conformational change in the protein. Each monomer of HA consists of two disulfide-linked subunits, the smaller one, HA2, is membrane-anchored at the C terminus. The N terminus of this subunit consists of a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids known as the “fusion peptide,” which is buried in the stem of the HA trimer at neutral pH (3.Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). The conformational change at low pH moves this peptide to the outside of the protein (4.Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar), and studies of liposome-virus fusion have shown that the peptide then enters the hydrophobic interior of the target membrane for fusion (5.Stegmann T. Delfino J.M. Richards F.M. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Tsurudome M. Glück R. Graf R. Falchetto R. Schaller U. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20225-20232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion could perturb the target membrane locally, providing a starting point for fusion. We and others have found that virus (7.Shangguan T. Alford D. Bentz J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4956-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or a single purified trimer of the ectodomain of HA (8.Jiricek R. Schwarz G. Stegmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), prepared by bromelain digestion of HA (BHA), produce a pore in target membranes at low pH, allowing the leakage of water-soluble molecules across these membranes. Whereas the conformational change and insertion of the fusion peptide are clearly required for fusion (9.Günther-Ausborn S. Praetor A. Stegmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,10.Stegmann T. Helenius A. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 89-111Google Scholar), little is known of the mechanism whereby the protein achieves the merger of the lipid bilayers. The formation of either lipidic or proteinaceous intermediate structures has been proposed to precede membrane merger. Lipidic intermediates could be “stalks” of fused outer membrane leaflets, formed after a focal perturbation of the target membrane bilayer by the inserted viral fusion peptides (11.Siegel D.P. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 475-512Google Scholar, 12.Siegel D.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2124-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This “hemifusion” intermediate would then expand laterally, be followed by breakthrough and merger of the inner leaflets at this point, leading to complete fusion. Although several observations are compatible with this theory (13.Chernomordik L.V. Vogel S.S. Sokoloff A. Onaran H.O. Leikina E.A. Zimmerberg J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14.Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2383-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it follows that lipids would line the first aqueous connection between the viral and the target membrane interior, the so-called “fusion pore.” However, electrophysiological measurements have shown that fusion pores form before lipid mixing can be detected (16.Tse F.W. Iwata A. Almers W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, alternatively, it was proposed that the fusion pores may be proteinaceous (17.Lindau M. Almers W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and would expand gradually, incorporating lipids as they open. More recent data suggest, however, that a lipidic connection between the membranes may form before fusion pore formation after all but that extensive lipid mixing would be hindered by the presence of HA in the membrane, thus supporting the first theory while explaining the data that gave rise to the second theory (18.Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Frolov V. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar).

Geminiviruses do not encode their own polymerases and, instead, rely on host enzymes for viral DNA and RNA synthesis. These characteristics make geminiviruses excellent model systems for studying plant DNA replication and transcription mechanisms. The geminivirus, tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV),1 has a bipartite genome that encodes seven open reading frames that are divergently transcribed. The 5′-intergenic region separating the transcription units is nearly identical between the two DNA components and includes the plus strand origin of replication (7.Lazarowitz S.G. Wu L.C.

In contrast, three elements in the TGMV intergenic region are necessary for origin function but have little or no effect on AL1 promoter activity. A hairpin structure with a 9-base pair loop sequence that is conserved among all geminiviruses is essential for replication and contains the cleavage site for initiating plus strand DNA synthesis (4.Heyraud F. Matzeit V. Kammann M. Schaefer S. Schell J. Gronenborn B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4445-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13.Laufs J. Traut W. Heyraud F. Matzeit V. Rogers S.G. Schell J.

A conserved sequence between the AL1 binding site and the hairpin, the AG-motif, is also required for replication (8.Orozco B.M. Gladfelter H.J. Settlage S.B. Eagle P.A. Gentry R. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Virology. 1998; 242: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The third element, the CA motif, is located outside of the minimal origin but its deletion reduced replication 20-fold (8.Orozco B.M. Gladfelter H.J. Settlage S.B. Eagle P.A. Gentry R. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Virology. 1998; 242: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The role of the AG- and CA-motifs in TGMV origins is not known, but one possibility is that they bind host factors that facilitate initiation of plus strand DNA replication. TGMV encodes two proteins, AL1 and AL3, that are required for efficient viral replication. AL1 is necessary for replication, whereas AL3 enhances viral DNA accumulation by an unknown mechanism (15.Elmer J.S. Brand L. Sunter G. Gardiner W.E. Bisaro D.M. Rogers S.G.

We previously mapped the TGMV AL1 domains for double-stranded DNA binding, single-stranded DNA cleavage and ligation, and AL1 oligomerization (23.Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Settlage S.B.

The DNA cleavage/ligation domain was located to the first 120 amino acids, and the oligomerization domain was mapped between amino acids 120 and 181. DNA binding activity required amino acids 1–130 for protein-DNA contacts and the AL1 oligomerization domain. Because of its importance in AL1 function, we have further characterized the sequences required for oligomerization in vitro and assessed the impact of site-directed mutations in the domain in vivo. Constructs are listed in Table I. The plasmid pNSB148, which contains the AL1 coding sequence in a pUC118-background, was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis (27.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 482-492Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers and resulting clones are also listed in TableI. DNA fragments containing the mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Plant expression cassettes for mutant AL1 proteins were generated by subcloningSalI/NcoI fragments (TGMV A position 2442 and 2059) from the mutant clones into the same sites in the wild type AL1 plant expression cassette pMON1549 (11.Fontes E.P.B.

Expression vectors coding for mutant AL1 proteins were made by subcloningBglII/BamHI inserts from the mutant plant expression cassettes into the BamHI site of pMON27025 (28.Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression vectors for the truncated proteins, AL1119–352(pNSB516), AL11–120 (pNSB388), and AL11–180(pNSB517), have been described previously (23.Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Settlage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The N-terminal truncations, AL1134–352 and AL1147–352, were generated by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing anSphI site into the NotI site of pNSB593 and pNSB595 to create in-frame start codons. AL1160–352 was created by inserting an SphI linker with a start codon (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) into the SspI site of pMON1539 (29.Hanley-Bowdoin L. Elmer J.S. Rogers S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1446-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). SphI/BamHI fragments from the resulting clones were inserted into the same sites of the baculovirus vector, pNSB448 (23.Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Settlage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), to give pNSB803 (AL1134–352), pNSB876 (AL1147–352), and pNSB633 (AL1160–352). The C-terminal truncation, AL11–158 (pNSB646), was generated by digesting pMON1539 with NdeI and SspI, repairing with Klenow, and subcloning into the filled BamHI site of pMON27025 to create an in-frame stop codon. The AL11–168 truncation, pNSB708, was created by inserting anXbaI linker into the repaired BssHII of pNSB609, generating an in-frame stop codon. Yeast expression cassettes were generated using the pAS1–1 and pACT2 vectors from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). TheBamHI/NdeI fragment of pMON1539 was cloned into the same sites of pAS2–1 to give pNSB736, which contained the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to wild type AL1 sequences. The ends of the sameBamHI/NdeI fragment were repaired with Klenow and cloned into the SmaI site of pACT2 to give pNSB735. TheAatII/BamHI fragment of pNSB735 was then replaced with the AatII/BamHI fragment from pMON1549. The resulting clone, pNSB809, contained the GAL4 activation domain (AD) fused to wild type AL1 sequences. Mutant AL1 yeast expression cassettes were created by replacing the wild typeAatII/BamHI fragment of pNSB735 with mutantAatII/BamHI fragments from the corresponding plant expression cassettes. Protoplasts were isolated from Nicotiana tabacum (BY-2) orNicoxiana benthamiana suspension cells, electroporated, and cultured according to published methods (11.Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8459-8465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For replication assays, N. tabacum transfections included 15 μg each of replicon DNA containing a partial tandem copy of TGMV B (pTG1.4B, Ref. 17.Fontes E.P.B. Gladfelter H.J. Schaffer R.L. Petty I.T.D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), wild type or mutant AL1 plant expression cassette, and an AL3 plant expression cassette (pNSB46, Ref. 11.Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8459-8465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the interference assays, 2 μg of replicon DNA containing a partial tandem copy of TGMV A (pMON1565, Ref. 14.Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Crossref Google Scholar) was cotransfected with 40 μg of mutant AL1 expression cassette or the empty expression vector (pMON921, Ref. 11.Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8459-8465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total DNA was extracted 3 days post-transfection and analyzed for double- and single-stranded viral DNA accumulation by DNA gel blot hybridization (11.Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8459-8465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The viral DNA was quantified by phosphorimager analysis in a minimum of three independent experiments. For transcriptional repression assays, N. benthamianaprotoplasts were transfected with 15 μg of luc reporter construct (pNSB114), 15 μg of AL1 expression cassette, and 36 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA (10.Eagle P.A. Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1157-1170PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity in total soluble protein extracts was measured 36 h post-transfection and standardized for protein concentration. Repression was determined as the ratio of Luc activity in the absence versus the presence of AL1. Each expression cassette was assayed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. Recombinant proteins were produced inSpodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system according to published protocols (14.Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Crossref Google Scholar, 24.Settlage S.B. Miller B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein extracts from cells co-expressing authentic and GST-AL1 fusion proteins were assayed for AL1 oligomerization by co-purification on glutathione-Sepharose (24.Settlage S.B. Miller B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) and immunoblotting using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-GST (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and anti-AL1 antisera (24.Settlage S.B. Miller B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y187 (MATα,ura3–52, his3–200, ade 2–101,trp 1–901, leu 2–3, 112,gal4Δ, met −, gal80Δ,URA3::GAL1 UAS-GAL1 TATA-lacZ) was transformed using lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol (30.Geitz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiesti R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). The DNAs were pNSB736, which expresses the GAL4 binding domain-wild type AL1 fusion, and either pNSB809, which produces the GAL4 AD-wild type AL1 protein, or the equivalent cassettes corresponding to the GAL4 AD-AL1 mutants. For β-galactosidase assays, yeast transformants were grown to an A 600 of 0.5 in 3 ml of synthetic dropout medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (31.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min, rinsed with Z buffer (0.1m NaPO4, pH 7, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 40 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) (31.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), and resuspended in 300 μl of Z buffer. The cells were subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant (150 μl) was assayed for β-galactosidase activity in a total reaction volume of 250 μl using the substrateo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside, as described by CLONTECH. Accumulation of theo-nitrophenol product was measured atA 420 using a BioKinetics microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instrument Inc., Winooski, VT). Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad). The enzyme-specific activity (1 unit = 1.0 μm product/min at pH7.3 at 37 °C) resulting from interaction between two-hybrid cassettes carrying wild type AL1 sequences was determined using purified β-galactosidase (Sigma) as the standard. The relative activities of the mutants were normalized against the wild type AL1 interaction level, which was set to 100%. The β-galactosidase specific activity for wild type and mutant AL1 proteins was adjusted for background from pNSB736 alone. The different constructs were tested in a minimum of two experiments, each of which assayed four independent transformants for each construct. For immunoblot analysis, individual yeast transformants were grown in 5 ml of medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, pH 5.8 (31.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) to an A 600 of 1. An equal volume of crushed ice was added and the culture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellet was washed once with ice cold water and resuspended in 80 μl of modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 (32.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), containing 1% (w/v) SDS) and protease inhibitors (6 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 8 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Glass beads (40 μl, 425–600 μm, Sigma) were added and the sample was vortexed at maximum speed for four 30-s intervals separated by 2-min intervals on ice. The sample was then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered, and the protein concentration was determined using Bradford assays. Total protein (100 μg) was resolved on 12% polyacrylamide/SDS gels and analyzed by immunoblotting using a GAL4 AD monoclonal antibody at 0.4 μg/ml (CLONTECH). The domains for TGMV AL1 DNA binding and DNA cleavage/ligation activities are well defined, and key structural and sequence motifs have been identified for these functions (23.Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Settlage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26.Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24448-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas the AL1 oligomerization domain has only been broadly located to the center of the protein (23.Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Settlage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this paper, closely spaced N- and C-terminal truncations were generated to define the limits of the AL1 oligomerization domain (Fig.1 A). A GST fusion corresponding to full-length AL1 (GST-AL1) was co-expressed with the truncated AL1 proteins in baculovirus-infected insect cells, and protein complexes were purified on glutathione-Sepharose resin. Total extracts and purified proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with AL1 and GST polyclonal antisera. As reported previously (23.Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Settlage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the C-terminal truncation AL11–180 (Fig. 1 B,lanes 3 and 6) copurified with full-length GST-AL1. Further deletion of the C terminus to amino acid 168 (lanes 2 and 5) or 158 (lanes 1 and4) abolished interactions with GST-AL1, demonstrating that the C-terminal limit of the oligomerization domain is between position 168 and 180. The N-terminal truncations to amino acids 134 (Fig.1 C, lanes 3 and 6), 147 (lanes 2 and 5), and 160 (lanes 1 and 4) showed a gradual disappearance of interaction with GST-AL1. AL1134–352 consistently displayed interactions with GST-AL1, whereas AL1147–352 and AL1160–352interactions varied between weak to background levels, making it more difficult to define the N-terminal limit. Contacts outside the oligomerization domain may contribute to complex stability or multimerization and account for the low level interactions observed with AL1147–352 and AL1160–352. To address this possibility, we asked whether full-length AL1 copurified when only the oligomerization domain was fused to GST (GST-AL1119–180). Full-length AL1 interacted with GST-AL1119–180 but not with GST alone (Fig.2 B, lanes 1 and2), demonstrating that amino acids 119–180 are sufficient for oligomerization. We then examined the abilities of the N-terminal AL1 truncations to bind GST-AL1119–180. In this assay, deletion to positions 119 (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1 and5) and 134 (lanes 2 and 6) did not affect oligomerization, whereas further deletion to positions 147 (lanes 3 and 7) and 160 (lanes 4 and8) abolished interactions with GST-AL1119–180. Together, these results showed that AL1 amino acids 134–180 contain the oligomerization domain and that sequences outside the domain contribute stabilizing contacts. Alanine substitutions were generated in conserved charged or hydrophobic residues within the oligomerization domain to identify key amino acids that contribute to AL1 interactions (Fig.3, the mutations are designated by the corresponding wild type sequence and the position of the last amino acid that was altered; dashes indicate amino acids that were not changed). Alanine was selected because it is structurally neutral and should not interfere with normal protein folding. The mutations are within a region that includes a pair of predicted α-helices (26.Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24448-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and downstream sequences required for oligomerization. All of the mutant AL1 proteins co-purified with GST-AL1 on glutathione resin when co-expressed in insect cells (Fig. 2 A), showing that they formed stable complexes with the wild type protein. Similar results were observed when both the test and GST fusion proteins carried the mutations (data not shown). In contrast, when interactions between the mutant AL1 proteins and GST-AL1119–180 were examined mutant EKY159 (Fig. 2 B, lane 6) was defective for AL1 interactions. Thus, sequences outside of the oligomerization domain in the full-length AL1 masked the effect of the EKY159 mutation in Fig.2 A, which is consistent with our previous conclusion that sequences outside the oligomerization domain stabilize AL1 interactions. The oligomerization mutant, EKY159, was assayed with truncated GST-AL1 proteins to locate the stabilizing region. As shown above, EKY159 bound full-length GST-AL1 (Fig. 2 C,lanes 1 and 5) but not GST-AL1119–180 (lanes 4 and 8). EKY159 also bound an N-terminal truncation, GST-AL1119–352(lanes 3 and 7), whereas no interaction was detected with a C-terminal truncation, GST-AL11–180(lanes 2 and 6), demonstrating that the AL1 C terminus contributes stabilizing contacts. The quantitative impact of each mutation on AL1 oligomerization was measured using a yeast two-hybrid system. Expression cassettes for wild type or mutant AL1 fused to the GAL4 AD were cotransformed into yeast with a cassette for wild type AL1 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Activation of a GAL4-responsive promoter driving a lacZreporter was assayed by measuring β-galactosidase activity in total soluble protein extracts. In extracts from yeast cotransfected with AD and binding domain cassettes carrying wild type AL1 sequences, 142 mu/mg total protei"

Here we have analyzed a different signaling state that arises from noncovalent binding of all-trans-retinal (atr) to the aporeceptor opsin and enhances the very low opsin activity by several orders of magnitude. Like with metarhodopsin II, coupling of Gt to opsin-atr is sensitive to competition by synthetic peptides from the COOH termini of both Gtα and Gtγ. However, atr does not compete with 11-cis-retinal incorporation into the Lys296 binding site and formation of the light-sensitive pigment. Blue light illumination fails to photorevert opsin-atr to the ground state. Thus noncovalently boundatr has no access to the light-dependent binding site and reaction pathway. Moreover, in contrast to light-dependent signaling, removal of the palmitoyl anchors at Cys322 and Cys323 in the rhodopsin COOH terminus impairs the atr-stimulated activity. Repalmitoylation by autoacylation with palmitoyl-coenzyme A restores most of the original activity. We hypothesize that the palmitoyl moieties are part of a second binding pocket for the chromophore, mediating hydrophobic interactions that can activate a large part of the catalytic receptor/G-protein interface.

Atr forms an active complex with PM-opsin, although no covalent Schiff base bond is detectable by acid trapping (12.Jager S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This provides evidence that the opsin-atr activity arises from noncovalent chromophore/protein interaction, rather than from a Meta II-like deprotonated Schiff base bond. Moreover, atr does not compete with 11-cis-retinal during regeneration of PM-opsin to PM-rhodopsin, suggesting that even the binding site might be different (12.Jager S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).The formation of an active complex between opsin and the photolyzed chromophore, atr, may play an important role in vivo under conditions of intense illumination. After the decay of Meta II, atr bound to opsin may keep the rod cell in noisy and/or desensitized states (14.Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar).A new property of the opsin-atr activity, described in this study, is its dependence on palmitoylation. Generally, theS-palmitoylation of heptahelical membrane receptors may provide a structural anchor for the carboxyl-terminal tail. In rhodopsin, the two palmitoyl anchors at cysteines 322 and 323 may help to stabilize the structure of the putative fourth cytoplasmic loop (15.Ovchinnikov Y.A. Abdulaev N.G. Bogachuk A.S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar,16.Cai K. Klein-Seetharaman J. Farrens D. Zhang C. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7925-7930Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Protein S-palmitoylation of rhodopsin was foundin vivo and also after autoacylation with fatty acid acyl-coenzyme A in vitro (17.O'Brien P.J. St. Jules R.S. Reddy T.S. Bazan N.G. Zatz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5210-5215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty acidS-acylation is specific for palmitate incorporation (18.Papac D.I. Thornburg K.R. Bullesbach E.E. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16889-16894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous functional tests, chemical depalmitoylation of membrane-bound rhodopsin in the dark had no effect on the light-dependent binding of Gt, but rather increased its GTPase activity (19.Morrison D.F. O'Brien P.J. Pepperberg D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20118-20123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and replacement by protein engineering of the cysteines by serines did not change Gt activation by dodecyl maltoside- purified rhodopsin (20.Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Thus rhodopsin has two faces, that of a photoreceptor and that of a chemical receptor for the diffusible agonist, atr. We will investigate some aspects of retinal/protein and protein/protein interaction, with emphasis on the role of palmitoylation.DISCUSSIONIn its well studied function as a photoreceptor, rhodopsin absorbs photons via the chromophoric ligand, 11-cis-retinal. Photoactivation may be understood as the light-induced replacement, through photochemical isomerization, of the bound inverse agonist 11-cis-retinal by the agonist atr. In contrast, the exogenous addition of atr to the aporeceptor leads to a noncovalent complex that is less active than Meta II but several orders of magnitude more active than the empty opsin. In this study we have explored some properties of this activity.The Opsin-Atr Complex Is a Form of the Receptor with an Intrinsically Low ActivityA prerequisite for theatr-induced activity is the binding of the ligand to a site from which the signal is transmitted to the interaction domain with the G protein. The most obvious explanation would be that the exogenously added chromophore binds reversibly to the original Lys296binding site. Such a mechanism has indeed been found in constitutively active mutants (32.Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 33.Han, M., and Sakmar, T. P. (2000) Methods Enzymol., 315 in pressGoogle Scholar). In all mutants studied, the data were consistent with a two-state model (34.Leff P. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), which predicts that increased constitutive activity results in increased atr-induced activity (35.Han M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8253-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).The data presented in this work reveal that reversible binding to the original site does not occur in wild type opsin to any measurable degree. Although a substantial activity of opsin-atr toward Gt is measured, it could still result from an equilibrium with Meta II that is strongly shifted toward the inactive form. Such a small amount of a Meta II-like species would be hard to determine by direct spectroscopy.However, properties of the Gt activation argue for opsin-atr representing a separate form of the active receptor with intrinsically low activity. These include:1. atr recombines not only with native opsin but also with reductively PM-opsin, lacking free lysine side chains with the exception of the original blocked binding site Lys296. In this situation, one does not find any measurable Schiff base formation with atr, although a substantial Gt activation (12.Jager S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or phosphorylation of opsin by rhodopsin kinase (5.Buczylko J. Saari J.C. Crouch R.K. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20621-20630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is measured.2. Removal of the palmitoyl anchors from the COOH-terminal cysteines does not measurably affect the activity of Meta II but has a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of opsin-atr (Fig. 4, discussed below).We thus conclude that the rod photoreceptor is capable of two very different types of activity, one Meta II-like, one opsin-like. Available evidence indicates that in this complex, atr is bound noncovalently (12.Jager S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Chromophore/Protein Interaction in the Opsin-Atr Complex Is Different from Meta IIThe data presented have corroborated the data of Daemen (36.Daemen F.J.M. Nature. 1978; 276: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and our earlier finding (12.Jager S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) that atr, under conditions where it activates opsin, does not compete with 11-cis-retinal when the latter regenerates the aporeceptor to rhodopsin. We thus conclude that the overlap between the binding domains for the chromophore in the two modes of action is negligibly small. Moreover, atr has a supporting effect on regeneration of opsin to rhodopsin, indicating a positive allosteric effect ofatr (Fig. 2). Thus, atr paradoxically favors the termination of the opsin-atr activity by stimulating the binding of the inverse agonist, 11-cis-retinal.The most characteristic difference between Meta II and opsin-atr comes from the photoregeneration experiment (Fig.3). In Meta II, atr is linked to Lys296 by a Schiff base bond. When the chromophore is reisomerized by UV light, most of the rhodopsin reacts back to the ground state, as is seen in the readily observed reprotonation of the Schiff base (Fig. 3). The lack of any such signal in the case of the opsin-atr complex is evidence that light absorption fails to restore the ground state, indicating a fundamentally different chromophore/protein interaction than in Meta II.These experiments support the hypothesis of a second binding site foratr, which may be prevented from reaching the 11-cis-retinal binding pocket in native opsin because of steric hindrance.Binding Sites at Gt May Be Similar for Meta II and Opsin-AtrIn a recent study, the effect of synthetic peptides from the COOH-terminal stretches Gtα (340–350) and Gtγ (50–71)-farnesyl was investigated by several biophysical assays, identifying these two sites as part of the Gt domain to which Meta II couples in light-dependent nucleotide exchange catalysis (8.Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this regard, the opsin-atr complex displays a similarity to Meta II. The peptide competition data (Fig. 1) provide evidence that opsin-atr uses the same sites for catalytic interaction with Gt as Meta II.These analogies between the G-protein coupling mechanisms of opsin-atr and Meta II do not exclude that Meta II and/or opsin-atr uses more and other interaction sites on Gt than the ones that have been identified (37.Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 38.Hamm H.E. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 11: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Regarding the rhodopsin/Gt interface, recent analyses argue for a complex interplay between binding sites, in that mutations at the NH2-terminal side of the fourth loop of rhodopsin affect light-dependent interactions with both Gtα and Gtγ-farnesyl COOH-terminal peptides. 2Ernst, O. P., Meyer, C. K., Marin, E. P., Henklein, P., Fu, W.-Y., Sakmar, T. P., and Hofmann, K. P. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 1937–1943 Such relationships remain to be explored for opsin-atr.A rigorous quantitative evaluation of the peptide competition data in terms of affinities is difficult (8.Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30.Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 238-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because of limitations of the fluorescence assay in the case of Meta II. This prevents a quantitative comparison with opsin-atr. Nevertheless, we can state that, compared with Meta II, competition for opsin-atr was enhanced with both peptides. This is qualitatively consistent with the notion that the affinity of the opsin-atr complex toward the Gt holoprotein is reduced. A similar conclusion can be reached from the shift of the alkaline branch of the pH/rate profile of Gt activation with opsin-atr compared with Meta II (Fig. 6). It reflects a lower capacity for forced protonation and thus a weaker coupling between the noncovalent retinal binding and the Gt interaction domain.Palmitoylation Is Essential for Atr/Opsin/GtInteractionThe data show that depalmitoylation strongly decreases the activity of opsin-atr, and repalmitoylation of opsin restores the original level of Gt activation. This establishes a functional role for this modification, which was not found for Meta II, in agreement with previous studies (19.Morrison D.F. O'Brien P.J. Pepperberg D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20118-20123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20.Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). 3Marin, E. P., Krishna, A. G., Zvyaga, T. A., Isele, J., Siebert, F., and Sakmar, T. P. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 1930–1936 We conclude that the palmitoyl thioesters at Cys322 and Cys323 are involved in binding the retinal and/or in the transmission of the agonist binding signal to the Gt interaction domain. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic interactions within the region of the palmitoylated cysteines and the fourth loop contribute to reversible interaction with atr, possibly forming part of theatr binding site. It is intriguing to note that prominent hydrophobic elements at opsin and at Gt, namely the receptor palmitoyl, Gtα-myristoyl, and Gtγ-farnesyl moieties, are involved in both receptor/Gt interaction and in membrane anchoring (39.Seitz H. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Alt T. Pellaud J. Seelig A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7950-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Physiological ImplicationsA physiological role for the opsin-atr complex as a storage form of atr was recently found in mice lacking the rim protein of rod outer segment discs, a member of the ABC transporter superfamily. In these retinas, dark adaptation is delayed, which was interpreted as an accumulation of the opsin-atr complex, related to impaired transport ofatr and/or its adduct N-retinylidene phosphatidylethanolamine (14.Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The rim protein is a component of a larger signaling complex organized by glutamic acid-rich protein and localized at the disc rims, which interacts with active phosphodiesterase but not with rhodopsin or Gt (40.Körschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Koch K.-W. Kellner R. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). If it is true that atr interacts with opsin's palmitoyl moieties, it will be of interest to analyze how it is translocated to the export machinery of the ABC transporter protein.ConclusionExogenous atr activates opsin by a different mechanism than the atr in the Meta II photoproduct. The receptor structure is flexible enough to accept the chromophoric ligand in different modes of action. Even though key features of the interaction with Gt are similar, it is likely that exogenous atr uses a second binding site on bovine opsin. Palmitoylation plays a unique role in the opsin-atr complex, not found with Meta II. We suggest that the palmitoyl-cysteines are involved in the interaction withatr. The retinal photoreceptor rhodopsin absorbs photons via a chromophoric ligand, 11-cis-retinal, to trigger the amplifying cascade of vision. The light-sensitive ground state conformation, with a λmax = 500 nm, is stabilized by a salt bridge between the protonated Schiff base bond of the 11-cis-retinal to Lys296 and its counterion at Glu113 (1.Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Light-induced 11-cis/all-trans isomerization of the retinal and subsequent relaxation processes result in protonation-dependent conformations of the receptor identified as “metarhodopsin” photointermediates (for details, see Refs. 2.Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and 3.Hofmann K.P. Goode J. Proceedings of the 224th Symposium of the Novartis Foundation. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, U. K.1999: 158-179Google Scholar). Metarhodopsin II (Meta II,1 λmax = 380 nm) is distinguished by its deprotonated Schiff base linkage and broken Lys296/Glu113 salt bridge. The signaling state for Gt arises from Meta II through proton uptake from solution (4.Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), with the conserved Glu134 as the likely proton acceptor. The apparent pK for this protonation is shifted to pH values higher than the intrinsic pK of a Glu residue, reflected in pH/rate profiles for activation of both Gt (1.Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and rhodopsin kinase (“forced protonation” (5.Buczylko J. Saari J.C. Crouch R.K. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1973058523,"Most selenoproteins contain a single selenocysteine residue per polypeptide chain, encoded by an in-frame UGA codon. Selenoprotein P is unique in that its mRNA encodes 10–12 selenocysteine residues, depending on species. In addition to the high number of selenocysteines, the protein is cysteine- and histidine-rich. The function of selenoprotein P has remained elusive, in part due to the inability to express the recombinant protein. This has been attributed to presumed inefficient translation through the selenocysteine/stop codons. Herein, we report for the first time the expression of recombinant rat selenoprotein P in a transiently transfected human epithelial kidney cell line, as well as the endogenously expressed protein from HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The majority of the expressed protein migrates with the predicted 57-kDa size of full-length glycosylated selenoprotein P. Based on the histidine-rich nature of selenoprotein P, we have purified the recombinant and endogenously expressed proteins using nickel-agarose affinity chromatography. We show that the recombinant rat and endogenous human proteins react in Western blotting and immunoprecipitation assays with commercial anti-histidine antibodies. The ability to express, purify, and immunochemically detect the recombinant protein provides a foundation for investigating the functions and efficiency of expression of this intriguing protein. Most selenoproteins contain a single selenocysteine residue per polypeptide chain, encoded by an in-frame UGA codon. Selenoprotein P is unique in that its mRNA encodes 10–12 selenocysteine residues, depending on species. In addition to the high number of selenocysteines, the protein is cysteine- and histidine-rich. The function of selenoprotein P has remained elusive, in part due to the inability to express the recombinant protein. This has been attributed to presumed inefficient translation through the selenocysteine/stop codons. Herein, we report for the first time the expression of recombinant rat selenoprotein P in a transiently transfected human epithelial kidney cell line, as well as the endogenously expressed protein from HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The majority of the expressed protein migrates with the predicted 57-kDa size of full-length glycosylated selenoprotein P.

This rare amino acid is found in the active site of all selenoenzymes characterized to date. Most selenoprotein mRNAs contain a single UGA codon encoding a single selenocysteine residue per polypeptide chain and a single specific RNA secondary structure, termed a SECIS element, directing incorporation of this amino acid. Selenoprotein P is unique in that its mRNAs in different mammalian species encode 10–12 selenocysteine residues and contain two SECIS elements in the 3′-untranslated region (1.Hill K.E. Lloyd R.

Selenoprotein P is a glycoprotein that carries up to 50% of the selenium in plasma, but its function is unknown. Although originally identified in plasma and shown to be expressed in liver, more recent studies have identified selenoprotein P mRNA in a wide variety of tissues. An abundance of selenoprotein P message is present in specific regions of the brain, in kidney, testis, lung, and heart (4.Saijoh K. Saito N. Lee M.J. Fujii M. Kobayashi T. Sumino K. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5.Dreher I. Schmutzler C. Jakob F. Kohrle J. J. Trace Elem. Med.

Selenoprotein P cDNA sequences in the GenBankTM data bases indicate expression in human thyroid, prostate, a T cell lymphoma, and an endometrial tumor, as well as in mouse myotubes and mammary gland. Response elements for hepatic nuclear factor, HNF3, and a brain-specific transcription factor, BRN-2, are present in the murine gene promoter (7.Steinert P. Bachner D. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), consistent with expression of the mRNA in these tissues. Expression of selenoprotein P has been shown to be repressed by cytokines in HepG2 cells (8.Dreher I. Jakobs T.C. Kohrle J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29364-29371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and induced by dexamethasone treatment in normal rat kidney cells (9.Fujii M. Saijoh K. Sumino K. Kobe J. Med. Sci. 1997; 43: 13-23PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting possible roles in inflammatory responses and repression during the acute phase reaction. Immunohistochemical localization of selenoprotein P revealed its presence in the liver and brain bound to capillary endothelial cell walls. In kidney, the protein is found associated with the linings of the glomerulus but not in the tubules (10.Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Boeglin M.E. Ebner F.F. Chitum H.S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 108: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In vivo, selenoprotein P is thought to serve as an antioxidant in protection from diquat-induced liver necrosis (11.Burk R.F.

Observed in vitro functions include exhibiting a low level extracellular phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase-like activity (13.Saito Y. Hayashi T. Tanaka A. Watanabe Y. Suzuki M. Saito E. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2866-2871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), promoting survival of neurons in primary culture (14.Yan J. Barrett J.N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8682-8691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and binding to complexes consisting of equimolar ratios of heavy metals and selenium,i.e. Hg-Se, Cd-Se, and Ag-Se (14.Yan J. Barrett J.N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8682-8691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Yoneda S. Suzuki K.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16.Mostert V. Lombeck I. Abel J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The protein has also been proposed to function in selenium transport or storage (6.Burk R.F. Hill K.E. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The localization of selenoprotein P to the capillary endothelial cells may correlate with protection from products of oxidative stress or as a barrier to heavy metal uptake by cells. In addition to the presence of 10–12 selenocysteines, the protein has a high content of cysteine and histidine residues. The rat and human selenoprotein P sequences each encode two histidine-rich regions; the first region consists of 8 (rat) or 9 (human) histidines out of 14 residues, and the second a stretch of 7 (rat) or 4 (human) consecutive histidines. These regions, in conjunction with the cysteine and selenocysteine content, are likely responsible for the observed coordination to heavy metals (17.Suzuki K.T. Sasakura C. Yoneda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1429: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This property has been utilized in designing affinity purification strategies, employing either zinc-Sepharose (14.Yan J. Barrett J.N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8682-8691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or nickel-agarose (16.Mostert V. Lombeck I. Abel J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All studies to date reporting characterization or functional studies of selenoprotein P have relied on protein expressed endogenously by various cell lines or purified from plasma or serum. Progress has been made in defining the biochemical properties, such as heavy metal binding, and correlation with physiological effects, e.g.antioxidant activity and extension of neuronal survival. However, the function(s) and particularly the mode of action of selenoprotein P remain elusive, in part due to the lack of a transgenic or knockout model and the reported inability to express the recombinant protein in mammalian cells. Similarly, little is known about the efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation into selenoprotein P, either in cell lines or in the intact animal. Studies in transfected mammalian cells (18.Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Ohama T. Hatfield D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3753-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and in bacteria (19.Suppmann S. Persson B.C. Bock A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) suggest that selenocysteine incorporation at a single site per polypeptide may be inefficient. If so, this raises the question of how the translation machinery produces full-length selenoprotein P, outcompeting termination at 10–12 UGA codons. Herein, we describe expression of recombinant rat selenoprotein P in a transiently transfected human epithelial kidney cell line. We show that the expressed rat protein is glycosylated to a similar extent as human and hamster selenoprotein P expressed endogenously in cell lines from these two species. Taking advantage of the histidine-rich nature of the proteins, we utilized nickel-agarose affinity chromatography to purify the expressed recombinant protein. We show that commercially available antibodies prepared against 4 or 5 consecutive histidines detect the expressed protein in both Western blotting analysis and immunoprecipitation assays. The reactivity of these antibodies with unlabeled selenoprotein P in Western blots thus circumvents the need to use radiolabeled selenium to study the protein. These results provide an excellent foundation for investigation of the functions of selenoprotein P, as well as the mechanism and efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation into this protein. The rat selenoprotein P cDNA was a generous gift of Kristina Hill (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Two upstream PCR1 primers (Life Technologies Inc.), GGAATTCCGCAATGT GGAGAAGCCTAGGGCTTG and GGAATTCCACCATGG GGAGAAGCCTAGGGCTTG, were designed corresponding to the region of the initiation codon (italics). One amplifies the wild-type sequence, in which the ATG codon is found in a context predicted to be unfavorable for initiation (GCA ATG T). A second primer was designed to create a favorable Kozak context (ACC ATG G). These primers introduce an EcoRI site (underlined) just upstream of the coding region. A downstream PCR primer complementary to nucleotides 2550–2532 in the 3′-untranslated region and encoding a NotI site was used in conjunction with the upstream primers to amplify the selenoprotein P coding and 3′-untranslated region sequences. The ∼2.5-kilobase pair PCR products were subcloned into pUHD10-3 vector (20.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar) via the unique EcoRI site and a NotI site introduced adjacent to the XbaI site. Constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing to ensure that no mutations were introduced by PCR. Transient transfections in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were carried out using the calcium phosphate method of transfection as described previously (21.Berry M.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14155-14158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three days prior to transfection, cells were plated onto 60-mm culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were transfected with 10 μg of the pUHD10-3 based expression plasmids and 4 μg of the pUHD15 plasmid (20.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), which encodes a protein necessary for transcriptional activation of the pUHD10-3 promoter. To monitor transfection efficiencies, cells were cotransfected with 3 μg of an expression vector containing the human growth hormone cDNA under control of the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter. On the day of transfection, media were changed to DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS. The day following transfection, media were changed to DMEM without serum to reduce the amount of albumin in the preparations. For labeling studies,75Se (3 μCi/ml) was added to the media at this time. Two days after transfection, media and cells were harvested. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 6.9, 1 mm EDTA containing 0.25 m sucrose. For studies of the effects of selenium supplementation, graded amounts of sodium selenite were added to media the day before transfection. HepG2 human hepatoma cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12, supplemented with 10% FBS. Transfection with DEAE-dextran was performed according to the procedure described (22.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 9.1.2Google Scholar). DEAE-dextran was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1 mm chloroquine. Media were changed to DMEM without serum at the time of addition of 75Se as above, and labeling was continued for 24 h. Polysome preparation from transiently transfected HEK 293 cells was carried out according to a modification of the protocol described by White et al. (23.White M.W. Kameji T. Pegg A. Morris D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested as above, except that cycloheximide was added to 100 μg/ml 20 min before harvest. Cells combined from three 100-mm dishes were washed in PBS buffer and resuspended in low salt buffer (LSB, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm RNasin, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in LSB containing 1.2% Triton X-100 and 0.25 m sucrose. Postmitochondrial supernatants were prepared by centrifugation in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min. NaCl and MgCl2concentration were adjusted to 150 and 10 mm, respectively. Linear sucrose gradients (15–50% w/w in LSB) were prepared using a Searle Densi-flow IIC gradient maker with a sublayer of 1 ml of Fluorinert (ISCO, Lincoln, NE). Cytoplasmic extracts (1 ml) were layered onto 10.6-ml gradients and centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 2 h. Fractions (0.75 ml) were collected using a gradient fractionator (Brandel) equipped with an ISCO UA-6 UV detector. Polysome profiles were detected by absorbance at 254 nm. RNA was isolated from 250 μl of each gradient fraction using TRI REAGENT LS (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati) according to the manufacturer's specifications. RNAs were electrophoresed on denaturing agarose gels and vacuum-blotted to Nitran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). A DNA fragment from the selenoprotein P cDNA (NspI fragment, 783 base pairs) was labeled by random priming (Random Primer Labeling Kit, Stratagene). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C followed by high stringency washing at 65 °C. Protease or proteasome inhibitors were added to media at the time of 75Se labeling. CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) containing inhibitors of chymotrypsin, thermolysin, papain, Pronase, and trypsin was used according to the manufacturer's specifications.N-Acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal (ALLN, Sigma), a calpain I inhibitor (24.Sasaki T. Kishi M. Saito M. Tanaka T. Higuchi N. Kominami E. Katunuma N. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhibit. 1990; 3: 195-201Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar), was added to media at a final concentration of 50 μm. Carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal (MG132), a proteasome uptake inhibitor (25.Steinsapir J. Harney J. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1895-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was added at a final concentration of 10 μm. Deglycosylation was performed using theN-Glycosidase F Deglycosylation Kit from Roche Molecular Biochemical according to the manufacturer's specifications. Nickel-agarose chromatography was performed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or Bio-Rad poly-prep columns (2-ml bed volume) filled with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. Columns were equilibrated with protein binding (PB) buffer, consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl; 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol. Media from transfected cells (up to 3 column volumes) were allowed to percolate into the columns by gravity. Column resin was washed at least 3 times with PB buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. Specifically bound proteins were eluted by washing columns with PB buffer containing 0.5m NaCl and 100–400 mm imidazole. If necessary, proteins were concentrated in Viva-spin columns (VivaScience, Lincoln, UK). Tetra-histidine- and penta-histidine-specific antibodies were obtained from Qiagen. Primary antibodies were diluted according to the manufacturer's specifications. Typically 5 μl were incubated with 300 μl of selenium-labeled media from cells. Immunoprecipitation was carried out according to Ref. 41.Qiagen Inc QIAexpress Detection and Assay Handbook. Qiagen, Valencia, CA1998Google Scholar except that Pansorbin (Calbiochem) was used as a source of protein A. Samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer containing 0.5 m β-mercaptoethanol, and electrophoresed on 10% acrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 29:1) or 12% ReadyGels (Bio-Rad). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis on 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 29:1), followed by electrotransfer to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in 20% methanol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine. Membranes were blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), incubated with histidine-specific antibodies (Qiagen) at 1:1500 dilution in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS and then washed in TBS/Triton/Tween according to the manufacturer's instructions. This was followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 10% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS (1:6000 dilution, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reaction products were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and exposure to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). After extensive washing of the membrane and decay of the chemiluminescent signal the membrane was subjected to autoradiography. We hypothesized that one possible reason for the reported inability to express selenoprotein P in transfected cells was due to the unfavorable context, GCA ATG T, of the initiation codon in the wild-type (w.t.) rat selenoprotein P sequence. To test this hypothesis, the w.t. sequence was mutated to the Kozak consensus sequence (26.Kozak M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2482-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), ACC ATG G. W.t. and mutant selenoprotein P expression constructs were then transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. We chose to visualize the expression of selenoprotein P first by polysome analysis. Determination of the number of ribosomes associated with an RNA reflects its translational activity. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and loaded onto sucrose gradients for polysome isolation and fractionation. The A 260 profile of a representative gradient is shown in Fig.1. RNA was prepared from each gradient fraction and analyzed by Northern hybridization to localize selenoprotein P mRNA in the gradient. Fig. 1 B shows that selenoprotein P mRNA expressed from the w.t. mRNA is found in fractions ranging from monosomes up to at least 7–8 ribosomes, with the peak of message in the four-ribosome region. This indicates that ribosomes are efficiently loaded onto the mRNA. No differences were detected in polysome profiles from the w.t. versus the Kozak consensus construct (not shown). Thus, problems with initiation of protein biosynthesis seem not to be the explanation for the reported inability to express selenoprotein P. Since selenoprotein P mRNA appeared to be translated efficiently, we analyzed media from cells transiently transfected with the selenoprotein P expression plasmid and labeled with 75Se. Forty-eight hours after transfection and after a 24-h labeling period,75Se-labeled selenoprotein P was present in the media from transfected cells (Fig. 2, lane 2). The recombinant protein migrated with the observed molecular mass of full-length or near full-length selenoprotein P, ∼57 kDa. No endogenously expressed selenoprotein P was detectable in the media from HEK cells following transfection with vector alone (Fig. 2, lane 1). We also analyzed the labeled selenoprotein profile in cell lysates. We were unable to detect any differences in the cell lysate labeling pattern between the selenoprotein P and vector-transfected cells. Thus, no new selenoprotein bands corresponding to the sizes of prematurely terminated or non-glycosylated selenoprotein P species were seen in cell lysates following transfection. However, the high background of endogenous selenoproteins in the size range of the full-length protein, including thioredoxin reductases and selenophosphate synthetase, might easily mask full-length or near full-length glycosylated selenoprotein P associated with cells (see below). Endogenous selenoproteins in the size range corresponding to cytoplasmic and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase were also present in these cells. We next investigated the abilities of other cell lines to express the recombinant rat protein. Following 75Se labeling of CHO cells, endogenously expressed, secreted selenoprotein P was easily detected in the media (Fig. 2, lane 3). However, the expression of recombinant selenoprotein P was negligible, as there was no increase in the amount of selenoprotein P observed after transfection of the plasmid encoding the rat protein (not shown). The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, is known to express several selenoproteins, including type 1 deiodinase 2R. M. Tujebajeva, J. W. Harney, and M. J. Berry, unpublished observations. and selenoprotein P (5.Dreher I. Schmutzler C. Jakob F. Kohrle J. J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 1997; 11: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following 75Se labeling, HepG2 cells also produced endogenous selenoprotein P (Fig. 2, lane 4) but no additional selenoprotein P upon transfection of the plasmid (not shown). Strikingly, the patterns of labeled proteins differed from these three cell lines. Transfection of the rat cDNA into HEK 293 cells produced a single prominent selenoprotein migrating as ∼57 kDa, whereas the human protein produced endogenously by HepG2 cells migrated slightly more slowly, in the 60-kDa size range. As the deduced molecular masses only differ by ∼170 Da, this may reflect differences in extent of glycosylation. In CHO cells, a faster migrating selenoprotein of ∼45 kDa was also observed, in addition to the ∼57-kDa protein. This may correspond to a prematurely terminated form of the protein (see “Discussion”). One potential difficulty in determining the extent of premature termination of endogenous or recombinant expressed selenoprotein P from these cell lines is that these products may be rapidly degraded within the cell, underestimating the level of termination. This has been shown to be the case for the UGA-terminated product produced upon transfection of type 1 deiodinase cDNA in HEK cells (see below). To address this question, we examined the effects of adding protease or proteasome inhibitors to cells during in vivo 75Se labeling. We tested the calpain I-specific protease inhibitor, ALLN (Sigma), which stabilizes the type 1 deiodinase UGA-termination product. 3G. Warner, personal communication. Addition of either ALLN or a protease inhibitor mixture, CompleteTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), had no detectable effect on the patterns of selenoproteins either in the media or in cell lysates (not shown) from any of the three cell lines. Similarly, the proteasome uptake inhibitor, MG132, did not affect the selenoprotein patterns. As selenium may be limiting for expression of selenoprotein P, we examined the effects of supplementation of media with unlabeled selenium. Sodium selenite was added to a final concentration of 0, 10, 30, or 100 nm the day before transfection. The selenium concentration in the “0 added” condition is estimated at less than 1 nm. Thus, the increase in unlabeled selenium to 100 nm results in a >100-fold decrease in specific activity. Supplementation with 10, 30, or 100 mm selenium led to 1.2-, 3.6-, and 7.2-fold increases, respectively, in labeling intensityversus the unsupplemented lane (data not shown). Examination of the labeling intensity over this range revealed a progressive increase in incorporation of label into selenoprotein P despite the large decrease in specific activity, indicating a dramatic increase in selenoprotein P production. No apparent changes in the ratios of individual labeled bands were detected with the increase in selenium concentration. In addition, no detectable differences in cell growth or morphology were observed during the time course of the experiment. Previous studies have shown that rat selenoprotein P undergoes N-linked glycosylation in at least three of the five potential sites (27.Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine if some of the observed differences in migration patterns could be accounted for by differences in glycosylation, selenoprotein P preparations were treated with endoglycosidase F. A decrease in the apparent molecular weights of the selenium-labeled proteins from all three cell lines was observed, indicating that the protein is glycosylated in all three lines (Fig.3). The mobility of the HepG2 human protein decreased from an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 to ∼45 kDa and the recombinant rat protein from ∼57 to ∼45 kDa. The larger and smaller selenoprotein species from CHO cells (∼57 and ∼45 kDa) decreased to ∼38 and ∼26 kDa following endoglycosidase treatment, representing changes of ∼19 kDa. This latter change indicates that the two forms produced by CHO cells are probably glycosylated to a similar extent (Fig. 3, lane 3 versus 4). Although the majority of selenoprotein P was expected to be in the media, and no premature termination products or deglycosylated forms were detected in the cell lysate, some glycosylated selenoprotein P might be present in the cell lysate fraction, due to either association with the outer cell membrane or perhaps in intracellular compartments in the process of being secreted. Glycosylated selenoprotein P would be predicted to comigrate with other endogenous selenoproteins, making it difficult to detect. We might be able to reveal its presence by deglycosylation, thus increasing its mobility relative to the other endogenous selenoproteins. Lysates from HEK cells transfected with the selenoprotein P plasmid or empty vector were treated with endoglycosidase F and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in parallel with untreated lysates and treated and untreated media. Upon overexposure of the autoradiogram, a very faint band, corresponding in size to the major selenoprotein P band in endoglycosidase-treated media, was detected in the endoglycosidase-treated selenoprotein P-transfected lysate (data not shown). This band was not seen in the endoglycosidase-treated vector-transfected lysate. Thus, the only selenoprotein P-specific band detectable in cell lysates corresponds to full-length or near full-length protein. As previous studies have utilized nickel-agarose or zinc-Sepharose chromatography to purify selenoprotein P from serum, we wanted to determine if the recombinant selenoprotein exhibited similar chromatographic behavior. Media were harvested from HEK 293 cells following transfection of the rat selenoprotein P plasmid and75Se labeling. Media (Fig. 4,lane 1) were percolated through a bed of nickel-agarose resin, the flow-through fraction collected (lane 2), and the resin washed with buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl to elute nonspecifically bound proteins (Fig. 4, lanes 3–5). This was followed by washes in the same buffer containing 100, 200, or 400 mm imidazole to elute specifically bound protein (lanes 6–8). The majority of the labeled protein eluted in the 100 mm imid"
https://openalex.org/W1984429232,"The yeast mating pheromone a-factor precursor contains an N-terminal extension and a C-terminal CAAX motif within which multiple posttranslational processing events occur. A recently discovered component in a-factor processing is Ste24p/Afc1p, a multispanning endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that contains an HEXXH metalloprotease motif. Our in vivo genetic characterization of this protein has demonstrated roles for Ste24p in both the N-terminal and C-terminal proteolytic processing of the a-factor precursor. Here, we present evidence that the N-terminal proteolysis of the a-factor precursor P1 can be accurately reconstituted in vitro using yeast membranes. We show that this activity is dependent on Ste24p and is abolished by mutation of the Ste24p HEXXH metalloprotease motif or by mutation of the a-factor P1 substrate at a residue adjacent to the N-terminal P1 cleavage site. We also demonstrate that N-terminal proteolysis of the P1 a-factor precursor requires Zn2+ as a co-factor and can be inhibited by the addition of the metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-orthophenanthroline. Our results are consistent with Ste24p itself being the P1→P2 a-factor protease or a limiting activator of this activity. Interestingly, we also show that the humanSte24 homolog expressed in yeast can efficiently promote the N-terminal processing of a-factor in vivo and in vitro, thus establishing a-factor as a surrogate substrate in the absence of known human substrates. The results reported here, together with the previously reported in vitro reconstitution of Ste24p-dependent CAAX processing, provide a system for examining the potential bifunctional roles of yeast Ste24p and its homologs. The yeast mating pheromone a-factor precursor contains an N-terminal extension and a C-terminal CAAX motif within which multiple posttranslational processing events occur. A recently discovered component in a-factor processing is Ste24p/Afc1p, a multispanning endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that contains an HEXXH metalloprotease motif. Our in vivo genetic characterization of this protein has demonstrated roles for Ste24p in both the N-terminal and C-terminal proteolytic processing of the a-factor precursor. Here, we present evidence that the N-terminal proteolysis of the a-factor precursor P1 can be accurately reconstituted in vitro using yeast membranes. We show that this activity is dependent on Ste24p and is abolished by mutation of the Ste24p HEXXH metalloprotease motif or by mutation of the a-factor P1 substrate at a residue adjacent to the N-terminal P1 cleavage site. We also demonstrate that N-terminal proteolysis of the P1 a-factor precursor requires Zn2+ as a co-factor and can be inhibited by the addition of the metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-orthophenanthroline.

Surprisingly, the yeast mating pheromones do not share a common biosynthetic pathway even though the mature pheromones perform similar functions as secreted signaling molecules that stimulate cognate G-protein coupled receptors. The processing and export of α-factor involves translocation of its precursor into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1and subsequent transport of the precursor through the lumenal compartments of the classical secretory pathway, during which it is modified by resident processing enzymes of the ER, Golgi, andtrans-Golgi network (4.Julius D. Schekman R. Thorner J. Cell. 1984; 36: 309-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In contrast, the processing of thea-factor precursor appears to occur on the cytosolic face of the ER (and possibly other intracellular membranes), yielding a cytosolically disposed mature pheromone (5.Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The eventual export of the mature a-factor pheromone across the plasma membrane is accomplished by Ste6p, a dedicated transporter that is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters (3.Michaelis S. Chen P. Berkower C. Sapperstein S. Kistler A. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 61: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 6.Kuchler K. Sterne R.E. Thorner J.

Nature. 1989; 340: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar).The S. cerevisiae a-factor mating pheromone, redundantly encoded by the MFA1 and MFA2 genes, is initially synthesized as a primary precursor (P0) that contains an N-terminal extension and a C-terminal CAAX motif (C = cysteine, A = an aliphatic amino acid, andX = one of several amino acids) (Fig.1 A). The ultimate formation of mature a-factor (M) requires multiple modifications at both ends of the primary precursor (Fig. 1 B). The first set of modifications (isoprenylation, proteolytic removal of theAAX tripeptide, and carboxylmethylation) are directed by the C-terminal CAAX motif (8.Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 9.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). These C-terminal modifications are common to all proteins bearing a CAAX sequence (e.g. Ras, Gγ, and nuclear lamin precursors). Fora-factor, this processing yields an intermediatea-factor species (P1) that lacks the terminal three amino acids (VIA) and has a farnesylated and carboxylmethylated C-terminal cysteine. The P1 intermediate is then trimmed of its N-terminal extension in two sequential proteolytic steps, yielding first the P2 intermediate and finally mature a-factor (M) (3.Michaelis S. Chen P. Berkower C. Sapperstein S. Kistler A. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 61: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 10.Chen P. Sapperstein S. Choi J.D. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11.Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The initial N-terminal cleavage step (P1→P2) occurs between residues 7 (Thr) and 8 (Ala) of the a-factor precursor, and a subsequent cleavage step (P2→M) occurs between residues 21 (Asn) and 22 (Tyr) that removes the remainder of the extension. Thus, three distinct proteolytic processing events, one C-terminal and two N-terminal, are involved in a-factor maturation.Recent genetic studies have identified several components involved in the proteolytic processing of a-factor (Fig. 1 B). These include the Ste24p (also called Afc1p) and Rce1p proteins that are required for the C-terminal CAAX processing ofa-factor and other proteins bearing a CAAX motif (12.Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Ste24p and Rce1p appear to be partially redundant for this function (12.Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 13.Tam A. Nouvet F. Fujimura-Kamada K. Slunt H. Sisodia S.S. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). An unanticipated finding was that Ste24p has a second distinct role in a-factor processing; namely, it also is required for the first N-terminal cleavage (P1→P2) event ofa-factor biogenesis (11.Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The dual roles of Ste24p in promoting N- and C-terminal processing are notable given that these cleavage sites are spatially separated and have little sequence similarity (Fig. 1 A). Finally, the Axl1p and Ste23p proteins were shown to have some partial overlapping function for the final N-terminal cleavage event (P2→M) that yields maturea-factor (14.Adames N. Blundell K. Ashby M.N. Boone C. Science. 1995; 270: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Further analysis of the a-factor proteolytic processing components revealed that Ste24p and Rce1p are ER-localized membrane spanning proteins (5.Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The localization of Axl1p and Ste23p has not been reported. Additionally, Ste24p, Axl1p, and Ste23p, but not Rce1p, possess consensus metalloprotease motifs that are conserved among many zinc-dependent metalloproteases (e.g.HEXXH or HXXEH). Not surprisingly, point mutations of the Ste24p metalloprotease motif (HEXXH) resulted in defective CAAX and N-terminal processing ofa-factor precursors (11.Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12.Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Thus, the components genetically identified as being required for the proteolytic processing of a-factor may act directly on a-factor precursors as proteases, or alternatively could activate as yet unidentified downstream acting proteases. The CAAXproteolytic activities dependent on Ste24p and Rce1p were recently reconstituted in vitro using crude yeast membranes (12.Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Whereas membranes containing either Ste24p or Rce1p promoted the CAAX proteolysis of a particular farnesylated peptide substrate, only Rce1p-containing membranes could promote the CAAX proteolysis of yeast Ras2p. The Ste24p-dependent N-terminal proteolytic activity was not examined in this study.In addition to its role in CAAX proteolysis, Ste24p is likely to act directly or indirectly as a protease in the first N-terminal cleavage of the a-factor precursor, but this has not yet been examined by direct in vitro studies (11.Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the aim of this study was to reconstitute an in vitro system that could be used to examine the role of Ste24p in the N-terminal processing (P1→P2) of a-factor. This would enable us to gain further insight into the role of Ste24p and to initiate a characterization of the biochemical properties of the N-terminal processing activity. Here, we have faithfully reconstitutedin vitro the N-terminal proteolysis of the P1a-factor precursor using yeast membranes as the source of Ste24p and the P1 a-factor precursor. We demonstrate biochemically that this activity requires Ste24p and a metal co-factor and that the cleavage event displays substrate specificity. Finally, we show in vivo and in vitro that the human homolog of Ste24p can properly direct the N-terminal processing of the yeasta-factor precursor.

In all cases, the activity of bPL, oPL, or caprine PL was equal or similar to that of oGH or bGH and in the case of hGH receptors, also to hGH. These experiments were paralleled by protein-interaction studies that showed that oPL and bPL, similar to hGH, are capable of forming 1:2 complex with human and rabbit GHR-ECDs (9.Sakal E. Bignon C. Grosclaude J. Kantor A. Shapira R. Leibovitch H. Helman D. Nespoulous C. Shamay A. Rowlinson S.W. Djiane J. Gertler A. J.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mechanism of oPL (and other ruminant PLs) action in homologous systems is, however, less clear. It has been suggested that PLs act as a unique fetal GH, based on findings that ovine fetus responds to ovine or human PL. This response includes stimulation of glycogen synthesis, amino acid transport, cellular proliferation, and insulin-like growth factor-I synthesis. These biological effects in the fetus are only slightly, if at all affected by ovine or human GHs or oPRL, suggesting that oPL may have specific effects (for review see Ref. 2.Anthony R.V. Liang R. Kayl E.P. Pratt S.L. J. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. 1995; 49: 83-95PubMed Google Scholar). The way in which oPL signal is initiated remains, however, unknown. It has been suggested that the physiological effects of native oPL in the fetus are mediated through binding to specific PLRs receptors that have low affinities for oGH (20.Freemark M. Handwerger S. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The K d for oPL was 0.5 nm, whereas the respective K d values for oGH and oPRL were approximately 50- and 500-fold higher. However, despite many efforts, these unique receptors have been neither cloned nor identified. The previously reported, partially purified unique oPL receptor (21.Freemark M. Comer M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) turned out to be an artifact. 2A. Gertler and M. Freemark, unpublished data. Experiments executed in homologous mammary gland explants or acini cultures documented that oPL mimics the action of oPRL (9.Sakal E. Bignon C. Grosclaude J. Kantor A. Shapira R. Leibovitch H. Helman D. Nespoulous C. Shamay A. Rowlinson S.W. Djiane J. Gertler A. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, we tested the possibility that ruminant PLs transduce their activity through homologous GHRs as well, by comparing their activity in 293-HEK cells transiently transfected with homologous and heterologous GHRs. All three ruminant PLs acted as agonists in several heterologous bioassays (in cells with human or rodent GHRs), whereas in homologous bioassays, in cells transfected with oGHRs, they were not active and even antagonized oGH activity (22.Herman A. Helman D. Livnah O. Gertler A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7631-7639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite this difference, oGH and PLs bound with similar affinity to the oGHR extracellular domain (ECD), indicating that the binding occurs through site 1 of the hormone. Gel filtration of oPL·oGHR-ECD complex showed a 1:1 stoichiometry, as shown previously for the interaction of bPL and bGHR-ECD (23.Staten N.R. Byatt J.C. Krivi G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18467-18473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposed that the difference between heterologous and homologous systems originates from the fact that in the latter, ruminant PLs antagonize the activity of oGH because they do not homodimerize oGHRs, whereas in the former they do and thus act as agonists. In view of these findings, we speculated that ruminant PLs may initiate their signaling in four possible ways: (a) transducing the signal through homologous PRLRs; (b) heterodimerizing homologous GHR through site 1 and PRLR through site 2; (c) activating a unique as yet unidentified PLR; and (d) activating an as yet unknown variant of GHR, mutated in its ECD such that dimerization of GHR is allowed (22.Herman A. Helman D. Livnah O. Gertler A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7631-7639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

Recombinant oPL, oPL T185F, oPL G130R, bPL, bPL G133R, bPL K73F, and nonglycosylated recombinant oGHR-ECD and bPRLR-ECDs were prepared as described previously (9.Sakal E. Bignon C. Grosclaude J.

Plasmids encoding full size oGHR and oPRLR in pcDNA3 expression vectors (Invitrogene Co., Leek, The Netherlands), were constructed as described previously (22.Herman A. Helman D. Livnah O. Gertler A.

Molecular-weight markers for SDS-PAGE, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F12 medium, bovine serum albumin (RIA grade) were obtained from Sigma. SDS-PAGE reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Fetal calf serum was purchased from Labotal Co. (Jerusalem, Israel), LipofectAMINE was from (Life Technologies, Inc.). A SuperdexTM75 HR 10/30 column and SPR reagents including CM5 sensor chips, Hepes-buffered saline,N-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, 2(2-pyridinyldithio)ethanamine hydrochloride, and ethanolamine hydrochloride were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. High pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration chromatography on a SuperdexTM75 HR 10/30 column was performed with 200-μl aliquots of complexes between the soluble recombinant oGHR-ECD, bPRLR-ECD, and oPL using previously described methods (9.Sakal E.

For of preparative chromatography, 600-μl aliquots of preformed complex (the concentration of each component was roughly 27-μm) were injected, and 640-μl samples were collected for electrophoretic analysis. The molecular mass of the complexes was estimated by using several marker proteins with known molecular mass and semi-logarithmic plotting of the molecular mass as a function of retention time. Several consecutive injections of the same markers indicated that the variability of the retention times is not larger than 2–3%. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) in a 15% gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. The hormone was covalently linked according to Johnsson et al.(28.Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar) with few modifications (29.Gertler A. Grosclaude J. Strasburger C.J. Nir S. Djiane J. J. Biol.

Briefly, after activation with 0.05m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide in Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 7–8 min, oPL was injected at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.4), yielding 2,750 RU of immobilized oPL. Nonreacted sites were blocked with an 8-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride at pH 8.5, and binding capacity was checked by repeated injections of 5 m rabbit PRLR-ECD (26.Bignon C. Sakal E. Belair L. Chapnik-Cohen N. Djiane J. Gertler A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3318-3324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in Hepes-buffered saline. Regeneration was performed by a 1-min injection of 5m guanidine-HCl. All experiments were performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min in Hepes-buffered saline at 25 °C. Once the oPL was covalently immobilized through amino-group coupling, each R-ECD was injected for 6 min and then washed out for 10 min prior to regeneration. BIAcore incorporated software (BIA Evaluation and BIA Simulation) allowed us to: (a) fit experimental curves to 1:1 or 1:2 dissociation models and calculate the probabilities of each being the most accurate representation of reality and (b) calculatek off constants with standard deviations. The bioassays were carried out in 293 cells as described previously (30.Tchelet A. Vogel T. Helman D. Guy R. Nespoulous C. Goffin V. Djiane J. Gertler A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 130: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293-HEK cells were seeded in six-well plates in rich medium. After 4–8 h, the cells were transfected with oPRLR-pcDNA3, alone or in combination with oGHR-pcDNA3. The total amount of DNA was equalized using pcDNA3 plasmid without insert. In parallel, cells were transfected with LHRE-TK-luc, a plasmid bearing six repeats of the rat β-casein STAT5-responsive sequence upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene (31.Sotiropoulos A.

Transfection was carried out using the calcium-phosphate procedure described elsewhere (32.Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After 24 h, the cells were transferred to serum-free medium, hormonal treatment was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 18 h. Enzymatic activity was measured as described elsewhere (31.Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol.

The results were expressed as fold induction, and the ratio of stimulated to nonstimulated cells after luciferase activity was normalized by correcting for β-galactosidase activity, to take into account the transfection efficiency. Four chimeric constructs were prepared: the ECD of the α or β subunit of the hGM-CSF receptor (hGM-CSFR-α ECD, hGM-CSFR-β ECD) was fused to the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the long form oPRL (oPRLR) or growth hormone (oGHR) receptor. The four DNA fragments were obtained by polymerase chain reaction with the following primers and templates: GGG CCC CTG CAG ATG CTT CTC CTG GTA ACA AGC (5′ primer), GAA TTC AAG CTT CTC GAG CCC GTC GTC AGA ACC AAA TTC (3′ primer), and the hGM-CSFR-α cDNA (35.Anders R.A.

Sequencing confirmed the absence of misincorporation by Taq polymerase. After digestion by HindIII and XhoI (ECD) orXhoI and XbaI (TMI), each ECD was ligated to each TMI in the presence of HindIII/XbaI-digested eucaryotic expression vector pECE (39.Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). This resulted in four chimeric constructs: hGM-CSFR-α-l-oPRLR-pECE (α-PRLR), hGM-CSFR-β-l-oPRLR-pECE (β-PRLR), hGM-CSFR-α-oGHR-pECE (α-GHR), and hGM-CSFR-β-oGHR-pECE (β-GHR). The β-galactosidase and luciferase assays have been described previously (Refs. 34.Bignon C. Daniel N. Djiane J. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 243-246PubMed Google Scholar and 31.Sotiropoulos A.

Briefly, CHO-K1 cells were seeded in four 60-mm dishes in rich medium. The next day, the cells were starved for 16 h by incubation in GC3 medium. On the third day, the cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE with pCH110 along with LHRE-TK-luc, and with one or two of the four afore described chimera constructs. Transfected cells were subsequently incubated for 24 h in the presence (two plates) or absence (two plates) of 100 ng/ml hGM-CSF in GC3 medium. The plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the enzymatic activity was determined as described previously (31.Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C.

BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 243-246PubMed Google Scholar). The results were expressed as fold induction, after the luciferase activity was normalized by correcting for β-galactosidase activity, as explained earlier. Recombinant bPRLR-ECD was chosen because this protein is almost identical (94.5% identity and 96% similarity) to oPRLR-ECD and both ovine and bovine full-size PRLRs gave identical biological response to both bPL and oPL. 3D. Helman, A. Herman, and A. Gertler, unpublished data. The interaction of oPL with bPRLR-ECD and oGHR-ECD was studied by two independent methods, namely, gel filtration and SPR in a Biacore apparatus. Gel filtration revealed that oPL forms only 1:1 complex with each ECD even at 2:1 (Fig. 1, D and E) excesses of the respective R-ECDs. However, when oPL, oGHR-ECD, and bPRLR-ECD were mixed in almost equal molar ratios, a complex with a higher molecular mass, corresponding to a heterodimeric complex along with a small excess of oPRLR-ECD, was observed (Fig. 1 F). This complex was quite stable at μm concentrations (Fig.2, A and B) but upon progressive dilution to nm concentrations underwent partial (Fig. 2 C) or full (Fig. 2 D) dissociation. The order of addition, or preincubation of oPL with one of the ECDs prior to addition of the other, had no effect on the gel filtration profile (not shown). The protein peak corresponding to this complex was isolated (Fig. 3, bars 6–8) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As judged by the intensity of the bands stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3, inset), it consists of three components: oPL, oGHR-ECD, and bPRLR-ECD, in almost equal quantities. As shown by SDS-PAGE, the small peak with the lower molecular mass (Fig. 3, bar 10) was indeed bPRLR-ECD, as predicted. No complex was formed by incubation of oGHR-ECD and PRLR-ECD in the absence of oPL (not shown).Figure 2A, gel filtration of 1:1:1 complex of oPL·oGHR-ECD·bPRLR-ECD preformed by incubation of all three components at concentrations of 27 μm.

The protein concentration was determined manually by reading at 280 nm. For calculation of the molecular mass the column was calibrated with bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), egg albumin (45 kDa), extracellular domain of hGH receptor (28 kDa), and ovine placental lactogen (23 kDa).

First, binding capacity was checked with rabbit PRLR-ECD revealing the immobilization of active 2,750 RU of oPL. Then 1 μm solutions of either oGHR-ECD or bPRLR-ECD were injected for 20 min, followed by flushing with buffer for another 20 min (Fig. 4 A). The dissociation of each R-ECD was analyzed with Bioevaluation (BIA) Software. In the case of oGHR-ECD, which at that concentration failed to bind over 2,700 RU (stoichiometry, 1:1), the dissociation kinetics clearly showed a good fit to a one-site interaction model, and the calculated k off value (mean ± S.D.,n = 3) was 3.4 ± 0.30 × 10−4min−1. In contrast, although bPRLR reached a maximum of about 2,200 RU, the dissociation kinetics was indicative of a two-site interaction model with loose binding at each site, which, as shown by us previously is characteristic of homologous interaction with PRLRs (18.Helman D.

We concluded therefore that in the first case (oGHR-ECD), the homodimer is not conspicuous in the gel filtration profile (Fig. 1 D) because it is not assembled, whereas the bPRLR-ECD homodimer is too unstable to be observed (Fig. 1 E).

In unstimulated RBL-2H3 cells, okadaic acid pretreatment inhibited PP2A activity in both cytosol and membrane fractions, but inhibition of secretion correlated with inhibition of membrane-bound rather than cytosolic PP2A activity. Okadaic acid had very little effect on PP1 activity. Stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells by antigen led to the activity and amount of PP2A in the membrane fraction increasing nearly 2-fold. In contrast, there was little change in the activity or distribution of PP1. Importantly, the translocation of PP2A was transient, coinciding with or marginally preceding the peak rate of secretion, suggesting a link between PP2A translocation, activity, and secretion. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus the calcium ionophore A23187 induced a slower, prolonged rate of secretion that coincided with a similarly protracted translocation of PP2A to the membrane fraction. PP2A translocation is not the only event required for secretion as translocation was also induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, without resulting in secretion. These results indicate that increased protein dephosphorylation in the membrane fraction mediated by PP2A is required for mast cell secretion. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a signal-mediated, rapid, transient translocation and activation of PP2A in membranes in any system.

These results indicate that increased protein dephosphorylation in the membrane fraction mediated by PP2A is required for mast cell secretion. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a signal-mediated, rapid, transient translocation and activation of PP2A in membranes in any system. protein kinase C protein phosphatase type 1 or type 2A rat basophilic leukemia cell line, subclone 2H3 phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 1,4-piperazinediethane-sulphonic acid dinitrophenol bovine serum albumin antigen containing 24 molecules of dinitrophenol conjugated with 1 molecule of bovine serum albumin Binding of an antigen to receptor-associated IgE on mast cells initiates a well characterized sequence of initial intracellular signals. In general terms, the early events that follow receptor aggregation are increased tyrosine kinase activity, rapid hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and elevation of intracellular calcium, translocation of protein kinase C (PKC)1 to the plasma membrane, and phosphorylation of a diverse range of proteins (1.Beaven M.A. Metzger H.

Immunol. 1996; 8: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The culmination of these signals, which occurs over a period of seconds to minutes, is the release of inflammatory mediators (3.Schulman E.S. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 13: 35-70PubMed Google Scholar). Agents that bypass the IgE receptor can also activate mast cells. The calcium ionophore A23187 (which directly increases intracellular Ca2+) induces some secretion from these cells, which, in the added presence of the phorbol ester PMA (which activates PKC), reaches a level of secretion equivalent to that produced by antigen (4.Cunha-Melo J.R.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 5130-5138PubMed Google Scholar). Much of the current information about intracellular signaling in mast cells has come from the rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3, which is homologous to mucosal mast cells (6.Seldin D.C.

Recent work in RBL-2H3 cells as well as rat peritoneal mast cells and human lung mast cells has implicated serine/threonine protein phosphatases in the regulation of the secretory process (7.Botana L.M.

Int. 1998; 22: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the reversible covalent modification of proteins by phosphorylation in response to external signals is a dynamic process involving the regulation of both protein kinases and protein phosphatases, precise details of how phosphatases regulate function in any cell system remain unknown (12.Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 13.Brautigan D.L. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The phosphatases are separated into four major groups, protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1), PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), and PP2C. PP1 and PP2A are the major intracellular phosphatases, which together account for >90% of all serine/threonine dephosphorylation reactions (14.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 15.Cohen P. Cohen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21435-21438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A are ubiquitously distributed and highly conserved, the native forms are complexes of multiple subunits (12.Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 14.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 16.Sim A.T. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Specificity of phosphatase action is believed to be determined by additional regulatory subunits within the native complex that target the phosphatases to different subcellular locations and modify the substrate specificity of the catalytic subunits (15.Cohen P. Cohen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21435-21438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A regulatory role for PP1 and/or PP2A in intracellular processes has been implied by the use of two specific inhibitors, okadaic acid and calyculin A. In vitro, okadaic acid blocks both PP1 and PP2A activity at 0.1–10 nm concentrations, although it is 10-fold more effective against PP2A in any one example (14.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 18.Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G.

Okadaic acid has little or no effect on PP2B or PP2C. Calyculin Ain vitro is equipotent against PP1 and PP2A at 0.1–1 nm concentrations (20.Ishihara H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), but for both these inhibitors, higher concentrations than those required in vitro are required to see effects in intact cells (19.Hardie D.G. Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, inhibits granule-bound mediator release from mast cells (8.Peachell P.T. Munday M.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3808-3816PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Estevez M.D. Vieytes M.R. Louzao M.C. Botana L.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10.Kitani S.

Cox S.E. Munday M.R. Peachell P.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Calyculin A has a similar effect but acts much faster than okadaic acid in RBL-2H3 cells, and there are differences in the concentrations required for inhibition of secretion in RBL-2H3 cells (11.Ludowyke R.I. Warton K. Scurr L.L. Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and human lung mast cells (8.Peachell P.T. Munday M.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3808-3816PubMed Google Scholar). However, because of the high concentrations of PP1 and PP2A inside cells, it has been difficult to use these inhibitors to readily distinguish between the actions of these two phosphatases in intact systems. Therefore whereas these inhibitors imply a modulatory role for PP1 and/or PP2A in the secretory process (22.Peirce M.J. Cox S.E. Munday M.R. Peachell P.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the specific phosphatase involved or the mechanism of action remains unresolved in mast cells or indeed in any secretory system. The aim of this study was to investigate the activity and distribution of PP1 and PP2A in mast cells, within the context of possible modulation by the stimulation of secretion. We show that whereas the activity and subcellular location of PP1 remains unchanged in response to both IgE-dependent and -independent secretagogues, PP2A undergoes a number of distinct changes. Specifically, in response to secretagogues, there is a transient translocation and activation of PP2A in the membrane fraction, which correlates directly with the peak rate of secretion. Strikingly, as the rate of secretion diminishes so too does the membrane association of PP2A. Furthermore, okadaic acid inhibits membrane and cytosolic PP2A activity without any effect on PP1. This work establishes PP2A as the prime phosphatase involved in the mast cell secretory process and introduces a new model system with which to investigate protein phosphatase regulatory mechanisms within a functional context. Tissue culture supplies were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. except for the fetal calf serum which was obtained from CSL Limited (Parkville, VIC, Australia). Maintenance of monolayer cultures of RBL-2H3 cells was in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum and carried out as described previously (4.Cunha-Melo J.R. Gonzaga H.M. Ali H. Huang F.L. Huang K.P.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12492-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1.5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well culture dishes were washed and activated at 37 °C in a buffer consisting of 119 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm dextrose, and 0.4 mm MgCl2 with 25 mm PIPES (pH 7.2). The buffer was supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 1 mm CaCl2 prior to use. For antigen activation, cells were primed overnight with 75 ng/ml DNP-specific IgE (Sigma) and activated with the specific antigen DNP24-BSA (24 molecules of DNP conjugated with one molecule of BSA, hereafter referred to as DNP-BSA) at 100 ng/ml, which was optimal for secretion. The antigen was obtained from two sources. One was a kind gift of Dr. Henry Metzger, NIAMS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, and the second was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Both sources gave the same results in terms of rate and extent of secretion (data not shown). Where required, cells were activated with 50 nm PMA, 1000 nm calcium ionophore A23187, or the combination of 50 nm PMA and 500 nm A23187 (both from Sigma). Control samples were incubated with buffer alone. After the designated time, the reaction was stopped by placing the samples on ice; the supernatant was removed, and an aliquot was taken for assay of the release of β-hexosaminidase. The total cellular content of β-hexosaminidase was determined following lysis of unstimulated cultures, and the activated release was expressed as a percentage of total. The amount of β-hexosaminidase released was assayed using an absorbance assay withp-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamide (from Sigma) as the substrate (24.Lloyd H.G. Ross L. Li K.M. Ludowyke R.I. Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 11: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When phosphatase inhibitors were required, okadaic acid (potassium salt; Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was dissolved in buffer and calyculin A (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final buffer concentration of Me2SO was no more than 0.2%, which was added to control cells and had no noticeable effects (11.Ludowyke R.I. Warton K. Scurr L.L. Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated with the phosphatase inhibitors in activation buffer containing 4 mm glutamine at 37 °C for the designated times. Washing the cells free of excess inhibitors had no effect on the inhibitory capacity. After activation and removal of the supernatant as above, 0.3 ml of an ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) was added, and the cells were scraped immediately into ultracentrifuge tubes. They were then sonicated (Branson Sonifier, 20% duty cycle, power 2) for 4 × 20 s intervals. The cytosolic fraction was then obtained following centrifugation at 170,000 × gfor 23 min (5.Ludowyke R.I. Scurr L.L. McNally C.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5130-5138PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended, sonicated (2 times as above), and centrifuged as above to give the final membrane fraction, which was resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer. Aliquots of the cytosol and membrane fractions were removed to assay for protein content using the bicinchoninic acid system (Pierce). Proteins (15–25 μg/well for cytosol and 20–30 μg/well for membrane) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, then separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 400 mA for 2 h. The membranes were washed, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% w/v skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline. The membranes were incubated for 90 min with the primary antibodies (polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides derived from the C termini of the catalytic subunits of PP1 or PP2A (25.Sim A.T. Collins E. Mudge L.M. Rostas J.A. Neurochem. Res. 1998; 23: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) and 60 min with the secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Westgrove, PA). The level of PP1 and PP2A catalytic subunits in each fraction was determined using an Enhanced Chemiluminescent detection kit (NEN Life Sciences Products) following the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of each subunit present was quantified by scanning the bands on the Kodak x-ray film with a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) laser densitometer. The activity of PP1 and PP2A in cytosol and membrane fractions was determined by measuring the release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble 32P from32P-labeled glycogen phosphorylase (26.Collins E. Sim A.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 79-102PubMed Google Scholar). Activity was measured at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and PP2A activity was defined as the activity inhibited by 2 nm okadaic acid. Assays were carried out in triplicate, and reactions were restricted to <20% dephosphorylation to ensure linearity. Initial characterization of phosphatase activity in unstimulated RBL-2H3 cells was carried out using32P-labeled phosphorylase as substrate. The total cellular activity of PP1 measured using this standard substrate was over 3-fold greater than that of PP2A (0.61 versus 0.19 units; TableI). Furthermore, whereas 30% of the total PP1 activity was recovered in the membrane fraction, only 10% of the total PP2A activity was recovered from this fraction. This differential between cytosol and membrane fractions correlated well with Western immunoblot analysis using antisera to the catalytic subunits, which showed that 32.6% of the total PP1 and 6.8% of the total PP2A was membrane-associated (Table I).Table IProtein phosphatase PP1 and PP2A activity and distribution in the cytosol and membrane fractions of unstimulated RBL-2H3 cellsEnzymeCytosolMembraneTotal protein recovered (mg)0.32 ± 0.010.17 ± 0.01Protein phosphatase activityPP11.36 ± 0.091.04 ± 0.08 (units/mg)PP2A0.52 ± 0.050.13 ± 0.02Total phosphatase activityPP10.43 ± 0.020.18 ± 0.01 (units)PP2A0.17 ± 0.010.02 ± 0.00Total phosphatase enzymePP167.4 ± 5.632.6 ± 5.6 (%)PP2A93.2 ± 1.06.8 ± 1.0Adherent monolayers of RBL-2H3 cells were lysed, and cytosol and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of each fraction containing equivalent protein concentrations were then assayed for PP1 and PP2A activity using 32P-labeled glycogen phosphorylase as anin vitro substrate.

In RBL-2H3 cells, our previous work has shown that the phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A and okadaic acid inhibit secretion in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (11.Ludowyke R.I. Warton K. Scurr L.L. Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To investigate the selective effects of these inhibitors on secretion, we measured the inhibition of both membrane and cytosol phosphatase activities and compared this with the degree of inhibition of secretion. After 15 min with 5 nm calyculin A, the cytosol and membrane activity of both PP1 and PP2A were equally inhibited (Fig.1). The results are expressed relative to the activity in unstimulated cells that had not been incubated with calyculin A. Calyculin A inhibited PP2A activity slightly more than PP1, and this degree of inhibition was parallel to the inhibition of secretion of 70%. When similar experiments were carried out with okadaic acid, a more dramatic differentiation between the inhibition of PP1 and PP2A was demonstrated (Fig. 2). The addition of 1 μm okadaic acid to RBL-2H3 cells led to a time-dependent inhibition of the basal activity of PP2A in both the cytosol and membrane fractions with a much more rapid inhibition of PP2A in the cytosol fraction (Fig. 2 A). Importantly, however, at the same time points, okadaic acid had no effect on the membrane or cytosolic activity of PP1 (Fig.2 B). It can be seen in Fig. 2 A that the degree of inhibition of β-hexosaminidase release after 15 min with okadaic acid (stippled bar) is very similar to the degree of inhibition of membrane PP2A activity (Fig. 2 A, solid bar). At this time point cytosolic PP2A activity is already 90% inhibited, arguing that its activity is not as important in the secretory process. These findings indicate that the inhibition of secretion caused by 1 μm okadaic acid pretreatment is mediated only through inhibition of PP2A and not PP1 and that okadaic acid, in these cells, is a better differential inhibitor of PP2A intracellularly as well asin vitro.Figure 2Inhibition by okadaic acid of PP2A activity and antigen stimulated secretion. Adherent monolayers of RBL-2H3 cells that had been incubated overnight with specific IgE were incubated in the presence of 1 μm okadaic acid for 15 or 40 min. One group of cells was then lysed, cytosol and membrane fractions were separated, and PP1 and PP2A activity was determined as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” A parallel group of cells was activated by the addition of 100 ng/ml DNP-BSA for 20 min after which the supernatant was removed to measure the release of β-hexosaminidase. For the best comparison between PP1 and PP2A in each fraction, the activities are expressed relative to the levels found in unstimulated cells that had not been incubated with okadaic acid (Control). The release data are presented as relative to the levels released by cells activated by DNP-BSA without okadaic acid (OA) pretreatment (Control, 40.4 ± 6.6).

Results are mean and S.E. of three experiments at 15 min and two at 40 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the role of PP2A in secretion, RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated for specific times by the addition of the antigen, DNP-BSA, and analyzed for the release of β-hexosaminidase and the activity and distribution of PP1 and PP2A in cytosol and membrane fractions. Within 2.5 min of stimulation there was an approximately 2-fold increase in both the activity (Fig.3 A) and concentration (Fig.3 B) of PP2A in the membrane fraction. Strikingly, the increase in both the membrane activity and level of PP2A was transient, having decreased by 5 min. By 10 min, the activity and levels of PP2A were actually below those seen in unstimulated cells. Stimulation by antigen had no effect on the activity of PP1, in either the cytosol or membrane fractions (Fig. 3 C), and throughout the time course there was no change seen in the distribution of PP1 in these fractions (data not shown). Notably, the transient increase in both the level and activity of PP2A in the membrane fraction appeared to correlate with the rate of antigen-induced β-hexosaminidase release that peaks around 2.5 min after stimulation (Fig. 4). To investigate this correlation more closely, we examined the levels of PP1 and PP2A in the membrane fraction using further time points around the peak rate of secretion. The results revealed that as the level of secretion increased to a peak, so too did the level of PP2A in the membrane fraction. Similarly, as the rate of secretion diminished, so too did the level of membrane-associated PP2A (Fig.5). Over the same time course there was no consistent change in the amount of PP1 in the membrane fraction. It was of interest to determine if PP2A translocation and activation was directly linked to IgE-receptor activation or mediated by other downstream signaling events involved in secretion. Although the PKC activator PMA and calcium ionophore A23187 together induce a similar level of β-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells as antigen (data not shown), the stimulation mechanism bypasses the aggregation of the IgE receptor and subsequent activation of many of the earliest signaling pathways (4.Cunha-Melo J.R. Gonzaga H.M. Ali H. Huang F.L. Huang K.P. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2617-2625PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ludowyke R.I. Scurr L.L. McNally C.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5130-5138PubMed Google Scholar, 30.White K.N. Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 942-947PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4, the time course of antigen-induced β-hexosaminidase release differs from that induced by PMA plus A23187. Whereas the peak rate of antigen-induced release is between 2–3 min after stimulation, PMA plus A23187-induced release has a slower onset with a more prolonged peak rate between 4–6 min after stimulation. Importantly, we determined that this different rate of β-hexosaminidase release closely paralleled the rate of translocation of PP2A to the membrane fraction. The addition of PMA plus A23187 to RBL-2H3 cells induces translocation of PP2A to the membrane fraction but with a longer lag time before translocation begins and with a slower rate than observed with antigen (Fig. 6). The peak of translocation is obtained by 6 min, and the return to the cytosol is also more protracted than that observed with antigen (Fig. 5). At these time points there was a small but consistent reciprocal decrease seen in the level of PP2A in the cytosol fraction. The change in activity of PP2A in the membrane fraction also follows this extended time course (Fig.6 C). The translocation of PP2A once again coincides or actually slightly precedes the peak rate of secretion (Fig.6 B), suggesting that the two events are mechanistically linked. Once again these changes were specific to PP2A, there being no change in the level or activity of PP1 in the cytosol or membrane fractions under the same conditions (data not shown). The addition of PMA alone to RBL-2H3 cells does not induce β-hexosaminidase release, yet it mimics many of the other changes induced by both antigen and A23187. The cells spread out on the substratum and actomyosin containing plaques, ruffles, and filaments are formed (27.Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 270-279PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Ludowyke R.I. Kawasugi K. French P.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 29: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as well as focal adhesions containing vinculin and talin (29.Kawasugi K. French P.W. Penny R. Ludowyke R.I. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PMA also leads to the translocation of PKC isozymes to the membrane fraction and the phosphorylation of myosin (4.Cunha-Melo J.R. Gonzaga H.M. Ali H. Huang F.L. Huang K.P. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2617-2625PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ludowyke R.I. Scurr L.L. McNally C.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5130-5138PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S.

We therefore examined the effect of PMA on the distribution and activity of PP2A. The addition of PMA to RBL-2H3 cells induced the translocation of PP2A to the membrane fraction in a similar time frame to that observed for PMA in the presence of A23187, with a peak at 6 min (Fig.7 A). This translocation occurred with a reciprocal decrease in the level of PP2A in the cytosol fraction (Fig. 7 A). Surprisingly, however, there was no increase in the level of PP2A activity in the membrane fraction, indeed PP2A activity decreased with the minimum activity being measured at 6 min (Fig. 7 B). This decrease in the basal level of PP2A activity was also transient as the activity increased again as the level of PP2A associated with the membrane fraction diminished. During the same time frame, PMA had little effect on the activity of PP1 in the cytosol or membrane fractions (Fig. 7 C). These intriguing results lead to the proposal that translocation of PP2A to the membrane fraction is necessary but not sufficient to induce secretion and that secretion requires induction of membrane-associated PP2A activity. Previous studies have described the inhibition of mast cell secretion by okadaic acid, implying that PP1 and/or PP2A are essential components of the mast cell intracellular secretory pathway (8.Peachell P.T. Munday M.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3808-3816PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Estevez M.D. Vieytes M.R. Louzao M.C. Botana L.M. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown, for the first time in mast cells, that okadaic acid inhibition of secretion correlates with the inhibition of membrane-bound rather than cytosolic PP2A activity. On the other hand, PP1 activity in either fraction was unaffected by okadaic acid under the conditions used, showing it does not contribute to these events of the secretory process. Furthermore, we have shown that stimulation of secretion through the IgE receptor (antigen) or by bypassing the receptor (PMA plus A23187) leads to the translocation of PP2A to the membrane fraction with a concomitant increase in measured PP2A activity. Moreover, the increased activity and level of PP2A in the membrane fraction is transient, with a time course that closely matches the rate of release of granule-bound mediators. In contrast, activation of mast cells does not alter PP1 activity or distribution. These results lead to the proposal that increased protein dephosphorylation in the membrane fraction mediated by PP2A is required for mast cell secretion. The low concentration and activity of PP2A measured in the membrane fraction of unstimulated RBL-2H3 cells when compared with the cytosol fraction, is similar to the level of activity and concentration found in membranes of most cells including muscle, hepatocytes (31.Mukhopadhyay S. Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30039-30045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and adipocytes (32.Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 709-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The exception to this rule is neuronal cells, which have a significant proportion of reversibly inactivated membrane-bound PP2A (33.Sim A.T. Ratcliffe E. Mumby M.C. Villa-Moruzzi E. Rostas J.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In RBL-2H3 cells, we have demonstrated that the time course of the translocation of PP2A to the membrane fraction and the increase in activity correlate closely with the rate of secretion. This correlation is observed in the fast rate of translocation in response to antigen and the slower, more prolonged response to PMA plus A23187. Consistent with this observation, individual batches of RBL-2H3 cells that have earlier peaks of secretion also showed a more rapid translocation of PP2A (data not shown). Other findings confirm this correlation. Pretreatment with okadaic acid for 15 min almost completely inhibits PP2A activity in the cytosol fraction, whereas the membrane-associated activity is only inhibited by about 50%, which is the same degree by which β-hexosaminidase release is inhibited. Our present results therefore indicate that the level of inhibition of secretion by okadaic acid appears to correlate best with the level of PP2A activity in the membrane and not the cytosol fractions. Importantly, although calyculin A inhibits PP1 and PP2A in vitro, it has sometimes been described as a specific inhibitor of PP1 (34.Revan S. Montesinos M.C. Naime D. Landau S. Cronstein B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17114-17118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that calyculin A added to intact cells to inhibit secretion inhibited PP1 and PP2A activity to the same extent in both membrane and cytosol fractions. Stimulated changes in PP1 and PP2A activity have been described in other cell types but with quite different outcomes to that which we have observed for PP2A in RBL-2H3 cells. Insulin stimulation of rat skeletal muscle cells leads to increased PP1 activity that is accompanied by a corresponding inhibition of PP2A activity (35.Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Begum N. Ragolia L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31166-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-2 stimulation of human CD4+ T cell lines results in a decrease in the activity of both PP1 and PP2A (37.Brockdorff J. Nielsen M. Dobson P. Geisler C. Ropke C. Svejgaard A. Odum N. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and adenosine A2 receptor stimulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes results in an increased PP1 activity in a crude membrane fraction but without any increased translocation of PP1 to that fraction (34.Revan S. Montesinos M.C. Naime D. Landau S. Cronstein B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17114-17118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our present observations argue strongly in favor of a mechanistic link between translocation and activation of membrane-associated PP2A and secretion. Our experiments with PMA alone support this activation hypothesis. In the absence of calcium, PMA alone induces the translocation of PP2A to the membrane fraction but does not induce secretion. Under these circumstances, the activity of PP2A in the membrane fraction was reduced. With the addition of A23187, membrane PP2A activity is increased and secretion ensues. It is likely that some of the PP2A resident in the membrane fraction before stimulation also contributes to the secretory response, because, following the peak rate of secretion induced by either antigen or PMA plus A23187, the amount and activity of membrane PP2A actually drops below the basal level (Fig. 4, B and C, and Fig. 7 C). This suggests that an active mechanism for removal of PP2A from the membrane after secretion is stimulated. Our present findings lead to a number of important questions. First, how is PP2A translocated to the membrane fraction. Second, how might the influx of calcium activate PP2A, and third, what is the role of PP2A in the membrane fraction. With regard to the first question, it is known that the addition of antigen or PMA to RBL-2H3 cells also leads to the translocation of PKC to the membrane fraction (4.Cunha-Melo J.R. Gonzaga H.M. Ali H. Huang F.L. Huang K.P. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2617-2625PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ludowyke R.I. Scurr L.L. McNally C.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5130-5138PubMed Google Scholar, 30.White K.N. Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 942-947PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the translocation of the two enzymes may be linked. However, it should be noted that PMA-induced translocation of PKC is not transient, whereas PP2A is released from the membrane fraction back into the cytosol within a few minutes. A growing body of evidence indicates that regulation of PP2A occurs through association with other proteins in multiprotein complexes that may include specific kinases (38.Coghlan V.M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39.Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 40.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). For example A-kinase anchoring protein 79 anchors several signaling enzymes together, including protein kinase A, PKC, and PP2B, and maintains these enzymes in an inactive conformation (41.Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PP2A has been shown to be present in complexes containing specific kinases (42.Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 43.Westphal R.S. Coffee Jr., R.L. Marotta A. Pelech S.L. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 687-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and in one study, PKC and PP2A were co-localized to the membrane during PKC-mediated cell signaling in COS cells, although the mediator of this co-localization has not been identified (44.Hansra G. Bornancin F. Whelan R. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32785-32788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It will be important to identify mast cell-specific binding partners for PP2A. With regard to the mechanism for activation of membrane-associated PP2A, it is clear that for secretion to occur in RBL-2H3 cells, an increase in intracellular calcium is required (2.Beaven M.A. Baumgartner R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 along with PMA restores the activity of PP2A in the membrane fraction to levels proportional to the amount of enzyme present, suggesting that in some way inhibition of PP2A is removed by an influx of extracellular calcium. PP2A does not require divalent cations for activity in vitro, but calcium may indirectly affect the activity of PP2A by affecting its interaction with binding or targeting proteins. Precedence for such a mechanism exists in other signaling complexes, where PKC when bound to A-kinase anchoring protein 79 is inhibited, but as A-kinase anchoring protein 79 also binds Ca2+/calmodulin with high affinity, the addition of Ca2+/calmodulin antagonizes the interaction of PKC with A-kinase anchoring protein 79, releasing the inhibition (45.Faux M.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17038-17044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). With regard to the potential role of membrane-associated PP2A in the secretory process, it has been shown in yeast that a protein dephosphorylation event that is sensitive to okadaic acid and microcystin-LR is necessary for one of the final stages of vacuole fusion (46.Conradt B. Shaw J. Vida T. Emr S. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 47.Conradt B. Haas A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The close correlation of the translocation and activation of PP2A in the membrane fraction with the rate of secretion from RBL-2H3 cells suggests that PP2A may be fulfilling such a role in mast cell secretion. Proteins of the synaptosome-associated protein receptor fusion complex have been described in rat peritoneal mast cells (48.Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and we have observed such proteins in RBL-2H3 cells. 2R. I. Ludowyke and K. Stanley, unpublished observations. PP2A in the membrane could become associated with a supramolecular fusion complex. Whereas the molecular mechanisms responsible for PP2A translocation and activation remain unknown, our results clearly establish that PP2A and not PP1 is the major phosphatase involved in the mast cell secretory process and suggest that PP2A activity in the membrane fraction is required for secretion to proceed. Furthermore, these results are, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a rapid, signal-mediated transient translocation of PP2A to membranes in any cell system. These results therefore not only have implications for understanding the mechanisms of mast cell secretion and PP2A regulation but may also provide important clues into the molecular mechanisms of exocytosis in general. RBL-2H3 cells may therefore represent a useful model for other secretory systems where the rapid time-course of exocytosis makes detailed molecular analysis difficult.

Anesthetized rats were ventilated and placed in a custom-built cradle fitted with a force transducer that could be placed into a 7-tesla NMR magnet. Muscle work was induced by supramaximal sciatic nerve stimulation that activated all fibers. Muscles were stimulated at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 Hz until twitch force, phosphocreatine, and Pi were unchanged between two consecutive spectra acquired in 4-min blocks (8–12 min). Parallel bench experiments were performed to measure total tissue glycogen, lactate, total creatine, and pyruvate in freeze-clamped muscles after 10 min of stimulation at each frequency. Up to 0.5 Hz, there was no significant change in muscle glycogen, lactate, and the lactate/pyruvate ratios between 8–12 min. At 0.8 Hz, there was a 17% fall in glycogen and a 65% rise in the muscle lactate with a concomitant fall in pH. Above this frequency, glycogen fell rapidly, lactate continued to rise, and ATP and pH declined. On the basis of these force and metabolic measurements, we estimated the maximal mitochondrial capacity (V max) to be 0.8 Hz. Free [ADP] was then calculated at each submaximal workload from measuring all the reactants of the creatine kinase equilibrium after adjusting the K′CK to the muscle temp (30 °C), pH, and pMg.

The balanced reaction for oxidative phosphorylation is summarized in Reaction 1. NADH2−+4H++3ADP3−+3HPO42−+0.5O2→NAD1−Equation EReaction_1 +3ATP4−+4H2OIn 1952, Lardy and Wellman were among the first to propose that the rate of cellular respiration might be controlled by the products of ATP hydrolysis, namely free [ADP] or [Pi] (1.Lardy H.A.

Prentice-Hall Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1969Google Scholar). A few years later, Chance and Williams obtained apparentK m values of respiration of 20 μm and 1.0 mm for free [ADP] and [Pi], respectively, in rat liver mitochondria (3.Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chance suggested a greater role for free [ADP] than [Pi] in respiratory control since it would afford a greater sensitivity or gain to the system for a given increase in steady-state work (4.Chance B. Williams G.R. Adv. Enzymol. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Chance B. Leigh J.S. Mccully K. Nioka S. Clark B.J. Maris J.M. Graham T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In 1986, Katz and colleagues challenged the importance of free [ADP] on the basis of an invariant NMR determined [PCr]/[ATP] ratio in the in situ canine heart over a 3–5-fold increase in rate-pressure product, or oxygen consumption (42.Balaban R.S.

Physiol. 1990; 258: C377-C389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence against free [ADP] control was supported on theoretical grounds by the fact that a Michaelis-Menten function is inadequate to explain the observed high flux rates in vivo (7.Hochachka P.W. Muscles as Molecular and Metabolic Machines. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994Google Scholar). In an attempt to clarify what has become a very complex subject, Chance and colleagues proposed a modified Michaelis-Menten equation showing how control of cell respiration in vivo may be shared among the reactants in Reaction 1 (5.Chance B. Leigh J.S. Mccully K. Nioka S. Clark B.J. Maris J.M. Graham T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9458-9462Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Chance further postulated that the relative contribution of each controller was dependent on the energetic state of the tissue (5.Chance B. Leigh J.S. Mccully K. Nioka S. Clark B.J. Maris J.M. Graham T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9458-9462Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the mounting evidence against free [ADP], its importance in the control of mitochondrial respiration has recently resurfaced with the 31P NMR finding that the apparent kinetic order of [ADP] transduction is at least second order in intact human forearm (8.Jeneson J.A.L. Wiseman R.W. Westerhoff H.V. Kushmerick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). That free [ADP] and submaximal muscle work does not obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics has sparked a great deal of controversy (8.Jeneson J.A.L. Wiseman R.W. Westerhoff H.V. Kushmerick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 33.Portman M.A. Xiao Y. Song Y. Ning X.-H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 271: H727-H729Google Scholar). The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between free cytosolic [ADP] (and Pi) and tension-time integral (TTI)1 in the rat gastrocnemius muscle in vivo. We show that free [ADP] (and Pi) and TTI followed an apparent second order function and that our data do not fit a Michaelis-Menten relationship. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350–400 g body weight) were obtained from Animal Resources Center, Canningvale, Western Australia, Australia. Animals were housed in the James Cook University small animal facility with free access to food and water. Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg), tracheotomized, and ventilated at the rate of 75 breaths/min with a tidal volume of ∼25 ml to maintain arterial pH (7.4 ± 0.5), pCO2 (40 ± 5 mmHg), and pO2 (90 ± 10 mmHg) (S.E.). Blood pH and gas tensions were analyzed using a Ciba-Corning 865 series analyzer. The right carotid artery was cannulated with heparinized (100 units/ml) polyethylene tubing connected to a Statham P23 XL pressure transducer coupled to a MacLab for continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure. Anesthesia was maintained by delivering 1% isofluorane in compressed air via artificial ventilation at a rate of 0.5 liter/min. The entire surgical procedure was performed on a thermostatically regulated heating pad (37 °C). The right hindlimb was shaved, and two brass pins were driven through the calcaneum and tibial head with an electric drill. The animal was transferred to a purpose-built cradle pre-fitted with a 37 °C water-heated pad, and the limb was immobilized by clamping the pins onto a mechanical ground in the cradle. For muscle stimulation, bipolar electrodes were attached to the right sciatic nerve exposed by blunt dissection of overlying tissue. The nerve was then severed distal to the electrodes. The tendon of the gastrocnemius muscle was freed from the leg and attached to a calibrated ultra precision mini load cell (Transducer Techniques, MDB10) with non-compliant 2.0 silk string. Isometric force development (newtons) was continuously displayed on a MacLab. The muscle was carefully denuded of overlying tissue avoiding arteries and veins, and covered with plastic film to prevent the exposed tissue from drying out. Muscles under these conditions maintained a constant internal temperature of 30 ± 1 °C throughout the experiment (n = 5). Muscle temperature was measured in separate experiments using a YSI 500 series micro-implantable thermistor probe. The muscle was adjusted to the length at which maximum twitch force was developed during a supramaximal contraction in response to a square-wave pulse (0.1 ms, 5–15 V). The TTI, defined as the sum of the area under the twitches over the acquisition period in the NMR spectra, was used as an index of muscle work with units of Newtons second (Ns). The twitch tension-time integral was found to be a linear function of stimulation frequency during steady-state aerobic work (data not shown). The equation to the line was TTI = 46.98 stimulation frequency +2.26 R 2 = 0.99, giving a TTI at 0 Hz of 1.37 Ns. Each animal served as its own control precluding the need to normalize the data by muscle volume. The whole apparatus was introduced into the bore of an Oxford Instruments horizontal NMR magnet. 31P NMR experiments were performed at 121.47 MHz in the 110-mm bore of an Oxford 7.05-tesla superconducting magnet. A three-turn surface coil (14 mm outer diameter) was placed at the center of the gastrocnemius muscle and served as transmitter and receiver. A small latex balloon filled with a solution of 10 mm phenylphosphonic acid in saline was placed above the coil in the same geometrical arrangement as the muscle below and served as an external standard. Magnetic field homogeneity was optimized by observing the off-resonance proton signal of muscle water. The surface coil was tuned and matched to resonate at 121.47 MHz. All NMR experiments were performed using a radio frequency pulse of 10-μs duration, which was transmitted at a near 90oflip angle by the surface coil. 31P NMR spectra were collected as 9600 data points using a sweep-width of 6000 Hz. The free induction decays were acquired over 0.8 s with an interpulse delay time of 1 s. The free induction decays were multiplied by a line broadening factor equivalent to 20 Hz to improve signal-to-noise ratio. Resultant line widths for the in vivo muscle experiments were typically 40–60 Hz. The radio frequency pulse was not synchronized with a nerve stimulation. The advantage of 31P NMR is that the method is noninvasive and provides continuous measurements of phosphorus metabolites in real time in one animal, including direct estimates of pH and free [Mg2+]. The limitation of the NMR technique, as with conventional metabolic analysis, is that the measurements cannot discriminate the different contributions of fiber types. Fully relaxed spectra with a relaxation delay of 20 s was collected for 30 min at the beginning of each experiment to determine the saturation correction factors for each of the phosphorus-containing compounds (see “Quantitation of NMR Spectra”). Control spectra were obtained for 7 min (256 transients) before the muscle was stimulated to contract isometrically at frequencies of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 Hz and either 0.8 Hz (n = 4), 1 Hz (n = 7), or 2 Hz (n = 7). For each stimulation frequency in the three groups, spectra were acquired in 4-min blocks each with 128 transients. Muscles were allowed to recover for 20 min between each stimulation frequency to restore the contraction force and PCr and Pi to prestimulation levels. The total time for each of the three protocols was about 3 h. The force and NMR data were then analyzed to establish a steady state in which twitch tension and PCr and Pi were constant in two consecutive spectra (9.Argov Z. Maris J. Damico L. Koruda M. Roth Z. Leigh J.S. Chance B. J. Appl. Physiol. 1987; 63: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10.Shoubridge E.A. Bland J.L. Radda G.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 805: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We showed that steady state was reached between 8 and 12 min of stimulation up to 0.8 Hz (see “Results”). Parallel experiments were carried out on the laboratory bench and muscles freeze-clamped following 10 min of stimulation at each of the frequencies using aluminum tongs pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The freeze-clamped muscles were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen, the connective tissue was removed, and the powder kept at −80 °C until analysis of lactate, glycogen, pyruvate, PCr, and Cr. Conversion of total tissue contents (micromoles/g wet weight) into intracellular concentrations (micromoles/ml) were carried out using our published extracellular space values and total tissue water contents reported for rat gastrocnemius in vivo (11.Cieslar J. Huang M-T. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1530-R1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we also measured the extracellular spaces at 1 and 2 Hz and found them to be 18% and 17%, respectively. The values were not significantly different from the 16% we report in vivo(11.Cieslar J. Huang M-T. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1530-R1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All chemicals used in the metabolic assays were purchased from either Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals and were of the highest grade. Frozen tissue (∼100 mg) was homogenized in equal volumes of ice-cold 0.1 m HCl in methanol and 3.6% perchloric acid (12.Lowry O. Passoneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis.

The homogenate was centrifuged (9,000 × g; 2 min) and a volume of acid-extract removed and mixed with an aliquot of KHCO3 (0.3 and 0.2m stocks) to neutralize (pH 6–7). The supernatant was immediately measured either spectrophotometrically or fluorometrically for pyruvate, lactate, PCr, and creatine according to the methods of Passoneau and Lowry (12.Lowry O. Passoneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar). Total tissue glycogen was measured separately according to the method of Passoneau (13.Passoneau J. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of 0.5m NaOH was added to frozen tissue (∼50 mg) and heated in boiling water for 20–30 min to remove tissue free glucose. The suspension was made acidic with a known volume of 12 n HCl (pH < 3.0). An aliquot of acid extract (∼50 μl) was removed and added to 950 μl of 200 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.7) containing amylo-α-1,4-α-1,6-glucosidase to digest tissue glycogen. Following 2 h of incubation, the acid extract was fluorometrically assayed for glucose (13.Passoneau J. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). 31P NMR spectral intensities for the phosphorus-containing compounds were determined by computer integration using the VNMRX software. Saturation correction factors were determined by taking the ratio of the area under a given peak with a 20-s relaxation delay to the area of the spectra with a 1-s relaxation delay. The mean correction factors for the 10 mmphenylphosphonic acid external standard, Pi, PCr, and β-ATP were 2.20 ± 0.05, 1.80 ± 0.06, 1.56 ± 0.0, and 1.22 ± 0.02 (± S.E., n = 18), respectively. Intracellular concentrations of the β-ATP, PCr, and Piwere calculated by equating the spectral intensities of the saturation-corrected phosphorus metabolites to the spectral intensity of the saturation-corrected external standard (10 mm).

Golding R.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1995; 33: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), where α = [H+]/KH and β = α(KD /KD ′).

Golding R.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1995; 33: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The free cytosolic [ADP] was calculated from the creatine kinase equilibrium (EC 2.7.3.2) using the measured components in the31P NMR spectra. [ADP]=[ATP][Cr][PCr]KCK′Equation 6 The Cr concentration was calculated by subtracting the NMR PCr value from the total Cr measured enzymatically where the total Cr = PCrenz + Crenz. The creatine kinase equilibrium constant (K′CK) was adjusted to muscle free [Mg2+]i and pHiduring graded levels of steady-state work according to the method of Golding et al. (15.Golding E.M. Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition,K′CK was adjusted to the temperature of the muscle (30 °C) using the method of Teague et al.(16.Teague W.E. Golding E.M. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 509-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All values shown are means ± S.E. Unless otherwise indicated, Student's t test was applied for statistical comparisons among basal and stimulated values. A probability of p < 0.05 indicated a significant difference between values. Steady-state was defined in terms of relatively constant TTI and concentrations of PCr and Pi measured at the different stimulation frequencies in consecutive spectra acquired in 4-min blocks (Fig. 1). Mean values for TTI were similarly calculated in three blocks of 4 min to coincide with the NMR acquisition period. Fig. 1 a shows no significant differences in TTI for the stimulation frequencies between 0.1 and 0.8 Hz over the 12-min time period. Significant changes were observed at 1 and 2 Hz. At all stimulation frequencies, PCr fell significantly during the first and second periods of acquisition (0–8 min) (Fig.1 b). With the exception of 1 and 2 Hz, metabolic steady state was reached during the period between 8 and 12 min. A similar profile was found with the increase in muscle Piconcentration at the different stimulation frequencies (Fig.1 c). In parallel bench experiments, muscles were freeze-clamped following 10 min of stimulation and glycogen, lactate, and pyruvate were measured enzymatically (Table I). Up to 0.5 Hz, there was no significant difference in muscle glycogen, lactate, and pyruvate compared with controls. At 0.8 Hz, a significant rise in lactate and pyruvate (p < 0.05) was observed with a concomitant fall in glycogen. It was not until 1 and 2 Hz that glycogen fell as low as 30% of control, lactate increased up to 5-fold, and lactate/pyruvate ratio increased 3-fold (Table I). NMR determined cytosolic pH, also reported in Table I, was not significantly different from controls up to 0.5 Hz but significantly decreased from 7.203 to 7.050 at 0.8 Hz. On the basis of these changes in TTI and accompanying metabolic data, we estimated that the maximal mitochondrial capacity in rat gastrocnemius in situ under our conditions was around 0.8 Hz.Table ITotal tissue concentrations of lactate, glycogen, and pyruvate determined enzymatically in freeze-clamped rat gastrocnemius muscle in vivo following 10-min stimulationHznLactateGlycogenPyruvateLactate/pyruvatepHControl81.76 ± 0.1630.7 ± 1.60.055 ± 0.00732.8 ± 4.77.20 ± 0.010.171.91 ± 0.2328.4 ± 1.80.034 ± 0.00347.2 ± 4.57.17 ± 0.010.251.81 ± 0.2127.6 ± 0.60.040 ± 0.00446.0 ± 8.07.14 ± 0.010.351.66 ± 0.3130.7 ± 1.40.037 ± 0.00649.4 ± 11.47.15 ± 0.010.451.28 ± 0.2330.9 ± 1.60.032 ± 0.00843.4 ± 5.37.14 ± 0.010.541.61 ± 0.1328.5 ± 3.90.044 ± 0.00437.9 ± 4.77.12 ± 0.010.852.57 ± 0.1825.6 ± 1.90.077 ± 0.00533.5 ± 2.17.05 ± 0.04174.32 ± 0.8421.6 ± 2.50.066 ± 0.01159.9 ± 3.17.01 ± 0.04259.35 ± 1.429.3 ± 0.180.095 ± 0.007100.5 ± 18.16.84 ± 0.06All data are expressed in micromoles/g wet weight tissue.

NMR determined PCr, ATP, Pi, and free Mg2+ in rat gastrocnemius muscle in vivo during the 8–12 min of stimulation are reported in TableII. During submaximal steady-state work transitions, PCr fell in significantly different increments (p < 0.05) at each stimulation frequency up to 0.8 Hz (Table II). The work-induced fall in PCr was accompanied by a stoichiometric rise in intracellular Pi concentration (Table II). It is noteworthy that ATP began to decrease at 2Hz when PCr was about 30% of the control value (Table II). ATP was not considered part of our aerobic steady-state criteria because it remained constant up to and including 1.0 Hz, presumably through PCr hydrolysis and the activation of anaerobic glycogenolysis (Tables I and II). Free [Mg2+] was not significantly different up to 1 Hz but increased by 50% at 2 Hz.Table IIIntracellular concentrations of PCr, ATP, Mg, ADP, and Piduring 8–12 min of stimulation in rat gastrocnemius muscle in vivo using 31 P NMR spectroscopyHzn[TCr][PCr][Cr][ATP][Mg]K′CK[ADP][Pi]μmControl1829.96 ± 0.5338.78 ± 0.527.22 ± 0.528.99 ± 0.110.58 ± 0.01104.0 ± 3.317.0 ± 1.82.80 ± 0.190.11829.72 ± 0.7435.78 ± 0.5510.22 ± 0.559.03 ± 0.130.59 ± 0.08112.5 ± 3.723.4 ± 1.43.94 ± 0.310.21829.34 ± 0.6532.25 ± 0.5913.75 ± 0.539.02 ± 0.110.61 ± 0.02120.9 ± 3.432.6 ± 2.06.76 ± 0.510.31830.69 ± 0.7328.78 ± 0.5917.22 ± 0.599.02 ± 0.100.64 ± 0.04121.5 ± 3.445.9 ± 2.98.71 ± 0.680.41830.66 ± 0.6827.13 ± 0.7218.87 ± 0.729.06 ± 0.100.61 ± 0.02123.1 ± 3.753.8 ± 4.011.03 ± 0.720.51830.37 ± 0.3823.89 ± 0.8422.11 ± 0.848.67 ± 0.080.60 ± 0.02127.3 ± 3.665.2 ± 3.711.91 ± 0.750.8431.08 ± 0.6418.98 ± 1.0027.02 ± 1.008.58 ± 0.180.58 ± 0.04144.6 ± 3.686.3 ± 5.715.57 ± 1.561727.41 ± 0.4417.08 ± 1.1324.92 ± 1.138.66 ± 0.110.65 ± 0.04167.6 ± 16.880.5 ± 6.016.78 ± 0.572725.93 ± 0.9211.16 ± 0.9428.84 ± 0.946.26 ± 0.280.86 ± 0.09287.1 ± 7.566.7 ± 8.921.07 ± 1.63Total creatine concentration ([TCr]) was determined enzymatically in freeze-clamped extracts of muscle following 10 mins of stimulation.

Open table in a new tab Total creatine concentration ([TCr]) was determined enzymatically in freeze-clamped extracts of muscle following 10 mins of stimulation. All concentrations with the exception of free cytosolic [ADP] are expressed in mm. Values are mean ± S.E. Free cytosolic [ADP] was 17 μm in the gastrocnemius prior to stimulation and increased with increasing stimulation frequency and tension-time integral (Fig.2 a). The equation to the line up to 0.8 Hz was TTI = 46.984 ([ADP]) + 2.2562 withR 2 = 0.9945. When free [ADP] was plotted against TTI using the Hill relationship, given aV max of 39 Ns at 0.8 Hz, a Hill coefficient (n H) of 2.4 was found (Fig. 2 b). The equation to the line was log(TTI/V max − TTI) = 2.38 (log ADP) − 4.00 with R 2= 0.99. The apparent K 0.5 of ADP for submaximal steady-state stimulation was 48 μm. A similar analysis was performed with increases in cytosolic [Pi]. A Hill coefficient of 2.1 was obtained. The equation to the line was log(TTI/V max − TTI) = 2.14(log[Pi]) − 2.08 with R 2= 0.96 (graph not shown). The apparent K 0.5value of free [Pi] for submaximal steady-state work was 9.4 mm. The data for free cytosolic [ADP] (and free [Pi]) and TTI did not fit any form of the Michaelis-Menten function, i.e. the Lineweaver-Burke plot showed no tendency to intersect the y axis (Fig.2 c). Similarly, the Eadie-Hofstee and Hanes Plot followed no sensible form, leading to the calculation of a kineticV max or apparent K m (plots not shown). There has been much controversy in recent years about whether the relationship between oxygen consumption and free [ADP] follows a first order Michaelis-Menten function or higher order sigmoidal function. Our study shows that ADP and TTI follows a Hill relationship with at least a second order function. Before we discuss these findings in relation to other studies, it is important to first discuss the assumptions of our model that form the basis of our results. The assumptions are: 1) our study applies to submaximal steady-state levels of aerobic activity, 2) the maximal mitochondrial capacity for aerobic work in rat gastrocnemius was in the vicinity of 0.8 Hz, and 3) the tension-time index provides a reliable estimate of oxygen consumption during steady-state work. Our first two assumptions were supported on the basis of our force and metabolic measurements in the magnet and on the bench. Fig. 1 clearly shows that no change occurred in twitch tension, PCr, and Pi between the second and third spectra up to 0.8 Hz. Moreover, there was no significant change in muscle lactate, glycogen, and pH indicating a physiological and metabolic steady state (Tables I and II). Our study therefore differs from most in this area by experimentally determining the apparent maximum aerobic mitochondrial capacity (V max) in situnot from fitting the data to a specific mathematical relation (8.Jeneson J.A.L.

It mediates a signal from outside the cell to a target protein that regulates gene expression or the enzyme activity of various enzymes. cAMP plays a central role in the regulation of the response to different nutritional states in enteric bacteria (1.Botsford J.L.

Science. 1970; 169: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). cAMP functions to regulate transcription in conjunction with the cAMP receptor protein (CRP)1 in Gram-negative bacteria. E. coli CRP has been well characterized in vitro by a variety of physical and biochemical techniques, including x-ray analysis of CRP crystals (4.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol.

The CRP forms a homodimer; each subunit of this dimer is composed of two domains. The larger NH2-terminal domain contains the cAMP binding site and shows homology to a class of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (6.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S.

The dimer form of CRP is able to bind to specific DNA sequences when it is liganded with cAMP. The COOH-terminal domain can bind to DNA at helix-turn-helix motif. The cAMP-CRP complex functions as a transcriptional regulator, activating transcription at several promoters and repressing transcription from others (1.Botsford J.L. Harman J.G. Microbiol.

In the green algae Chlamydomonas, cAMP is reported as a key second messenger in the mating reaction, but the adenylate cyclase and the mediator of cAMP have not yet been identified. In this case, the cAMP signal cascade is poorly understood (13.Quarmby L.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1271-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In Euglena, Carrie and Edmunds (14.Carre I.A. Edmunds Jr., L.N. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that cAMP mediates the phasing of the cell division cycle through the circadian clock. Recently, it was reported that the catalytic subunit of PKA had been identified inEuglena gracilis (15.Kiriyama H. Nanmori T. Hari K. Matsuoka D. Fukami Y. Kikkawa U. Yasuda T FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), although the adenylate cyclase and regulatory subunit of PKA have not been reported. In higher plants, many attempts have been made to clone the adenylate cyclase and PKA genes. Nevertheless, these genes have not been identified in higher plants. Cyanobacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, are able to perform higher plant-type oxygen evolving photosynthesis. The intracellular cAMP levels of cyanobacteria change in response to changes in environmental conditions such as light-dark, low pH-high pH, oxic-anoxic (16.Ohmori M. Ohmori K. Hasunuma K. Arch.

Exogenous cAMP stimulates the gliding movement of Spirulina platensis (19.Ohmori K. Hirose M. Ohmori M.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results suggest that cAMP functions as a signaling molecule in cyanobacteria as well. However, no intracellular molecule that mediates the cAMP signal has yet been identified in cyanobacteria. In this report, we investigated the biochemical properties, especially the cAMP binding affinity, of putative cyanobacterial CRPs. Among them, a novel cAMP receptor protein was identified as a cyanobacterial cAMP receptor protein and named SYCRP1. The E. colistrains used as hosts were JM109 (recA1, endA1,gyrA96, thi, hsdR17(rK−, mK+)), supE44, relA1,Δ(lac-proAB)/F' (traD36,proAB, lacI q,Δ(lacZ)M15)) for cloning and BL21(DE3)pLysS (F−, ompT, hsdS (rB−, mB−), dcm, gal, λ(DE3), pLysS) for the expression of recombinant proteins. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (21.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). When required, kanamycin or chloramphenicol was added at 25 or 30 μg ml−1, respectively. To obtain DNA fragments corresponding to sll1371, sll1924, and slr0593 ORFs (sycrp1, sycrp2 andsypk, respectively), polymerase chain reactions were performed with several sets of synthetic primers and genomic DNA fromSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The primers forsycrp1 were CGA1 (5′-CGGGATCCATGGGCACTAGTCCCC-3′) and CGA2 (5′-CCCACCTAGTGTGACAT-3′). Primers for sycrp2 were HYP1(5′-CGGGATCCATGGCACCACAAAAGC-3′) and HYP2 (5′-GGCAACTGCTGAGGTTT-3′). Primers for sypk were PKA1 (5′-CGGGATCCATGGAACTGGGAAAGATT-3′) and PKA2 (5′-CAGGCTCTTAGACGTGG-3′). The sequences of the CGA1, HYP1, and PKA1 primers were designed to allow the introduction of a BamHI restriction site immediately upstream of the initiator ATG codon. Each polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen). After verification of the nucleotide sequence, sycrp1 andsycrp2 were digested from each plasmid with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned between the BamHI andEcoRI sites of the pET-28a expression vector (Novagen). The resulting plasmids were named pCGA and pHYP. The sypk was partially digested with AluI, and a DNA fragment corresponding to a putative cAMP binding site (from 291 to 872 relative to the start site of the open reading frame) was cloned into theSmaI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The direction of the open reading frame was confirmed by restriction mapping. The resulting plasmid was named pPKA. The transformants, BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring each of the pCGA, pHYP, and pPKA plasmids, were grown at 37 °C in 1.5 liter of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with kanamycin or ampicillin (25 or 100 μg ml−1, respectively) and chloramphenicol (30 μg ml−1). The recombinant genes were expressed in exponentially growing cells by adding 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After 3 h of incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, and resuspended in 50 ml of Buffer A consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The cell suspension was frozen and thawed, and then sonicated at 4 °C for 9 min (3 min three times) using a sonicator (model 200M, Kubota Co., Tokyo, Japan). The cell extract was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 45 min. Recombinant proteins in the 150,000 × g supernatants were purified with several affinity columns connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (FPLC system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 150,000 × g supernatant containing His-tagged SYCRP1 (His-SYCRP1) was loaded onto a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1.6 × 2.5 cm) connected to an FPLC system, and the proteins were eluted using a step gradient of 30, 60, 100, and 200 mm imidazole in Buffer A. The 200 mm imidazole fraction was loaded onto a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1.6 × 2.5 cm) connected to an FPLC system, and eluted using a step gradient of 100 and 200 mm NaCl in Buffer B consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The 200 mm NaCl fraction contained purified His-SYCRP1. The predicted molecular mass of this protein was determined to be 29.5 kDa using DNASTAR software (DNASTAR Inc). The 150,000 × g supernatant containing His-tagged SYCRP2 (His-SYCRP2) was loaded onto a HiTrap SP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 0.7 × 2.5 cm) connected to an FPLC system, and was eluted using a step gradient of 100, 200, and 400 mmNaCl in Buffer B. The 400 mm NaCl fraction was loaded onto a HiTrap chelating column connected to an FPLC system, and eluted using a step gradient of 100, 200, and 400 mm imidazole in Buffer A. The 400 mm imidazole fraction contained purified His-SYCRP2. The predicted molecular mass of His-SYCRP2 is 30.4 kDa. The 150,000 × g supernatant containing a fusion protein (GST-pSYPK) between GST and a portion of SYPK was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (10 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with 5 mm glutathione in Buffer A. The eluate was loaded onto a HiTrap Q column connected to an FPLC system, and eluted using a step gradient of 100 and 200 mm NaCl in Buffer B. The 200 mm NaCl fraction contained purified GST-pSYPK. The predicted molecular mass of GST-pSYPK is 45.5 kDa. Equilibrium dialysis was performed essentially as described by Hisabori et al. (22.Hisabori T. Sakurai H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1984; 25: 483-493Google Scholar). Lucite cells were fulfilled in a volume of 100 μl per half cell with dialysis membranes (pore size 15 Å; Biomed Instruments Inc. Co., Fullerton, CA). A glass bead (inner diameter = 0.8 mm) was placed in each half cell to aid stirring. One of the recombinant proteins in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mmNaCl, and 10% (w/v) glycerol was placed in one side (sample side) of the lucite cell, and the same volume of cAMP solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 10% (w/v) glycerol was placed in the other side (reference side). The concentrations of the recombinant proteins and cAMP are indicated in the legends to Figs. 3 and 4. The filled lucite cells were incubated in a shaker (BR-15LF, Taitec Co., Saitama, Japan) at 20, 25, or 30 °C. An incubation period of 6 h was needed to establish equilibria, and 80-μl samples were taken from each half cell for HPLC analysis.Figure 4Determination of theK d value for His-SYCRP1 by equilibrium dialysis. The binding of cAMP to His-SYCRP1 was measured by equilibrium dialysis at 20 °C (●) and 30 °C (▪). 5 μm His-SYCRP1 was incubated for 6 h in the presence of 0.5–20 μm of cAMP at 20 °C or 30 °C, and then the amounts of bound cAMP were measured by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An HPLC system (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) was used to measure the amounts of cAMP bound to recombinant proteins. Aliquots from the sample side were denatured for 5 min with cold trichloroacetic acid, final concentration 4.5% (w/v), or by heating at 95 °C for 2 min, and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove proteins. The 10-μl aliquot of the supernatant from the sample side or 10 μl from the reference side was applied to a TSK ODS-80Ts column (4.6 mm × 15 cm, Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 5% (v/v) acetonitrile; the effluent was monitored at 259 nm. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Purified His-SYCRP1 (4 μg) was incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 10% (w/v) glycerol, with or without 10 μm cAMP in a final volume of 20 μl for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of EDC to a final concentration of 25 mm. After 2 h of incubation, the cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 4× SDS sample-loading buffer. The samples were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel for electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. An oligonucleotide (5′-CGGGATCCGCGAAAAGTGTGACATATGTCACACTTTTCGC-3′) was synthesized and used in the assay. The sequence of the oligonucleotide includes a consensus DNA sequence for E. coli CRP binding and aBamHI sequence attached to the 5′ end of the consensus sequence. Since the consensus sequence is composed of two palindromic copies of a 16-bp sequence, preparation of double strand DNA was achieved by incubating the oligonucleotide at 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 10 min, and 25 °C for 1 h in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The DNA fragment was labeled with Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA), and used as a probe. The 32P-labeled probe (10,000 cpm, approximately 1 ng) was incubated with His-SYCRP1 in a total volume of 20 μl of the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8% (w/v) glycerol, 50 ng of poly(dI-dC)) with or without a final concentration of 20 μm cAMP for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 50:1). The electrophoresis buffer was 0.25× TBE with or without 20 μm cAMP. Electrophoresis was conducted at constant current (15 mA). When the binding reactions were carried out in buffer containing cAMP, electrophoresis buffer supplemented with 20 μm cAMP was also used. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (23.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out in polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS by the method of Laemmli (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). The cAMP binding motif in the prokaryotic cAMP receptor protein and the eukaryotic regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is substantially conserved (6.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7.Taylor S.S. Bubis J. Toner-Webb J. Sarawat L.D. First E.A. Buechler J.A. Knighton D.R. Sowadski J.

We performed a search for a putative cAMP receptor protein in the Synechocystis PCC 6803 genome sequencing data (25.Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar) and Cyano Base, with reference to the entire amino acid sequence ofE. coli CRP, and 18 candidate ORFs were first selected. Based on the presence of functional amino acids that bind cAMP molecule (4.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 26.Vany M. Gilliland G.L. Harman J.G. Peterkofsky A. Weber I.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4568-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), 18 ORFs were finally narrowed down to 3 ORFs (Fig.1): sll1371, sll1924, and slr0593, which we named sycrp1, sycrp2 and sypk, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequences of the three ORFs are overall less similar to E. coli CRP sequence (Fig.1). The residue identity is only 14–23% between three proteins andE. coli CRP, although some highly conserved amino acid residues were identified among these amino acid sequences. The amino-terminal region, from residues 1 to 88 of SYCRP1, shows low sequence homology to the corresponding region of E. coliCRP. However, the next segment, corresponding to residues 89–103 of SYCRP1, shows high homology to E. coli CRP and contains several amino acids that participate directly in the binding of cAMP (indicated by the open stars in Fig. 1). The identical residues in this segment are Gly-89, Glu-90, Glu-95, Glu-96, Arg-99, Ser-100, and Val-103, which correspond to Gly-72, Glu-73, Glu-78, Glu-79, Arg-83, Ser-84, and Val-87 in E. coli CRP, respectively. The next highly homologous region, residues 138–141 of SYCRP1, is highly conserved. Arg-124 stabilizes Glu-73 in E. coli CRP through an ionic interaction (4.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 26.Vany M. Gilliland G.L. Harman J.G. Peterkofsky A. Weber I.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4568-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thr-128 and Ser-129 participate in the binding of cAMP in E. coli CRP (4.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 26.Vany M. Gilliland G.L. Harman J.G. Peterkofsky A. Weber I.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4568-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but these residues are replaced by Leu-144 and Asn-145 in SYCRP1. A check with the Sequence Motif Search (the GenomeNet web server) revealed the cAMP binding motif 1 to be [LIVM]-[VIC]-X(2 amino acid residues)-G-[DENQTA]-X-[GAC]-X(2 amino acid residues)-[LIVMFY](4 amino acid residues)-X(2 amino acid residues)-G and the cAMP binding motif 2 [LIVMF]-G-E-X-[GAS]-[LIVM]-X(amino acid residues 5–11)-R-[STAQ]-A-X-[LIVMA]-X-[STACV]. These motifs are in pairs. SYCRP1 does not match these motifs because of several amino acid substitutions. In motif 1 [VIC] and G (underlined) are replaced by L and H, respectively. In motif 2, A (underlined) is replaced by T (see Fig. 1; E. coli CRP motif 1 is the segment from Leu-30 to Gly-46 and motif 2 is the segment from Ile-71 to Ala-89). Together, these data indicate that SYCRP1 must carry a novel cAMP binding motif. E. coli CRP has a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA-binding in the carboxyl-terminal region (5.Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 27.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3973-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). From residues Arg-196 to Glu-207 in SYCRP1, this region shows high homology to the latter helix region in E. coli CRP. The specific amino acids that interact with DNA in E. coli CRP are Arg-181, Glu-182, Thr-183, Arg-186, and Lys-189 (5.Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). SYCRP2 shows high homology (40% similarity) to SYCRP1. However, SYCRP2 lacks several amino acids corresponding to Glu-73, Arg-83, and Ser-84 in E. coli CRP, which participate directly in cAMP binding. The amino acid sequence of SYPK containing a putative cAMP binding domain is almost the same as that of SYCRP1. SYPK has common cAMP binding motifs; however, the entire predicted amino acid sequence of SYPK comprises 434 amino acids, and the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions are different from those in E. coli CRP and SYCRP1. As a result of BLAST search (the GenBankTM BLAST server), it is shown that the cAMP binding site of SYPK is similar to that of the regulatory subunit of PKA in eukaryotes. However, the rest of the SYPK sequence shows less homology to the regulatory subunit of eukaryotic PKA. To prepare recombinant proteins encoded by these ORFs for biochemical analysis of the putative cAMP receptor proteins, we constructed expression vectors (pCGA, pHYP, and pPKA) encoding hybrid proteins with His tag or GST as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When the entire sypk was cloned into pET-28a, expression of the desired protein was not observed. Therefore, we cloned the ORF into pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and succeeded in expressing the desired protein as a fusion protein with GST. Unfortunately, the product was insoluble (data not shown). Therefore, the deduced amino acid sequence of the sypk containing a putative cAMP-binding site (193 amino acids; 98–290 amino acids in the entire predicted amino acid sequence, see Fig. 1) was examined. When the partial sypk was cloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector and expressed, a soluble product named GST-pSYPK was obtained. Then, this fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column and ion exchange chromatography. Other recombinant proteins (His-tagged SYCRP1 and His-tagged SYCRP2) were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. The molecular masses of both His-tagged SYCRP1 (His-SYCRP1) and His-tagged SYCRP2 (His-SYCRP2) were estimated to be 30 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis, corresponding closely to the theoretical values (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of a major band of GST-pSYPK was estimated to be 45 kDa, but another minor band was also detected at 45.5 kDa, a value that corresponds to the theoretical molecular mass of GST-pSYPK. Probably several amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal region were cleaved without any effect on the binding to cAMP (Fig. 2, lane 6). To determine the cAMP binding ability of each of the expressed proteins, equilibrium dialysis measurements were performed at 25 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are shown in Fig.3. Three-fifths of the amount of 5 μm cAMP was bound to 20 μm His-SYCRP1, suggesting that His-SYCRP1 can bind cAMP. His-SYCRP2 showed low cAMP binding activity. We had carried out the equilibrium dialysis measurements using 10 μm cAMP, 10 μmHis-SYCRP2, and 10 μm His-tagged galactosidase (Novagen, control sample) as negative control under the same conditions as in Fig. 3 several times (data not shown) and found no cAMP binding activity of His-SYCRP2. Based on these results, we concluded that His-SYCRP2 had no cAMP binding activity. It was noted that very high amounts of cAMP, more than the amounts initially added, were released from 20 μm GST-pSYPK, indicating that GST-pSYPK was purified together with endogenously bound cAMP. To investigate the binding specificity of His-SYCRP1 to cAMP, equilibrium dialysis measurements were performed using 10 μm His-SYCRP1 and 10 μm 5′-AMP or 10 μm cGMP. His-SYCRP1 bound neither 5′-AMP nor cGMP entirely (data not shown); thus, the data indicate that His-SYCRP1 binds cAMP specifically. To obtain the K d value of His-SYCRP1 from cAMP, 0.5–20 μm cAMP was incubated with 5 μm His-SYCRP1 for 6 h at 20 °C or 30 °C for equilibrium dialysis. The K d value was determined from the revolution lines by least-square analysis on a Scatchard plot (Fig. 4). The K d value was 2.57 ± 0.08 μm at 20 °C and 2.82 ± 0.09 μm at 30 °C. In this range of temperature, theK d values were almost constant. These values are physiologically relevant in bacteria because the intracellular cAMP concentration is within 0–10 μm (28.Botsford J.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 620-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheK d values of bacterial CRPs are known to be in a order of 10−5m in general (29.Takahashi M. Blasy B. Baudras A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5124-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30.Ren Y.L. Garges S. Adhya S. Krakow J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5127-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 31.Chen P.F. Tu S.C. Hagag N. Wu F.Y.-H. Wu C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The obtained K d value for His-SYCRP1 is comparatively lower than that of other bacteria. The bacterial CRPs bind both cAMP and cGMP and the K d values of both nucleotides are very similar, that is 10−5m (29.Takahashi M. Blasy B. Baudras A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5124-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30.Ren Y.L. Garges S. Adhya S. Krakow J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5127-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 31.Chen P.F. Tu S.C. Hagag N. Wu F.Y.-H. Wu C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Considering the predicted maximum amounts of bound cAMP on His-SYCRP1, approximately 0.6 molecule of cAMP bound on 1 molecule of His-SYCRP1. This means that a His-SYCRP1 dimer binds 1 molecule of cAMP, as in the case in E. coli CRP (32.Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine whether cyanobacterial CRP forms a dimer, a protein cross-linking experiment of His-SYCRP1 with the zero-length cross-linking reagent EDC was performed. Fig. 5 shows the detecting of a protein-protein cross-linking dimeric His-SYCRP1 band in the absence of cAMP. In E. coli CRP, cAMP has been reported to stabilize the CRP dimer form (33.Brown A.M. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7387-7391Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). If cAMP stabilized His-SYCRP1, the proportion of dimeric His-SYCRP1 would be higher when cAMP was added. The addition of cAMP, however, did not increase the proportion of the dimeric His-SYCRP1 band in our preparations (Fig. 5). On the other hand, we could confirm that His-SYCRP1 can bind cAMP molecules as a homodimer. This result suggests that His-SYCRP1 may act as a transcriptional regulator as in the case of other bacterial CRPs. The carboxyl-terminal region of SYCRP1 shows high homology to the latter part of the helix-turn-helix motif of E. coli CRP that participates in DNA-binding (Fig.1). Therefore, there is a possibility that SYCRP1 binds some DNA sequences that are similar to E. coli CRP-binding sequences. To clarify this, we performed a gel mobility shift assay using His-SYCRP1 and an E. coli CRP consensus DNA sequence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.6 A, incubation of His-SYCRP1 with the DNA probe in the presence of cAMP resulted in a retarded band (lanes 2 and 3). The intensity of this band was reduced by the addition of non-labeled DNA probe but not affected by the addition of the same amount of poly(dI-dC) (lanes 4 and5). This shifted band was not detected in the absence of cAMP (Fig. 6 A, lanes 6–9). To examine whether the retarded complex involves His-SYCRP1, Western blotting analysis with tetra-His antibodies (Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid horseradish peroxidase conjugates, Qiagen) was carried out using the gel from the gel mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the Western blotting analysis after incubation of His-SYCRP1 with the DNA probe in the presence of 20 μm cAMP, a His-SYCRP1 protein band was detected at the same position as the shifted band. This band seems arise from a specific interaction of His-SYCRP1 with the DNA probe. His-SYCRP1 alone did not enter the gel in the presence of 20 μm cAMP. It was concluded that His-SYCRP1 bound to an E. coli CRP consensus DNA sequence, and the binding of His-SYCRP1 to this sequence is dependent on the presence of cAMP in vitro (Fig.6 A). It is unlikely that the His-SYCRP1 protein preparation is contaminated with E. coli CRP, because no band was observed except for His-SYCRP1 on denaturating polyacrylamide gel (Fig.2), and a band migrating at a position corresponding to the shifted band was observed in Western blotting analysis (Fig.6 B). Although a sequence-specific interaction between His-SYCRP1 and a DNA sequence was observed in competition experiments (lanes 4 and5 in Fig. 6 A), the identification of the optimum sequence for the binding of His-SYCRP1 remains to be elucidated. The results obtained in the present experiments suggest that SYCRP1 is a novel cAMP receptor protein, which is involved in transcriptional regulation as a mediator of the cAMP signal."

We recently showed that HPV-11 E1 interacts with cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) complexes through an RXL motif and is a substrate for these kinases. E1 mutations in this motif or in candidate cdk phosphorylation sites are impaired in replication, suggesting a role for cdks in HPV replication.

Cyclin E/CDK2 expression vectors also enhanced transient HPV replication in HeLa cells. HeLa cell-derived HPV-18 E1 protein is truncated at the carboxyl terminus but can associate with cyclin E/CDK2. This truncated E1 was replication-incompetent and inhibited cell-free HPV replication. These results indicate that HeLa cells are phenotypically limiting in cyclin E/CDK2 for efficient HPV replication, most likely due to sequestration by the endogenous, defective HPV-18 E1 protein.

Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because of this complexity, the functions of individual proteins in the preinitiation complex and their interactions and regulation have been difficult to investigate. Small DNA viruses such as SV40/polyomavirus and papillomaviruses each encode one or two viral origin (ori) recognition and initiator proteins and rely heavily on the cellular DNA replication machinery. Because the interactions among viral and cellular proteins mimic those among the cellular counterparts, these viruses have proven to be particularly useful model systems. The SV40 system has aided in the identification and mechanistic description of several important replication components (reviewed in Ref. 2.Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and more recently has revealed the opposing effects of cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin A/CDK2 in regulating DNA polymerase α/primase via direct phosphorylation (3.Voitenleitner C.

The fact that papillomaviruses are highly prevalent and medically important human and animal pathogens also makes them attractive to investigators (reviewed in Ref. 4.Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Nathanson N. Viral Pathogenesis. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1997: 267-302Google Scholar).The genome of papillomaviruses is an approximately 8-kilobase pair double-stranded circular DNA. Because the productive life cycle takes place only in keratinocytes undergoing terminal squamous differentiation (4.Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Nathanson N. Viral Pathogenesis. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1997: 267-302Google Scholar), viral DNA replication is studied either in a cell-free system or in transiently transfected cells (reviewed in Refs.5.Chow L.T.

In cell-free replication, high concentrations of E1 can initiate replication even in the absence of an ori. But at low E1 concentrations, E2 protein is absolutely necessary for origin-specific replication and is thought to play a role in the assembly of the preinitiation complex (8.Kuo S.-R. Liu J.-S.

Virol. 74, in press.Additional cellular proteins also interact with the viral replication proteins and play major roles in regulating HPV DNA replication. For example, cellular transcription factor YY1 binds to the E2 protein and inhibits HPV ori replication (33.Lee K.-Y. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4911-4917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human heat shock/chaperone protein Hsp70 and the co-chaperone Hsp40 additively stimulate HPV-11 E1 binding to the ori (34.Liu J.-S.

In particular, electron microscopic observations reveal that Hsp40 promotes efficient assembly of di-hexameric HPV-11 E1 complexes on the ori, as would be required for bidirectional replication. Di-hexameric BPV-1 E1 protein complexes have also been observed in the absence of added Hsp40 (20.Fouts E.T., Yu, X. Egelman E.H. Botchan M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4447-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).By using expression cloning, we previously identified a shortened HPV-18 E1 protein as one of several proteins in HeLa cells that interact with cyclin E/CDK2 (35.Ma T. Zou N. Lin B.-Y. Chow L.T. Harper J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). HeLa is a cervical carcinoma-derived cell line containing multiple copies of integrated HPV-18 DNA. We then demonstrated that the replication-competent, full-length HPV-11 E1 protein can interact with several different cyclin/cdk complexes, including cyclin E and cyclin A complexes, and these interactions require a conserved RXL motif located in the amino-terminal portion of the E1 protein (35.Ma T. Zou N. Lin B.-Y. Chow L.T. Harper J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 4T. Ma and J. W. Harper, unpublished results. 4T. Ma and J. W. Harper, unpublished results. This motif, first found in the p21CIP1 class of cdk inhibitors (36.Adams P.D. Sellers W.R. Sharma S.K. Wu A.D. Nalin C.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), is now recognized as a primary cyclin-targeting motif, and in the case of HPV-11 E1, mutation of this motif greatly reduces the efficiency of phosphorylation of E1 by cyclin E/CDK2. The E2 protein does not directly bind cyclin E, but it is also a substrate for phosphorylation when present in a quaternary complex containing the E1 protein. A functional role for at least one cyclin/cdk complex in HPV replication is indicated by the fact that E1 mutations in either the RXL motif or in serine or threonine residues that are consensus cdk substrates dramatically reduce replication efficiency (35.Ma T. Zou N. Lin B.-Y. Chow L.T. Harper J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The BPV-1 E1 protein also binds to cyclin E of Xenopus laevis, and theXenopus cyclin E/CDK2 increases BPV-1 ori replication by E1 in Xenopus egg extracts (37.Cueille N. Nougarede R. Mechali F. Phillipe M. Bonne-Andrea C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7255-7262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cdks comprise a family of proteins that function at distinct phases of the cell cycle to catalyze cell cycle transitions. Following the activities of cyclin D1/CDK4 and CDK6, S phase entry requires cyclin E-dependent kinases. These kinases inactivate the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein, pRB, which negatively controls the E2F transcription pathway. Overexpression of cyclin E/CDK2 or cyclin E/CDK3 can mobilize quiescent fibroblasts (38.Connell-Crowley L. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 65-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 39.Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Cook J.G. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cyclin E/CDK2 complex also functions downstream of the pRB/E2F pathway (41.Leng X. Connell-Crowley L. Goodrich D. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,42.Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) to activate chromosomal replication. For example, cellular DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts requires an active CDK2, presumably in complex with cyclin E (43.Jackson P.K. Chevalier S. Philippe M. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 44.Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The speculation is that cyclin E/CDK2 may directly regulate the formation or activity of the pre-replication complex, including certain MCM proteins (reviewed in Ref. 45.Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar). In contrast, cyclin A/CDK2 and cyclin A/CDC2 are needed for S phase progression and passage through the G2/M transition. However, it is currently unclear to what extent cyclin E and cyclin A play redundant or independent roles in DNA replication, in part because the primary targets of these kinases in the replication process are largely unknown.We previously showed that HPV ori-containing plasmids replicate transiently but efficiently in a wide range of human and animal cell lines. In contrast, replication is very poor in a number of cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines that contain and express integrated HPV-16 DNA, such as CaSki or SiHa, or HPV-18 DNA, notably HeLa (21.Chiang C.-M. Ustav M. Stenlund A. Ho T.F. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5799-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This low activity cannot be entirely attributed to poor transfection, because extracts of HeLa cells also fail to support efficient HPV ori replication, whereas those of human 293 cells (human kidney epithelial cells transformed by adenovirus E1A and E1B) do so efficiently (8.Kuo S.-R. Liu J.-S. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24058-24065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, HeLa cells may contain an inhibitor of HPV ori replication, or they are deficient in certain protein(s) critical for HPV DNA replication. In this study, we demonstrate that HeLa cell extracts are highly competent in supporting efficient SV40 ori replication in the presence of SV40 T antigen and that small amounts of 293 cell extracts complement HeLa cell extracts in initiating HPV ori replication. However, this activity, which is abundant in 293 cell extracts, does not biochemically fractionate in a manner consistent with any known replication proteins and has been most challenging to purify and identify. 5J.-S. Liu, S.-R. Kuo, T. R. Broker, and L. T. Chow, unpublished results. 5J.-S. Liu, S.-R. Kuo, T. R. Broker, and L. T. Chow, unpublished results. HeLa cDNA sequences indicate that the amino-terminal portion of the HPV-18 E1 protein, including the putative cyclin E-binding motif RXL, is expressed (35.Ma T. Zou N. Lin B.-Y. Chow L.T. Harper J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 46.Schneider-Gädicke A. Schwarz E.

Virol. 1988; 62: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that a cyclin E/CDK2 complex partially complements HeLa cells in vivo and in vitro. Conversely, a HeLa cell-derived HPV-18 E1 protein, which is truncated at the carboxyl terminus, inhibits HPV replication in 293 cell extracts and in HeLa cell extracts complemented with cyclin E/CDK2. These observations suggest that sequestration of cyclin E/CDK2 by the endogenous, truncated HPV-18 E1 protein in HeLa cells is at least partly responsible for inefficient HPV replication. By taking advantage of this property of HeLa cell extracts, we demonstrate that cyclin A/CDK2, cyclin A/CDC2, and cyclin B/CDC2 do not possess this complementation activity. The implications of these observations concerning viral and cellular DNA replication are discussed.DISCUSSIONWe have previously shown that HPV-11 E1 protein binds to several cyclins and that phosphorylation by one or more cyclin/CDK complexes is essential for efficient HPV ori replication in transient and cell-free replication. However, the identity of the cyclin/CDK that functions during the initiation of replication was not known (35.Ma T. Zou N. Lin B.-Y. Chow L.T. Harper J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study, by taking advantage of the observation that HeLa cells and cell extracts support HPV ori replication poorly (8.Kuo S.-R. Liu J.-S. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24058-24065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) due to a deficiency in one or more novel factors (Fig. 1) and acting on an educated guess, we conducted experiments demonstrating that a functional cyclin E/CDK2 or cyclin E/CDK3 complex, but not other cyclin-dependent kinases, comprises a significant portion of the limiting components (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Both CDK2 and CDK3 complement a temperature-sensitive mutation in the CDC28 kinase in budding yeast and are implicated in the G1/S transition in mammalian cells, but the available evidence indicates that they are not functionally redundant (Refs. 38.Connell-Crowley L. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 65-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 40.Van den Huevel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, and 52.Hofmann F. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar and references therein). These kinases inactivate the pRb growth control pathway and can also function downstream of this pathway to activate chromosomal DNA replication in the absence of pRb phosphorylation (39.Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Cook J.G. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6626-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 42.Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 49.Connell-Crowley L. Harper J.W. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). One proposed role for the cyclin E/CDK2 complex is the phosphorylation of MCM proteins, but precisely how it regulates MCMs and perhaps additional targets during initiation of replication is unknown (45.Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is not known whether cyclin A/CDK2 can substitute for cyclin E/CDK2 in these phosphorylation activities. However, the tight correlation between cyclin E and S phase entry would seem to suggest that the cyclin E/CDK2 complex, rather than cyclin A/CDK2, functions during initiation of DNA replication. The present study, together with our previous analyses of E1 mutations in potential phosphorylation sites and in the cyclin-binding site (35.Ma T. Zou N. Lin B.-Y. Chow L.T. Harper J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), demonstrates for the first time that the phosphorylation activity of cyclin E/CDK2 or cyclin E/CDK3 plays a unique and critical role in the initiation of DNA replication. Most importantly, this role cannot be fulfilled by an excess of other cdks.The deficiency of cyclin E/CDK2 activity in HeLa cell extracts as far as HPV replication is concerned cannot be attributed to a low concentration of cyclin E, as a Western blot revealed similar amounts of cyclin E and CDK2 in HeLa and 293 cell extracts (Fig.7). Rather, we suggest that HeLa cells are phenotypically limiting in cyclin E/CDK2 activity for HPV ori replication attributable to sequestration by the endogenous, replication-incompetent HPV-18 E1 protein. At present, the truncated HPV-18 E1/cyclin E/CDK2 complex in HeLa cells cannot be demonstrated directly for lack of an antibody to the HPV-18 E1 protein. Nevertheless, several observations support this interpretation. First, HeLa-derived HPV-18 E1 protein binds to cyclin E/CDK2 in vitro, as does the full-length HPV-11 E1 (Fig. 5), which also forms a complex with cyclin E/CDK2 in vivo in insect cells and mammalian cells (35.Ma T. Zou N. Lin B.-Y. Chow L.T. Harper J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Second, the observation that a low level of replication was detected in unsupplemented HeLa cell extracts in the presence of higher concentrations or more active preparations of E1 (Fig. 2, data not shown) is consistent with a competition between the exogenous E1 and the endogenous E1 for a limiting factor. Third, HPV ori replication in 293 or complemented HeLa cell extracts is inhibited by exogenous HeLa-derived E1 protein (Fig. 6 A). However, we cannot exclude the possibility of additional mechanisms of inhibition by the HeLa E1 protein, such as a titration of host DNA replication proteins or the formation of non-functional, mixed oligomers with the full-length E1 protein, as the addition of the replication-competent, full-length HPV-18 E1 reduced replication by HPV-11 E1 and E2 proteins somewhat (data not shown). Be that as it may, none of these other modes of repression can account for the unique ability of cyclin E/CDK2 or cyclin E/CDK3, among the various cdks, to complement HeLa cell extracts.One might ask why cellular and SV40 DNA replication were not affected by the endogenous HPV-18 E1 protein. Phosphorylation by cdks of threonine 124 of the T antigen of SV40 or polyomavirus is known to regulate its replication function. Although a role of cyclin E/CDK2 has not been examined directly in a replication reaction, this threonine residue is phosphorylated in vitro efficiently by cyclin A and cyclin B-dependent kinases but poorly by cyclin E/CDK2 (53.Cannella D. Roberts J.M. Fotedar R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 105: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Li H. Bhattacharyya S. Prives C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6479-6485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55.McVey D. Ray S. Gluzman Y. Berger L. Wildeman A.G. Marshak D.R. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Weisshart K. Taneja P. Jenne A. Herbig U. Simmons D.T. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that T antigen is not regulated by cyclin E/CDK2 and hence insensitive to cyclin E/CDK2 sequestration by the defective HPV-18 E1 protein. Yet, the possibilities remain that cyclin E/CDK2 is also required for some aspect of SV40 replication, as is cellular DNA replication, but T antigen and cellular substrates are capable of effectively competing with the endogenous HPV-18 E1 in HeLa cells. We note that both 293 and HeLa cells harbor elevated cyclin E protein or mRNA relative to normal fibroblasts devoid of viral oncogenes (57.Chang Z.-F. Huang D.-Y. Lai T.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27374-27379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 58.Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12146-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) due to a transcriptional up-regulation by, respectively, the adenovirus E1A and HPV E7 protein. Both oncoproteins target the pRB/E2F pathway (Ref. 4.Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Nathanson N. Viral Pathogenesis. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1997: 267-302Google Scholar and references therein). Alternatively, the truncated HPV-18 E1/cyclin E/cdk complex might be capable of phosphorylating substrates relevant for cellular and SV40 replication. Indeed, we have previously shown that the E1/cyclin E/CDK2 complex retains activity toward the exogenous substrate histone H1 and the associated substrate E2 (35.Ma T. Zou N. Lin B.-Y. Chow L.T. Harper J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, in principle, cyclin E may be capable of performing at least some of its functions even when associated with E1. Consistent with some of the hypotheses, addition of the HeLa-derived HPV-18 E1 protein also partially inhibited cell-free SV40 ori replication in the presence of T antigen, and the activity was partially restored by the addition of cyclin E/CDK2, but not cyclin E/cdk (dn) (Fig. 6 B, compare lanes 1–4 andlane 8).

Renal proximal tubular brush border membrane expresses the IIa isoform, whereas the IIb isoform is preferentially expressed in small intestinal brush border membrane of mammals. IIa and IIb proteins are predicted to contain eight transmembrane domains with the N- and C-terminal tails facing the cytoplasm. They differ in their pH dependences: the activity of IIa increases at higher pH, whereas the IIb shows no or a slightly opposite pH dependence. To determine the structural domains responsible for the difference in pH sensitivity, mouse IIa and IIb chimeras were constructed, and their pH dependence was characterized. A region between the fourth and fifth transmembrane domains was required for conferring pH sensitivity to the IIa-mediated Na/Picotransport. Sequence comparison (IIa versus IIb) of the third extracellular loops revealed a stretch of three charged amino acids in IIa (REK) replaced by uncharged residues in IIb (GNT). Introduction of the uncharged GNT sequence (by REK) in IIa abolished its pH dependence, whereas introduction of the charged REK stretch in IIb (by GNT) led to a pH dependence similar to IIa.

These data indicate that the pH sensitivity of renal brush border Na/Pi cotransport (IIa-mediated) is not explained by a titration of divalent Pi, as a preferred species transported (18.Cheng L.

Thus, the differences in pH sensitivity between IIa- and IIb-mediated Na/Pi cotransporter activities may be attributable to differences within the two proteins. The aim of the present work was to identify the structural domains that confer pH sensitivity to the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter. For this purpose, we constructed several mouse IIa-mouse IIb chimeras as well as mutated Na/Pi cotransporters and compared their pH dependences with those of the wild type proteins. These studies were done by expression of the various constructs in X. laevisoocytes and measurement of the Na+-dependent Pi uptake over an extracellular pH range from 6.2 to 8. Our data suggest that the third extracellular loop is involved in conferring the pH sensitivity of the IIa-mediated Pitransport. Within this loop, a cluster of three charged amino acids (REK), present in IIa but not in IIb Na/Pi cotransporters, are necessary to provide the pH dependence to IIa. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). The site-directed mutagenesis kit containing Pfu DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene, and the restriction and modifying enzymes were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Life Technologies, Inc. All chemicals were purchased from Fluka. All constructs were cloned in pSPORT-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The partial cDNA fragments used to construct the chimeras were amplified by PCR,1 using as template the wild type (WT) mouse IIa or IIb cDNAs subcloned into pSPORT and the indicated nucleotides as primers (see TableI). PCR reactions were performed usingPfu DNA Polymerase, and 30 thermal cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min/kb of PCR target.

To obtain the IIa fragment, WT IIa was amplified using the primers 1-SphI and 2-BglII in which SphI and BglII restriction sites were introduced (shown in bold in Table I). Then, the PCR fragments as well as the WT IIb were digested with BglII and SphI. The double digestion of the WT IIb cotransporter produced two fragments: one of about 1 kb containing the N-terminal portion, and one other of about 7 kb containing the last five TDs plus the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail and the whole pSPORT sequence. After purification in 1% agarose gel, the appropriate fragments were ligated over night with T4 Ligase at 16 °C. The IIb-IIa chimera contained the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail plus the first three TDs of IIb, and the last five TDs plus the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IIa (see Fig. 1). The IIa fragment was amplified using the primers 3-SalI and 4-BglII in which the indicated restriction sites were introduced (shown in bold in Table I). Then, the WT IIb and the IIa-PCR product were digested withSalI and BglII. This double digestion released two fragments from the WT IIb cotransporter: one of about 4.5 kb containing the three N-terminal TDs and the whole pSPORT sequence, and another of about 3.5 kb containing the C-terminal portion. After purification in agarose gel, the appropriate fragments (see Fig. 1) were ligated as described before. The IIaN-IIbC chimera contained the N-terminal tail plus the eight TDs from IIa and only the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail from IIb cotransporter (see Fig. 1). We used the primers 1-SphI and 5-NheI to amplify the IIa fragment and primers 10-NheI and 9 (downstream of a SalI site located in the polylinker) and 10-NheI to amplify the C-terminal tail of the IIb. Both PCR fragments were digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes. In addition, pSPORT was digested with SphI and SalI. After purification in agarose gel, a three-fragments ligation was carried out overnight. The IIbN-IIaC chimera contained the N-terminal tail plus the eight TDs of IIb and only the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IIa (see Fig. 1). We amplified by PCR the IIb fragment using the primers 7 (upstream of aSphI site located in the polylinker) and 8-NheI; for amplification of the IIa cytoplasmic tail, the primers 3-SalI and 6-NheI were used. Then, we followed a strategy similar to that described for the IIaN-IIbC chimera. The IIaN6-IIb chimera contained the N-terminal tail plus the first six TDs from IIa and the last two C-terminal TDs plus the C-terminal tail from IIb cotransporter (see Fig. 1). The IIa fragment was amplified using primers 1-SphI and 12-NheI and the IIb portion with primers 14-NheI and 9. We then followed an approach similar to that described for the IIaN-IIbC chimera. Plasmids encoding the chimeric constructs were introduced intoEscherichia coli competent cells. After plasmid purification sequences were verified by automatic sequencing (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). Mutations of the REK residues of IIa to GNT, and GNT of IIb to REK, were done by site-directed mutagenesis. Briefly 20 ng of the plasmids containing the WT mouse IIa or mouse IIb cDNAs were amplified with 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase in the presence of 250 nmoverleaping primers containing in the middle of their sequence the three mutated codons (GNT-s and GNT-as for IIa, and REK-s and REK-as for IIb; see Table I). PCR amplification was performed with 25 thermal cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 16 min. Then, 10 units of DpnI were added directly to the amplification reaction, and the sample was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to digest the parental, methylated DNA. XL1-blue supercompetent cells were finally transformed with 1 μl of the reaction mixture and plated onto LB-ampicillin plates. After plasmid purification sequences were verified by automatic sequencing (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). The procedures for oocytes preparation and cRNA injection, as well as for the 32Pi uptake assay have been described in detail elsewhere (22.Werner A. Biber J. Forgo J. Palacin M. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12331-12336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNAs encoding the two WT and the constructs were first linearized. In vitro synthesis and capping of cRNAs were done by incubating the linearized cDNAs in the presence of Cap Analog (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and 40 units of T7 RNA polymerase (for WT IIa and IIa-GNT) or Sp6 RNA polymerase (for WT IIb, IIb-REK, and the chimeric constructs). Oocytes were injected with either 50 nl of water or 50 nl of water containing 5 ng of cRNA.32Pi uptake was measured 4 days after cRNA injection as already described (22.Werner A. Biber J. Forgo J. Palacin M. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12331-12336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using external solutions with pH adjusted to 6.2, 7.4, and 8. Throughout the study, we have shown experiments obtained with single batches of oocytes, with 8–10 oocytes measured for each experimental condition. All studies have been performed with qualitatively similar data on at least three batches of oocytes. To identify the regions responsible for the different pH dependence of the IIa and IIb Na/Pi cotransporters, we have constructed several chimeras (Fig. 1). The first set of constructs contained approximately half of each type of cotransporter: the IIa-IIb chimera comprised the first 304 amino acids (N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and the three first TDs) from IIa, and the last 395 amino acids (last five TDs and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail) from IIb. In the complementary IIb-IIa chimera, the first 301 amino acids correspond to IIb and the last 332 amino acids to the IIa. Because most of the differences between IIa and IIb reside in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails, we constructed a second set of chimeras with only interchanged cytoplasmic tails. Thus, the IIaN-IIbC chimera comprised the first 596 amino acids (N-terminal cytoplasmic tail plus eight TDs) of IIa and the last 84 amino acids (C-terminal tail) from IIb. To obtain the complementary IIbN-IIaC chimera, we fused the first 612 residues of IIb to the last 41 amino acids of IIa. Finally, the IIaN6-IIb chimera was constructed by fusing the first 487 residues (N-terminal cytoplasmic tail plus six TDs) of IIa to the last 193 amino acids (last two TDs plus the C-terminal tail) of IIb. Based on Western blot analysis using IIa- and IIb-specific antibodies (11.Hilfiker H. Hattenhauer O. Traebert M. Forster I. Murer H. Biber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14564-14569Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 12.Custer M. Lotscher M. Biber J. Murer H. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F767-F774PubMed Google Scholar), we found that all chimeras were synthesized in oocytes after cRNA-injection although their level of expression was only about 25–30% compared with the wild types (data not shown). In a previous study we have shown that, in oocytes, transport activity correlates with the transporter present in the surface membrane but not with the total amount of protein (23.Forster I. Traebert M. Jankowski M. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. J. Physiol (London). 1999; 517: 327-340Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we have measured Na+-dependent Pi uptake and its pH dependence for all the different constructs. Because we did not quantify the transporter at the surface, we cannot make conclusions about the influence of the different chimeric constructions on overall transport characteristics (e.g. transport rates) but only on the effect on pH dependence. As shown in Fig. 2, the Pitransport activities of all chimeric constructions were significantly higher than that of water-injected oocytes in the presence of 100 mm Na+ and at pH 7.4. The Pi uptake activities were entirely dependent on the presence of Na+(data not shown). Thus, all chimeric proteins are present at the oocyte surface and mediate Na/Pi cotransport. This was a prerequisite for our analysis of the pH dependence of Pitransport activity mediated by these chimeric proteins (see below). The pH dependence of the WT IIa and IIb as well as the chimeric cotransporters was analyzed in oocytes by measuring the Na+-dependent 32Piuptake at three external pH values: 6.2, 7.4, and 8. As shown in Fig.3 A, the Na/Picotransport mediated by the WT IIa increased with higher pH values. This increase is a characteristic feature of IIa cotransporters (7.Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Sorribas V. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5979-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) that most likely reflects an interaction of protons with the unloaded carrier and the last Na+ binding step. 2I. Forster, J. Biber, and H. Murer, submitted for publication. In contrast, IIb-mediated Na/Pi cotransport was largely independent of the external pH and was even slightly higher at more acidic pH (11.Hilfiker H. Hattenhauer O. Traebert M. Forster I. Murer H. Biber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14564-14569Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the IIb-IIa chimera behaved similarly to the WT IIa, with higher activity at higher pH values. In contrast, the IIa-IIb chimeras showed no pH dependence, similarly to the WT IIb. Therefore, the pH dependence can be attributed to sequences within the C-terminal half of IIa. We next analyzed the chimeras in which only the C-tails were interchanged. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the C-terminal tail does not seem to be involved in the pH dependence of IIa since replacement with the IIb tail did not abolish the pH dependence of IIa, and conversely the IIa tail did not restore the pH dependence of the IIb. These experiments suggested that the pH-dependent site is located within the last five TDs of IIa. To locate more specifically the pH-sensitive region, we tested a chimera containing the first six TDs of IIa and only the last two TDs and the C-terminal tail of IIb. Fig. 3 D shows that this chimera (IIaN6-IIb) has pH sensitivity similar to the WT IIa. Thus, the domain responsible for the pH sensitivity of IIa is located between the fourth and sixth TD, i.e. within the third extracellular loop. In a cysteine-scanning study on to the rat IIa cotransporter, the third extracellular loop was found to be of functional importance (25.Lambert G. Forster I. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A sequence comparison of this loop revealed a high degree of homology between the mouse IIa and IIb; however, a cluster and single residues differ (Fig. 4). Among them, three charged amino acids (REK) present in IIa correspond to three neutral amino acids (GNT) in IIb. Single amino acid substitution in the rat IIa cotransporter indicated that replacement of charged amino acid residues at sites 462 (R) and 464 (K) by cysteines, reduced the pH sensitivity of the mutants as compared with the WT. 3G. Lambert, G. Stange, I. Forster, J. Biber, and H. Murer, unpublished observations. Moreover, these charged amino acids are conserved in IIa proteins identified from various species, all of which show the same characteristic increase in transport activity with increasing pH (7.Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Sorribas V. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5979-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 11.Hilfiker H. Hattenhauer O. Traebert M. Forster I. Murer H. Biber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14564-14569Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of these three residues in determining pH sensitivity of IIa. Replacement of the charged amino acids in the IIa protein by the IIb neutral residues (construct IIa-GNT) led to the loss of the characteristic IIa pH dependence, such that the cotransporter behaved similarly to the WT IIb (Fig. 5,A and B). Furthermore, pH sensitivity could be introduced into the IIb protein by replacing the neutral residues with the IIa charged amino acids residues (IIb-REK) so that this construct now mimicked the strong pH dependence of the WT IIa (Fig. 5,A and B). The behavior of these two constructs strongly suggested that the cluster of three charged amino acids (REK) located on the third extracellular loop is responsible for the pH dependence of IIa.Figure 5Site-directed mutagenesis in the third extracellular loop.

Biochem. 1998; 8: 46-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A charged residue (Glu-419) has been reported to play a role in the pH sensitivity of a chloride channel (ClC-2G419) (27.Stroffekova K. Kupert E.Y. Malinowska D.H. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1113-C1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the bacterial Na+/H+ antiporter (NhaA), His-225 has been proposed as part of the pH sensor (28.Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); furthermore, Leu-73 and/or its vicinity may contribute to the pH sensitivity of the antiporter (29.Noumi T. Inoue H. Sakurai T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the mammalian Na+/H+ antiporter (NHE1 and related isoforms), a pH-modifier site seems to be located in the N-terminal TD although its precise sequence has not been identified (30.Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Also for the mammalian AE2 anion exchanger, a chimera approach led to the identification of the region involved in the pH sensitivity of anion exchanger (24.Zhang Y. Chernova M. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Jiang L. Alper S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5741-5749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified a “molecular determinant” of the pH sensitivity of the IIa Na/Pi cotransporter, namely three charged amino acids located in the third extracellular loop (REK) which play a critical role in determining the specific pH dependence of the renal cotransporter."

Strikingly, significant levels of N-tail translocation is seen only when a minimum of four of the transmembrane segments are present; for constructs with fewer transmembrane segments, the N-tail remains mostly nontranslocated and the majority of the molecules adopt an “inverted” topology where normally nontranslocated parts are translocated and vice versa. N-tail translocation can also be promoted by shortening of the N-tail and by the addition of positively charged residues immediately downstream of the first trasnmembrane segment. We conclude that as many as four consecutive transmembrane segments may be collectively involved in determining membrane protein topology in the ER and that the effects of downstream sequence determinants may vary depending on the size and charge of the N-tail. We also provide evidence to suggest that the ProW N-tail is translocated across the ER membrane in a C-to-N-terminal direction.

Two general mechanisms for the membrane assembly of a polytopic membrane protein have been proposed. In the first, the overall topology is assumed to be determined by the most N-terminal TM, with downstream TMs serving alternately as stop transfer and signal anchor sequences (1.Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The second model suggests that topogenic information is spread throughout the protein and that downstream TMs may affect the orientation of upstream ones (2.Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 3.Zhang J.-T. Chen M. Han E. Wang C. Mol. Biol.

Kuhn A. von Heijne G. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 380-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). N-tail translocation is presumably initiated by a hydrophobic “reverse signal-anchor” sequence that also becomes the first TM segment (6.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M.

In eukaryotic cells, N-tail translocation has been shown to proceed by the normal signal recognition particle-Sec61 pathway (11.Oliver J. Jungnickel B. Görlich D. Rapoport T. High S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and to require an unfolded N-terminal domain (12.Denzer A.J. Nabholz C.E. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, N-tail translocation in Escherichia coli appears to be possible both by a SecA-dependent (10.McMurry J.L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6776-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and by a Sec-independent mechanism (6.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M.

In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, it seems that the presence of too many positively charged amino acids can prevent N-tail translocation, whereas negatively charged residues may facilitate translocation (6.Whitley P.

Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18.Haardt M. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5370-5381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is one of the longest known N-tails. Earlier studies in E. coli have shown that the ProW N-tail can be efficiently translocated across the inner membrane (6.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7.Whitley P. Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29831-29835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have now expressed ProW in vitro in the presence of ER-derived dog pancreas microsomes and have studied N-tail translocation in the full-length protein as well as in fusion constructs lacking one or more TM segments and with N-tails of different lengths. Strikingly, and in contrast to previous findings inE. coli, we find that a minimum of four TM segments must be present to reach appreciable levels of N-tail translocation; constructs with up to three TM segments mainly adopt an “inverted” topology with the N-tail in the cytoplasm. Shortening of the N-tail increases translocation efficiency and reduces the number of TMs that need to be present for N-tail translocation to occur.The full-length ProW N-tail is efficiently translocated across the ER membrane when fused to the N terminus of another E. coliinner membrane protein, leader peptidase (Lep). Studies of the kinetics of glycosylation of Asn-Xaa-Thr acceptor sites located either early or late in the N-tail in this construct strongly suggest that N-tail translocation proceeds in a C-to-N-terminal direction.These observations show that the whole TM1-TM4 region of ProW can influence N-tail translocation across the ER membrane. Thus, distant downstream sequence determinants can affect the insertion of the most N-terminal parts of a polytopic membrane protein into the ER membrane.RESULTSTo study N-tail translocation in the ProW protein in a microsome-supplemented in vitro translation system, we engineered series of ProW fusion proteins and truncated ProW variants containing unique N- or C-terminal N-glycosylation acceptor Asn-Xaa-Thr sites. In most constructs, the N-terminal glycosylation site was placed at residues 5–7 in the ProW N-tail by mutating these residues to Asn-Asn-Thr. As C-terminal reporters we used both the P2-domain (residues 81–323) from the E. coli inner membrane protein Lep and a short C-terminal tag (C*) including an Asn-Leu-Thr glycosylation acceptor site followed by an 18-residue-long tail (see “Materials and Methods”). The P2 reporter has a naturally occurring glycosylation site (Asn214-Glu-Thr) and is well suited for topological mappings based on N-linked glycosylation (27.van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,28.Nakai T. Yamasaki A. Sakaguchi M. Kosaka K. Mihara K. Amaya Y. Miura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23647-23658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A truncated version of the P2 domain, P2′ (residues 81–215), lacking the glycosylation site was also used. All constructs were expressed in vitro in the absence or presence of dog pancreas rough microsomes. Because N-linked glycosylation occurs only in the lumen of the microsomes, the localization of the introduced acceptor sites can be determined by assaying their glycosylation status. Addition of a single N-linked oligosaccharide to the nascent chain leads to an increase in molecular mass of about 2 kDa that is easily detectable by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Topology of Full-length ProW in MicrosomesThe topology of ProW in the inner membrane of E. coli has previously been determined by PhoA/LacZ fusion analysis and protease mapping (6.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18.Haardt M. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5370-5381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the protein has seven TM segments, and the long N-tail is located in the periplasm. The topology of full-length ProW in microsomes was probed by (i) introducing a glycosylation acceptor site in positions 5–7 in the N-tail, (ii) constructing a full-length ProW/P2* fusion, and (iii) adding a short C-terminal extension (C*) containing a glycosylation acceptor site to the full-length protein. In what follows, an asterisk always indicates the presence of an Asn-Xaa-Thr glycosylation acceptor site in the relevant domain.As shown in Fig. 2, ∼30% of the molecules with the N-terminal acceptor site were glycosylated when expressed in vitro in the presence of microsomes, whereas essentially no glycosylation was seen for the two C-terminal reporters. Because the maximal glycosylation efficiency routinely obtained in ourin vitro system is ∼80% (see, e.g. construct TM1/P2* in Fig. 3 A and construct *TM1–3(3R)/P2′ in Fig. 5 A), we conclude that the N-tail is translocated into the lumen of the microsomes in ∼40% of the molecules and that the ProW C terminus is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.Figure 2Localization of the N and C termini of full-length ProW relative to the microsomal membrane. *ProW (lanes 1 and 2), ProW/C* (lanes 3 and4), and ProW/P2* (lanes 5 and 6) (asterisk indicates the location of a unique glycosylation site in the relevant domain) were expressed in vitro in the absence (−) and presence (+) of rough dog pancreas microsomes (RM).

Unexpectedly, the P2* fusions after TM1 and TM3 were efficiently glycosylated, whereas the fusion after TM2 was not glycosylated. On the other hand, and in agreement with the topology determined in E. coli, the fusions after TM4 and TM6 were more efficiently glycosylated than those after TM5 and TM7. These observations suggest that the TM1–3 part of ProW, when expressed without the downstream TM segments, inserts with an inverted topology compared with that adopted by the full-length molecules. In contrast, the majority of the molecules in the longer ProW/P2* fusions have the same C-terminal orientation as in E. coli.To check whether the length of the C-terminal fusion domain could affect the topology, fusions to the short C* tag were also analyzed (Fig. 3 A, white bars). In general, glycosylation levels were lower in this case; this was expected, because glycosylation acceptor sites located close to the C terminus of a protein are less efficiently modified than internal sites (29.Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9465-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 3I. Nilsson and G. von Heijne, unpublished data. The results for the C* fusions paralleled those of the P2* fusions, except for construct TM1/C*, which was poorly glycosylated. Possibly, because co-translational targeting may not be possible in this construct where the TM1 segment is still mostly inside the ribosome at the time of chain termination, the protein is only inefficiently targeted to the microsomes. In general, however, the qualitative picture is the same for the ProW/P2* and ProW/C* fusions, suggesting that the length of the C-terminal reporter domain has little influence on the topology.To rule out the possibility that lack of glycosylation was a consequence of lack of membrane insertion of the protein, we checked the membrane insertion of the TM1–2/P2* and TM1–3/P2* constructs by carbonate extraction (30.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). Both constructs were quantitatively retained in the alkali-extracted membrane pellet, demonstrating proper assembly into the microsomal membrane.Because the C-terminal fusions suggested that the topology may be different for proteins with up to three TM domains and those with four or more, we also assayed N-tail translocation in these constructs. To this end, we expressed *ProW/P2′ fusions and truncated *ProW molecules with a unique glycosylation acceptor site in the N-tail (Fig.3 C). Little glycosylation of the N-tail was seen for the *TM1/P2′, *TM1–2/P2′, and *TM1–3/P2′ constructs, whereas the *TM1–4/P2′, *TM1–5/P2′, *TM1–6/P2′, and *TM1–7/P2′ constructs were glycosylated to between 20 and 30% (black bars). Similar results were seen with the truncated ProW molecules (white bars), except that the *TM1–4 construct was very inefficiently glycosylated. Thus, N-tail translocation increases significantly when at least four (P2′ fusions) or five (truncated ProW molecules) TM segments are present. The length of the C-terminal tail thus makes little difference, except for the *TM1–4 constructs.We conclude that only a very minor fraction of the ProW/P2 constructs with up to three TM segments is oriented with the N-tail in the lumen, whereas a significant fraction (30–40%) of those with four or more TM segments has a lumenal N-tail. The efficiency of N-tail translocation in the TM1–4 constructs apparently depends on the length of the C-terminal tail, with a longer C-tail favoring a lumenal orientation of the N-tail.Addition of Positively Charged Residues in the TM1-TM2 Loop Affects the Topology of the TM1–2/P2 and TM1–3/P2 ConstructsThe TM1–2 loop lacks positively charged residues (Fig. 1), which may contribute to the unexpected topology of the shorter ProW constructs. To test this notion, three positively charged arginine residues were inserted between positions 119 and 120 in the TM1-TM2 loop, and the topology of the resulting TM1–2(3R) and TM1–3(3R) P2* and P2′ fusions was probed by the glycosylation status of unique N-terminal and C-terminal acceptor sites (Fig. 4 A). The N-tail was still poorly glycosylated in both the *TM1–2(3R)/P2′ and *TM1–3(3R)/P2′ constructs. In contrast, the P2-domain was more efficiently glycosylated in the TM1–2(3R)/P2* construct than in the parent TM1–2/P2* construct (34% versus 10%;cf. Fig. 3 A), while the TM1–3(3R)/P2* construct was much less efficiently glycosylated than its parent (7%versus 60%). To rule out the possibility that the position of the glycosylation site in the N-tail affected these results, we introduced a second acceptor site in position 80, i.e. 20 residues upstream of TM1. The two resulting constructs, **TM1–3/P2′ and **TM1–3(3R)/P2′, were as poorly glycosylated as the parent constructs (data not shown). We also introduced six consecutive arginines in the TM1-TM2 loop; again, no N-tail translocation was seen for the resulting *TM1–3(6R)/P2′ construct (data not shown). Thus, although the introduction of positively charged residues in the TM1-TM2 loop leads to its retention in the cytoplasm (and translocation of the TM2-TM3 loop to the lumen), it does not promote translocation of the N-tail (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Addition of three Arg residues to the TM1–2 loop enhances its retention in the cytoplasm. A, constructs *TM1–2(3R)/P2′ (lanes 1 and 2), TM1–2(3R)/P2* (lanes 3 and 4), *TM1–3(3R)/P2′ (lanes 5 and 6), and TM1–3(3R)/P2* (lanes 7 and8) were expressed in vitro in the absence (−) and presence (+) of rough microsomes (RM).

In all cases, a unique Asn3-Ser4-Thr5 glycosylation site was present in the N-tail. Little increase in N-tail glycosylation was seen for the shorter *TM1/P2′ and *TM1–2/P2′ constructs. In contrast, shortening of the N-tail in the *TM1–3/P2′ construct led to an appreciable increase in glycosylation efficiency. For the *TM1–3(3R)/P2′ construct, essentially complete N-tail translocation (i.e. ∼80% modification) was observed when the N-tail was shorter than ∼50 residues.N-tail translocation also became markedly more efficient in the *TM1–3/P2′, *TM1–4/P2′, *TM1–5/P2′, *TM1–6/P2′, and *TM1–7/P2′ constructs when the N-tail was shortened to 30 residues (Fig.5 B; see also black bars in Fig. 3 C), and similar results were obtained with the corresponding C-terminally truncated constructs (white bars; note that the *TM1(Δ1–70), *TM1–2(Δ1–70), and *TM1–3(Δ1–70) truncations were too poorly expressed to be analyzed).Thus, N-tail translocation can be promoted by shortening the N-tail, and can be further increased by the addition of positively charged residues to the TM1–2 loop. Again, for a given length of the N-tail, we observe more efficient N-tail translocation as the number of TM segments is increased. Interestingly, the short N-tail in the *ProW(Δ1–70)/P2′-constructs is predominantly located in the lumen already when only three TM domains are present, in contrast to the full-length N-tail where four TM domains are required for significant translocation of the N-tail (Fig. 3 C).Efficient N-tail Translocation by Replacement of the ProW TM DomainBecause the efficiency of N-tail translocation was found to depend mainly on the number of transmembrane segments, it was also of interest to check whether the identity of the transmembrane domain would affect the translocation efficiency. We thus constructed fusions between the ProW N-tail (residues 1–99) and Lep residues 1–215 (*Nt/Lep-P2′) or the full-length Lep protein (Nt/Lep-P2*). Lep has two transmembrane segments (residues 4–22 and 62–76), and both the N and C terminus face the lumen when Lep is integrated into microsomes (31.Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,32.Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 A). As shown in Fig. 6 B, the ProW N-tail was quite efficiently translocated in this context (59% glycosylation of *Nt/Lep-P2′), despite the fact that only two TM segments are present, and the P2 domain was likewise translocated into the lumen as seen from the efficient glycosylation (62%) of Nt/Lep-P2*.Figure 6Efficient translocation of the ProW N-tail when fused to the N terminus of Lep.

To this end, glycosylation acceptor sites were introduced in position 5 or 80 near the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the N-tail, respectively (Fig. 6 A). Synchronized translation was initiated by the addition of mRNA to the translation mix, and further chain initiation was blocked after 1.5 min by addition of the inhibitor aurintricarboxylic acid. The kinetics of glycosylation of the two sites was then followed as initially described by Rothman and Lodish (33.Rothman J. Lodish H. Nature. 1977; 269: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), i.e. by dissolving the microsomes by addition of the detergent Triton X-100 at different time points (thus preventing further glycosylation) and then allowing translation to go to completion. Results for the *Nt(Asn5)/Lep-P2′ and *Nt(Asn80)/Lep-P2′ constructs are shown in Fig.7 A. To rule out that the glycosylated forms of the two constructs represent different populations of molecules, the analysis was carried out also for construct **Nt(Asn5, Asn80)/Lep-P2′ containing both sites.Figure 7The ProW N-tail is translocated in a C-to-N-terminal direction. The *Nt(Asn5)/Lep-P2′ and *Nt(Asn80)/Lep-P2′ constructs were expressed in vitro in the presence of microsomes. After a 1.5-min incubation, aurintricarboxylic acid was added to block further initiation. Samples were removed at different time points, and Triton X-100 was added to dissolve the microsomes and block further glycosylation.

Mean values are shown bycrosses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As is clear from the quantitations in Fig. 7 B, glycosylation of the *Nt(Asn80)/Lep-P2′ construct preceded that of the *Nt(Asn5)/Lep-P2′ construct by about 3 min. Glycosylation of the Asn80 site was first detected about 7 min after initiation of translation. Separate measurement of the overall translation rate of the two constructs in the in vitrosystem yielded a value of 0.4 amino acids/s (data not shown). Assuming a uniform translation rate, the nascent chain is thus roughly 170 residues long after 7 min. Because approximately 70 residues are required to span the distance between the ribosomal P-site and the oligosaccharyl transferase active site (34.Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), glycosylation of Asn80 happens at about the time expected if translocation is initiated by TM1, whereas Asn5 is glycosylated ∼3 min later. Glycosylation of the **Nt(Asn5, Asn80)/Lep-P2′ construct proceeded in two steps separated by about 3 min, and the final glycosylation levels were 53% doubly glycosylated molecules and 14% singly glycosylated molecules (data not shown), consistent with the results for the single acceptor site mutants.These results strongly suggest that the N-tail is translocated into the lumen in a C-to-N-terminal direction, starting with the insertion of TM1 into the translocation apparatus. Interestingly, the rate of N-tail translocation estimated from this experiment is quite slow and roughly of the same order as the rate of chain elongation.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have analyzed the insertion of the E. coli inner membrane protein ProW into ER-derived microsomal membranes. In E. coli, the 100-residues long ProW N-tail is efficiently translocated across the inner membrane in the TM1–3/P2 construct, whereas in the shorter TM1/P2 construct it is translocated in about 50% of the molecules (6.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The lack of positively charged residues immediately downstream of TM1 has been shown to be at least partly responsible for the appearance of TM1/P2 molecules with an inverted Ncyt-Cexo topology (7.Whitley P. Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29831-29835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13.Cristobal S. Scotti P. Luirink J. von Heijne G. de Gier J.W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20068-20070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).The most unexpected finding in the present work is that very little N-tail translocation across the microsomal membrane is seen unless a minimum of four TM segments from ProW are present (Fig.8). Instead, an inverted topology with the N-tail on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane dominates for the TM1, TM1–2, and TM1–3 constructs as determined by the glycosylation status of the N-tail and two different C-terminal reporter domains. Only when a minimum of four TM segments are present do we find a significant fraction of molecules with the N-tail in the lumen. It thus appears that"
https://openalex.org/W2006785647,"Exposure of cells to oxidants increases the phosphorylation of the Src family tyrosine protein kinase Lck at Tyr-394, a conserved residue in the activation loop of the catalytic domain. Kinase-deficient Lck expressed in fibroblasts that do not express any endogenous Lck has been shown to be phosphorylated at Tyr-394 following H2O2 treatment to an extent indistinguishable from that seen with wild type Lck. This finding indicates that a kinase other than Lck itself is capable of phosphorylating Tyr-394. Because fibroblasts express other Src family members, it remained to be determined whether the phosphorylation of Tyr-394 was carried out by another Src family kinase or by an unrelated tyrosine protein kinase. We examined here whether Tyr-394 in kinase-deficient Lck was phosphorylated following exposure of cells devoid of endogenous Src family kinase activity to H2O2. Strikingly, treatment of such cells with H2O2 led to the phosphorylation of Tyr-394 to an extent identical to that seen with wild type Lck, demonstrating that Src family kinases are not required for H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Lck. Furthermore, this efficient phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394 in non-lymphoid cells suggests the existence of an ubiquitous activator of Src family kinases.

Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). For example, the Src family kinases c-Src, Yes, and Fyn are required for integrin-mediated signaling in response to cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (2.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Additionally, Lck, a lymphoid cell-specific member of the Src family (3.Sefton B.M. Campbell M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), is essential for both the development of T cells in the thymus and the response of mature T cells to signals arising from the T-cell antigen receptor (4.Molina T.J.

Src family kinases are 52–62-kDa cytoplasmic proteins consisting of an acylated N-terminal unique domain that mediates association with the plasma membrane, an SH31domain, an SH2 domain, a catalytic domain, and a short C-terminal regulatory tail (6.Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain interacts with poly-proline type II helices (7.Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), whereas the SH2 domain binds sites of tyrosine phosphorylation (8.Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Both the SH3 and SH2 domains play a role in the intramolecular regulation of Src family kinase activity (9.Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J.

The kinase activity of Src family members can be both inhibited and activated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine near the C terminus (Tyr-505 in Lck, Tyr-527 in c-Src) by the ubiquitous tyrosine protein kinase Csk (11.Thomas J.E. Soriano P. Brugge J.S.

This inactive “closed” conformation is further stabilized by binding of the SH3 domain to the linker between the SH2 domain and the catalytic domain (9.Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J.

Dephosphorylation of this site by the tyrosine phosphatase CD45, in the case of Lck, or R-PTP-α, in the case of c-Src, activates the kinase (15.Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P.

In contrast, phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine in the activation loop (Tyr-394 in Lck, Tyr-416 in c-Src) enhances kinase activity (19.Boulet I. Fagard R. Fischer S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20.Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21.Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In Lck, the phosphorylation of Tyr-394 is activating because it stabilizes the catalytic active site by forming hydrogen bonds with Arg-387 and Arg-363 and hydrophobic interactions with Ile-361 and Ile-389 (22.Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this site can be carried out by the kinase itself, and it is the major site of “autophosphorylation”in vitro (23.Casnellie J.E. Harrison M.L. Hellstrom K.E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13877-13879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Voronova A.F. Buss J.E. Patschinsky T. Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Studies of c-Src activity in vitro and in yeast indicate that phosphorylation of the activation loop in c-Src is an intermolecular autophosphorylation event (25.Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D.

Dephosphorylation of Tyr-394 in Lck is mediated by the tyrosine phosphatases PEP and SHP-1 (28.Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. J. Exp.

These agents have this effect because both inhibit the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases through the oxidation of an essential catalytic cysteine (33.Hecht D. Zick Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The induced phosphorylation on tyrosine results, at least in part, from cessation of dephosphorylation in the oxidant-treated cells. Hydrogen peroxide stimulates the activity of Src family kinases. Endogenously produced H2O2 stimulates the activity of the Src family kinases c-Fgr and Lyn in adherent neutrophils (37.Yan S.R. Berton G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23464-23471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Exposure of Jurkat T cells or Lck-expressing rat 208F fibroblasts to H2O2 induces the phosphorylation of Tyr-394 and enhances Lck kinase activity (21.Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this oxidant-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-394 in Lck occurs at an undiminished rate in fibroblasts expressing only kinase-deficient forms of Lck. Therefore, the kinase activity of Lck is not required for the oxidant-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-394, and another tyrosine protein kinase may function as an activator of Lck (21.Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The kinase that phosphorylates Tyr-394 in H2O2-treated fibroblasts could be either another Src kinase or an as yet unidentified kinase. To distinguish between these possibilities, we took advantage of the cell line SYF, which is derived from mutant mouse embryos lacking the Src family members c-Src, Yes, and Fyn (2.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Additionally, the SYF cell line does not express Lyn (2.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). We expressed kinase-deficient Lck in SYF cells and analyzed the phosphorylation of Tyr-394 following cellular exposure to H2O2. 293, a human embryonic kidney cell line, was grown in DMEM (Cellgro, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone). Jurkat, a human leukemic T-cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Intergen) and 2 mm glutamine. SYF (2.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), a murine embryonic fibroblast cell line derived from mutant embryos deficient for c-Src, Yes, and Fyn (a kind gift from Drs. R. Klinghoffer and P. Soriano, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA), was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Wild type Lck (WT) and kinase-deficient Lck (R273) cDNAs have been previously described (21.Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 38.Voronova A.F. Sefton B.M. Nature. 1986; 319: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The lck cDNAs were subcloned into the retroviral vector MSCVhph (39.Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar) from the retroviral vector LXSN (40.Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar) to utilize hygromycin B phosphotransferase as a selectable marker. Recombinant retroviruses were produced by cotransfecting the MSCV-Lck constructs along with the viral helper plasmid SV-Ψ−E-MLV (41.Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) into 293 cells using a calcium phosphate transfection system (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h post-transfection, supernatant containing recombinant virus particles was collected, filtered through an 0.45-μm filter to remove cells and debris, and used to infect SYF cells. 48 h post-infection, cells expressing WT Lck or R273 Lck were selected with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline and lysed in either RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin) or Tris/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin) for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 × gfor 30 min. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a rabbit anti-Lck antibody as described previously (42.Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar). Immune complexes were collected on Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem), washed three times in either RIPA or Tris/Nonidet P-40 buffer, and used for subsequent analysis. SYF cells or Jurkat T cells were lysed in Tris/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described. Anti-Lck immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer (40 mmPIPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MnCl2). Kinase reactions were initiated by adding 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 ci/mmol, ICN) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Immunoprecipitated Lck was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Western blotting was carried out with rabbit anti-Lck antibodies as described previously (42.Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar) and enhanced chemiluminescence. SYF cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/5-cm plate, 16 h prior to labeling. Immediately prior to labeling, cells were washed twice in phosphate-free DMEM. Cells were biosynthetically labeled in 2 ml of phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum containing 32Pi(H332PO4, ICN, 0.5 mCi/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. For H2O2 treatment, H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer, and32P-labeled Lck was isolated by immunoprecipitation as described. 32P-labeled Lck was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and excised from the membrane following identification by autoradiography. The excised membrane containing the labeled Lck was then digested with TPCK-trypsin as described previously (43.Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 921-923PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping was carried out on cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (EM Science) by electrophoresis at pH 8.9 in the first dimension followed by ascending chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer in the second dimension as described previously (44.Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). The labeled peptides were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To express wild type Lck and the kinase-deficient R273 Lck in SYF cells, we infected the cells with recombinant MSCVhph retroviruses. Following antibiotic selection, pools of selected cells were tested for both Lck expression and kinase activity. Anti-Lck immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Lck antibodies or were subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction. Uninfected SYF cells did not express Lck (Fig.1 A, lane 1). SYF cells infected with WT- or R273 Lck-encoding virus expressed readily detectable levels of Lck (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and3). Wild type Lck from the SYF cells exhibited robust kinase activity (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). In contrast, the R273 Lck did not exhibit any detectable kinase activity (Fig. 1 B,lane 3). Because we were able to detect phosphorylated bands with 0.5% of the intensity of the wild type Lck signal, we estimate that the activity of the R273 Lck is at least 200-fold lower than that of the wild type kinase. H2O2 treatment of SYF cells expressing R273 Lck had no detectable effect on the activity of the mutant kinase (data not shown). It has been shown previously that exposure of both Jurkat T cells and 208F fibroblasts expressing wild type Lck to H2O2induces the phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394 (21.Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To determine whether this is also the case in SYF cells, we biosynthetically labeled cells expressing wild type Lck with 32Pi and immunoprecipitated Lck both before and after exposure to 5 mm H2O2. The phosphorylation of the protein was examined by two-dimensional tryptic peptide analysis (Fig.2). Wild type Lck was predominately phosphorylated on Tyr-505 in untreated cells (Fig. 2 A). A trace of phosphorylation at Tyr-394 (2% of the level of Tyr-505) was also observed in untreated cells. Following exposure of the labeled cells to H2O2, wild type Lck became phosphorylated at Tyr-394 to an extent equal to that of Tyr-505 (Fig.2 B). The identity of the tryptic peptide containing Tyr-394 was confirmed by its co-migration with the predominant phosphorylated peptide from Lck labeled in vitro by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP, when mixtures of peptides from two samples were examined by two-dimensional tryptic peptide analysis (Fig. 2,E and F, and data not shown). The trace phosphorylation at Tyr-394 in wild type Lck observed in untreated cells is presumably due to Lck autophosphorylation because kinase-deficient Lck was not phosphorylated at Tyr-394 in untreated cells (Fig. 2, compare A with C) To determine whether kinase-deficient Lck could be phosphorylated at Tyr-394 in cells lacking all Src family kinases, we treated SYF cells expressing R273 Lck with H2O2 and analyzed Lck phosphorylation as detailed above. R273 Lck was phosphorylated at Tyr-505 with no detectable Tyr-394 phosphorylation in untreated SYF cells (Fig. 2 C). Strikingly, H2O2treatment of SYF cells expressing kinase-deficient Lck led to the phosphorylation of Tyr-394 to an extent equal to that of Tyr-505 (Fig.2 D). Pervanadate treatment of SYF cells expressing R273 Lck gave identical results to that seen with H2O2, indicating that this phenomenon is not specific to H2O2 (data not shown). It is clear that the lack of Lck kinase activity has no effect on H2O2-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine 394, even in cells completely lacking Src family kinases. Many serine/threonine protein kinases are activated by phosphorylation in the activation loop. This activating phosphorylation is usually carried out by a specific upstream activator. For example, the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are stimulated by the Cdk-activating kinase, CAK, in this manner (45.Kaldis P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Additionally, protein kinase B/c-Akt, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, p70 S6 kinase, and several protein kinase C isoforms are all activated by the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase, PDK1 (46.Alessi D.R.

Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated by phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinases, such as MEK1 (51.Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol.

Src family kinases are also activated by phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine in the activation loop. This phosphorylation traditionally has been thought to occur as an intermolecular event carried out by the kinase itself (25.Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26.Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our data, however, suggest that phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine need not be performed by Src family kinases. Using SYF cells, which are devoid of all known Src family kinase activity, we have demonstrated that H2O2and pervanadate induce phosphorylation of kinase-deficient Lck at Tyr-394 to an extent equal to that of wild type Lck. Therefore, our results argue strongly that the oxidant-induced phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394 is not catalyzed exclusively by Src family members and may be carried out by another tyrosine protein kinase(s) that is functionally analogous to activators of serine/threonine protein kinases. In the absence of a completely sequenced mammalian genome, the formal possibility that the tyrosine protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394 is a Src family kinase that has escaped detection to date cannot be excluded. However, the defective integrin-mediated signaling phenotype of the SYF cells (2.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) argues against the expression of a heretofore unidentified Src family member that can functionally complement for the c-Src, Yes, and Fyn deficiency in these cells. Therefore, the simplest interpretation of our results is that a non-Src family kinase is responsible for the oxidant-induced phosphorylation of Lck. We have not yet determined whether the kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394 is itself stimulated by hydrogen peroxide or whether its activity is constitutive and the increased phosphorylation of Tyr-394 is due simply to inhibition of a tyrosine phosphatase. Because Lck is normally expressed only in lymphoid cells, the fact that kinase-deficient Lck is phosphorylated in non-lymphoid cells following exposure to oxidants suggests that a general activator of Src family kinases may exist. Characterization of this kinase(s) in SYF cells may provide insight into this alternative mechanism of Src family kinase activation. We suspect that phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine in Src kinases will be shown to be carried out by Src family kinases in some circumstances and by one or more non-Src kinases in others. We are indebted to Richard Klinghoffer and Philippe Soriano for the very generous gift of the SYF cells, and we thank Kambiz Amdjadi and Roberta Schulte for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1971068266,"Cellular signaling mediated by inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) results in oscillatory intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release. Because the amplitude of the Ca2+ spikes is relatively invariant, the extent of the agonist-mediated effects must reside in their ability to regulate the oscillating frequency. Using electroporation techniques, we show that Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 cause a rapid intracellular Ca2+ release in resting HeLa cells and a transient increase in the frequency of ongoing Ca2+oscillations stimulated by histamine. Two poorly metabolizable analogs of Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(2,4,5)P3, and 2,3-dideoxy-Ins(1,4,5)P3, gave a single Ca2+spike and failed to alter the frequency of ongoing oscillations. Complete inhibition of Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase (IP3K) by either adriamycin or its specific antibody blocked Ca2+oscillations. Partial inhibition of IP3K causes a significant reduction in frequency. Taken together, our results indicate that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is the frequency regulator in vivo, and IP3K, which phosphorylates Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, plays a major regulatory role in intracellular Ca2+ oscillations.

Many models have been proposed to describe the mechanism of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations induced by various agonists based on positive and negative feedback from Ca2+ (1.Meyer T. Stryer L. Annu.

Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that the mechanism appears to be cell type-dependent and not fully understood. We have shown that repetitive phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the InsP3 receptor and the Ca2+-ATPase pump catalyzed by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and a calyculin A and okadaic acid-inhibitable protein phosphatase are responsible for sustaining Ca2+ oscillations in HeLa cells when stimulated with histamine (13.Zhu D.M. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Huang C.Y. Biochem. 1996; 35: 7214-7223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In agreement with others, we found that the amplitude of oscillating Ca2+ spikes is relatively independent of the agonist concentration, whereas its frequency increases as a saturation function with respect to the agonist concentration. Thus, the extent of the agonist-mediated effects must reside in their ability to regulate the oscillation frequency. Recent studies using a Ca2+ clamp technique (14.Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar) and a caged InsP3 method (15.Li W.H. Llopis J. Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1998; 392: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) revealed that oscillations can reduce the Ca2+ threshold and that variation of its frequency affects both the specificity and optimization for gene expression. Therefore, it is essential to understand by which metabolites and by which mechanism the frequency is regulated. We have previously pointed out that such regulation must involve a factor generated by a reaction related to the agonist-receptor interaction to account for the agonist concentration dependence (13.Zhu D.M. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Huang C.Y. Biochem. 1996; 35: 7214-7223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Ins(1,4,5)P3 has been shown to undergo oscillations with Ca2+ in REF52 fibroblast cells (16.Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P.Y. Paranjape S. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1991; 251: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and in canine kidney epithelial cells (17.Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). To search for the frequency regulator(s), we investigated the effects of various inositol polyphosphates on both the intracellular Ca2+ release in HeLa cells and on the frequency of ongoing Ca2+oscillations in histamine-stimulated cells. Our results indicate that Ins(1 3,4,5)P4 is a frequency regulator in vivoand Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase, which catalyzes the conversion of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 plays a major regulatory role in intracellular Ca2+ oscillation.

Adriamycin and rabbit anti-mouse IgG were from Sigma. Fluo-3/AM and fluorescein-labeled IgG were from Molcular Probes, Inc. d-Myo-[3H]inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate and trypsin were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. The monoclonal anti-IP3K antibody was kindly provided by Dr. S. G. Rhee (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health). HeLa cells (ATCC) seeded on plastic dishes were grown in 90% minimum essential medium with nonessential amino acids, Earle's salts, and l-glutamine, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. HeLa cells, grown to 70–80% confluency, were detached from dishes by 0.25% trypsin with 1 mm EDTA for 2 min and then washed at least twice with and resuspended in Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 121 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2 0.8 mmMgCl2, and 5 mmd-glucose). After 0.5 h of incubation at 37 °C with 2 μm Fluo-3/AM (a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator), the cells were washed three times and resuspended in fresh buffer. They were either used immediately or kept at 4 °C for use within 4 h. A fluoromicroscope equipped with an image analysis setup to record at wavelengths longer than 510 nm was used to monitor the Ca2+signal in HeLa cells excited at 480 nm. The images were recorded on videotape at 30 frames/s and transferred to a computer at 1 frame/s. The light intensity in each frame was calculated by the computer and included the correction for dye bleaching. Experiments were carried out at room temperature, 23 ± 2 °C. The home-built electroporator used was described previously (16.Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P.Y. Paranjape S. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1991; 251: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Briefly, electric pulses of desired amplitude and pulse width were applied across cells placed in a home-built electroporation chamber. The chamber was constructed with two polished stainless steel electrodes fixed on a 75 × 25-mm microscope glass slide. The inter-electrode separation was 1 mm. A suspension of cells was placed between the electrodes, and the chamber was mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Ziess, Axiovert 100TV). The cells were allowed to settle in the glass chamber, and a field of view with about 5–10 cells was chosen prior to field application and initiation of experiments. Fluorescence images were acquired with an intensified camera and recorded on a VHS tape for analysis. The loading of anti-mouse IgG or anti-IP3K antibody into a population of cells was performed using a commercial electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) with an inter-electrode separation of 0.2 cm. In the present study, a constant electric field of 1.2 kV/cm with a pulse width of 200 μs was used for electroporating inositol polyphosphates, and 500 μs was used for electroporating antibodies. The efficiency of electroporation was determined to be about 10% of the bath concentration for inositol polyphosphate using3H-labeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 as a probe and about 0.3% for antibody using fluorescein-labeled IgG as a probe. For this study, HeLa cells were chosen because they contain mainly the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores, and histamine consistently induces Ca2+ oscillations in more than 80% of these cells (13.Zhu D.M. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Huang C.Y. Biochem. 1996; 35: 7214-7223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although ryanodine receptors have been found in HeLa cells, their population is so low that an acute opening of these receptors has little effect on the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ (18.Bennett D.L. Cheek T.R. Berridge M.J. Smedt H.D. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6356-6362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The electroporation technique (19.Tekle E. Astumian R.D. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4230-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) was used to introduce membrane impermeable inositol polyphosphates and the monoclonal anti-IP3K antibody into the cells. To ensure that observed Ca2+ signals originated from the intracellular Ca2+ stores, all experiments involving the use of electroporation were carried out in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Fig. 1 shows the Ca2+ oscillation pattern in HeLa cells induced by 200 μm histamine observed in a Ca2+-free buffer that also contained 10 μm EGTA. This addition of 10 μm EGTA was to ensure the absence of free extracellular Ca2+ as indicated by the fact that no Ca2+signal was observed when the cells were electroporated in the absence or presence of a low Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration (see Fig.2). We found that, unlike the oscillation pattern in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ that exhibits constant amplitude and frequency, the absence of external Ca2+ causes a small reduction in the amplitude and frequency. Furthermore, under our electric pulse conditions (1.2 kV/cm, 200–500 μs), which induced rapid transient membrane pore formation (20.Tekle E. Astumian R.D. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11512-11516Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we observed no visible effects on the intracellular Ca2+ signal (data not shown).Figure 2Intracellular Ca2+ release in a single HeLa cells induced by Ins (1,4,5)P3electroporation.

Thearrowheads indicate when cells were subjected to the electric pulse (1.2 kV/cm, 200 μs) in a home-built electroporator (18.Bennett D.L. Cheek T.R. Berridge M.J. Smedt H.D. Parys J.B. Missiaen L.

The Ca2+signal was not observed when the concentration was reduced to 1.2 μm or in the absence of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Because the efficiency of the electroporation is about 10% under our experimental conditions (1.2 kV/cm, 200 μs), the resulting cytosolic concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 was about 0.25 μm when Ca2+ was mobilized from the intracellular stores. Using this method, we probed a series of inositol polyphosphates, at bath concentrations ranging from 2 to 150 μm, for their capacity to mobilize the release of intracellular Ca2+ and to alter the frequency of histamine-initiated Ca2+ oscillations. It should be pointed out that, similar to Ins(1,4,5)P3, the Ca2+releases induced by Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 were observed with a bath concentration of 3.5 and 2.0 μm, respectively. Therefore, the observed Ca2+ release cannot be because of the potential 5% contamination of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in Ins(1,3,4,5)P4or Ins(1,3,6)P3 in Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 samples, because, under our conditions, a minimum bath concentration of 1.2 μm is required for Ins(1,4,5)P3 to cause a Ca2+ release, and Ins(1,4,5)P3 is a much more potent Ca2+ mobilizer than Ins(1,3,6)P3 (21.Murphy C.T. Bullock A.J. Lindley C.J. Mills S.J. Riley A.M. Potter B.V.L. Westwick J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1223-1230PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ release data shown in TableI are similar to those reported for SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (22.Gawler D.J. Potter B.V.L. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and bovine adrenal microsomes (23.Ely J.A. Hunyady L. Baukal A. Catt K.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), except that in HeLa cells Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 exhibit a similar potency for inducing Ca2+ release based on the concentration-dependent study (data similar to those shown in Fig. 2). In addition, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, 2,3-didoeoxy-Ins(1,4,5)P3, and a high concentration of Ins(2,4,5)P3 can also induce Ca2+ release in resting cells.Table IEffects of inositol polyphosphates on the intracellular Ca 2+ release in resting cells and on the frequency of ongoing oscillations in HeLa cellsInositol polyphosphatesConcentrationaThe concentrations are those in the bath used for electroporation.% of Cells releasing Ca2+% of Cells increasing frequency (-fold)μmIns(1,4,5)P32590 (n = 50)69 (2–3, n = 52)Ins(2,4,5)P315075 (n = 24)0 (n = 36)2,3-Dideoxy-Ins(1,4,5)P325100 (n = 30)0 (n = 30)Ins(1,3,4,5)P43588 (n = 34)71 (2–3, n = 28)Ins(1,3,4)P3200 (n = 20)0 (n = 32)Ins(1,4)P2200 (n = 16)0 (n = 26)Ins(4,5)P2250 (n = 42)0 (n = 42)Ins(1,3,4,6)P42092 (n = 24)20 (1–2, n = 30)Ins(1,4,5,6)P4200 (n = 20)0 (n = 28)Ins(1,5,6)P3200 (n = 24)0 (n = 34)InsP6250 (n = 16)0 (n = 18)The data were obtained from three independent experiments. nis the number of cells observed, and -fold increase represents the increase in frequency, which lasted for 1–2 min, relative to that of ongoing oscillations prior to the electroporation of inositol phosphates.a The concentrations are those in the bath used for electroporation. Open table in a new tab The data were obtained from three independent experiments. nis the number of cells observed, and -fold increase represents the increase in frequency, which lasted for 1–2 min, relative to that of ongoing oscillations prior to the electroporation of inositol phosphates. To probe the effect of inositol polyphosphates on the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations, we electroporated the histamine-treated cells with 20–35 μm of inositol polyphosphate (150 μm for Ins(2,4,5)P3), which gave a 2–3 μm elevation inside the cells. This elevated concentration is within the range found in agonist-stimulated cells (24.Palmers S. Hughes K.T. Lee D.Y. Wakelam M.J. Cell Signal. 1989; 1: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although, as indicated in Fig. 2, the concentrations in the bath required to induce Ca2+ release are relatively low,i.e. about one-tenth of those shown in Table I, a higher concentration range was used to observe an increase in the frequency for a duration of 1 to 2 min (Table I). This finding suggests that the frequency regulator(s) may be generated due to the added inositol polyphosphates, and it undergoes intracellular clearance. Fig.3 A shows that no effect was observed on the frequency of histamine-stimulated Ca2+oscillation when the cells were electroporated in the presence of 150 μm Ins(2,4,5)P3. However, in similar cells, electroporation in the presence of 150 μmIns(1,3,4,5)P4 causes a transient increase in the frequency (Fig. 3 B). The observed Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-induced frequency increase and the duration of the transient high frequency phase is concentration-dependent. Among the inositol polyphosphates tested (see Table I), only Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 enhance the frequency of the ongoing Ca2+ oscillations effectively. Ins(1,3,4,6)P4also causes an increase in frequency but with much reduced efficiency. The two poorly metabolizable analogs of Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(2,4,5)P3 and 2,3-dideoxy-Ins(1,4,5)P3, which can induce a Ca2+ spike, fail to enhance the oscillation frequency. Thus, the data suggest that the frequency regulator is not Ins(1,4,5)P3 per se but its metabolite(s). Ins(1,4,5)P3 is easily metabolized to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and Ins(1,4)P2 catalyzed by IP3K and 5-phosphatase, respectively (25.Shears S.B. Perry J.W. Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphorylation Research. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 63-91Google Scholar). Table I shows that Ins(1,4)P2 failed to induce an intracellular Ca2+ release or an increase in the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. Thus, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is likely to be involved, directly or indirectly, in regulating the frequency in the cells. To verify this possibility, we investigated the effect of IP3K inhibitors on Ca2+ oscillations. Adriamycin is a potent inhibitor of IP3K (26.da Silva C.P. Emmrich F. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12521-12526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows that, when HeLa cells were incubated with 10 μm adriamycin for 2 h before histamine treatment, the histamine-induced Ca2+oscillations were abolished. In its place, only a single Ca2+ spike was observed, suggesting that Ins(1,4,5)P3 was generated to cause the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. However, without active IP3K to catalyze the formation of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, the cells fail to produce Ca2+ oscillations. Other evidence supporting Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 playing an important role in regulating the frequency was obtained with monoclonal anti-IP3K antibody (Table II). The antibody was introduced into the cells by electroporation in a Ca2+-free buffer containing 1 mg/ml antibody. Five min after electroporation, the cells were transferred into Buffer A containing 1.8 mmCa2+, and the histamine was added to a final concentration of 200 μm. As a control, a similar procedure was applied to another population of cells, except that the anti-IP3K antibody was replaced with a nonspecific anti-mouse IgG. The results showed that only 35% of the anti-IP3K antibody-treated cells exhibited Ca2+ oscillations in response to histamine, relative to 73 and 75% observed with anti-IgG-treated and untreated cells, respectively. In addition, statistical analysis revealed that the oscillation frequency exhibited by the anti-IP3K-treated cells, 0.9 ± 0.6 spike/min, was significantly lower than the control, which gave 1.6 ± 0.5 spike/min. The heterogeneity of the anti-IP3K antibody-loaded cells indicates that the quantity of the antibody loaded in each cell was not the same. The population of cells that received a sufficient quantity of antibody to fully inactivate the IP3K exhibited one single Ca2+ spike. Those cells that received a lower quantity of antibody, such that their IP3K was partially inhibited, could undergo Ca2+ oscillations but with reduced frequency.Table IIThe effect of monoclonal anti-IP3K antibody on Ca 2+ oscillations in HeLa cellsAntibodyaThe bath concentration of the antibodies was 1 mg/ml (∼67 μm). The electroporation was carried out in Ca2+-free Buffer B with two electric pulses (1.2 kV/cm, 500 μs) at intervals of 2 s. Under these conditions, the electroporation is about 0.3% effective, verified by using a fluorescein-labeled IgG probe. Five min after electroporation, the cells were transferred to Buffer A containing 1.8 mmCa2+ and stimulated by 200 μm histamine.

Open table in a new tab The data shown in Fig. 4 and Table II clearly demonstrate that the metabolism of Ins(1,4,5)P3 via phosphorylation at the 3-position is essential for sustaining Ca2+ oscillations and for controlling the oscillation frequency in HeLa cells. Because it can be metabolized to other inositol phosphates, we cannot directly confirm that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 itself is the frequency regulator. The most accepted and well characterized route for metabolizing Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is the 5-phosphatase-catalyzed hydrolysis that yields Ins(1,3,4)P3, which can then be metabolized further to Ins(1,3)P2, Ins(3,4)P2, and Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, with the latter as a minor product (25.Shears S.B. Perry J.W. Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphorylation Research. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 63-91Google Scholar). The data in Table I show that Ins(1,3,4)P3 in the ∼2 μm intracellular concentration range failed to induce both intracellular Ca2+ release and an increase in the frequency of ongoing Ca2+ oscillations. The latter observation also implies that inositol phosphate 6-kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4)P3 is not a major pathway in HeLa cells. This is in accordance with the finding that phosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4)P3 by 6-kinase is a minor route relative to total Ins(1,3,4)P3 metabolism during receptor activation (27.Hughes P.J. Hughes A.R. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 in the agonist-stimulated cells has been reported to be similar to (25.Shears S.B. Perry J.W. Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphorylation Research. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 63-91Google Scholar) or higher than (28.Hughes A.R. Takemura H. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Doughney C. McPherson A.M. Dormer R.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Furthermore, IP3K is a Ca2+/CaM-activated enzyme, in which activity can be enhanced 4-fold by micromolar concentrations of the Ca2+/CaM complex (30.Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. FASEB J. 1988; 1: 388-393Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the concentration of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 will transiently increase following each Ca2+ spike. Based on our data and the properties of IP3K reported elsewhere (30.Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. FASEB J. 1988; 1: 388-393Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it is feasible that the frequency of Ca2+ oscillation is achieved by altering the concentration of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Our results allow us to identify Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as a second messenger in sustaining, directly or indirectly, Ca2+oscillation and regulating its frequency in HeLa cells. Hirose et al. (17.Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) reported that in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, the concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillates synchronously with Ca2+ oscillation. Strictly speaking, because Ca2+ release follows Ins(1,4,5)P3binding to Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor and most of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 is likely to be converted to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 by the cooperative interaction of Ca2+, calmodulin, and IP3K, the decrease in Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration should at least lag somewhat behind Ca2+ concentration decreases even if IP3K instantaneously phosphorylates free Ins(1,4,5)P3. In fact, such “synchrony,” barring the presence of other major Ca2+-activated Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding proteins, can be achieved by a sufficient amount of fully activated IP3K. In this sense, the finding of Hirose et al. (17.Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) supports our observation that IP3K plays a pivotal role in Ca2+oscillations. It is also likely that the product, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, in turn regulates the frequency of oscillation. It should be pointed out that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4has been implicated in modulating Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane from the extracellular Ca2+ pool (31.Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 256-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which is known to alter the frequency and amplitude of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in HeLa cells (13.Zhu D.M. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Huang C.Y. Biochem. 1996; 35: 7214-7223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32.Bootman M.D. Young K.W. Young J.M. Moretan R.B. Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) by an unknown mechanism. However, because our experiments were conducted in a Ca2+-free medium, it indicates that this mechanism is probably not responsible for the observed effects. Two Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-specific-binding proteins, GAP1IP4BP and GAP1m, have been purified and found ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (33.Lockyer P.J. Vanlingen S. Reynolds J.S. McNulty T.J. Irvine R.F. Parys J.B. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Both are members of the GAP1 family of Ras GTPase-activating proteins, and they exhibit relatively low affinity for Ins(1,3,4,6)P4. Whether and how the frequency-regulating properties of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 may be mediated through one of these proteins is unclear. On the other hand, we have shown that a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle, which involves the Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II and a calyculin A-inhibitable protein phosphatase, plays a pivotal role in sustaining Ca2+ oscillations in HeLa cells. The addition of calyculin A to an ongoing Ca2+ oscillation causes a decrease in its frequency and, at high concentrations, it reduces the oscillation to a single Ca2+ spike (13.Zhu D.M. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Huang C.Y. Biochem. 1996; 35: 7214-7223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several inositol trisphosphates and tetrakisphosphates have been shown to activate a phosphoprotein phosphatase (34.Zwiller J. Ogasawara E.M. Nakamoto S.S. Boynton A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 may exert its function via direct or indirect activation of a specific phosphoprotein phosphatase in which the activity determines the duration between two adjacent Ca2+ spikes, hence controlling the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations.

https://openalex.org/W2165088310,"Alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase is a peroxisomal enzyme involved in ether lipid synthesis. It catalyzes the exchange of the acyl chain in acyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate for a long chain fatty alcohol, yielding the first ether linked intermediate,i.e. alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate, in the pathway of ether lipid biosynthesis. Although this reaction is not a net redox reaction, the amino acid sequence of the enzyme suggested the presence of a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain. In this study we show that alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase contains an essential FAD molecule as cofactor, which is evidenced by fluorescence properties, UV-visible absorption spectra and the observation that the enzyme activity is dependent on the presence of this cofactor in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation assay. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that the FAD cofactor directly participates in catalysis. Upon incubation of the enzyme with the substrate palmitoyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate, the flavin moiety is reduced, indicating that in this initial step the substrate is oxidized. Stopped flow experiments show that the reduction of the flavin moiety is a monophasic process yielding a oxygen stable, reduced enzyme species. Upon addition of hexadecanol to the reduced enzyme species, the flavin moiety is efficiently reoxidized. A hypothetical reaction mechanism is proposed that is consistent with the data in this paper and with previous studies.

It catalyzes the exchange of the acyl chain in acyl-DHAP by a long chain fatty alcohol, yielding alkyl-DHAP (Scheme FS1). Because in this step the ether linkage is introduced, this enzyme can be considered to catalyze the most characteristic step in ether lipid synthesis. In mammals it is clearly established that the enzyme is located in peroxisomes (1.Hajra A.K. Bishop J.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). This is also emphasized by the observation that the enzyme activity as well as the enzyme protein is deficient in human genetic diseases in which peroxisome biogenesis is disturbed (3.Schrakamp G. Roosenboom C.F.P. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. Heymans H.S.A. Tager J.M. van den Bosch H. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 867-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.De Vet E.C.J.M. Ijlst L.

The identification of patients with deficiencies in ether lipid biosynthetic enzymes, including alkyl-DHAP synthase, with severe clinical abnormalities shows unambiguously that ether lipids are of central importance in humans (5.Wanders R.J.A. Schutgens R.B.H. Barth P.G. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of alkyl-DHAP synthase has been studied extensively in the past using partially purified enzyme preparations and crude microsomal fractions. Important features are: both oxygens of the fatty acid are removed during the acyl cleavage (6.Friedberg S.J. Weintraub S.T. Peterson D. Satsangi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the oxygen for the ether linkage to be formed is donated by the alcohol (7.Snyder F. Rainey Jr W.T. Blank M.L. Christie W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5853-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pointing toward a unique cleavage mechanism. The pro-R hydrogen at the C-1 position of the DHAP moiety is exchanged with water during the reaction, and 1 mol of hydrogen is incorporated from water in alkyl-DHAP for each mole of product formed (8.Brown A.J.

Both mammalian enzymes carry a peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 in N-terminal cleavable presequences, whereas the C. elegans and D. discoideum homologs contain C-terminal PTS1 sequences. The expression of guinea pig alkyl-DHAP synthase in Escherichia coli (15.De Vet E.C.J.M. Zomer A.W.M. Lahaut G.J.H.T.J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 798-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), as well as the raising of specific antibodies against the protein, has enabled further characterization of the enzyme. Although not an integral membrane protein, the enzyme appears to be tightly bound to the inner aspect of the peroxisomal membrane (19.De Vet E.C.J.M. Biermann J. van den Bosch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20.Zomer A.W.M. de Weerd W.F.C. Langeveld J. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Alkyl-DHAP synthase is present in a heterotrimeric complex with DHAP acyltransferase, the enzyme that provides the substrate for alkyl-DHAP synthase (21.Thai T-H. Heid H. Rackwitz H-R. Hunziker A. Gorgas K. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22.Biermann J. Just W.W. Wanders R.J.A. van den Bosch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, based on the crystal structure of the fungal flavoprotein vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (23.Mattevi A Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L Coda A van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and sequence homology analysis, a novel oxidoreductase family sharing a conserved FAD-binding domain was identified (24.Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Members of this family are typically 500–600 amino acids long and consist of two domains: (i) a conserved FAD-binding domain anchoring the ADP part of the cofactor which is formed by the N- and C termini and (ii) a nonconserved variable domain of about 240 residues. Remarkably, also alkyl-DHAP synthase, not catalyzing a net redox reaction, was considered to be a member of this family on the basis of its primary sequence. Already after the cloning of the cDNA for human alkyl-DHAP synthase we have noted a clear homology between alkyl-DHAP synthase and the FAD containingd-lactate dehydrogenase (cytochrome c) precursor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as with an uncharacterized open reading frame product of glycolate oxidase subunit D from E. coli, which are also members of this novel oxidoreductase family (see Refs. 16.De Vet E.C.J.M. van den Broek B.T.E. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 24.Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar for alignments and references). Mature alkyl-DHAP synthase as well as yeastd-lactate dehydrogenase carry N-terminal extensions of about 100 amino acids that are not shared by other members of the family. Because these two enzymes are the only known membrane-associated proteins of this family so far, these extensions may form membrane anchors. Although existing, examples of FAD-binding enzymes that do not catalyze net redox reactions are rare (25.Muh U. Cinkaya I. Albracht S.P. Buckel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11710-11718Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26.Macheroux P. Bornemann S. Ghisla S. Thorneley R.N. J. Biol.

In this paper we show that alkyl-DHAP synthase does indeed contain FAD and that the flavin part is actively involved in the formation of the product alkyl-DHAP. A reaction mechanism is presented that is consistent with the experimental data presented in this paper and with previous studies (6.Friedberg S.J. Weintraub S.T. Peterson D. Satsangi N. Biochem.

TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Amylose resin and the pMAL-c2 vector were obtained from New England Biolabs. ProbondTMmetal-binding resin was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was a product from Research Organics Inc. (Cleveland, OH). Poly-histidine tagged guinea pig alkyl-DHAP synthase was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) as described (15.De Vet E.C.J.M. Zomer A.W.M. Lahaut G.J.H.T.J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 798-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After the induction period, cells (0.7 liters of culture) were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 3000 ×g) and resuspended in 30 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm imidazol, 200 mmNaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, pH 7.5). After 0.5 h of incubation on ice, the suspension was sonicated in two parts for five times for 30 s at 90 Watt output with a macro tip of a Sonifier B12 (Branson Sonic Power Company). All subsequent manipulations were done in a cold room (4 °C). The suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a ProbondTM metal-binding resin column charged with NiCl2 (1.3 × 6 cm). The flow rate was 30 ml/h. After application of the sample, the column was washed with 50 ml of washing buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm imidazol, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). Recombinant alkyl-DHAP synthase was eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, 400 mm imidazol, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5). Because of the relatively low protein concentrations and high Triton X-100 concentration in the samples, the protein concentration was estimated by comparison of staining intensities of the enzyme with known amounts of bovine serum albumin on Coomassie-stained gels. To determine flavin content of mutant forms of the poly-histidine tagged alkyl-DHAP synthase, proteins were also purified batchwise. For this purpose, 22 ml of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced E. coli culture expressing the mutant protein was harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 1 ml of the lysis buffer described above. After clearing of the lysate by centrifugation, the supernatant was added to 150 μl of ProbondTM metal-binding resin charged with NiCl2. The recombinant protein was allowed to bind to the material for 0.5 h. The material was washed three to four times with the washing buffer described above, and proteins were eluted with 750 μl of elution buffer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Photon Technology International Quantum Master fluorimeter with a slit width of 2 nm. Fractions containing purified alkyl-DHAP synthase were denatured with 7 m urea, and excitation and emission scans were recorded as indicated using 1-ml cuvettes. Spectra were routinely corrected for background fluorescence of the buffer. The amount of flavin was quantified by comparing the emission of the sample with the emission of known amounts of reference FAD in the same buffer. For determination of flavin content in mutant forms of the poly-histidine tagged guinea pig protein, 600-μl aliquots of the eluates containing the purified proteins were adjusted to 7 m urea (end volume, 1 ml), and flavin fluorescence was quantified by integration of the emission between 520 and 560 nm (excitation wavelength, 470 nm). The flavin fluorescence was normalized for differences in the concentration of the purified mutant proteins. For this purpose, relative amounts of purified alkyl-DHAP synthase in the eluates were determined by quantification of staining intensities on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained SDS-PAGE gels with a Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer. The construct encoding poly-histidine tagged mature guinea pig alkyl-DHAP synthase cloned downstream of the T7 promotor was used (15.De Vet E.C.J.M. Zomer A.W.M. Lahaut G.J.H.T.J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 798-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The coupled T7 in vitro transcription/translation reactions were done according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) without radioactive label. The total volume of each reaction was 50 μl, and approximately 1 μg of plasmid DNA was used per reaction. Reactions were performed in the presence or absence of FAD (10 μm) or FMN (10 μm). Formation of the protein was monitored by analyzing an aliquot of 5 μl of the reaction by Western blot immunodetection (19.De Vet E.C.J.M. Biermann J. van den Bosch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 10 and 20 μl were used for the determination of alkyl-DHAP synthase activity. Substrate preparation and activity assays were performed as described previously (20.Zomer A.W.M. de Weerd W.F.C. Langeveld J. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with a slight modification in buffer composition. The following assay conditions were used: 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaF, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 240 μm palmitoyl-DHAP, and 110 μm[1-14C]hexadecanol (9000 dpm/nmol) in a total volume of 75 μl. The histidine residues at position 300, 615, and 616 in the poly-histidine tagged form of the enzyme were replaced separately by alanines using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis method according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene). Incorporation of the mutagenic oligonucleotides into the construct was checked by restriction analysis and nucleotide sequencing. The mutant proteins (denoted as H300A, H615A, and H616A, respectively) were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and expression levels were found to be comparable with those of the wild type enzyme. Enzyme activies were measured in total cell lysates as described (14.De Vet E.C.J.M. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Flavin content was determined by measuring fluorescence as described above. The cDNA encoding guinea pig alkyl-DHAP synthase was excised from the pET-15b vector withXhoI and ligated into the SalI site of a pMAL-c2 vector. This construct allows the expression of mature guinea pig alkyl-DHAP synthase (amino acids 75–658) as a C-terminal fusion to the maltose-binding protein under control of the tac promotor. This enables the purification of the enzyme in a single step by affinity chromatography (27.Kellermann O.K. Ferenci T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The construct was transformed into E. coli strain DH5α. An overnight culture (70 ml) was diluted in 700 ml of fresh LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and cells were grown at 37 °C. Cells were induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.7 and grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme on ice for 0.5 h. The suspension was sonicated five times for 30 s, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was applied onto an amylose resin column (volume, 4 ml) with a flow rate of 18 ml/h. The column was washed with four column volumes of buffer A, and thereafter the recombinant MBP-alkyl-DHAP synthase was eluted with 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10 mm maltose. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi 150-20 spectrophotometer. The concentration of FAD was calculated from the absorption at 450 nm in the presence of 0.5% SDS using 11.3 mm−1 cm−1 as molar extinction coefficient (28.Kuichi K. Nisikimi M. Yagi K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5076-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The substrates palmitoyl-DHAP and hexadecanol were added to the purified enzyme as sonicates in 0.2% Triton X-100. Stopped flow kinetics were carried out with a Hi-Tech SF-51 stopped flow apparatus equipped with a Hi-Tech M300 monochromator diode-array detector (Salisbury, UK). All kinetic experiments were performed at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Spectral scans were collected each 10 ms from 300 to 600 nm. In each experiment 96 scans were collected. Deconvolution analysis of spectral data was performed using the Specfit Global Analysis program version 2.10 (Spectrum Software Assn., Chapel Hill, NC). To determine the rate of enzyme reduction, alkyl-DHAP synthase was mixed with a solution containing 200 μm palmitoyl-DHAP resulting in a final concentration of 100 μm after mixing. For generation of the reduced enzyme intermediate complex, the enzyme was titrated with an excess of palmitoyl-DHAP (100 μm). By mixing the reduced enzyme species with a solution of 200 μm hexadecanol, reoxidation of the reduced enzyme could be monitored. SDS-PAGE was done according to Laemmli (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Protein was determined according to Bradford (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Recombinant poly-histidine tagged alkyl-DHAP synthase was purified in a single purification step to apparent homogeneity from E. coli (Fig. 1). To monitor for the presence of flavin fluorescence, an emission scan was recorded (excitation wavelength, 470 nm) from both the native enzyme as well as enzyme denatured in 7 m urea. As can be seen in Fig.2 A, a clear fluorescence is observed in case of the denatured enzyme with a maximum of about 525 nm, which is characteristic for flavin. The fluorescence yield is relatively low in the native state, showing that the protein effectively quenches the flavin fluorescence. An excitation scan was obtained with the denatured enzyme (emission wavelength, 530 nm; Fig.2 B), which is very characteristic for flavin and resembles the absorption spectrum. The molar ratio between flavin and protein was estimated to be around 0.15–0.25, which shows that only a small part of the enzyme has taken up a flavin cofactor. Nevertheless, because the protein sample appears to be rather pure on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1,lane 3) it is unlikely that this flavin fluorescence is due to another contaminating flavoprotein.Figure 2Fluorescence of purified recombinant guinea pig alkyl-DHAP synthase.

Prinsen H.C.M.T. van den Bosch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we were unable to generate active enzyme despite adequate expression of the protein. If indeed alkyl-DHAP synthase is a FAD-dependent enzyme, this may have been caused by the absence of this particular cofactor. To investigate this, the histidine tagged guinea pig alkyl-DHAP synthase was expressed in a coupledin vitro transcription/translation system in the absence or presence of either FAD or FMN (Fig. 3). As can be seen in the Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 B), the enzyme is expressed to comparable levels in the incubations with no cofactor, with FAD, or with FMN when the DNA template is present. However, only in the FAD-containing incubation does alkyl-DHAP synthase activity become clearly detectable. This provides clear evidence that alkyl-DHAP synthase is dependent on FAD, although it does not catalyze a net redox reaction. It is also shown that FMN cannot replace FAD. This result is in line with the observation that alkyl-DHAP synthase shows homology toward FAD containing enzymes, which contain a conserved domain that specifically interacts with the ADP part of the FAD molecule (24.Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In a previous study we prepared single amino acid mutants of the poly-histidine tagged enzyme as well as C-terminal deletion mutants (14.De Vet E.C.J.M. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Because histidine may play an important role in the catalytic mechanism (14.De Vet E.C.J.M. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we changed in addition all remaining conserved histidines (His300, His615, and His616) into alanines in this study. The inactivity of a given mutant may result from replacement of essential catalytic amino acid residues or from misfolding of the protein, which may be reflected by defective FAD binding. Therefore, we examined for all available mutant enzymes whether flavin content was comparable with the wild type content by assaying batch purified protein for flavin fluorescence. In Table I, the activity and flavin content of the mutant proteins are given. Certain mutant enzymes have nondetectable activities accompanied by reduced FAD binding (H300A and the deletion mutant pADSΔ5 missing the last five C-terminal residues). Other mutant proteins have nondetectable or strongly reduced activity, whereas flavin content is near normal (R419H, R419K, H616A, and H617A).Table IFAD content and enzyme activities of mutant alkyl-DHAP synthasesMutantFAD contentEnzyme activityH300A14NDH615A56NDH616A135NDH617A157NDcS367A474a*, values derived from previous studies (4,14).C576A120187a*, values derived from previous studies (4,14).R419K1071a*, values derived from previous studies (4,14).R419HbThis mutant corresponds to the pMutant construct in Ref. 4and represents a guinea pig-human hybrid enzyme.123NDa*, values derived from previous studies (4,14).pADSΔ521NDa*, values derived from previous studies (4,14).Both FAD content (determined by fluorescence) and enzyme activities are expressed as percentages of wild-type values.

Because the poly-histidine tagged protein readily loses activity upon purification, we changed to another affinity tag, i.e. the maltose-binding protein. Alkyl-DHAP synthase activities per mg ofE. coli protein in lysates of cells expressing the MBP-alkyl-DHAP synthase fusion were comparable with the values found for the poly-histidine tagged form (1–3 milliunits/mg) (15.De Vet E.C.J.M.

Approximately 60% of the enzyme activity did not bind to the amylose resin affinity column. The enzyme eluted as a yellow protein from the affinity column when a buffer containing 10 mm maltose was applied. About 40% of the applied alkyl-DHAP synthase activity was recovered in the purified fractions. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the recombinant fusion protein (109 kDa) in the eluate was nearly homogeneous. The purified MBP-alkyl-DHAP synthase contained 0.28–0.30 mol FAD/mol protein.

In our search for specific inhibitors of RNAPII phosphorylation, we discovered that the transcriptional coactivator PC4 (17.Kretzschmar M. Kaise K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18.Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) has the ability to inhibit cdk7-mediated phosphorylation of RNAPII. PC4 was initially described as a DNA-binding protein that enhances the activator-dependent transcription of class II genes in vitro (17.Kretzschmar M. Kaise K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M.

It was later shown that PC4 could also act as a repressor of basal transcription (19.Malik S. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PC4 has also been shown to be able to participate in DNA replication, substituting for other ssDNA-binding proteins in vitro (25.Pan Z-Q. Qe H. Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22111-22116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we show that PC4 inhibits the phosphorylation of the largest subunit of RNAPII by cdk7, cdk1, and cdk2. The inhibition of RNAPII phosphorylation by PC4 is specific, as phosphorylation of several other cdk substrates is not inhibited. This kinase inhibitory activity of PC4 is correlated with its transcriptional inhibitory activity in vivo. Bacterially expressed PC4 was purified as described (18.Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). TFIIH, CAK, and RNAPII were purified as described (26.Bochar D.A. Pan Z-Q. Knights R. Fisher R.P. Shilatifard A. Shiekhattar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13162-13166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). No PC4 or 37.5 or 75 ng of bacterially expressed PC4 were mixed with 20 ng of TFIIH or 50 ng of CAK in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol. After a 5-min preincubation at 30 °C, the substrate mix was added (100 ng of RNAPII and ATP to a final concentration of 10 μm, which included 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Kinase reactions were then performed for 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 25 μl of 2× gel-loading buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol), and proteins were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min. Phosphorylated products were resolved in polyacrylamide gels and visualized in a PhosphorImager system. After a 5-min preincubation of TFIIH with the indicated amounts of PC4, substrate mixes containing saturating amounts of ATP (including 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and varying amounts of RNAPII (from 25 to 250 ng as indicated) were added. Kinase reactions were performed as described above. The amounts of phosphorylation were measured in a PhosphorImager system using Molecular Dynamics software. A double-reciprocal plot is presented. To study inhibition of cdk-1 and cdk-2 by PC4, the phosphorylation reactions were similar to that for TFIIH. Baculovirus-expressed cyclin A/cdk-1 or cyclin A/cdk-2 (27.Dynlacht B.D. Flores O. Lees J.A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1772-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) were used as enzymes. Kinase reactions were performed for 10 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylation of substrates other than RNAPII was analyzed as described above, except that 100 ng of TFIIF (26.Bochar D.A. Pan Z-Q. Knights R. Fisher R.P. Shilatifard A. Shiekhattar R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 374: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), or the indicated amount of Histone H1 (Sigma) were used as substrates. Kinase reactions were performed for 20 min at 30 °C. No PC4 or 37.5 or 75 ng of bacterially expressed PC4 was added as indicated. Mutant forms of PC4 were generated by inserting double-stranded DNA oligomers, which contained the mutated sequences, in appropriate restriction sites. Mutant forms of PC4 were then expressed and purified as described for the wild-type protein. Inhibition of cdk7 by mutants forms of PC4 was analyzed as described above, except that 90 ng of each of the different mutant or wild-type forms of PC4 were used. To analyze phosphorylation of wild-type or mutant forms of PC4, kinase reactions were performed as described above, except that RNAPII was omitted in the reactions. In these reactions, 90 ng of wild-type or mutant forms of PC4 were added as a component of the substrate mix together with ATP. Thus, PC4 or its mutant forms were not preincubated with TFIIH before the addition of ATP. 240 mg of HeLa S100 extract (a side fraction of nuclear extract) was first fractionated on a phosphocellulose (P11) column. The column was then washed with BC500 (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 500 mm KCl), and PC4-containing fractions were eluted with BC850 (containing 850 mm KCl). The eluate was then mixed with an equal volume of BC100 and fractionated on a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-agarose column. This column was washed with BC500, and PC4-containing fractions were eluted with BC850. The ssDNA-bound fraction was dialyzed against BC100 containing 10% glycerol and further purified through a heparin-5PW (HPLC, Toso Hass) column. The heparin-5PW column was washed with BC200, and the different forms of PC4 were eluted in a stepwise manner with BC300, BC400, and BC500 (containing 10% glycerol). Whereas BC300 eluate contained the phosphorylated form of PC4, BC400 contained both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms, and BC500, contained only unphosphorylated PC4. Finally, all forms of PC4 were dialyzed against BC100 and stored at −70 °C until use. To study the inhibitory activity of native PC4, 20 ng of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated forms of PC4 were used in the kinase reactions, replacing bacterially expressed PC4. Otherwise, kinase reactions were performed as above. Wild-type PC4 was digested from pET11a/PC4wt with HindIII and ApaI and inserted into the multicloning site of pcDNA3.1/V5 to generate the PC4 mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3/PC4. The mammalian expression vector for Mut.2 was generated by replacing theXhoI/BstXI fragment of pCDNA3/PC4 with the equivalent fragment of pET11a-PC4-K23I/K29A. Control empty vector was generated by deleting the HindIII-ApaI (PC4-containing) region of pcDNA3/PC4. 750 ng of CAT reporter plasmid, which is driven by human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter were transfected by lipofection with varying amounts of PC4 or Mut.2, together with 0.15 μg of a GFP-expressing plasmid (to evaluate the efficiency of transfection) into Saos-2 or U2-OS cells. Total amounts of DNA were kept constant to 4.9 μg with empty PC4 vector. Optimal inhibition of CAT activity was observed with 0.5 μg of PC4 transfected into Saos-2 cells. To analyze the inhibition of RNAPII phosphorylation by PC4, recombinant PC4 was expressed in Echerichia coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig.1 A). The inhibitory activity of PC4 was analyzed using either TFIIH or the trimeric cdk7 kinase complex. Recombinant PC4 inhibited phosphorylation of the largest subunit of RNAPII by either TFIIH or the trimeric cdk7 complex (Fig.1 B). It is difficult to assess the change in the mobility of the largest subunit of RNAPII under our assay conditions. Interestingly, the concentration of PC4 required for inhibition of cdk7 kinase activity was similar to the concentrations of bacterially expressed P15 and P16 proteins previously reported to inhibit cdk4 and cdk6 (9.Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). To analyze the mechanism of inhibition of RNAPII phosphorylation by PC4, kinetic assays were performed in which varying amounts of RNAPII were phosphorylated by a constant amount of TFIIH in the presence of excess ATP at several different concentrations of PC4. This analysis revealed that PC4 inhibited the phosphorylation of RNAPII in a competitive manner (Fig. 1 C). The K ifor PC4 inhibition of RNAPII phosphorylation was calculated to be 100 nm. PC4 contains a ssDNA-binding domain, which maps to the C-terminal half of the protein (Fig. 2 A). Additionally, the N-terminal half of PC4 encompasses two serine-rich domains, which contains the conserved phosphorylation sites in PC4, and a lysine-rich domain (Fig. 2 A). To further analyze the inhibitory activity of PC4, we constructed a series of PC4 mutants (Fig. 2 B). Mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2 C). Analysis of the PC4 mutants for their inhibitory activity of RNAPII phosphorylation by cdk7 revealed that double (mutants 1 and 2) or triple (mutant 3) point mutations in the lysine-rich motif (amino acids 23–41) abolished the inhibitory activity of PC4 (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, a point mutation in the C-terminal half of PC4 (mutant 5, Fig.2 D), or a quadruple point mutation in the major casine kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation site located in the first serine-rich domain (mutant 6, Fig. 2 D), did not effect the inhibitory activity of PC4. Moreover, a triple point mutant C-terminal to amino acid 41 ( Fig. 2 D, mutant 4) retained the kinase inhibitory activity, although to a smaller extent than that of wild-type PC4 (Fig.2 D, compare WT with mutant 4). To rule out the possibility that inhibition of RNAPII phosphorylation was the result of PC4 acting as a competitive substrate of TFIIH, we analyzed the phosphorylation of PC4 and its mutants by TFIIH in the absence of RNAPII. As Fig. 2 E indicates, all forms of PC4 were phosphorylated by TFIIH, although only wild-type and mutants 4, 5, and 6 inhibited RNAPII phosphorylation (Fig. 2 D). Therefore, phosphorylation of PC4 by TFIIH does not correlate with its inhibitory activity toward RNAPII phosphorylation. It was previously reported that PC4 was subject to phosphorylation and that the phosphorylated form of PC4 was devoid of transcriptional coactivation activity (29.Ge H. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12691-12695Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of PC4 phosphorylation on the cdk7 kinase inhibitory activity, we isolated mammalian PC4 from HeLa cells using conventional chromatography technique. Analysis of the last chromatography step (heparin-5PW), using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining, revealed that the phosphorylated form of PC4 (PC4-P, 16 kDa) eluted at 0.3 m KCl (Fig.3 A, lane 2), whereas the unphosphorylated form (PC4, 15 kDa) eluted at 0.5 m (lane 3). The 0.4 m fraction contained a mix of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of PC4 (lane 1). To confirm that the 15- and 16-kDa polypeptides are PC4, the respective bands were cut from a colloidal blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel, cleaved in the gel by trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and limited Edman sequencing. Both the 15- and the 16-kDa bands were unambiguously identified as the transcriptional coactivator PC4. Analysis of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of PC4 in a TFIIH-dependent RNAPII phosphorylation assay revealed that unphosphorylated PC4 (0.5 m eluate) possesses kinase inhibitory activity (Fig. 3 B, lane 2), whereas the phosphorylated form of PC4 (0.3M eluate) was devoid of kinase inhibitory activity (lane 4). The mixture of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of PC4 (0.4m eluate) displayed modest inhibitory activity (comparelanes 2 and 3). These results demonstrate that the kinase inhibitory activity of PC4 is regulated by phosphorylationin vivo. Phosphorylation of RNAPII has been postulated to catalyze the transition from transcriptional initiation to elongation by RNAPII (1.Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Because PC4 inhibited RNAPII phosphorylation in vitro, we asked whether PC4 displayed transcriptional inhibitory activityin vivo. Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with a CAT reporter plasmid and a mammalian PC4-expressing plasmid. Analysis of CAT reporter activity revealed a 5-fold repression by wild-type PC4 (Fig.3 C). In contrast to wild-type PC4, cotransfection of Mut.2, which was shown to lack the kinase inhibitory activity, was devoid of any transcriptional inhibitory activity (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that the transcriptional inhibitory activity of PC4 correlates with its ability to inhibit RNAPII phosphorylation. We next tested whether PC4 inhibited the kinase activity of other cdks. Baculovirus-expressed cyclin A/cdk-1 and cyclin A/cdk-2 were purified to homogeneity and incubated with purified RNAPII in the absence or presence of 37.5 or 75 ng of purified recombinant PC4. Although PC4 efficiently inhibited phosphorylation of RNAPII by both kinases, we observed that phosphorylation of another protein present in the same reactions (tentatively identified as cyclin A) was not affected by the inhibitor (Fig. 4 A). The inability of PC4 to inhibit the phosphorylation of cyclin A by cdk2 or cdk1 prompted us to analyze the effects of PC4 on the phosphorylation of other substrates of cdk1, cdk2, or cdk7. All naturally occurring cdk inhibitors are specific for one or more cdks but cannot discriminate among different substrates (9.Hannon G.J. Beach D.

Skolnick M.H. Science. 1994; 264: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (2820) Google Scholar). In contrast, synthetic peptide cdk inhibitors (aptamers) have been described that selectively inhibit phosphorylation of only some cdk2 substrates (30.Cohen B.A. Colas P. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14272-14274Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine whether PC4 is indeed a naturally occurring substrate-specific (“aptamer-like”) cdk inhibitor, the activity of PC4 on the phosphorylation of three other substrates of cdk7 was examined. Although PC4 did not inhibit cdk7-dependent phosphorylation of the large subunit of TFIIF or p53, it inhibited phosphorylation of GST-cdk2 (Fig. 4 B). To further test the specificity of PC4 kinase inhibitory activity, Histone H1 was used as a substrate for cyclin A/cdk-1, cyclin A/cdk-2, and cyclin B/cdk-1 in the presence of 0, 37.5, or 75 ng of purified PC4. Phosphorylation of either 1.0 μg (standard conditions) or 100 ng (same amount as RNAPII) of histone H1 by any of the three tested kinases was not inhibited by PC4 (Fig.4 C and data not shown), although similar concentrations of PC4 inhibited RNAPII phosphorylation by cdk2 and cdk1 (Fig.4 A). These results demonstrate that PC4 behaved similarly to the previously described peptide aptamers and therefore represents a novel class of naturally occurring cdk inhibitors. We show that PC4 acts as a substrate-specific inhibitor of cdks. Our analysis revealed that PC4 inhibits RNAPII phosphorylation through a competitive mechanism. Furthermore, through analysis of the PC4 mutants, we were able to dissociate the cdk inhibitory activity of PC4 from transcriptional coactivation and DNA binding. We demonstrate that the lysine-rich domain (amino acids 23–41) was important for the cdk-inhibitory activity of PC4. However, point mutations C-terminal to amino acid 41, such as F77P, which abolished the transcriptional coactivation and DNA binding activities of PC4 2H. Ge, unpublished observations. did not abolish its kinase inhibitory activity. These results indicate that different sets of amino acids of PC4 are required for transcriptional coactivation and cdk inhibition. cdk7 is a component of TFIIH and at least two smaller complexes involved in transcription and cell-cycle regulation (2.Shiekhattar R.

Moreover, a subset of the components of TFIIH is present in the nucleotide excision-repair complex (34.Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. Chambon P. Egly J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 35.Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Because transcription, cell-cycle progression, and DNA repair are regulated in a coordinated manner, TFIIH has been proposed to be the limiting factor that coordinates regulation of these three cellular processes (26.Bochar D.A. Pan Z-Q. Knights R. Fisher R.P. Shilatifard A. Shiekhattar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13162-13166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 36.Fisher R.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ability of PC4 to inhibit TFIIH kinase activity on some substrates but not others may play an important role in modulating the dynamic regulation of transcription, DNA repair, and cell-cycle progression. Therefore, it is not surprising that similar to other cdk inhibitors, PC4 displays tumor suppressor activity when overexpressed inraf-transformed cells (37.Kannan P. Tanisky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (899908)Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our identification of PC4 as a natural substrate-specific (aptamer-like) cdk inhibitor reveals a novel mechanism for a cellular factor in the regulation of protein phosphorylation. The existence of such a factor point to a more complex and specific mechanism for cdk regulation than was previously envisioned. We thank Dr. T. Halazonetis for recombinant p53 and Dr. D. Bochar and Dr. R. Mormorstein for critical comments on the manuscript. Dr. X. Sun made the original observation for the kinase inhibitory activity of PC4."

In this work, evidence is presented that nitrogenases isolated from Azotobacter vinelandii andClostridium pasteurianum can hydrolyze MgGTP, MgITP, and MgUTP to their respective nucleoside diphosphates at rates comparable to those measured for MgATP hydrolysis. The reactions were dependent on the presence of both the iron (Fe) protein and the molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein. The oxidation state of nitrogenase was found to greatly influence the nucleotide hydrolysis rates. MgATP hydrolysis rates were 20 times higher under dithionite reducing conditions (∼4000 nmol of MgADP formed per min/mg of Fe protein) as compared with indigo disulfonate oxidizing conditions (200 nmol of MgADP formed per min/mg of Fe protein). In contrast, MgGTP, MgITP, and MgUTP hydrolysis rates were significantly higher under oxidizing conditions (1400–2000 nmol of MgNDP formed per min/mg of Fe protein) as compared with reducing conditions (80–230 nmol of MgNDP formed per min/mg of Fe protein). TheK m values for MgATP, MgGTP, MgUTP, and MgITP hydrolysis were found to be similar (330–540 μm) for both the reduced and oxidized states of nitrogenase. Incubation of Fe and MoFe proteins with each of the MgNTP molecules and AlF4− resulted in the formation of non-dissociating protein-protein complexes, presumably with trapped AlF4−·MgNDP. The implications of these results in understanding how nucleotide hydrolysis is coupled to substrate reduction in nitrogenase are discussed.

Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar, 2.Mortenson L.E. Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Bolin J.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry for coupling ATP hydrolysis to substrate reduction varies depending on reactions conditions, with a minimum of 2 ATP molecules hydrolyzed for each electron transferred to substrate (5.Mortenson L.E. Upchurch R.G. Gibson A.H. Newton W.E. Current Perspectives in Nitrogen Fixation. Australian Academy of Science, Canberra, Australia1981: 75-78Google Scholar, 6.Watt G.D. Bulen W.A. Burns A. Hadfield K.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4266-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the reduction of N2 to 2NH3 by nitrogenase requires the hydrolysis of at least 16 ATP molecules (Equation 1). N2+8H++16 ATP+8e−→2NH3+H2+16 ADP+16 PiEquation 1 A direct role for nucleotides in nitrogenase substrate reduction reactions was first demonstrated in 1964 (7.Mortenson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) when it was discovered that the addition of MgATP stimulated nitrogen fixation in cell-free extracts. Subsequent studies by many groups have detailed the roles of ATP in nitrogenase catalysis, although key aspects of how ATP hydrolysis is coupled to substrate reduction remain unclear. It appears that ATP serves at least three roles in the nitrogenase mechanism. (i) The binding of 2 ATP molecules to the iron (Fe) protein component of nitrogenase induces protein conformational changes that influence both the properties of the protein-bound [4Fe-4S] cluster and the affinity of this protein for the molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein. (ii) The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi occurs only in the Fe protein-MoFe protein complex and is somehow coupled to electron transfer from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the Fe protein to the metal centers in the MoFe protein (an [8Fe-7S] cluster and an FeMo-containing cofactor). (iii) The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi participates in signaling dissociation of the Fe protein from the MoFe protein following each single-electron transfer reaction. Since the reduction of all known substrates by nitrogenase requires two or more electrons (8.Burgess B.K. Spiro T.G. Metal Ions in Biology: Molybdenum Enzymes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 161-220Google Scholar), multiple rounds of Fe protein-MoFe protein association, ATP hydrolysis, electron transfer, and Fe protein-MoFe protein dissociation must occur for all substrate reduction reactions (9.Hageman R.V. Burris R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). There have been isolated examinations of the interactions of nucleotides other than adenine nucleotides with nitrogenase. To summarize, no nucleotide other than ATP has been shown to support substrate reduction, although there is a recent report that protons can be reduced at extremely low rates without ATP within an Fe protein-MoFe protein complex created with AlF4−·ADP (10.Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 511-515PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi is the predominant reaction observed. Apparently, the MoFe protein alone or the Fe protein-MoFe protein complex can catalyze the further hydrolysis of ADP at extremely low rates (11.Larsen C. Christensen S. Watt G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12.Miller R.W. Eady R.R. Gormal C. Fairhurst S.A. Smith B.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), although these reactions do not appear to be part of the substrate reduction mechanism. A divalent metal-bound form of ATP is required for hydrolysis, with MgATP showing the highest rates of substrate reduction (13.Burns R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 171: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There is, however, evidence suggesting that nucleotides other than adenosine di- or triphosphates interact with nitrogenase. The Fe protein is known to bind 2 molecules of either MgATP or MgADP, with each resulting in distinct protein conformational changes (1.Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). These protein conformational changes have been detected by a variety of methods. For example, the line shape of the EPR signal of the S = 1/2 state of the reduced [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster of the Fe protein changes upon MgATP or MgADP binding (14.Zumft W.G. Palmer G. Mortenson L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MgGTP was observed to induce small changes in the EPR line shape of the Fe protein, suggesting that MgGTP binds to the Fe protein and induces at least partial protein conformational changes (14.Zumft W.G. Palmer G. Mortenson L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Another technique that reports protein conformational changes in the Fe protein is the sensitivity of the [4Fe-4S] cluster to chelation by iron-specific chelators like bathophenanthroline or α,α′-dipyridyl. In the absence of nucleotides, the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the Fe protein is resistant to chelation by chelators (15.Walker G.A. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,16.Ljones T. Burris R.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Upon binding MgATP, however, a time-dependent release of all of the iron atoms from the cluster to the chelator occurs. MgGTP, MgCTP, and MgUTP all were observed to slightly stimulate iron chelation from the reduced Fe protein, although the rates were far below that observed upon MgATP binding (15.Walker G.A. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this work, evidence is presented that nitrogenase catalyzes the hydrolysis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides (MgGTP, MgITP, and MgUTP) other than ATP at significant rates. These rates were sensitive to the oxidation state of the nitrogenase proteins, with an oxidized enzyme having much greater rates of hydrolysis than the reduced enzyme. The traditional focus on the dithionite-reduced form of nitrogenase likely explains why these activities were not previously reported. The nature of the interactions of these other nucleotides with nitrogenase are examined, and the implications of these findings in understanding roles for nucleotides in the nitrogenase mechanism are discussed. Azotobacter vinelandii cells were grown as described previously (17.Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clostridium pasteurianum strain W5 was a gift from Professor J. S. Chen (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) and was grown as described (18.Tso M.Y.W. Ljones T. Burris R.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to apparent homogeneity as judged by migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel with Coomassie Blue staining (20.Hathaway G.M. Lundak T.S. Tahara S.M. Traugh J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 495-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified biuret method using bovine serum albumin as the standard (21.Chromy V. Fischer J. Kulhanek V. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1362-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fe protein concentrations were also determined from the visible absorption spectrum using an absorption coefficient for the oxidized protein of 13.3 mm−1 cm−1 at 400 nm (22.Lanzilotta W.N. Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10713-10723Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All manipulations of proteins were conducted in the absence of oxygen in sealed serum vials under an argon atmosphere or inside an anaerobic glove box (Vacuum Atmospheres Co., Hawthorne, CA) with an argon gas atmosphere with <1 ppm oxygen. Acetylene and proton reduction activity assays were conducted as described previously (23.Seefeldt L.C. Ensign S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All nitrogenase component proteins had specific activities of >1900 nmol of substrate reduced per min/mg of protein for both H2 evolution and C2H2 reduction. Substrate reduction assays all contained a MgATP regeneration system (17.Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of hydrolysis of MgNTPs other than MgATP were determined essentially as described (19.Seefeldt L.C. Mortenson L.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The assay solutions consisted of 100 mm MOPS1 (pH 7.0) with 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 2 mmnucleotide, unless noted otherwise. When the nucleotide concentration was varied, the MgCl2 concentration was maintained at a 1:1 molar ratio with the nucleotide concentration. Hydrolysis assays conducted under reducing conditions contained 10 mmdithionite, whereas hydrolysis assays conducted under oxidizing conditions contained 4 mm oxidized indigo disulfonate (IDS). All assays were conducted at 30 °C with shaking for times ranging from 45 s to 2 min. Reaction times were chosen to minimize the accumulation of MgNDP while providing sufficient concentration of the nucleotide to allow accurate quantification. These assays did not contain a nucleoside triphosphate-regenerating system. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 128 μg of either Av2 (Fe protein from Azotobacter vinelandii) or Cp2 (Fe protein from C. pasteurianum) to vials containing 250 μg of either Av1 (MoFe protein from A. vinelandii) or Cp1 (MoFe protein from C. pasteurianum). The reactions were quenched by the addition of 250 μl of 2.5m H2SO4. MgADP, MgGDP, MgIDP, and MgUDP were quantified following separation by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Supelcosil LC-18 column (4.6 mm × 25 cm; Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA) with a mobile phase of 100 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.2) containing 12% (v/v) methanol and 4 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate and a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. Nucleotides were detected with a continuous flow UV-visible detector and molar absorption coefficients of 15.4 mm−1cm−1 at 259 nm (MgADP), 13.7 mm−1cm−1 at 252 nm (MgGDP), 12.2 mm−1cm−1 at 248 nm (MgIDP), and 8.1 mm−1 cm−1 at 262 nm (MgUDP) (24.Weast R.C. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. 69th Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988Google Scholar). The Michaelis constants (K m andV max) for MgNTP hydrolysis were determined from least-squares fits of hydrolysis rates versus nucleotide concentration to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 2) using the program Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), Vi=Vmax [S]Km+[S]Equation 2 where V i is the measured rate,V max is the maximal rate, [S] is the substrate concentration, and K m is the Michaelis constant. Absorbance changes occurring during nitrogenase turnover were monitored with a Hi-Tech SF61 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with data acquisition and curve fitting software. The SHU-61 sample handling unit was kept inside an anaerobic chamber with a gas atmosphere of 95% N2 and 5% H2 with <1 ppm oxygen. Reactants were thermostatted to 30 ± 0.2 °C with a Techne C-85D circulator attached to a FC-200 flow cooler (25.Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Data were collected at 430 nm. The rates of primary electron transfer were determined in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) with 150 mm NaCl. Nitrogenase protein complexes were trapped by incubation of Av1 and Av2 with AlF4− (26.Renner K.A.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and MgATP, MgGTP, MgITP, or MgUTP. The reaction solutions contained 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 20 mm AlF4−, 10 mm MgNTP, 10 μm av1, and 60 μm Av2. The reactions were allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 5 min, followed by isolation of the nitrogenase complexes by HPLC using a Spherogel TSK 3000SW column (Beckman Instruments) with a mobile phase of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) containing 500 mm NaCl and 800 μm dithionite and a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Proteins were detected by their ultraviolet absorption at 280 nm. Hydrolysis of MgATP by the Fe protein-MoFe protein complex can occur in the absence of electron transfer (termed reductant-independent ATP hydrolysis) or coupled to electron transfer. For the coupled reactions, the stoichiometry can range from a minimum of 2 ATP molecules hydrolyzed for each electron transferred to substrate (5.Mortenson L.E. Upchurch R.G. Gibson A.H. Newton W.E. Current Perspectives in Nitrogen Fixation. Australian Academy of Science, Canberra, Australia1981: 75-78Google Scholar) to very large ratios of ATP hydrolysis per electron transferred. TableI summarizes the ATP hydrolysis rates observed for nitrogenases isolated from two different bacteria, the aerobic bacterium A. vinelandii and the anaerobic bacteriumC. pasteurianum. Consistent with earlier findings (11.Larsen C. Christensen S. Watt G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the oxidation state of nitrogenase greatly influences the MgATP hydrolysis rate, with the dithionite-reduced state showing the highest ATP hydrolysis rates for both enzymes. Oxidation of nitrogenase with the mediator IDS (midpoint potential (E m) = −125 mV) results in the oxidation of the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster to the 2+ oxidation state and the MoFe protein P cluster to the P2+ state. Oxidation significantly lowers the rate of MgATP hydrolysis to ∼5% of the reduced state rates. MgGTP, MgITP, and MgUTP were screened as potential substrates for nitrogenase as representative purine and pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates. As shown in Table I, under dithionite reducing conditions, all three nucleotides were found to be hydrolyzed to their respective nucleoside diphosphates at low rates. No nucleoside monophosphates were detected as products. The rates of hydrolysis of MgGTP, MgCTP, and MgITP were <5% of the ATP hydrolysis rate, but were above background levels, suggesting that these nucleotides are substrates for nitrogenase-dependent hydrolysis. Surprisingly, the rates of hydrolysis of GTP, CTP, and ITP were found to increase when nitrogenase was oxidized. All three nucleotides were hydrolyzed at rates substantially higher than MgATP hydrolysis rates when nitrogenase was oxidized and reached rates that ranged from 30 to 50% of the maximal rates observed for MgATP hydrolysis by reduced nitrogenase.Table IMaximal rates of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis by nitrogenaseComponentsbThe designations used denote the Fe protein (Av2) and MoFe protein (Av1) from A. vinelandii and the Fe protein (Cp2) and MoFe protein (Cp1) fromC. pasteurianum.

Initial nucleotide triphosphate concentrations were 2 mm. Open table in a new tab The lower rates of hydrolysis of MgGTP, MgCTP, and MgITP under reducing conditions could have been a result of the choice of reductant, dithionite. To test this possibility, MgGTP, MgITP, and MgUTP hydrolysis by nitrogenase was carried out in the presence of 5 mm electrochemically reduced methyl viologen (E m = −450 mV) as the reductant. Reduced methyl viologen has a similar E m to that of dithionite and has previously been shown to support nitrogenase activity (28.Watt G.D. Reddy K.R.N. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 53: 281-294Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similar rates of MgNTP hydrolysis were observed when either dithionite or methyl viologen was the reductant, indicating that the oxidation state of the nitrogenase proteins controls the rates of MgNTP hydrolysis, and not the choice of reductant. Several lines of evidence indicate that these reactions are attributable to nitrogenase and not to a contaminating protein. First, the hydrolysis reactions were observed in nitrogenase proteins isolated from different bacterial sources. The nitrogenase isolated fromC. pasteurianum, unrelated to A. vinelandii, was found to demonstrate similar nucleoside triphosphatase activities (Table I). Second, neither nitrogenase component protein (Fe or MoFe protein) alone was observed to catalyze the hydrolysis of MgNTP even after long incubation times. Third, oxygen inactivation of either nitrogenase protein prior to the initiation of the assay completely inhibited the observed MgNTP hydrolysis reactions. Fourth, the rates of MgNTP hydrolysis by nitrogenase were dependent on the ratio of the Fe and MoFe proteins (Fig. 1). In all cases, the maximal MgNTP hydrolysis activity occurred near a 2:1 molar ratio of Fe protein to MoFe protein. Finally, all nitrogenase-catalyzed reactions are subject to inhibition by NaCl concentrations >50 mm (29.Deits T.L. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3859-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibition has been proposed to be a result of interference in the ionic interactions between nitrogenase component proteins (30.Wolle D. Kim C. Dean D. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3667-3673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the inhibition of MgATP, MgGTP, MgITP, and MgUTP hydrolysis by increasing concentrations of NaCl for A. vinelandii nitrogenase when assay vials contained 10 mm dithionite (panel A) or 4 mm IDS (panel B). In either oxidation state, the hydrolysis of MgGTP, MgITP, and MgUTP was completely inhibited at NaCl concentrations >300 mm. The hydrolysis of MgATP by IDS-oxidized nitrogenase also followed a similar NaCl inhibition profile. In contrast, MgATP hydrolysis activity in the presence of dithionite was not completely inhibited until NaCl concentrations were >800 mm.Figure 2Inhibition of nitrogenase-catalyzed MgNTP hydrolysis by NaCl.

Open table in a new tab MgATP or MgADP binding to the Fe protein has been shown to induce distinct conformational changes to both oxidized and reduced states. Hence, it was of interest to determine if nucleotides other than MgATP and MgADP could induce conformational changes to the dithionite-reduced or IDS-oxidized state of the Fe protein. None of the nucleotides other than MgATP or MgADP were observed to change the E mof the Fe protein or to alter the position of the isotropically shifted proton signals in the proton NMR spectrum. Only MgATP and MgADP were found to influence the visible region CD spectrum of the Fe protein in the oxidized state. Consistent with previous reports (14.Zumft W.G. Palmer G. Mortenson L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), MgGTP did show subtle effects on the line shape of the EPR spectrum of the [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster; however, MgGDP, MgITP, MgIDP, MgUTP, and MgUDP did not influence the EPR spectrum. Last, only MgATP significantly stimulated the chelation of Fe2+ from dithionite-reduced Fe protein by α,α′-dipyridyl, consistent with previous findings (15.Walker G.A. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Only MgATP was found to support reduction of protons, acetylene, or N2 by nitrogenase. The reason for this was apparent when the electron transfer reaction from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein was monitored. Fig. 4 shows that MgATP can stimulate primary electron transfer from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein with an apparent first-order rate constant of 107.4 ± 2.5 s−1. No increase in the 430 nm absorbance was detected when MgITP replaced MgATP. Furthermore, none of the nucleotides tested other than MgATP supported any detectable electron transfer even when the assay time was increased to 1000 s. It has been shown recently that the addition of AlF4− and MgATP or MgADP to nitrogenase assays results in the formation of a non-dissociating Fe protein-MoFe protein complex (26.Renner K.A. Howard J.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5353-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27.Duyvis M.G. Wassink H. Haaker H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine if AlF4− would stabilize a nitrogenase complex with other MgNTP molecules, nitrogenase turnover was carried out in the presence of AlF4− and the other MgNTP molecules examined here. The addition of AlF4− and MgGTP, MgITP, or MgUTP all resulted in stable nitrogenase complexes as determined by the isolation of these complexes by HPLC. The oxidation state of nitrogenase did not alter the formation of these complexes. This work provides evidence that nitrogenase can hydrolyze purine and pyrimidine nucleotides at high rates, not just adenine nucleotides as was previously reported. The K m values measured for the hydrolysis of each nucleotide examined were near the value for ATP. From this, it can be concluded that the adenine base does not provide significant specificity for binding or hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates by the nitrogenase complex. Although the oxidation state of the nitrogenase proteins did not influence the K mvalues for hydrolysis, it did dramatically influence the maximal hydrolysis rates. Only adenine nucleotides induced substantial protein conformational changes in the Fe protein when compared with the other nucleotides examined. Furthermore, the hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate from a nucleoside triphosphate is not sufficient to stimulate electron transfer or substrate reductions by nitrogenase. This suggests that interactions of the adenine base with the Fe protein play a more important role than previously thought in directing the energy of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis to conformational changes that influence electron transfer and substrate reduction. The influence of the oxidation state of the nitrogenase proteins on the hydrolysis rates for nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP probably explains why these activities have not been previously reported. Most of the earlier studies have focused on the reduced resting state of the nitrogenase proteins in the presence of low potential reductants (e.g. dithionite or reduced methyl viologen). In this state, the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster is in the 1+ state, the P clusters are in the all-ferrous state (PN), and FeMoco is in the dithionite-reduced resting state. Upon treatment with oxidized IDS, the Fe protein is in the [4Fe-4S]2+ state, the P clusters are in the P2+ state, and FeMoco remains in the resting state. These two oxidation states of nitrogenase were found to have dramatically different activities toward hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates. The reduced state showed maximal rates of hydrolysis of ATP, with lower but significant rates of hydrolysis of other purine or pyrimidine nucleotides. Interestingly, the measuredK m values for all of the nucleotides tested were about the same (Table II), suggesting similar binding affinities for all of the nucleotides tested. This suggests that the lower rates of hydrolysis of non-adenine nucleotides do not result from lowered binding affinity. The oxidized state of nitrogenase showed a reversal in the activities for hydrolysis of nucleotides, with a low rate of hydrolysis of ATP and much higher rates of hydrolysis of ITP, UTP, and GTP. How can the redox state of nitrogenase control the nucleotide hydrolysis reactions? The Fe protein alone will not hydrolyze nucleotides at detectable levels until bound to the MoFe protein. From this, it can be concluded that MoFe protein binding alters the positions of amino acid residues within the Fe protein that activate the hydrolysis reaction. Given that the MoFe protein binds some 19 Å away from the phosphate-binding region within the Fe protein (32.Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), this activation must occur through protein conformational changes. The [4Fe-4S] cluster of the Fe protein and the P cluster of the MoFe protein are located near the protein-protein docking surface. Thus, it is reasonable that the oxidation state of one or both of these clusters might affect the protein conformational changes involved since redox changes in both the MoFe protein P cluster (33.Christiansen J. Tittsworth R.C. Hales B.J. Cramer S.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10017-10024Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster are known to result in metrical changes in the cluster dimensions. How then might these changes affect the activation of the hydrolysis reaction? First, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the hydrolysis of all nucleotides tested for both the reduced and oxidized states of nitrogenase showed similar dependence on the concentration of Fe protein. This observation suggests that the affinity of binding of the Fe protein to the MoFe protein is similar in each case. Second, as highlighted by Fig. 2, NaCl had a similar effect on the hydrolysis activity of all of the nucleotides tested, with a slight variation for ATP in the reduced state. Previous work has shown that increasing concentrations of NaCl decrease, in part, the affinity of binding of the Fe protein to the MoFe protein (29.Deits T.L. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3859-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the apparent similarities in NaCl sensitivity of the various nucleotides suggest similar Fe protein-MoFe protein affinities. The ATP hydrolysis activity for reduced nitrogenase was somewhat less sensitive to NaCl, suggesting a possible tighter complex. The results from this work favor a model in which the oxidation states of the metal clusters influence the activation of the hydrolytic reaction. The idea that the status of the metal clusters of nitrogenase can influence interactions with nucleotides has been suggested before (34.Miller R.W. Smith B.E. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 35.Ryle M.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9424-9434Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36.Yates M.G. Stacey G. Burris R.H. Evans H.J. Biological Nitrogen Fixation. Chapman and Hall, Inc., New York1991: 685-735Google Scholar). Given the location of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the Fe protein and the P cluster of the MoFe protein at the docking interface between the two proteins (32.Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to conclude that metrical changes in these cluster would affect the positioning of the substrates or hydrolytic residues through alterations in the protein conformational changes. Earlier work has demonstrated that the binding of either ATP or ADP to the Fe protein results in protein conformational changes, including altered electronic and spectroscopic properties of the [4Fe-4S] cluster (reviewed in Refs. 1.Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar and 3.Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1997; 30: 260-266Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, communication from the nucleotide-binding site to the [4Fe-4S] cluster has been inferred, and protein motifs likely to be involved in such communication have been examined (37.Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). From the present study, it is seen that the binding of UTP, GTP, or ITP to the Fe protein results in few changes in the E m, CD, EPR, and NMR of the Fe protein. Thus, it is apparent that the adenine moiety must influence how the energy of nucleotide binding is directed to protein conformational changes. The lack of significant conformational changes induced by UTP, GTP, and ITP binding likely explains why these nucleotides do not stimulate the electron transfer reaction and substrate reduction. Even though ITP, CTP, and GTP are hydrolyzed by nitrogenase, these nucleotides do not support electron transfer or substrate reduction. Two important conclusions are apparent from this observations. (i) The energy of hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide is not sufficient to direct the activation of the electron transfer or substrate reduction reaction; and (ii) the adenine moiety must play a central role in directing the energy of nucleotide association and hydrolysis into events that allow electron transfer and substrate reduction. A look at the structures for the nucleobases examined in this study (Scheme FS1) emphasizes several important aspects of the interactions discovered here. First, despite the significant difference in structure between the pyrimidine and purine nucleobases, nitrogenase is capable of accommodating a large range of structures for binding and hydrolysis. Second, although the structural differences between adenine and inosine are very small (an amino group versus a hydroxyl group at C-6), the differences in coupling hydrolysis to electron transfer are infinite. This indicates that specific interactions with the C-6 moiety of the purine base must be integral to this coupling event. An examination of the structure of the AlF4−·ADP-stabilized complex of the Fe protein with the MoFe protein (32.Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) reveals some likely interactions of the Fe protein with the adenosine nucleobase. The side chains of Tyr240 and Gln236 and the carbonyl oxygen of Pro212 are ∼4 Å away from the adenosine amino group at C-6 and are thus likely to be involved in specific interactions with this group (32.Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). As noted earlier, the K m values for ATP and ITP hydrolysis are nearly identical, so these interactions are not likely to play a large role in recognition, but rather in positioning. Interactions with the amino group of adenine or the hydroxyl group of inosine probably slightly alter the position of the ribose and phosphate groups, as is apparent from the different rates of hydrolysis of the two nucleotides depending on the oxidation state of the protein. An important conclusion that can be made from this observation is that the hydrolysis reaction is not sufficient to drive electron transfer. Earlier proposals have suggested that the transition state with ADP and Pi bound is the work step used to communicate the hydrolysis energy to electron transfer (31.Lowe D.J. Ashby G.A. Brune M. Knights H. Webb M.R. Thorneley R.N.F. Tikhonovich I.A. Provorov N.A. Romanov V.I. Newton W.E. Nitrogen Fixation: Fundamentals and Applications. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 103-108Google Scholar). The present work suggests that if this is the case, then the exact position of the ADP or Pi is fundamentally important to the proper coupling of this work step with the downstream events. In summary, it is clear that nitrogenase can hydrolyze both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides at significant rates and that the oxidation state of nitrogenase defines the rates of hydrolysis. It seems reasonable that the adenine moiety of ATP plays an important role, not so much in the binding affinity for nucleotides, but rather in directing the energy of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis to conformational changes involved in stimulating electron transfer and substrate reduction.

Taken together these results provide new insights into the tertiary structure in VAChT. vesicular acetylcholine transporter acetylcholine transmembrane domain The vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT)1 catalyzes the transport of acetylcholine (ACh) from the cytoplasm into small synaptic vesicles of cholinergic neurons. Transport of ACh by VAChT is dependent on a proton electrochemical gradient across the synaptic membrane involving the exchange of two protons from inside the vesicle for one cytoplasmic substrate (1.Nguyen M.L. Cox G.D. Parsons S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13400-13410Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For the transport of ACh, at least two sequential steps are required: binding of ACh to the transporter and the actual transfer of ACh across the vesicle membrane. In this process, it is suggested that the loss of a proton leads to a conformational change which makes the transporter active (2.Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9094-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Vesamicol ((-)-trans-2-(4-phenylpiperidino)cyclohexanol) has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of ACh transport by VAChT (3.Bahr B. Clarkson E.D. Rogers G. Noremberg K. Parsons S.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5752-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4.Parsons S.M. Prior C. Marshall I.G. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 35: 279-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This compound acts in a noncompetitive manner; however ACh blocks vesamicol binding to the transporter. Recent mutagenesis studies have separated the vesamicol binding site from the ACh binding site (5.Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol.

Hydrophathy analysis predicts that VAChT contain 12 transmembrane domains, and within these putative hydrophobic domains are found a number of both positively and negatively charged residues (6.Erickson J.D Varoqui H.

Because of the large energy requirement for placing a single charged amino acid residue in the hydrophobic environment of a membrane, such residues are a relatively infrequent occurrence in membrane spanning α-helices. On the other hand when present, these charged residues frequently have specific physiological functions. In the case of VAChT, charged residues could function in maintaining the native conformation of the transporter, they could be involved in substrate binding, or they could play a role in the H+/antiporter activity. Sequence conservation of charged and polar amino acids within the putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains of VAChT suggests functional importance. In a previous report (5.Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), Asp-398 in TM10 and Asp-425 in TM11 were shown to possess important roles in acetylcholine transport. The placing of a charged amino acid residue in membrane-spanning regions of a membrane protein is thermodynamically unfavorable. However, Honig and Hubbell (8.Honig B.H. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5412-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) have pointed out that the transfer of an ion pair from water to a region of low dielectric constant is not so energetically unfavorable. Indeed such an ion pair could make additional hydrogen bonds in the membrane. In the case of voltage-sensitive ion channels, charged residues are a prominent feature of membrane-spanning α-helices and may provide an essential binding site for transported ions or for the gating mechanism (9.Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 242: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). In such channel proteins, the positively charged amino acids in amphipathic helices probably line the aqueous channel. It is believed that these positive charges are ion paired with negatively charged residues on adjacent α-helices (9.Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 242: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). A salt bridge between oppositely charged amino acid residues in membrane-spanning regions would greatly reduce the energy required to stabilize two individual charged residues in a hydrophobic environment and may also provide a proton relay system for the H+/substrate transporter (10.Lee J.A. Puttner I.B. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2540-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rat VAChT has three positively charged residues within its transmembrane domains, Lys-131 in TM2, His-338 in TM8, and His-444 in TM12, and has three histidines located on luminal loops. In this paper, we have investigated the role of these positively charged residues and their potential interaction with the negatively charged residues in the transmembrane domains. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (5.Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, rVAChT was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ and transformed into the BD2399 strain ofEscherichia coli with R408 helper phage yielding single-stranded uracil containing DNA. Mutagenic oligonucleotides, which contain a one- or two-base mismatch with wild type VAChT, were annealed to parental single-stranded DNA and extended to synthesize the complementary strand. The product was transformed into the JM109 strain of E. coli to remove uracil-containing parental DNA. To verify that only the desired mutation was introduced, the mutated portion was sequenced by the dideoxy method (11.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar). The mutant VAChT was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Insertions of fragments into PstI or XhoI restriction enzyme sites were used for double or triple mutant construction. PC12A123.7 cells (12.Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixed 1:1 with Ham's F-12 medium. The culture medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For electroporation, trypsin/EDTA was used to first detach cells from culture plates. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of ∼6 × 107 cells/ml. Resuspended cells (800 μl) were mixed with DNA (50 μg), incubated on ice for 10 min, and then transferred to a 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad). Electroporation was carried out at 0.2 kV and 975 microfarads. Cells were replated in the above medium with fresh medium added at 24 h. Cells were cultured for an additional 24–48 h, harvested, and vesicles prepared. The expression level of wild type and of mutant VAChTs was determined by Western blotting. It was noted that with a given batch of cells, VAChT expression did not vary significantly between replicates or between different constructs. A postnuclear supernatant fraction was prepared as described previously (5.Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were removed from culture plates with trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and resuspended in a homogenization buffer (0.32 msucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 4% of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 5% Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were broken by several up and down strokes in a Potter-Elvehjam homogenizer. Centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min yielded the postnuclear supernatant fraction. Protein was determined with the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Transport of acetylcholine into synaptic vesicles and vesamicol binding to the vesicles were performed according to Kimet al. (5.Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For ACh transport assays, 50 μl of postnuclear supernatants containing ∼500 μg of protein was mixed with 50 μl of uptake/binding buffer (110 mm potassium tartrate, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm ascorbic acid) and pre-incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence or absence ofl-vesamicol (Research Biochemicals Inc.). Uptake was initiated by the addition of 10 mm Mg2+-ATP and 0.5 mm [3H]ACh (40–50 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C. For vesamicol binding assays, an aliquot of postnuclear supernatant containing ∼250 μg of protein was mixed with uptake/binding buffer containing 35 nml-[3H]vesamicol (31 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). The total volume was adjusted to 200 μl with uptake and binding buffer. The suspension was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Both uptake and binding reactions were terminated by vacuum filtration through an HAWP filter (Millipore) pre-wetted with cold uptake/binding buffer followed by two washes of 5 ml each with ice-cold uptake/binding buffer. Radioactivity bound to the filters was solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS and measured by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined in the absence of ATP but in the presence of 4 μm vesamicol at 0 °C and was subtracted from total binding. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice. The postnuclear supernatant containing ∼5 mg of protein in 0.5 ml was loaded onto a 10-ml linear sucrose gradient from 0.6–1.6 m sucrose in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 6 h in an SW40 rotor in a Beckman LE-80 centrifuge at 4 °C. Fractions of 500 μl were collected from the bottom of the tube and stored at −80 °C until use. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (5.Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to assess the expression of mutant VAChTs. An aliquot of postnuclear supernatant, containing ∼50 μg of protein was diluted 1000-fold with homogenization buffer and then pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A semi-dry electrotransfer apparatus (Alltech) was used to transfer proteins to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 10% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated first with a goat anti-rVAChT antisera (Chemicon International Co.) and then with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antisera. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions from sucrose density gradients were immunoblotted in a similar manner and included additional Western blot analysis using either a monoclonal antibody against synaptophysin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or a rabbit antisera against secretogranin II. The secretogranin II antisera was a generous gift from Dr. Jonathan Scammell of the University of Alabama. Fig. 1 is a schematic showing the position of the positively charged amino acid residues of rat VAChT and their amino acid sequence homology among different species of VAChT and the related transporters VMAT1 and VMAT2. In rat VAChT, there are eight histidine residues. Two of these, His-338 and His-444, are located in a transmembrane domain; three histidines, His-283, His-354, and His-413, are found in cytoplasmic loops; and three, His-63, His-318, and His-441, are located on luminal loops. His-338, found in TM8 is conserved among all VAChTs but is absent in VMAT. His-413 found in the cytoplasmic loop between TM10 and TM11 is conserved among mammalian VAChTs and VMAT, whereas His-444 found in TM12 is conserved among all VAChTs except the Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans proteins and is absent from the VMATs. There is one lysine residue in a transmembrane domain, Lys-131 in TM2, which is conserved among all cloned VAChTs as well in the VMATs. Using site-directed mutagenesis, Lys-131 was replaced with alanine or leucine to remove the positive charge from this position. The mutant VAChTs were expressed in PC12A123.7, and their ability to transport acetylcholine and bind vesamicol was determined. As shown in Fig.2 replacement of Lys-131 with alanine or leucine led to a severe transport defect, but vesamicol binding activity remained at a level comparable with the wild type transporter. The decreased transport activity of these mutants could be because of several factors unrelated to transport activity. The concentration of mutant transporter could be low because of reduced production or reduced stability of the mutant protein, or the targeting of the mutant transporter to the small synaptic vesicles could be impaired. The first possibility seems unlikely because vesamicol binding appeared normal and was further ruled out by comparing VAChTK131A and VAChTK131L expression levels to that of the wild type transporter by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.3, the mutant and wild type transporters were expressed at comparable levels and exhibited the same subunit molecular weight. Therefore, the impairment of the transport activity in VAChTK131A and VAChTK131L is not attributable to reduced levels of transporter protein. Although the Lys-131 VAChT mutants were expressed at wild type levels, it is possible that they were inefficiently targeted to the synaptic vesicle. To rule out this possibility, post-nuclear supernatants were fractionated on a 0.6–1.6 m linear sucrose gradient using synaptophysin as a marker for synaptic vesicles and secretogranin II as a marker for dense core vesicles (5.Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Lys-131 mutant proteins were found to co-localize with synaptophysin as did the wild type transporter as illustrated in Fig. 4 for K131A. Therefore, the loss of transport activity in VAChTK131A and VAChTK131L is not a consequence of improper localization. In contrast to the results obtained with the Lys-131 alanine or leucine mutants, replacement of Lys-131 with a histidine or arginine residue reduced, but did not eliminate, ACh transport activity, Fig. 2.Figure 3Western blot analysis of wild type (WT) and mutant rVAChT proteins. Post-nuclear supernatants from wild type (WT) and mutant VAChT transfected PC12A123.7 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and then separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blot analysis was then conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The rVAChT proteins appeared as a diffuse band with a molecular mass of approximately 68–70 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Equilibrium sucrose density gradient fractionation of postnuclear supernatants of PC12A123.7 cells expressing wild type and mutant VAChTs. Post-nuclear supernatants from wild type or rVAChT mutant-transfected PC12A123.7 cells were loaded onto a 0.6–1.6 m continuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube and subjected to Western blot analysis. Fractions were probed with anti-secretogranin II antisera (SgII) to locate large dense core vesicles, anti-synaptophysin antisera (Syn) to locate small synaptic vesicles, and anti-rVAChT antisera to locate VAChT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A histidine residue in the cytoplasmic loop between TM10 and TM11 has been shown to be important for energy coupling in VMAT1 (13.Shirvan A. Laskar O. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rat VAChT has three His residues in cytoplasmic loops: His-283 between TM6 and TM7, His-354 between TM8 and TM9, and His-413 between TM10 and TM11. Because His-283 and His-354 are not conserved among VAChT species, see Fig. 1, it is unlikely they would be functionally important. On the other hand, His-413 is conserved among mammalian VAChTs, although it is absent inDrosophila and Torpedo VAChT, and corresponds to His-419 in VMAT1. Thus although His-413 might be anticipated to be functionally important in acetylcholine transport, its replacement by Ala, Arg, or Cys showed no significant affect on the transport of acetylcholine. However, vesamicol binding was reduced to half of wild type levels, Table I. Thus, His-413 must be functionally different between VMAT and VAChT, and its lack of conservation in Drosophila and Torpedo VAChTs can be explained by its nonessential role.Table IACh uptake and vesamicol binding by histidine mutantsMutantACh uptake (pmol/min/mg protein)Vesamicol binding (pmol/mg.)Wild type26 ± 2.04.2 ± 0.08H338A25 ± 1.90H413A23 ± 3.11.9 ± 0.05H413R25 ± 2.02.0 ± 0.11H413C25 ± 1.81.9 ± 0.03H444A27 ± 1.44.2 ± 0.13H444R25 ± 2.14.2 ± 0.21H444C26 ± 2.24.1 ± 0.06H338A/H444A24 ± 2.80H63A/H318A/H441A25 ± 2.54.0 ± 0.05H338DND0D398HND0Acetylcholine uptake and vesamicol binding were determined with post-nuclear supernatants (500 μg total protein) from PC12A123.7 transfected with wild type or mutant VAChT cDNAs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are given with their standard deviation determined from three independent experiments.

Open table in a new tab Acetylcholine uptake and vesamicol binding were determined with post-nuclear supernatants (500 μg total protein) from PC12A123.7 transfected with wild type or mutant VAChT cDNAs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are given with their standard deviation determined from three independent experiments. ND, not determined. There are two histidine residues located in transmembrane domains of rVAChT, His-338 in TM8 and His-444 in TM12. His-338 is conserved in all known species of VAChT but is not found in VMATs. This histidine, which is located in the center of the putative transmembrane domain 8, has been suggested to serve as the proton exchanger which drives ACh transport (1.Nguyen M.L. Cox G.D. Parsons S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13400-13410Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). His-444 is conserved in all family members of VAChT except C. elegans and is also not found in VMATs. This residue is located near the luminal surface of the 12th putative transmembrane domain. Replacement of His-338 with alanine (H338A) or lysine (H338K) had no effect on ACh transport; however, replacement with arginine (H338R) or cysteine (H338C) completely abolished transport activity, Fig.5. The difference in transport activity between H338A and H338K on the one hand and H338R and H338C on the other hand were not because of differences in the expression level of the recombinant transporters (Fig. 3). As illustrated for H338A in Fig.4, sucrose gradient centrifugation showed that all of the mutant proteins localized to the same synaptic vesicle fraction as did wild type VAChT. Although His-338 mutants exhibited differential effects on ACh transport dependent on the specific substitution, all of the His-338 mutants lacked vesamicol binding activity. In contrast to the results obtained with mutations at His-338, changing His-444 in TM12 to alanine, arginine, or cysteine had no effect on the transport of acetylcholine or vesamicol binding. The finding that neither of the transmembrane histidines were required for acetylcholine transport seemed to eliminate a histidine as the proton exchanger. However, these results do not rule out the possibility that mutation of the histidine involved in proton coupling (i.e. His-338) was compensated for by the second transmembrane histidine (i.e., His-444) taking over this function. Therefore, we constructed the double mutant H338A/H444A and examined its transport activity. As shown in Table I, this double mutant exhibited approximately the same rate of ACh transport activity as did the wild type transporter. As acetylcholine is transported from the cytoplasm into the vesicle, protons are exchanged from inside the vesicle to the cytoplasm (4.Parsons S.M. Prior C. Marshall I.G. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 35: 279-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 14.Nguyen M.L. Parsons S.M. Prog. Brain Res. 1996; 109: 97-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a histidine has been suggested to be the proton carrier (1.Nguyen M.L. Cox G.D. Parsons S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13400-13410Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Neither of the two transmembrane histidines are required for this proton coupling nor could one envision how a histidine in the cytoplasmic loop could fulfill this role. The remaining possibility is that one of the three histidine residues in the luminal loop of rVAChT functions in proton coupling. To test this possibility, we constructed a triple mutant in which each of these histidines was replaced with alanine. As shown in Table I, this mutant, VAChTH63A/H318A/H441A, showed the same rate of acetylcholine transport activity as did wild type VAChT. A number of transporters have been found to have ion pairs formed between transmembrane positively charged and negatively charged residues (15.Merickel A. Kaback H.R. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5403-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16.Sahin-Toth M. Dunten R.L. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9783-9790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as a means of avoiding an energetically unfavorable environment. If two oppositely charged residues form such a salt bridge, replacement of either charged residue with a neutral residue creates an unpaired charge which can lead to functional defects. On the other hand, neutral substitutions for both residues may not cause inactivation nor might charge reversal of the ion pairing residues. For example, studies of the E. colilactose permease have demonstrated that neutralization of residues forming a charge pair can restore the function lost in single mutants, as could reversal of the polarity (16.Sahin-Toth M. Dunten R.L. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10547-10551Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18.Dunten R.L. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R.

Acta. 1991; 1062: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that in the lactose permease of E. coli, positively and negatively charged residues in the TM interact and form a proton relay system that is postulated to function as a chemical pathway for proton movement through the lactose permease (10.Lee J.A. Puttner I.B. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2540-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because mutations of Lys-131 affect ACh transport activity, but not vesamicol binding, we sought to determine whether this residue might form an ion pair with either of the two transmembrane aspartate residues, Asp-398 and Asp-425, whose mutations also showed effects on ACh transport activity (5.Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We constructed mutants in which Lys-131 and either Asp-398 or Asp-425 were simultaneously replaced with neutral residues. Neither the K131A/D398N mutant nor the K131A/D425N mutant recovered acetylcholine transport activity. We also constructed the charge reversal mutants K131D/D398K and K131D/D425K. Despite normal levels of transporter expression with these mutants (Fig. 3), ACh transport activity was not detected, Fig.6. Although His-338 had no known function in acetylcholine transport, mutants H338A, H338R, and H338C were almost completely blocked in vesamicol binding. Similarly, replacement of Asp-398 in TM10 by Asn abolished vesamicol binding (5.Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the possibility that His-338 and Asp-398 might make an ion pair. Neutralization of charge at positions 338 and 398 in the mutant H338A/D398N did not restore vesamicol binding; however, the charge reversal mutant H338D/D398H showed almost the same vesamicol binding activity as the wild type transporter, Fig. 7. To rule out the possibility that vesamicol binding activity would be recovered by just a single mutation, we examined vesamicol binding with the H338D and D398K single mutants. As expected, there was no activity with either of these single mutants, Table I. The energy requirement for placing a charged amino acid residue in a hydrophobic environment makes such residues infrequent in protein membrane spanning α-helices. When present, they frequently play a role in substrate binding and translocation (15.Merickel A. Kaback H.R. Edwards R.H. J. Biol.

We have investigated the three putative transmembrane domain basic residues of rat VAChT; Lys-131 in TM2, His-338 in TM8, and His-444 in TM12. At position 131 in TM2, a positive charge rather than Lys is required for ACh transport activity. However, neutral residues at position 131 retain vesamicol binding. This finding functionally distinguishes the site of vesamicol binding from ACh transport. In VMAT1, His-419 in the cytoplasmic loop between TM10 and TM11 is suggested to play a role in energy coupling (13.Shirvan A. Laskar O. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the corresponding His in VAChT, His-413, is not conserved inDrosophila or Torpedo VAChTs. The finding that a variety of amino acid substitutions for His-413 of rVAChT were without effect is in keeping with the lack of conservation of this residue. This raises the question as to whether VMAT His-419 plays a functional role in monoamine transport or whether this is a structural residue. Alternatively, the mechanism of neurotransmitter transport for VMAT and VAChT may differ more than anticipated. Several transport systems for which a proton is a co-transported ion are known to contain essential histidyl residues which most likely participate in the binding and translocation of protons. Examples include the Na+/H+ coupled glutamate transporter (23.Zhang Y. Pines G. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

His-338 was suggested to function as a proton carrier, moving a proton from inside the vesicle to the outside as acetylcholine entered the vesicle (1.Nguyen M.L. Cox G.D. Parsons S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13400-13410Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The finding that H338A is transport competent argues that it cannot be involved in proton translocation. Some, but not all, His-338 mutants are defective in ACh transport, and yet all are defective in vesamicol binding. This suggests that substitutions at His-338 result in conformational changes. The nature of the conformational change is residue-dependent, some affecting ACh transport, and all affecting vesamicol binding. None of the substitutions at His-444 affected ACh transport or vesamicol binding. This is in keeping with the lack of conservation of this residue in Drosophila and C. elegans VAChT. The finding that ACh transport is unaffected when both of the transmembrane histidines were mutated together definitively rules out the involvement of a transmembrane histidine in proton translocation. Histidine residues in the luminal loop of rVAChT were also ruled out as having a functional role in proton coupling. We are left to conclude that VAChT differs from other H+-coupled neurotransmitter transporters in that a His residue does not play a role in substrate binding or proton translocation. We reported that mutation of Asp-398 of TM10 or Asp-425 of TM11 to glutamine abolished ACh transport (5.Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The D398N mutant was additionally defective in vesamicol binding. The finding of two functional TM positively charged residues, Lys-131 and His-338, and the above two functional acidic residues suggests the possibility of ion pairing. However, double mutants, in which interhelical combinations of positively and negatively charged residues were replaced pairwise with neutral residues, did not recover ACh transport activity nor did a H338A/D398N mutant recover vesamicol binding. These results indicate either there are no ion pairs between these charged residues or that ion pairs exist, but a specific charged residue contributes to the transport of acetylcholine and/or vesamicol binding. If a charged residue of an ion pair is important for the structure and function of the transporter, charge reversal might restore function. Of the charge reversal mutants constructed, H338D/D398H recovered vesamicol binding activity suggesting that His-338 in TM8 and Asp-398 in TM10 are connected via a salt bridge. Because polarity of the salt bridge is not important, this ion pair most likely serves a structural role. The ion pair between His-338 and Asp-398, eliminates an ion pair between Lys-131 and Asp-398. However, an ion pair between Lys-131 and Asp-425 cannot be ruled out. Charge reversal between these positions did not recover transport activity, consistent with the finding that a positive charge is required at position 131 for transport activity. Thus, it cannot be determined at this time whether or not an ion pair exists between Lys-131 and Asp-425. However the finding that, in VMAT2, the corresponding Lys-139 in TM2 and Asp-427 in TM11 form a charge pair whose polarity is critical for function (15.Merickel A. Kaback H.R. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5403-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) would support the contention that an ion pair exists between Lys-131 and Asp-425 of VAChT. The results of this study provide the first insights into the tertiary structure of VAChT. The ion pair between His-338 in TM8 and Asp-398 in TM10 indicates TM8 and TM10 must exist in close proximity. This charge pair may anchor these helices together and help form the vesamicol binding site. We propose that His-413 in the cytosol between TM helix 10 and TM helix 11 participates directly in vesamicol binding, and that vesamicol binding to His-413 induces a conformational change transmitted through the His-338/Asp-398 salt bridge. This conformational change leads to the vesamicol-dependent inhibition of ACh transport. It appears probable that Lys-131 of TM2 forms an ion pair with Asp-425 in TM11, bringing these two TM domains in close proximity. Importantly, we have provided evidence that histidine residues do not play a role in acetylcholine binding or proton translocation. This seems to mechanistically distinguish VAChT from VMAT."
https://openalex.org/W2059898284,"To investigate the molecular basis for the specificity of ligand recognition in human kinin B1(B1R) and B2 (B2R) receptors, we constructed a series of chimeric receptors by progressively replacing, from the N to the C terminus, the human B2R domains by their B1 counterparts. The chimeric construct possessing the C-terminal tail and the transmembrane domain VII (TM VII) of the B2R (construct 6) displayed 7- and 20- fold decreased affinities for the B1 agonist [3H]desArg10-kallidin (desArg10-KD) and the B1 antagonist [3H]desArg10-[Leu9]-KD respectively, as compared with the wild-type B1R. Moreover, the substitution of the B1 TM VII by its B2homologue TM increased the affinity for the pseudopeptide antagonists, Hoe140 and NPC 567. High affinity for desArg10-KD binding was fully regained when the B2 residue Thr287was replaced in construct 6 by the corresponding B1Leu294 residue. When the B2 residue Tyr295 was exchanged with the corresponding B1Phe302, high affinity binding for both agonist and antagonist was recovered. Moreover, the L294T and F302Y mutant B1R exhibited 69- and 6.5-fold increases, respectively, in their affinities for the B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe140. Therefore we proposed that Leu294 and Phe302residues, which may not be directly involved in the binding of B1R ligands and, hence, their Thr287 and Tyr295 B2 counterparts, are localized in a receptor region, which plays a pivotal role in the binding selectivity of the peptide or pseudopeptide kinin ligands.

Barabé J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1980; 32: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Kinins are released in response to tissue injury and activate sensory pain fibers, contract smooth muscle, cause endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, and induce plasma extravasation (1.Regoli D. Barabé J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1980; 32: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 2.Proud D. Kaplan A.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 49-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Most of the acute effects of kinins seem to be mediated by the activation of constitutive B2 receptors (2.Proud D. Kaplan A.P. Annu. Rev.

B1 and B2 receptors display 36% sequence identity; they can be discriminated by BK, which binds primarily to the B2 receptor, and the C-terminal truncated carboxypeptidase fragments desArg9-BK and desArg10-KD, which bind selectively to the B1 receptor. Little is known about the receptor domains or amino acids involved in determining subtype-specific ligand recognition. Some residues important for agonist binding to the B2 receptor have been located in transmembrane domains (TMs) III, VI, and VII as well as extracellular domains I, II, and III (7.Nardone J.

TM VI was shown to be directly involved in conferring B1 and B2 receptors with their ability to distinguish between the subtype-selective peptide agonists. TM VI might contain residues important for the binding of the B1-selective agonist desArg10-KD, as its high affinity binding was suppressed in the chimeric construct possessing the homologous B2 domain (12.Leeb T. Mathis A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 311-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fathy et al. (13.Fathy D.B. Mathis S.A. Leeb T.

Concerning the human B2 receptor, Phe259 and Thr263 located near the extracellular surface of the TM VI are crucial for the recognition of the B2-selective agonist, BK. To further investigate the determinants of ligand recognition, we applied a two-step strategy: (i) construction of a series of chimeric receptors by progressively replacing, from the N to the C terminus, the human B2 TMs by their B1 homologous domains, (ii) site-directed mutagenesis to target essential amino acids inside the discriminating TMs. The pharmacological profiles of the various constructs were determined in transfected cells by radioligand binding and phosphoinositide hydrolysis assay. [3H]desArg10-[Leu9]-KD, [3H]desArg10-KD, [3H]BK, [3H]NPC 17731 (50–120 Ci/mmol), andmyo-[3H]inositol (10–20 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Bradykinin and its analogs were from Bachem (Basel, Switzerland). Hoe140 was kindly provided by J. Martinez (CNRS, URA 1845, Montpellier, France). DesArg10-kallidin, desArg10-[Leu9]-kallidin, and desArg10-Hoe140 were from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). All molecular biology and cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were supplied by Sigma. The original B1 and B2 receptor cDNA were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). Chimeric receptor constructs were made using a PCR-ligation-PCR protocol. T7 and SP6 were chosen as flanking primers, and internal primers were designed according to the desired fusion point in the chimeric construct and contained aKsp632I site. Appropriate B1 and B2fragments were amplified for 10 cycles in a 50-μl PCR reaction containing 10 ng of template DNA, 200 μm dNTPs, 100 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 units of Red Goldstar polymerase, and the reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Eurogentec, Angers, France). Another 10 cycles of amplification was performed in the presence of 5-methyldeoxycytosine (m5dCTP) to protect already-existing internalKsp632I sites from subsequent cleavage by the endonuclease. The isolated PCR products were digested by 10 units ofKsp632I, purified using 1% agarose gel, and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). In a second PCR, ligation products were amplified for 30 cycles, purified as described above, and subcloned into pcDNA3.0. Mutant constructs were obtained using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The identity of chimeric and mutant constructs was confirmed by cycle sequencing. A 9-amino acid sequence (hemagglutinin (HA) tag) derived from the influenza virus HA protein was inserted at the extracellular N terminus of the chimeric constructs and the wild-type B1 receptor. Two reverse complementary oligonucleotides were designed to include the HA-tag sequence followed by the first eight codons encoding the N-terminal part of the B1receptor and to generate a HindIII restriction site at the 5′ end and a XbaI site at the 3′ end. Both nucleotides were annealed and inserted in the wild-type pcDNA3 vector. The cDNA encoding for the B1 receptor and for all chimeric constructs were then subcloned into the pcDNA3-HA vector. COS-7 cells (ATCC, Bethesda, MD). were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1% Glutamax (v/v), 1% nonessential amino acid (v/v), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient cell expression, COS-7 cells were seeded into 175-cm2 dishes or in 12-well plates and left to adhere overnight. 10 μg of vector containing the cDNA fragment of interest were then transfected into the cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (14.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) or the electroporation transfection method as described elsewhere (15.Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1822-1826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Native pcDNA3 vector was used as a negative control. COS-7 cells were allowed to recover in a standard growth medium for 48 h before membrane preparations or functional studies. Membrane preparations and binding assays were performed as described previously (16.Bastian S. Loillier B. Paquet J.L. Pruneau D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, for saturation experiments, radioligands were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a final volume of 500 μl. The assay was terminated by filtration on Whatman GF/B filters, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm corresponding unlabeled ligand. Competition binding experiments were carried out in the presence of [3H]BK or [3H]desArg10-KD with varying concentrations of kinin analogs. All assays were carried out in duplicate. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (17.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 721: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Subconfluent transiently transfected COS-7 cells maintained in 12-well plates were labeled with 0.5 μCi/well ofmyo-[3H]inositol in serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium). After 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated 15 min at 37 °C in phosphoinositide (PI) buffer of the following composition: 5 mm HEPES, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11 mmglucose, pH 7.4, supplemented with 10 mm LiCl (500 μl/well). Stimulation of PI hydrolysis was induced by desArg10-KD for 20 min. After removal of PI buffer, the reaction was stopped by the addition of a 5% (v/v) HClO4solution containing phytic acid, 5 μg/ml (500 μl/well). After 10 min on ice, wells were rinsed with 500 μl of 2.5% HClO4. The acidic extracts were pooled and neutralized with 155 μl of 2m K2CO3 and 25 μl of 1m HEPES. Samples were further applied on anion exchange columns (Dowex AG1-X8), and the different inositol phosphates were separated as described elsewhere (18.Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). A specific polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal part of the B1 receptor was generated. Briefly, a 120-base pair cDNA encoding the N-terminal part of the B1 receptor was amplified by PCR and subcloned into a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein expression vector, pGEX-4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GlutathioneS-transferase-fused protein and antibodies were prepared as described by Morohashi et al. (19.Morohashi H. Miyawaki T. Nomura H. Kuno K. Murakami S. Matsushima K. Mukaida N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Membrane preparations were fractionated using 10% Tris-glycine precast gel (Novex, Frankfurt, Germany) and were assayed by Western blotting (20.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). HA-tagged chimeric constructs were detected using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The secondary antibody horseradish peroxydase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Montrouge, France) was used in 1:50,000 dilution. Non-tagged mutant receptors were detected using the polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal part of the B1 receptor as a primary antibody. The specific secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG, Caltag, Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) was conjugated to horseradish peroxydase. The chemiluminescence immunoassay was performed with ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding experiments and concentration-response curves for PI hydrolysis were analyzed using GraphPADInPlot (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical analysis were performed using Statview (Abacus Concept, Palo Alto, CA). A one-way analysis of variance followed by a Student's t test was used to establish significant differences. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Fig.1 schematically represents the eight chimeric B1/B2 receptors corresponding to the progressive replacement of the human B2 receptor TMs by their B1 counterparts, starting from the N terminus and ending at the C-terminal tail. The binding properties of B2R ([3H]BK) and B1R ligands ([3H]desArg10-KD, [3H]desArg10-[Leu9]-KD) to wild-type and chimeric receptors transiently transfected in COS-7 cells are collected in Fig. 2 A; their functional properties are represented in Fig. 2 B. Binding and functional properties of the human B2 receptor were not affected when the N-terminal part was substituted with the corresponding region of the human B1 receptor (Construct 0; Fig. 2, A and B). All other modifications of the wild-type receptor completely prevented high affinity binding of the B2-selective agonist [3H]BK (Fig.2 A) and the ability of BK (1 μm) to stimulate inositol phospholipid hydrolysis (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Binding and functional characterization of human wild-type and chimeric receptors.

We assessed that the observed losses in ligand recognition were not the result of impaired receptor expression; for this purpose, Western blot analysis of membrane proteins of COS-7 cells transfected with the human B1 receptor and all chimeric constructs, using an antibody raised against the N-terminal part of the human B1receptor, showed bands with similar intensity with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa (data not shown). This molecular weight is close to the calculated one of the human B1receptor (6.Menke J.G. Borkowski J.A. Bierilo K.K. Macneil T. Derrick A.W. Schneck K.A. Ransom R.W. Strader C.D. Linemeyer D.L. Hess J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21583-21586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm our results, all chimeric receptors were tagged at their N termini with a nine-amino acid HA epitope after checking that the tagged HA-B1 receptor displayed the same affinity for [3H]desArg10-KD and [3H]desArg10-[Leu9]-KD as the wild-type receptor (data not shown). Receptor immunodetection through Western blotting analysis of plasma membrane extracts from transfected COS-7 cells revealed that all tagged chimeric constructs were adequately expressed and confirmed that there were similar levels of receptor antigen expression (data not shown). A B1-type binding and functional behavior (Fig. 2,A and B) was restored for chimeric receptors possessing the six first B1 TMs (Constructs 6 and 7). Saturation binding experiments were carried out on membrane preparation from COS-7 cells transfected with Constructs 6 and 7.B max values were within the same range as those obtained for the wild-type receptor, indicating a normal chimeric receptor expression (data not shown). The B1R bound the agonist [3H]desArg10-KD and the antagonist [3H]desArg10-[Leu9]-KD withK D values of 0.46 and 0.68 nm, respectively (Table I). As expected, these binding affinities values were not changed when the C-terminal tail of the B1R was substituted with the corresponding region of the B2R (Construct 7). The Construct 6, which bears both the C-terminal tail and the transmembrane domain VII (TM VII) of the B2R bound [3H]desArg10-KD and [3H]desArg10-[Leu9]-KD with a 7- and 20- fold lower affinity, respectively, compared with the wild type B1R (Table II). The EC50 values relative to desArg10-KD-induced inositol phosphate accumulation were 37- and 14- fold higher for Constructs 6 and 7, respectively, than for the wild-type B1R (Table IV).

Each value represents the mean ± S.E. from 3–6 experiments in duplicate. Therefore, the ability of Constructs 6 and 7 to bind B1-and B2-specific kinin analogues (structures depicted in TableI) was determined through competition binding assays using [3H]desArg10-KD as a radioligand. The K i values were not changed when the C-terminal tail of the B1R was substituted with the corresponding region of the B2R (Table II). The affinities of Construct 6 for the B1R agonist, desArg10-KD, and of the B1R antagonists desArg9-[Leu8]-BK and desArg10-[Leu9]-KD were 6-, 50-, and 20-fold lower, respectively, than those for B1R and Construct 7. Interestingly, chimeric B1 receptors possessing the B2 TM VII significantly increased the affinity of the pseudopeptide antagonists, Hoe140 and desArg10-Hoe140, by 13- and 2-fold, respectively, without affecting the binding of BK and desArg9-BK (Table II). To identify specific residues involved in discrimination of kinin peptides, four nonconserved amino acid residues (Thr287, Ser291, Met293, and Tyr295) located in the upper portion of the TMVII of Construct 6 were mutated to their homologous B1 amino acids (Leu294, Asn298, Phe300, and Phe302) as shown in Fig. 4. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding experiments revealed that Construct 6 [T287L], Construct 6 [S291N], Construct 6 [M293F], and Construct 6 [Y295F] exhibited a specific saturable binding for [3H]desArg10-KD and [3H]desArg10-[Leu9]-KD (TableIII). B max values were within the same range as for the wild-type B1 receptor (data not shown). When Thr287 was replaced by the corresponding Leu294 residue (Construct 6 [T287L]), high affinity for desArg10-KD binding was fully restored (K D = 0.61 ± 0.16 nm) compared with the wild-type B1 receptor (Table III). When Tyr295 was exchanged with the corresponding Phe302 (Construct 6 [Y295F]), high affinity binding for both [3H]desArg10-KD and [3H]desArg10-[Leu9]-KD was fully recovered (K D = 0.66 ± 0.23 nm and 1.25 ± 0.22 nm, respectively) (Table III). The four mutants retained functional activity as shown by the capacity of desArg10-KD to induce phosphoinositide hydrolysis (table IV). Consistent with binding data, the desArg10-KD potency was partially recovered in cells expressing Construct 6 [T287L] and Construct 6 [Y295F], whereas EC50 values relative to desArg10-KD activation of other Constructs remained 6- to 250 -fold higher than those obtained with the wild type B1R. The maximal response to desArg10-KD was significantly reduced for all mutant receptors (Table IV).Table IIIKD values (nm) on human wild-type, chimeric, and mutant B1/B2 receptorsConstructAgonistsAntagonists[3H]BK[3H]desArg10-KD[3H]NPC 17731[3H]desArg10-[Leu9]-KDnmB2R1.18 ± 0.11aSignificantly different than wild-type B1receptor with p < 0.05.NSB0.12 ± 0.01aSignificantly different than wild-type B1receptor with p < 0.05.NSBB1RNSB0.45 ± 0.09bSignificantly different than Construct 6, withp < 0.05.NSB0.68 ± 0.08bSignificantly different than Construct 6, withp < 0.05.Construct 7NSB0.64 ± 0.08bSignificantly different than Construct 6, withp < 0.05.NSB0.47 ± 0.06bSignificantly different than Construct 6, withp < 0.05.Construct 6NSB2.95 ± 0.43aSignificantly different than wild-type B1receptor with p < 0.05.NSB13.78 ± 3.30aSignificantly different than wild-type B1receptor with p < 0.05.Construct 6 [T287L]0.61 ± 0.16bSignificantly different than Construct 6, withp < 0.05.4.03 ± 1.07aSignificantly different than wild-type B1receptor with p < 0.05.Construct 6 [S291N]5.00 ± 2.97aSignificantly different than wild-type B1receptor with p < 0.05.6.97 ± 1.33aSignificantly different than wild-type B1recept"

https://openalex.org/W2048869509,"The influenza virus polymerase complex contains a metal ion-dependent endonuclease activity, which generates short capped RNA primer molecules from capped RNA precursors. Previous studies have provided evidence for a two-metal ion mechanism of RNA cleavage, and the data are consistent with a direct interaction of a divalent metal ion with the catalytic water molecule. To refine the model of this active site, we have generated a series of DNA, RNA, and DNA-RNA chimeric molecules to study the role of the 2′-hydroxy groups on nucleic acid substrates of the endonuclease. We could observe specific cleavage of nucleic acid substrates devoid of any 2′-hydroxy groups if they contained a cap structure (m7GpppG) at the 5′-end. The capped DNA endonuclease products were functional as primers for transcription initiation by the influenza virus polymerase. The apparent cleavage rates were about 5 times lower with capped DNA substrates as compared with capped RNA substrates. Cleavage rates with DNA substrates could be increased to RNA levels by substituting the deoxyribosyl moieties immediately 5′ and 3′ of the cleavage site with ribosyl moieties. Similarly, cleavage rates of RNA substrates could be lowered to DNA levels by exchanging the same two ribosyl groups with deoxyribosyl groups at the cleavage site. These results demonstrate that the 2′-hydroxy groups are not essential for binding and cleavage of nucleic acids by the influenza virus endonuclease, but small differences of the nucleic acid conformation in the endonuclease active site can influence the overall rate of hydrolysis. The observed relative cleavage rates with DNA and RNA substrates argue against a direct interaction of a catalytic metal ion with a 2′-hydroxy group in the endonuclease active site.

The vRNA1 segments are transcribed and replicated by a virus-encoded polymerase complex. The polymerase complex also contains an endonuclease activity, which is required prior to transcription initiation for the generation of short, capped RNA primer molecules. Nuclear host pre-mRNAs are the most likely endonuclease substrates for the generation of primer molecules in infected cells (1.Lamb R.A. Krug R.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1353-1395Google Scholar). The influenza virus polymerase is a trimer of the subunits PA, PB1, and PB2. Prior to transcription initiation, the trimeric polymerase complex is bound to both ends of a nucleoprotein-coated single-stranded RNA genome segment forming a noncovalent circular structure, the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) (2.Hsu M.T.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Separate binding sites for both the 5′- and the 3′-end of the vRNA have recently been mapped on the polymerase subunit PB1 (5.Li M.L. Ramirez B.C. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5844-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 6.Gonzalez S. Ortin J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 631-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of the polymerase complex to both vRNA ends has previously been found to be a prerequisite for the activation of endonuclease and transcription initiation activities (5.Li M.L. Ramirez B.C. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5844-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7.Hagen M. Chung T.D. Butcher J.A. Krystal M. J.

The process of viral transcription in the infected cell is catalyzed by the RNP-associated polymerase complex. Transcription starts with the binding of capped host pre-mRNAs, which are subsequently cleaved by the endonuclease at distinct sequence-dependent positions 9–15 nucleotides downstream of the cap structure (9.Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1618-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10.Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Ulmanen I. Krug R.M.

The resulting capped RNA oligonucleotides contain 3′-hydroxyl groups. They are used as primers for the initiation of transcription (7.Hagen M. Chung T.D. Butcher J.A. Krystal M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1509-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Ulmanen I. Krug R.M. Cell. 1981; 23: 847-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The location of the endonuclease active site on the polymerase complex is still unknown. Although it has been reported that some polymerase active sites of RNA polymerases could catalyze nuclease reactions (13.Reines D. Transcription: Mechanism and Regulation. Raven Press, New York1994: 263-278Google Scholar,14.Thomas M.J. Platas A.A. Hawley D.K. Cell. 1998; 93: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), there is strong evidence to suggest the presence of a separate endonuclease active site on the influenza virus polymerase complex. Inhibitors selective for either endonuclease or polymerase activities are known (15.Tomassini J. Selnick H. Davies M.E. Armstrong M.E. Baldwin J. Bourgeois M. Hastings J. Hazuda D. Lewis J. McClements W. Ponticello G. Radzilowski E. Smith G. Tebben E. Wolfe A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2827-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 16.Tisdale M. Ellis M. Klumpp K. Court S. Ford M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and endonuclease and polymerase activities show distinct differences in metal ion preference (17.Doan L. Handa B. Roberts N.A. Klumpp K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5612-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The endonuclease active site may in fact be located on a different polymerase subunit, because specific PB2-directed antibodies selectively abolish the endonuclease activity in vitro (18.Shi L. Summers D.F. Peng Q. Galarza J.M. Virology. 1995; 208: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19.Blok V. Cianci C. Tibbles K.W. Inglis S.C. Krystal M. Digard P. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas the polymerase active site has been mapped to the PB1 subunit (20.Biswas S.K. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Braam J. Ulmanen I. Krug R.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 609-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The cap-dependent endonuclease activity may be regarded as a rather unique enzyme activity of influenza viruses. However, for the design and development of selective inhibitors of this activity, it will be important to identify the most closely related cellular enzymes and to get a better idea of the endonuclease active site architecture. Recent experiments have suggested a two-metal ion mechanism of RNA cleavage for the influenza virus endonuclease reaction based on cooperative binding of metal ions and synergistic activation by metal ion combinations as compared with single divalent metal ion reactions (17.Doan L. Handa B. Roberts N.A. Klumpp K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5612-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among the group of metalloproteins for which similar catalytic mechanisms have been proposed, there are examples of both DNA and RNA hydrolases (22.Dismukes G.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2909-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 23.Wilcox D.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2435-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Direct discriminatory interactions with the 2′-hydroxy groups of RNAs seems to be rare in this group of enzymes. This is in contrast to the metal-independent RNases like RNase A and RNase T1, which directly interact with 2′-hydroxyl groups to distinguish RNA from DNA molecules. They also use the 2′-hydroxy groups as nucleophiles in the forward reaction to generate cyclic phosphates. In the case of RNA hydrolysis by the ribozyme RNase P, evidence has been presented for an inner sphere water interaction of a divalent metal ion with the 2′-hydroxy group at the cleavage site, which appeared to be a major determinant of RNA specificity of cleavage (24.Smith D. Pace N.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5273-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,25.Chen Y. Li X. Gegenheimer P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2425-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, most metal-dependent nuclease proteins can use both RNA and DNA as substrates, or RNA-DNA discrimination is achieved by nucleic acid conformational recognition elements rather than by direct interaction or active exclusion of the 2′-hydroxy group. Our understanding of the rules that govern cleavage site choice and substrate selectivity of the influenza virus endonuclease is still very limited. Here, we used a panel of DNA, RNA, and DNA-RNA chimeric oligonucleotides to define the role of 2′-hydroxy groups on the influenza virus endonuclease substrates. Although the endonuclease presumably is specific for RNA substrates in vivo, we observed efficient cleavage of DNA oligonucleotides in vitroalbeit with a 5-fold reduced cleavage rate as compared with RNA. The cleavage under physiological buffer conditions required the presence of a cap structure on the DNA or RNA substrates. It therefore appears that the specificity for RNA cleavage by the influenza virus endonucleasein vivo is mainly determined by the specific interaction of the polymerase complex with capped RNA and the absence of capped DNA in the cell. Two nucleotides in the endonuclease active site also contribute to RNA discrimination. On DNA substrates, the substitution of the deoxyribose moieties immediately 5′ and 3′ of the cleavage site with ribose moieties resulted in nucleic acid substrates that were cleaved with rates identical to that of RNA. Influenza virus A/PR/8/34 RNPs were prepared from purified influenza virus particles on glycerol gradients as described (4.Klumpp K. Ruigrok R.W.H. Baudin F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). RNP concentration was determined from the analysis of genomic RNA content after phenol extraction (17.Doan L. Handa B. Roberts N.A. Klumpp K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5612-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). RNases for RNA sequencing and unlabeled ribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; S-adenosyl-l-methionine was purchased from Sigma; radiolabeled ribonucleotide 5′-triphosphates (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; and vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. RNase inhibitor was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The endonuclease substrate nucleic acids were based on the sequence of Gem20 RNA, 5′-GAAUACUCAAGCUAUGCAUC-3′ (17.Doan L. Handa B. Roberts N.A. Klumpp K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5612-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The DNA oligonucleotides used in this study always contain thymidine nucleosides at the uridine positions of the RNA. The chimeric oligonucleotides were named according to the parent molecule, G20 for Gem20 RNA or dG20 for Gem20 DNA, with an added number for the position of the substitution and a suffix, R or D, depending on whether the substitution was a ribo- or a deoxyribonucleotide. For example, G20–11D was a capped Gem20 RNA molecule containing a deoxyribonucleotide at position 11, and dG20–11,12R was a capped Gem20 DNA molecule containing ribonucleotides at positions 11 and 12. All oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized, phosphorylated, and enzymatically capped using vaccinia virus capping enzyme following published procedures (26.Brownlee G.G. Fodor E. Pritlove D.C.

The oligonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% gels containing 8 m urea and quantified according to the amount of radioactive GTP incorporated into the cap structure. Except when indicated so in the figure legends, endonuclease reactions were performed in 5-μl reaction mixtures containing 1 nm RNP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 units/μl RNasin, 0.25 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.015–0.15 nm32P-cap-labeled nucleic acid substrate. After incubation at 31 °C for the indicated times, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of loading buffer (0.5 mm EDTA, 90% formamide, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The samples were then incubated for 2 min at 98 °C and loaded onto 20% acrylamide sequencing gels containing 7 m urea. Band intensities were quantified with a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) using ImageQuant version 4.2a software. For transcription initiation reactions, 10 μmCTP-Mg was added to the samples prior to the RNPs under the same reaction and incubation conditions as described above. Nucleic acid cleavage activity (A) was expressed as relative product formation from the PhosphorImager band volumes according to the equation A = [P]/([P] + [S]) where P represents product and S represents substrate. Time response curves were fitted to the exponential equation A =A m(1 − e(k app t)) to obtain the pseudo-first order kinetic constantsk app of the cleavage reactions. Transcription initiation reactions from 11-mer primers and coupled endonuclease/transcription initiation reactions from 20-mer substrates were run under conditions where about 50% of the substrates where cleaved and elongated. In that case, K m(app) andk app values were calculated from fitting hyperbolic standard curves to the data sets using the equationA = (k app S)/(K m(app) + S), whereS represents the concentration of CTP in the transcription initiation reaction. To study the influenza virus endonuclease reaction we used a previously characterized model substrate of 20 nucleotides in length, Gem20-M RNA (G20). This RNA substrate contains a cap I structure and is specifically cleaved by the endonuclease activity of the polymerase complex at a distinct site to generate a capped 11-mer oligonucleotide, G11, as determined by direct RNA sequencing (17.Doan L. Handa B. Roberts N.A. Klumpp K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5612-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This cleavage was dependent on a methylated cap structure on the RNA substrates 2K. Klumpp and L. Doan, unpublished results. similar to what has been established before for other RNA substrate sequences (10.Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Ulmanen I. Krug R.M. Cell. 1981; 23: 847-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a capped 20-mer DNA oligonucleotide of identical sequence (dG20) was also found to be specifically cleaved at a single site (Fig.1 a). The cleavage product co-migrated with a capped 11-mer DNA marker (dG11). DNA cleavage was dependent on the presence of influenza virus RNPs and Mg2+(Fig. 1 a, compare lanes 3–5). As expected, the DNA oligonucleotide was completely resistant to cleavage by RNases like RNase A and T1 but was a substrate for the exonuclease activity of Escherichia coli Klenow fragment. The specific DNA cleavage product dG11 of the influenza virus endonuclease reaction could be elongated by the influenza virus polymerase in the presence of CTP (Fig. 1 a, lane 6). In the same way, chemically synthesized dG11 DNA could be used by the influenza virus polymerase for transcription initiation with CTP (Fig. 1 a, lane 2). The ability of the polymerase to use CTP for transcription initiation with dG11 primer suggests a vRNA template-directed initiation reaction with the 3′-terminal A and G residues of dG11 base-paired to the 3′-end of the viral RNA (Fig. 2 e). CTP has been previously reported as the preferred nucleotide for transcription initiation from G11 RNA (17.Doan L. Handa B. Roberts N.A. Klumpp K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5612-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28.Klumpp K. Ford M.J. Ruigrok R.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The efficient use of the product from dG20 DNA cleavage for transcription initiation with CTP is consistent with the mapping of the endonuclease dG20 DNA cleavage site to dG11. Fig. 1 b shows the same set of reactions in the presence of Gem20-M RNA (G20). G20 cleavage was dependent on RNPs and Mg2+ and a specific 11-mer primer (G11) was generated by the endonuclease. G11 could be elongated by the polymerase in the presence of CTP. G20 was hydrolyzed by RNases A and T1 as well as by the Klenow fragment. RNase T1 specifically hydrolyzes single-stranded RNA molecules at guanosine residues. The expected fragments of 11 and 16 nucleotides in length were obtained from RNase T1 digestion of G20 RNA. The RNase T1-derived fragments migrate slightly faster than the corresponding influenza endonuclease products, because the former contain 3′-phosphate and the latter contain 3′-hydroxyl groups (10.Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Ulmanen I. Krug R.M. Cell. 1981; 23: 847-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Micrococcal nuclease digested both DNA and RNA substrates, albeit dG20 DNA with a slightly slower rate as compared with G20 RNA. The gel in Fig. 1 b also showed a low but significant cleavage of G20 at a second position, identified as position guanosine G16 (Fig.1 b, star). This site was also influenza endonuclease-specific as demonstrated by the elongation in the presence of CTP (Fig. 1 b, lane 6), but the intensity of the band was below 5% of G11 produced in all cases. The DNA molecule dG20 was also cleaved with low efficiency at nucleotide position 16 (see below). Together, these results demonstrated that the influenza virus endonuclease was able to hydrolyze a DNA analogue of G20 RNA at the same specific nucleotide position 11 as the RNA molecule. The influenza virus polymerase could use a capped DNA oligonucleotide for template-specific transcription initiation, and this primer could either be chemically synthesized or generated by the endonuclease activity. Transcription initiation from the dG11 DNA oligonucleotide appeared to be very efficient, and complete conversion of dG11 to dG11 + 1 nucleotide occurred at low micromolar concentrations of CTP (Figs. 1 a and 2 a), similar to what had previously been observed with RNA substrates (17.Doan L. Handa B. Roberts N.A. Klumpp K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5612-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28.Klumpp K. Ford M.J. Ruigrok R.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the initiation reaction at variable CTP concentrations under conditions where approximately 50% of the substrate was converted. We observed an ∼8-fold upward shift in the apparentK m value for CTP with DNA (dG20) substrate when comparing it with RNA (G20) substrate under enzyme excess conditions (Fig. 2 and Table I). Interestingly, a DNA substrate containing a ribosyl moiety at the cleavage site nucleotide 11 (dG20–11R) was specifically cleaved by the influenza virus endonuclease, and the cleavage product was elongated by the polymerase in the presence of CTP with an apparentK m virtually identical to the value obtained with G20 RNA substrate. The apparent rates of transcription initiation in the coupled reaction decreased with G20 > dG20–11R > dG20 (Table I).Table ITranscription initiation with CTP from model substratesSubstrateK m(app)aK m(app) for CTP as determined from fitting of a hyperbolic equation to data from experiments as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

Open table in a new tab We also studied transcription initiation from chemically synthesized 11-mer primer molecules, a reaction independent of endonuclease activity (Fig. 3). Under the gel electrophoresis conditions used, the DNA oligonucleotides migrated significantly faster during acrylamide electrophoresis as compared with RNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 3). The transcription initiation reactions were adjusted to conditions where approximately 50% of the primer was elongated when CTP was saturating. The apparent K mvalues calculated from these experiments were similar to those observed in the coupled endonuclease/transcription initiation reaction. Again,K m(app) for CTP was significantly higher for transcription initiation from the DNA primer dG11 as compared with initiation from the RNA primer G11. Surprisingly, replacing the deoxyribonucleotide at position 11 of dG11 with a ribonucleotide generated a primer (dG11–11R) that was initiated with an apparentK m even lower than that observed with G11 RNA. The apparent rates of transcription initiation were virtually identical with any of the three 11-mer substrates under these conditions. These results showed that 2′-hydroxy groups on the nucleic acid substrates were not required for catalysis by neither the endonuclease nor the polymerase active sites. However, subtle differences in conformation of the nucleic acid 3′-end at the polymerase active site could influence the efficiency of transcription initiation. Cleavage of different species of capped RNA molecules by the influenza virus endonuclease has been observed before at varying positions in a region between 9 and 15 nucleotides downstream of the cap structure depending on the RNA sequence used in the cleavage reaction. At present, the factors involved in the influence of the sequence environment around the cleavage site on cleavage site selection and cleavage efficiency are not very well understood (9.Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1618-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10.Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Ulmanen I. Krug R.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7435-7439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have introduced a deoxyribosyl moiety at the cleavage site of a different RNA oligonucleotide substrate of the influenza virus endonuclease. This modification induced a one-nucleotide downstream shift of the cleavage site from the preferred position 13 to position 14 on an avian myeloblastosis virus RNA 4-derived sequence (27.Olsen D.B. Benseler F. Cole J.L. Stahlhut M.W. Dempski R.E. Darke P.L. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7435-7439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These observations suggested a considerable flexibility in the distance between cap-binding and endonuclease sites on the polymerase complex and a significant preference for cleavage at ribosyl moieties on the nucleic acid substrate. To further analyze the mechanism of cleavage site choice, we therefore devised a series of DNA oligonucleotides based on the dG20 sequence containing single ribosyl moieties in the region of nucleotides 8–12. Surprisingly, the endonuclease did not follow the ribonucleotide positions on the DNA substrates. Instead, the specific endonuclease cleavage site at position 11 was preserved as the major cleavage site in all dG20-derived oligonucleotides independently of the position of the ribosyl moiety (Fig. 4). With these DNA substrates, the endonuclease showed slight differences in cleavage rates and in the efficiency of using a second specific cleavage site at position dG16 (Fig. 4, star). However, the major cleavage site was at dG11 in all cases. Only the substrate dG20–10R also showed a low level of cleavage at the ribosyl position 10 in addition to predominant cleavage at deoxyribonucleotide position 11. These results suggested that in the case of the dG20 DNA sequence the chimeric nucleic acid substrates were bound in a single, fixed position relative to cap-binding and endonuclease sites. As shown above with the dG20-derived nucleic acid sequence, cleavage site choice at position 11 was dominant even when cleavage had to occur at a deoxyribosyl group and even if ribonucleotides were present in the previously reported endonuclease range of 9–15 nucleotides from the cap structure. These results demonstrated that both DNA and RNA molecules were surprisingly efficient endonuclease substrates. There were, however, measurable differences in cleavage rates when RNA and DNA substrates were compared in this assay. As shown in Fig. 5 (and Table II), G20 RNA was cleaved about 5 times faster than dG20 DNA by the influenza virus endonuclease.Table IIEndonuclease activity with RNA, DNA, and chimeric substratesEndonuclease substratek appak app as determined from fitting a single exponential equation to data from experiments as shown in Figs.4-6.

Twenty-one independently isolated mutants of the Tet(C/B) protein with increased Tc resistance were generated by random chemical mutagenesis. Nine mutants with a Glu substitution for Gly-152 in helix 5 of the class C α domain produced a resistance of 48 μg/ml, whereas another 9 with an Asp replacement of Gly-247 in helix 8 of the class B β domain mediated resistance at 32 μg/ml. The third type of mutation, found in 3 mutants expressing 24 μg/ml resistance, was a S202F replacement in the putative interdomain cytoplasmic loop of Tet(C/B). The latter underscores a previously unappreciated function of the interdomain cytoplasmic loop. All three types of Tet(C/B) mutant proteins were expressed in amounts comparable with that of the original protein and demonstrated restored energy-dependent efflux of tetracycline.

Each determinant encodes a cytoplasmic membrane protein, Tet, that catalyzes the active efflux of a tetracycline-divalent cation complex from the cell in exchange for a proton (2.Yamaguchi A. Iwasaki-Ohba Y. Ono N. Kaneko-Ohdera M. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Tet proteins are members of the major facilitator superfamily that includes transporters of various drugs, antibiotics, sugars, and the well-studied lactose permease (3.Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this group share a common topology as well as regions of amino acid sequence identity. The Tet proteins of classes B and C are predicted to contain 12 transmembrane (TM) regions divided in half into two domains, α and β, by a large putative cytoplasmic loop designated the interdomain region (4.Kimura T.

Extensive genetic and mutagenic analyses of the class B Tet protein has shown that the two domains, both of which are required for Tet function (8.Curiale M.S. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 211-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contribute differently to the efflux of Tc. In the α domain, amino acid residues in TM2 and TM3 line a putative substrate translocation pathway (9.Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

The cytoplasmic loop connecting TM2 and TM3 could act as a gate that undergoes a conformational change during Tc transport (11.Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol.

Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6045-6051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Asp-285 in TM9 is important for Tc binding (14.Kimura T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Tc resistance proteins from classes A and C share 78% amino acid sequence identity, whereas the class B determinant is more distantly related to the other two, exhibiting 45% identity (15.Nguyen T. Postle K. Bertrand K. Gene. 1983; 25: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16.Waters S.H. Rogowsky P. Grinsted J. Altenbuchner J. Schmitt R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6089-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A hybrid Tet protein consisting of a class A α domain and class C β domain (Tet(A/C)) specified levels of Tc resistance not unexpected for the combination of the two functional proteins (17.Rubin R.A. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a Tet(C/B) protein (class C α domain and class B β domain) provided only minimal resistance to Tc, and a Tet(B/C) protein (class B α domain and class C β domain) did not confer resistance (17.Rubin R.A. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, an easily detectable level of Tc resistance (10–15% that of the level of wild-type Tet(C)) was observed when both the Tet(C/B) and the Tet(B/C) proteins were expressed together in the same cell. This result indicated that the individual domains of each hybrid protein were active and capable of interacting with the corresponding opposite domain of the same class (18.Rubin R.A. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4503-4509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, differences between the amino acid sequences of the class C and class B prevented the domains of the Tet(C/B) hybrid from functioning. In the present study, we have isolated and characterized active Tet(C/B) mutants. The locations of the specific mutations identify areas that probably mediate functional interactions between the α and β domains of Tet proteins and also implicate the interdomain region in the function of the Tet protein. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Taq polymerase and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Antibiotics were obtained from Sigma, except that AHTc was prepared by Mark Nelson of this laboratory. [3H]Tc was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The remaining reagents were analytical grade. Escherichia coliDH5α cells (recA1; laboratory collection) were used for the propagation of plasmid DNA, determining Tc resistance, and for assessing protein expression. Tc efflux assays were performed withE. coli AG100A cells (ΔacrAB (19.Okusu H. Ma D. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar)). Cell cultures were routinely grown in LB media supplemented with chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) or Tc (10 μg/ml), as needed. AHTc (0.025 μg/ml) was used as a gratuitous inducer of Tet protein where applicable. Plasmid pRAR1033 carrying a tet(C/B) hybrid gene (17.Rubin R.A. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used in both hydroxylamine and PCR mutagenesis and for expression of the wild-type and mutated Tet(C/B) proteins. Plasmid pLR1068 served as a source of Tet(B/B) (class B α domain and class B β domain) (20.Curiale M.S. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 209-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A XhoI/BglII fragment of pRAR1013, carrying thetet(C) gene (17.Rubin R.A. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used to replace thetet(C/B) hybrid gene in pRAR1033. The resulting construct, pCR2, was used as a source of Tet(C/C) (class C α domain and class C β domain) in this study. Plasmid DNA was purified using a Qiaprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 3 μg of plasmid pRAR1033 DNA was incubated in 400 mm hydroxylamine, 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 6.6), 100 mm EDTA in a 100-μl volume for 1 h at 65 °C followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C. The entire volume was drop-dialyzed against sterile distilled water for 2 h at room temperature on a type VS filter (0.025 μm pore size; Millipore, Bedford, MA). After ethanol precipitation and a 70% ethanol wash, the DNA was suspended in sterile distilled water. E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with 50 ng of mutagenized DNA using the CaCl2 heat shock method (21.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Upon recovery, a total of 5 × 105 transformants were plated on LB plates containing 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol (for maintenance of the plasmid) and 10 μg/ml Tc. Apparent Tc-resistant mutants were visible after 24–48 h of incubation at 37 °C. Only one colony per transformation was chosen for analysis to ensure that the mutants isolated were generated in separate mutagenic events. Tc resistance was verified by overnight growth of liquid LB cultures containing chloramphenicol and Tc. Plasmid DNA was isolated from Tc-resistant cultures and retransformed, and transformants were grown on Tc to verify that resistance was plasmid-mediated. Specific mutations within the tet(C/B) gene were identified by DNA sequencing. The entire coding region of hybrid tetgenes containing mutations in either domain was subcloned on aXmn I/BglII fragment into the original unmutagenized plasmid (pRAR1033) to ensure that any Tc resistance observed was due solely to the identified mutation. The mutations that produced Tc resistance by Tet(C/B) were introduced into the wild-type Tet protein class from which they were derived. The G247D mutation was introduced into the class B tet gene on pLR1068 by replacement of an EcoRI/PvuI fragment. A BamHI/SalI fragment of pRAR1033 encoding the G152E mutation was exchanged into the tet(C) gene on pCR2. Using the same restriction sites, the G152E mutation was also added to a tet(C/B) hybrid gene already containing the G247D mutation to create a double mutant. The exchanges were verified by sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis of the (C/B) hybrid tet gene on plasmid pRAR1033 or the class Ctet gene was performed by a PCR overlap method (22.Saraceni-Richards C.A. Jacobson G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutagenic PCR primers were designed to incorporate a restriction endonuclease site along with the desired mutation where possible (TableI). The final PCR product potentially carrying the specific mutation was digested with PvuI andBamHI and exchanged into the unmutated parentaltet gene. Plasmids were screened for the specific mutation by restriction enzyme analysis. The integrity of the mutatedtet genes was verified by DNA sequencing.Table ISite-directed mutants created in this studyProtein/mutationRelevant codon changeMutant oligonucleotides(C/B)/G152AGGA → GCC5′-CCGTGGCCGGGGCCCTGTTGGGCG-3′ApaI(C/B)/G152DGGA → GAU5′-CCGTGGCCGGGGATCTGTTGGGCG-3′BstYI(C/B)/G152QGGA → CAG5′-CCGTGGCCGGGCAGCTGTTGGGCG-3′PvuII(C/B)/G152KGGA → AAG5′-CCGTGGCCGGGAAGCTTTTGGGCGCCATCT-3′HindIII(C/B)/G247NGGC → AAC5′-GCATGATGGTTAACTTTTCATTAG-3′HincII(C/C)/S202FUCC → UUC5′-ACCCAGTCAGCTTCTTCCGGTGGG-3′Two oligonucleotides, corresponding to the sense and antisense sequence of the tet gene, were used to create each mutation by overlap PCR mutagenesis.

Cells harboring various wild-type and hybrid tet genes were grown in the presence of chloramphenicol and AHTc to an A 530 of 0.8. Cells were swabbed for confluent growth onto an LB plate containing AHTc. E-test strips (a gift of AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) containing Tc were applied to the inoculated plate. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, growth inhibition around the test strip corresponding to the MIC of Tc was examined. DH5α cells expressing various Tet proteins were grown in the presence of AHTc, and membranes were prepared from them as described previously (23.McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22752-22757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Before electrophoresis, membrane fractions were incubated in reducing sample buffer (21.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, then electroblotted to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) as per the manufacturer's directions. The blot was probed with a polyclonal antibody specific for the 14 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of Tet(B) (anti-Ct antibody, kindly provided by A. Yamaguchi (24.Yamaguchi A. Adachi K. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Phototope-HRP; New England Biolabs). Blots were developed with a Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence kit (NEN Life Science Products). To detect Tet(C) proteins with the anti-Ct antibody, the 6 carboxyl-terminal amino acids were removed and replaced with the 14 terminal amino acids of Tet(B). This was achieved by inserting a HpaI site between base pairs 1169 and 1170 of tet(C) by PCR amplification. ABamHI/HpaI fragment encompassing all but the last 22 base pairs of the class B gene was then excised from plasmid pRAR1033 and replaced with the corresponding fragment oftet(C). The resulting construct encoded Tet(C), with the anti-Ct epitope replacing the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. This procedure was also used to alter the Tet(C) S202F and G152E mutants. Assays were performed with E. coli AG100A cells as the chromosomal deletion in theacr locus eliminated host background Acr-mediated efflux of Tc. Energy-dependent Tc efflux was measured as the amount of [3H]Tc taken up by cells expressing various Tet proteins in the energized versus deenergized states. Assays were performed essentially as described by McMurry et al.(25.McMurry L.M. Petrucci Jr., R.E. Levy S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3974-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), with the exception that cells were grown in liquid LB medium containing 0.2% glucose in the presence of AHTc to induce expression of Tet protein. Time points began upon the addition of 4 μm [3H]Tc. CCCP was added to a final concentration of 100 μm at 20 min to deenergize the cells. Each strain was assayed in triplicate. A total of 21 Tc-resistant mutants were independently isolated from separate mutagenic and transformation events. Sequence analysis of the hybrid tetgene from each mutant revealed three types of mutations, each consisting of a single base change (TableII).Table IIEffect of specific mutations in Tet(C/B) hybrids on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of TcCodon changeNumber isolatedAmino acid substitutionDomain/LocationTc MICaDetermined via E-test.

The original wild-type Tet(C/B) protein provided a Tc MIC of 3 μg/ml. Open table in a new tab A GGA → GAA transition within codon 152 resulted in a Gly to Glu mutation in nine different mutants (Table II). Gly-152 is located in putative helix 5 of the α domain of Tet(C) in the Tet(C/B) hybrid (Fig. 1). The Tc MIC of cells expressing this protein was 48 μg/ml, approximately 16-fold greater than that of the original Tet(C/B) protein (3 μg/ml). This Gly residue (position 152 in Tet(C)) is conserved among all Tet proteins in Gram-negative bacteria. In nine additional mutants, a GGC → GAC transition resulted in the substitution of Gly-247 of the class B β domain in Tet(C/B) with an Asp residue (Table II). Based on the current topological model of Tet(B), the location of Gly-247 is predicted to be within putative helix 8 of the β domain of the Tet(C/B) protein (Fig. 1). Gly at position 247 of Tet(B) is also conserved in all Gram-negative Tet proteins. Cells expressing the G247D Tet(C/B) mutant protein had a Tc MIC of 24 μg/ml, approximately 8-fold over the original Tet(C/B) protein. Finally, three of the Tet(C/B) mutants isolated contained a UCC to UUC codon change that resulted in a Ser-202 → Phe mutation. A host bearing this mutation exhibited a Tc MIC of 32 μg/ml. Ser-202 is within the Tet(C) α domain of the Tet(C/B) hybrid and resides in the interdomain cytoplasmic loop connecting the α and β domains (Fig.1). Each type of mutation was subsequently introduced into the Tet protein from which the corresponding region of the Tet(C/B) protein was derived. Introduction of the G152E mutation into Tet(C/C) (consisting of both an α and a β domain from the class C protein) or the G247D mutation into Tet(B/B) (comprised of class B α and β domains) resulted in inactive proteins, as demonstrated by a Tc MIC of 1.5 μg/ml. A S202F mutation in Tet(C) also led to a severe reduction in Tc resistance to 4 μg/ml from 64 μg/ml mediated by the wild-type protein. Western blot analysis of the proteins was performed using the anti-Ct antibody directed against the 14 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Tet(B). The β domain of Tet(C) proteins was altered so that they would be detected by anti-Ct (see “Materials and Methods”). This replacement resulted in a small increase in the Tc MIC provided by these proteins (TableIII).Table IIITc resistance mediated by wild-type, hybrid, and mutant hybrid Tet proteinsProteinTc MICaDetermined by E-test.Protein presentμg/ml% of wild-typebProteins were quantitated using the NIH Image 1.6 program available on the Internet.

Open table in a new tab The parental hybrid Tet(C/B) protein was abundantly present in the membranes of the cells in which it was expressed (Fig.2 A, lane 3). The near background level of Tc susceptibility of Tet(C/B) has been attributed to inefficient functional interactions between α and β domains from the two different classes (17.Rubin R.A. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The G152E and S202F C/B proteins were detected in the membrane in quantities comparable with the original inactive Tet(C/B) hybrid (Fig.2 A, lanes 3, 4, and 11). The G247D mutant was detected in slightly lower quantities in the membrane compared with the original Tet(C/B) and the other mutant proteins (Fig. 2 A, lane 9). Although combining the G152E and G247D mutations in Tet(C/B) did not produce resistance to Tc, the protein was observed in higher quantities in the membrane than the original hybrid or any of the single mutants (Fig. 2 B,lane 5). A strain expressing Tet(B) protein containing the G247D mutation was inactive, which could be attributed to a decreased amount of this mutant protein in the membrane compared with the wild type (Fig.2 B, lane 3). The similar lack of Tc resistance by the Tet(C) G152E could also be due, at least in part, to lower protein expression (Fig. 2 C, lane 3). This protein also had a higher mobility in the gel relative to the wild type, which may reflect either a conformational change or the charge difference between the two proteins. It is unlikely, however, to be due to truncation of the G152E protein, as recognition by the anti-Ct antibody requires an intact carboxyl terminus. In addition, a Tet(C) protein containing the G152E mutation complements a deficiency in potassium transport (26.McNicholas P. Chopra I. Rothstein D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7926-7933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an activity that requires the amino terminus of Tet(C) to be associated with the membrane (27.Griffith J.K. Kogoma T. Corvo D.L. Anderson W.L. Kazim A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 598-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the S202F mutation in Tet(C) (generated by site-directed mutagenesis) did not affect the amount of protein in the membrane (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). In general, although the Tet(C) proteins analyzed by Western blot were engineered to express the anti-Ct epitope at their carboxyl termini, even the wild-type protein was not as reactive with the antibody as Tet(B) (compare Fig. 2 C, lanes 2 and5). In addition, although Tet(C) with the anti-Ct tag contained only two more amino acid residues, it had a noticeably lower mobility than Tet(B) (Fig. 2 C). It was of interest to determine whether the negatively charged side chain at either 152 or 247 was a requisite for Tc resistance by the hybrid protein. To this end, G152Q and G247N mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The Tet(C/B) G247N mutant provided a moderate level of Tc resistance (24 μg/ml; TableIII). This protein was observed in the membrane in a similar quantity to the wild-type Tet(C/B) hybrid (Fig. 2 A, lane 10) and more than the G247D mutant (Fig. 2 A, lane 9). Cells expressing the G152Q mutant, however, failed to show the Tet(C/B) protein in the membrane (Fig. 2 A, lane 7) and were susceptible to Tc (Table III). To further investigate the side chain requirements at position 152, additional replacements were constructed. Ala, Asp, and Lys were each substituted for Gly-152; only G152D resulted in a protein capable of mediating a significant level of Tc resistance (10 μg/ml; Table III). Each mutant protein was detectable in the membrane (Fig.2 A), although the G152K protein was present in relatively lower amounts. These results indicated that an acidic residue was required at position 152 to produce active Tet(C/B). Furthermore, introduction of a neutral or positively charged side chain at position 152 decreased the stability of the Tet(C/B) protein. In contrast, replacing Gly-247 with either Asp or Asn was structurally tolerated and also rendered Tet(C/B) capable of mediating Tc resistance. Energy-dependent Tc efflux was measured as the relative uptake of [3H]Tc before and after deenergization of the cells with the protonophore CCCP. As shown in Fig. 3, AG100A cells not expressing a Tet protein accumulated 26 pmol of [3H]Tc/mg of total protein at 20 min. The addition of 100 μm CCCP resulted in decreased accumulation of Tc in the cell, attributed to the dissipation of the proton gradient across the membrane upon which Tc uptake is dependent. The wild-type class B protein expressed from pLR1068 demonstrated a relatively low uptake of [3H]Tc (9 pmol/mg of protein at 20 min). Deenergization of the cells by CCCP resulted in an increased accumulation of [3H]Tc due to elimination of active Tc efflux. Cells expressing the unmutated Tet(C/B) hybrid from plasmid pRAR1033 did not exhibit efflux activity. The G152E and G247N Tet(C/B) mutants carried out Tc efflux as well as Tet(B) or Tet(C) (data not shown), accumulating only 8.5 and 9 pmol of [3H]Tc/mg of protein, respectively, at 20 min. Efflux by the G247D and S202F mutants resulted in an accumulation of approximately 11 pmol of [3H]Tc/mg of protein at 20 min. Overall, resistance to Tc mediated by each of the mutant Tet(C/B) proteins was accompanied by energy-dependent efflux of Tc from the cell, although as noted before (8.Curiale M.S. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 211-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Tc efflux activity did not directly correlate with the level of Tc resistance. Three different single amino acid changes out of a total of 21 independently isolated mutants restored Tc resistance to an otherwise inactive hybrid Tet(C/B) protein. Each mutant demonstrated a MIC for Tc above the 10 μg/ml on which they were selected. Of the 5 × 105 transformants screened, nine contained a G152E mutation in helix 5 of the class C α domain, and nine more contained the G247D replacement in helix 8 of the class B β domain. This finding suggests that critical interactions between the α and the β domains that are required for the function of Tet(C/B) occur between helices 5 and 8. Both Gly-152 and Gly-247 are conserved among all classes of Gram-negative Tet proteins and are predicted to be relatively close to the periplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 1). As conserved amino acid residues are usually of functional or structural significance, it was expected that substitutions leading to an active Tet(C/B) would have been at nonconserved positions. Substitution of Gly-152 with Glu in Tet(C) or Gly-247 with Asp or Asn in Tet(B) had a detrimental effect on Tc resistance, indicating the importance of Gly at these two positions in the wild-type proteins. Gly-152 is the last residue of an amino acid sequence motif (GX 8GX 3GPX 2GG) found among the antiporter members of the major facilitator superfamily (28.Varela M.F. Samsom C.E. Griffith J.K. Mol. Memb. Biol. 1995; 12: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our finding that a G152E mutation inactivates Tet(C) agrees with the findings of McNicholas et al. (26.McNicholas P. Chopra I. Rothstein D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7926-7933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substitutions at other positions within this conserved motif in Tet(C), specifically Gly-147 (replaced with any other amino acid) (28.Varela M.F. Samsom C.E. Griffith J.K. Mol. Memb. Biol. 1995; 12: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or Gly-143 (replaced with Asp or Asn) (26.McNicholas P. Chopra I. Rothstein D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7926-7933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also reduced or eliminated Tc resistance. Based on molecular modeling of helix 5 of Tet(C), Gly residues within this sequence were concluded to participate in the formation of a substrate binding pocket devoid of side chains (28.Varela M.F. Samsom C.E. Griffith J.K. Mol. Memb. Biol. 1995; 12: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). If this model holds true, then our result implies that within the Tet(C/B) hybrid, the putative Tc binding site is ineffective, and a G152E mutation suppresses this defect. The fact that only a negatively charged side chain at position 152 could render Tet(C/B) active suggests that an ionic interaction is formed with another region of the protein or that the side chain contributes in some manner to Tc binding. Residues within helix 5 are important for substrate recognition by other major facilitator superfamily members, particularly the multidrug transporter Bmr (29.Klyachko K.A. Schuldiner S. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the lactose permease (30.Sahin-Toth M. le Coutre J. Kharabi D. le Maire G. Lee J.C. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). With respect to Gly-247, a helical wheel projection predicts that it is located on the same hydrophilic side of amphipathic helix 8 as Gln-261 and His-257. Gln-261 appears to contribute to substrate recognition by Tet(B) (31.Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Kimura T. Sakai T. Adachi Y. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5698-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and His-257 has been proposed to play an essential role in proton translocation (13.Yamaguchi A. Adachi K. Akasaka T. Ono N. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6045-6051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of the G247D mutation into Tet(B) apparently destabilized the protein, as this protein was present in reduced quantities in membrane vesicles relative to the wild type. In Tet(C/B), substitution of Gly-247 with a larger, hydrophilic (Asp or Asn) residue may also perturb the structure of the helix, at least enough to render the protein active without severely displacing the key amino acid side chains at positions 257 and 261. If Gly-247 does indeed face, or is proximal to, the Tc/proton transport pathway rather than the membrane, introduction of the hydrophilic side chains of Asp or Asn at that position would not necessarily be thermodynamically unfavorable. Although the presence of either G152E or G247D is sufficient to activate Tet(C/B), the addition of the second mutation inactivates the protein without decreasing its stability (Fig. 2 B,lane 5). Considering that the class C and class B proteins share a relatively low sequence similarity (45%) (15.Nguyen T. Postle K. Bertrand K. Gene. 1983; 25: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16.Waters S.H. Rogowsky P. Grinsted J. Altenbuchner J. Schmitt R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6089-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it is surprising that a single amino acid substitution could render the previously inactive Tet(C/B) hybrid functional. In this sense, the individual mutations act as suppressors that compensate for the large differences in the amino acid sequences between the respective domains of the two classes, whereas the presence of the second mutation “desuppresses” the compensatory action of the first. This effect supports the hypothesis that a specific functional interaction exists between regions of helices 5 and 8. Alternatively, the mutations could reflect two entirely independent alterations, which individually promote functional interactions between α and β domains but together, do not. Our results are consistent with the general model for the arrangement of the TM regions of major facilitator superfamily members proposed by Goswitz and Brooker (32.Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), in which helices 5 and 8 are predicted to be adjacent to one another and line the substrate translocation channel. Not much attention has been given to the interdomain loop of Tet proteins owing to their poor amino acid sequence conservation. However, the random isolation of the active Tet(C/B) S202F mutant, without any additional mutations in the membrane-spanning regions, demonstrates that the interdomain loop is functionally important. Ser-202 is a nonconserved residue, found only in Tet classes C and H. The fact that the S202F replacement inactivates Tet(C) indicates that Ser-202 somehow contributes to Tc resistance. This finding confirms and extends other studies, which suggest that other residues within the interdomain region are important for Tet function (4.Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33.Tuckman M. Peterson P.J. Projan S.

Overall, our results strongly indicate that helices 5 and 8 interact and provide further evidence that the interdomain loop has a role in the function of Tet proteins.

Beretta G. Berti M. Arioli V. J. Antibiot. 1978; 31: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1). It acts by blocking cell wall biosynthesis (2.Reynolds P.E. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1989; 8: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and it is used to fight Gram-positive pathogens resistant to frequently used antibiotics, such as methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, clostridia, and enterococci (3.Brogden R.N. Peters D.H. Drugs. 1994; 47: 823-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). World-wide problems with methicillin-resistant S. aureus have resulted in an increased use of vancomycin and teicoplanin, the only agents that effectively treat these infections. Glycopeptide antibiotics are characterized by a peptide core consisting of seven amino acids connected by six peptide bonds. At least five of the amino acids are aromatic and the molecule contains a triphenyl ether moiety and a diphenyl group. This basic structure is termed the aglycone. In most cases one or more sugars are linked to the aglycone at different positions through glycosidic bonds. In the lipoglycopeptides, including teicoplanin, linear or branched fatty acids are linked to the amino group of a glucosamine or 2-aminoglucuronic acid. The teicoplanin aglycone consists of p-hydroxyphenylglycine in positions 1, 4, and 5; m-chlorotyrosine in position 2;m,m′-dihydroxyphenylglycine in position 3 and 7; and m-chloro-β-hydroxytyrosine in position 6.N-Acyl-β-d-glucosamine,N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine, and α-d-mannose are linked to the aglycone at positions 4, 6, and 7, respectively. The acyl side chain attached to β-d-glucosamine can have one of five different structures. Naturally produced teicoplanin is therefore a mixture of five different components (4.Lancini G. Cavalleri B. Rehm H.J. Reed G. Biotechnology: Products of Secondary Metabolism. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim1997: 371-396Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of the glycopeptide aglycones includes synthesis of the uncommon amino acids constituting the heptapeptide, polymerization of the amino acids, formation of ether and carbon-carbon bonds between the phenylic groups, and modifications like chlorination. Polymerization of the amino acids is probably performed by peptide synthetases by the thiotemplate mechanism, but there is no experimental evidence to support this.

A tetraketide has been suggested as the substrate for cyclization. It is, however, improbable that ring closure should occur onto a terminal methyl group of the chain. Alternatively, a longer chain may be formed and then degraded after cyclization. Another possibility is that malonate rather than acetate is the chain starter of the polymerization process. This would result in 6-carboxy-3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid which could be converted intom,m′-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid by decarboxylation (4.Lancini G. Cavalleri B. Rehm H.J. Reed G. Biotechnology: Products of Secondary Metabolism. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim1997: 371-396Google Scholar, 8.Hammond S.J. Williams D.H. Nielsen R.V. J. Chem. Soc. Chem.

In the two experiments the glucose contained either 34.0% [1-13C]glucose or 9.7% [U-13C]glucose. Analysis of the fractional enrichment pattern in teicoplanin produced in medium containing [1-13C]glucose and of the coupling pattern in teicoplanin produced in medium containing [U-13C]glucose enabled us to distinguish between two types of aromatic residues. The main reason for using 13C-labeled glucose rather than13C-labeled tyrosine and acetate to identify the precursors of the aglycone was that addition of even small amounts of tyrosine to the medium severely reduced growth and production of teicoplanin. An additional advantage of using 13C-labeled glucose is that the problem of low degrees of incorporation often associated with the use of 13C-labeled precursors is avoided. Moreover the bacteria grow and produce teicoplanin under more natural and neutral conditions in a medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source compared with a medium containing excessive amounts of a single precursor such as tyrosine. Finally, by using 13C-labeled glucose we obtained information about the biosynthesis of the three sugars of teicoplanin. The strain is an industrial strain used at Alpharma A/S. The strain was chosen by screening for high teicoplanin production after treatments of A. teichomyceticus (ATCC 31121) withN-methyl- N′-nitro-nitrosoguanidine. Cultures were grown in 1-liter batch fermentors for 80 h after which the glucose was exhausted and the bacteria had entered stationary phase. The production medium contained the following components: glucose (10 g/liter), KH2PO4 (0.44 g/liter), NaCl (1.00 g/liter), MgSO4-7H2O (0.20 g/liter), NH4Cl (1.00 g/liter), CaCl2, 2H2O (10 mg/liter), ferric ammonium citrate (5 mg/liter), and trace metal solution (30 ml/liter). The trace metal solution contained the following components: ZnSO4, 7H2O (10 mg/liter), MnCl2, 4H2O (3 mg/liter), H3BO3 (30 mg/liter), CoCl2, 6H2O (20 mg/liter), CuCl2, 2H2O (0.56 mg/liter), NiCl2, 6H2O (2 mg/liter), Na2MoO4-2H2O (3 mg/liter). In the first labeling experiment 3.41 g ofd-[1-13C]glucose (Sigma-Aldrich number 297046, 99 atom %, 13C) was mixed with 6.59 g of unlabeled d-glucose. In the second labeling experiment 1.00 g of d-[U-13C]glucose (Isotec inc. Miamisburg, 99 atom %, 13C) was mixed with 9.00 g of unlabeled d-glucose. The fermentor was inoculated with 5 ml of seed culture taken from a frozen stock culture. The pH of the medium was kept at 7.0 and the temperature was kept at 30 °C throughout the fermentation. The aeration rate was 0.5 liter/min. The final titer of teicoplanin in the fermentation liquid was 150 mg/liter. Immediately after termination of the labeling experiment the entire cultivation medium was adjusted to pH 9.5–10.0 with 0.5 mNa2CO3 and 25 ml of ion exchange resin (Amberlite IRA958) in the Cl− form adjusted to pH 9.5–10.0 was added. The mixture was stirred for 4 h at room temperature during which the pH was frequently adjusted to 9.5–10.0 with 0.5 m Na2CO3. The ion exchange resin was then separated from the cultivation medium by filtration through a polypropylene net (mesh size 420 μm) and washed on the net twice with 100 ml at 40 °C in distilled water. The filtrate was filtered through a Whatman filter for isolation of biomass. The filter cake was washed with saline solution and kept at −20 °C for later use. The ion exchange resin was transferred to a 250-ml beaker and washed twice each at 100 ml of 0.1 m NaHSO3 (pH 6.0). Each portion was stirred for 30 min. Teicoplanin was eluted from the ion exchange resin with 3× 100 ml of 1 m citric acid. The first portion was stirred overnight and the next two portions were each stirred for 4 h. Citric acid solutions containing teicoplanin were pooled and stored at 5 °C. The 300 ml of citric acid solution containing teicoplanin was then applied to a hydrophobic interaction column (25 ml, Diaion HP2 MGL). The column was washed with 125 ml of 0.1 m NaHSO4 (pH 3.0), 175 ml of 0.1m NaHSO3 (pH 8.0), and finally 50 ml of 10 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.0). Teicoplanin was eluted with 125 ml of 10 mm NaOH in 20% (v/v) ethanol. Since teicoplanin is degraded at high pH values the pH of the eluate was continuously adjusted to 6.5–7.0 with 0.5 m acetic acid (9.Gasper M.P. Berthod A. Nair U.B. Armstrong D.W. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The eluate was concentrated and diafiltrated on a cellulose acetate membrane (Amicon YC05) with a cut-off of 500 Da, which retained teicoplanin (1900 Da) whereas ions like Na+ and acetate passed through the membrane. The volume of the solution was reduced to 10 ml and diafiltrated using 60 ml of Milli-Q water. Finally the 10-ml teicoplanin solution was freeze dried (time, temperature: 8 h, −25 °C; 20 h, −10 °C; 14 h, 0 °C; 12 h, 10 °C; 18 h, 20 °C). The purity of the resulting teicoplanin as measured by high performance liquid chromatography was in the range of 50–60% (w/w). The yield after purification was in the range of 60–70%. Frozen biomass was placed in liquid nitrogen and thoroughly ground for 15 min in liquid nitrogen. The frozen white powder was thawed and suspended in 40 ml of demineralized water. Particulate matter was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g. The supernatant was transferred to centrifugation tubes kept on ice and 10% (v/v) 1.2m HClO4 was added to precipitate dissolved protein. After centrifugation (20 min, 1000 × g) the supernatant was discarded. The protein pellet was hydrolyzed in 100 ml of 4 m HCl at 105 °C overnight. Flushing with nitrogen gas minimized the formation of ash. The protein hydrolysate was filtrated, dried, and redissolved in D2O for NMR analysis. NMR spectra were obtained on Varian UNITY INOVA 500 and 750 instruments operating at 500.12 and 750.1 MHz for1H and 125.9 and 186.6 MHz for 13C, respectively. Spectra were recorded at 37 °C in dimethyl sulfoxide-d 6 solution. Assignments of chemical shifts for carbon atoms in the aglycone were based on the assignments and proposed three-dimensional structure previously published (10.Malabarba A. Ferrari P. Gallo G.G. Kettenring J. Cavalleri B. J. Antibiot. 1986; 39: 1430-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and verified by heteronuclear multiple bond correlation and HSQC1 experiments at 750 MHz. Only minor differences were observed. These were probably due to differences in the pH. The enrichment pattern in teicoplanin produced in medium containing [1-13C]glucose was obtained from a one-dimensional 13C spectrum. In order to obtain reliable enrichment fractions for carbon atoms with differentT 1 relaxation times, the spectrum was acquired using a long recycle time (3.3 s). Furthermore, no 1H decoupling was applied during the relaxation delay of 3.0 s, but only during acquisition, so that potential differences in the heteronuclear NOEs did not affect signal intensities. 80,000 scans were acquired at 125.9 MHz over 3 days with a digital resolution of approximately 1 Hz/point prior to zero filling to double the number of points. Fractional enrichments of 13C could not be obtained by integration of peaks in the one-dimensional spectrum, due to many signals having similar chemical shifts. Fractional enrichments were therefore determined from the signal intensities. This approach showed good agreement with a few values obtained by integration of well separated resonances. The absolute 13C incorporation was obtained by scaling the measured signal intensities to the intensity of carbon x4, for which the 13C:12C ratio was determined from 13C satellites in a two-dimensional1H DQF-COSY spectrum. The coupling pattern in teicoplanin produced in medium containing [U-13C]glucose was determined from J-scaled HSQC experiments carried out and analyzed as described previously (11.Schmidt K. Nørregaard L.C. Pedersen B. Meissner A. Duus J.Ø. Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Metab. Eng. 1999; 1: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It should be noted that scaling of multiplets in the spectrum allows for integration of selected traces and no assumptions related to intensity measurements were made. Assignments of the carbohydrate parts of teicoplanin were made from homonuclear 1H experiments (COSY, NOESY, and TOCSY) and heteronuclear HSQC and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiments and compared with published data on monosaccharides (12.Bock K. Thøgersen H. Annu. Rep. NMR Spectrosc. 1982; 13: 1-57Google Scholar). Connectivities to the aglycone were assigned from nuclear Overhauser effects between anomeric protons and protons in the peptide, as observed in two-dimensional NOESY experiments. The enrichment pattern of tyrosine from a protein hydrolysate from the culture grown in the medium containing [1-13C]glucose was obtained as described previously (11.Schmidt K. Nørregaard L.C. Pedersen B. Meissner A. Duus J.Ø. Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Metab. Eng. 1999; 1: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fractional enrichments of individual carbon atoms in teicoplanin aglycone from A. teichomyceticus grown in medium containing 34.0% [1-13C]glucose are shown in Fig.2 A. 1H and13C chemical shifts and fractional enrichments for the carbohydrate parts of teicoplanin produced in medium containing [1-13C]glucose are shown in TableII. Fractional enrichments in tyrosine from a protein hydrolysate of the culture grown in medium containing [1-13C]glucose were 11.4% for the β-carbon atom, 8.3% for the o-position, and 1.0% for the m-position.

There are few reported studies on the biosynthesis of the glycopeptide aglycones and none on the biosynthesis of the teicoplanin aglycone. Progress has been hampered by the failure to isolate blocked mutants accumulating biosynthetic intermediates and by the fact that some of the most studied glycopeptides, such as vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ristocetin, are produced by Actinomycesstrains in which no system for transformation with exogenous DNA is available (4.Lancini G. Cavalleri B. Rehm H.J. Reed G. Biotechnology: Products of Secondary Metabolism. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim1997: 371-396Google Scholar). Some of the genes and clusters involved in biosynthesis of vancomycin and A82846B have been identified, but the function of these genes has not been confirmed by gene inactivation experiments (13.Solenberg P.J. Matsushima P. Stack D.R. Wilkie S.C. Thompson R.C. Baltz R.H. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 195-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 14.van Wageningen A.M.A. Kirkpatrick P.N.

Recently, Pelzer et al. (15.Pelzer S. Süβmuth R. Heckmann D. Recktenwald J. Huber P. Jung G. Wohlleben W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified genes responsible for glycosylation and coupling of aromatic side chains in balhimycin, a vancomycin-like glycopeptide produced byAmycolatopsis mediterranei DSM5908. Two types of mutants were created by gene inactivation, one producing linear, unglycosylated derivatives of balhimycin and a glycosyltransferase mutant producing the unglycosylated balhimycin aglycone. Based on the structures of these intermediates they suggested that the biphenyl and the biphenyl ether linkages of the aglycone are all formed before glycosylation occurs. The origin of the uncommon aromatic amino acids in avoparcin, vancomycin, ardacin, and ristocetin appears to be similar. In all casesp-hydroxyphenylglycine, β-hydroxytyrosine, and 3-chloro-β-hydroxytyrosine are derived from tyrosine whereasm,m′-dihydroxyphenylglycine is derived from acetate (5.McGahren W.J. Martin J.H. Morton G.O. Hargreaves R.T. Leese R.A. Lovell F.M. Ellestad G.A. O'Brien E. Holker J.S.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 1671-1684Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6.Hammond S.J. Williamson M.P.

If teicoplanin follows this pattern,p-hydroxyphenylglycine in positions 1, 4, and 5;m-chlorotyrosine in position 2 andm-chloro-β-hydroxytyrosine in position 6 should be derived from tyrosine, whereasm,m′-dihydroxyphenylglycine in positions 3 and 7 should be derived from acetate. In bacteria L-tyrosine is synthesizedde novo from phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate. The biosynthetic origin of carbon atoms from phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate into L-tyrosine and the incorporation of acetate into m,m′-dihydroxyphenylglycine are shown in Fig. 3. Hosoda et al. (16.Hosoda J. Tani N. Konomi T. Ohsawa S. Aoki H. Imanaka H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1977; 41: 2007-2012Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) studied the conversion of L-tyrosine intop-hydroxyphenylglycine in the biosynthesis of nocardicin A and found that C-1 is lost. This is in accordance with 13C labeling experiments for ardacin (7.Chung S.K. Taylor P. Oh Y.K. DeBrosse C. Jeffs P.W. J. Antibiot. 1986; 39: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and ristocetin (8.Hammond S.J. Williams D.H. Nielsen R.V. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1983; 3: 116-117Crossref Google Scholar). Table II shows that the fractional enrichments in C-1 and C-6 in the two β-d-glucosamines and in α-d-mannose are considerably higher than in C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-5. The high enrichments in the C-1 positions can be explained by direct conversion of [1-13C]glucose into β-d-glucosamine and α-d-mannose. The high enrichments in the C-6 positions are probably due to scrambling of 13C atoms in the primary metabolism. Specific labeling of C-6 could result from [3-13C]glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate coming from [1-13C]glucose through glycolysis reacting with sedoheptulose-7-phosphate from the pentose phosphate pathway resulting in erythrose-4-phosphate and [6-13C]fructose-6-phosphate. [6-13C]Fructose-6-phosphate can reversibly be converted into [6-13C]glucose-6-phosphate. Another possibility is conversion of [1-13C]glucose to [3-13C]glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, followed by equilibration through triose-phosphate isomerase, and then resynthesis of [6-13C]glucose-6-phosphate. Assuming that the reassembled sugar units have the same fractional enrichment in C-1 and C-6, the fractional enrichment data (Table II) show that approximately 50% of the sugar units have been scrambled prior to incorporation. Coupling patterns of the three sugars were almost identical (see Table III). The high amount (73–87%) of doublets in the C-1 and C-6 positions show that only a minor fraction of the C-1—C-2 and C-5—C-6 bonds were broken during synthesis. The fractional intensities of triplets in the C-2 and C-5 positions (44–70%) show that roughly 60% of the C-1—C-2—C3 and C-4—C-5—C-6 fragments remained intact during synthesis. Finally, the low amounts of triplets in C-3 and C-4 (26–32%) indicate that scrambling mainly takes place at the C-3—C-4 bond. This is consistent with the results of the [1-13C]glucose experiment, where the two suggested pathways for specific labeling of C-6 both result in breakage and assembly of the C-3—C-4 bond. Information about de novo biosynthesis of L-tyrosine andm,m′-dihydroxyphenylglycine from glucose gives information about the enrichment pattern in these compounds, and assuming these to be precursors of teicoplanin, the fractional enrichment pattern of the aglycone can be calculated. Fig. 2,B and C, show the predicted enrichment patterns of the aglycone when teicoplanin is produced in medium containing either 34.0% [1-13C]glucose (Fig. 2 B) or 18.4% [1-13C]glucose and 9.4% [6-13C]glucose (Fig. 2 C). Fig. 2 Cillustrates the case where the labeling pattern of the glucose for teicoplanin biosynthesis corresponds to the measured enrichments of the C-1 and C-6 positions in the carbohydrates of teicoplanin (see TableII). The enrichment patterns of Fig. 2, B and C,are based on the assumptions that: 1) amino acids 1, 2, and 4–6 in teicoplanin are derived from tyrosine whereas amino acids 3 and 7 are derived from acetate; 2) the precursor metabolites phosphoenolpyruvate, erythrose 4-phosphate, and acetate are formed directly and irreversibly from glucose through glycolysis, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and the pentose-phosphate pathway (i.e. no scrambling of13C atoms); and 3) in the conversion of L-tyrosine intop-hydroxyphenylglycine C-1 is lost. Fig. 2, B andC, show that it is reasonable to expect different enrichment patterns in amino acids derived from either tyrosine or acetate. The most striking difference is enrichment in the d-position. Predicted enrichments in 3d and 7d are 15 to 18%, whereas predicted enrichments in 1d, 2d, 4d, 5d, and 6d are only 1%. The main observations of the measured fractional enrichment pattern in Fig. 2 A are: 1) fractional enrichments in positions a, c, and e are relatively low in all seven amino acids; 2) fractional enrichments in 3d (6.3%) and 7d (6.7%) are significantly higher than in 1d (1.5%), 2d (1.0%), 4d (1.3%), 5d (1.5%), and 6d (1.3%). These observations support the idea that amino acids 1, 2, and 4–6 are derived from tyrosine whereas amino acids 3 and 7 are derived from acetate. 3) Fractional enrichments in x1 (9.3%), x3 (10.0%), x4 (9.3%), x5 (9.0%), x7 (5.5%), z2 (6.1%), and z6 (6.8%) are relatively high whereas fractional enrichments in x2 (1.8%) and x6 (1.3%) are quite low. These three points are consistent with the predicted patterns of Fig. 2,B and C. Furthermore, the measured fractional enrichment pattern in L-tyrosine from a protein hydrolysate is consistent with the patterns of amino acids 1, 2, and 4–6 in Fig.2 A. Fractional enrichments in the ortho positions (b and f in Fig. 2 A) were 8.3% whereas fractional enrichments in the meta positions (c ande in Fig. 2 A) were 1.0%. By comparing the fractional enrichment of the β-carbon of tyrosine (11.4%) with those in position x1 (9.3%), x4 (9.3%), and x5 (9.0%), it appears that it is most likely not the β-carbon atom that is lost in the conversion of L-tyrosine into p-hydroxyphenylglycine. This has also been observed in the biosynthesis of ardacin (7.Chung S.K. Taylor P. Oh Y.K. DeBrosse C. Jeffs P.W. J. Antibiot. 1986; 39: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), ristocetin (8.Hammond S.J. Williams D.H. Nielsen R.V. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1983; 3: 116-117Crossref Google Scholar), and nocardicin A (16.Hosoda J. Tani N. Konomi T. Ohsawa S. Aoki H. Imanaka H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1977; 41: 2007-2012Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and validates the third assumption in the predicted labeling patterns of Fig. 2, B and C. Carbon-carbon connectivities can be traced from [U-13C]glucose through the precursor metabolites phosphoenolpyruvate, erythrose 4-phosphate, and acetate into teicoplanin. Fig. 4 shows expected coupling patterns in L-tyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylglycine, andm,m′-dihydroxyphenylglycine from A. teichomyceticus grown in a medium containing 9.7% [U-13C]glucose. These predicted coupling patterns are calculated under the same three assumptions as described in the legend of Fig. 2. A major difference between the measured coupling patterns in Table III and the predicted patterns in Fig. 4 is that all the measured spectra consist of weighted superpositions of at least two different types of 13C labeling patterns. Due to scrambling of13C atoms prior to incorporation into teicoplanin, in TableIII, a doublet is always accompanied by a singlet, and a triplet or a double doublet is always accompanied by a doublet and a singlet (for details, see Ref. 17.Szyperski T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Only a few results from Table III supply information about which amino acids in teicoplanin are derived from tyrosine and which are derived from acetate. Fig. 4 shows that the discriminating features are the multiplet structures in the c, d, and e positions of the aromatic rings and the double doublet of the α-carbon in tyrosine corresponding to x2 and x6 in Fig. 1. Amino acids derived from acetate should have doublets in the c, d, and e positions while those derived from tyrosine should have a triplet in the d position and a superposition of a doublet and a triplet in the c and e positions. In HSQC spectra only proton bound carbon atoms are observable, restricting the analysis of the aromatic carbon atoms to 1e, 2e, 3d, 5e, 6e, and 7d. Table III shows that the fine structures of 3d and 7d both correspond to superpositions of a singlet and a doublet. This supports the hypothesis that amino acids 3 and 7 are derived from two-carbon fragments. The fine structures of 2e, 5e, and 6e consist of superpositions of a singlet, doublet, and triplet. This indicates that amino acids 2, 5, and 6 are derived from tyrosine. The multiplet structure of 1e could not be resolved due to overlap. The double doublets in x2 and x6 further support that these two amino acids are derived from tyrosine. While x2, x6, and the c, d, and e positions of the aromatic rings are important for discriminating between amino acids derived from either acetate or tyrosine, the remaining 13C multiplets support the notion that the seven amino acids are derived from acetate or tyrosine solely. This can be seen from the fact that all of these carbon atoms have multiplet structures consisting of a singlet and a doublet, which was expected from the predicted coupling patterns in Fig. 4. Large precursors are often not taken up by bacteria growing in rich media and in other cases labeled precursors have to be added within a narrow time range to be incorporated into a secondary metabolite (e.g. Ref. 7.Chung S.K. Taylor P. Oh Y.K. DeBrosse C. Jeffs P.W. J. Antibiot. 1986; 39: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, even if a 13C-labeled metabolite added to the medium is not incorporated, it cannot be ruled out as a precursor, since incorporation depends on whether the labeled precursor is available for the biosynthetic enzymes in the right place at the right time. Furthermore, the presence of precursors in the medium may cause inhibition of growth and product formation. This was the case when we added 1 mm L-tyrosine to an actively growing culture of A. teichomyceticus (data not shown). By using labeled glucose it is, however, to a certain extent possible to study biosynthetic routes for all parts of complex biomolecules like teicoplanin. In conclusion we have shown that the fractional enrichment pattern of teicoplanin produced in a medium containing [1-13C]glucose displays characteristic peaks indicating that amino acids 3 and 7 are derived from acetate whereas amino acids 1, 2, and 4–6 are derived from tyrosine. Multiplet structures in HSQC spectra of teicoplanin produced in a medium containing [U-13C]glucose showed characteristic coupling patterns supporting these results. Fractional enrichment patterns and multiplet structures of the carbohydrate parts of teicoplanin showed that about 50% of the sugar units are synthesized directly from glucose, whereas the rest are reassembled, probably from precursors in the primary metabolism. The spectra at 750 MHz were obtained on a Varian Unity Inova spectrometer at the Danish Instrument Center for NMR Spectroscopy of Biological Macromolecules.

But how do bees measure the distance in the first place? [Collett][1] explains in a Perspective that recent findings ([ Srinivasan et al .][2]) demonstrate decisively that bees measure distance visually, integrating over time the optic flow of images that cross the retina as they fly through a landscape.
