https://openalex.org/W1577451703,"Carbonate communities: The activity of anaerobic methane oxidizing microbes facilitates precipitation of vast quantities of authigenic carbonate at methane seeps. Here we demonstrate the significant role of carbonate rocks in promoting diversity by providing unique habitat and food resources for macrofaunal assemblages at seeps on the Costa Rica margin (400-1850 m). The attendant fauna is surprisingly similar to that in rocky intertidal shores, with numerous grazing gastropods (limpets and snails) as dominant taxa. However, the community feeds upon seep-associated microbes. Macrofaunal density, composition, and diversity on carbonates vary as a function of seepage activity, biogenic habitat and location. The macrofaunal community of carbonates at non-seeping (inactive) sites is strongly related to the hydrography (depth, temperature, O2) of overlying water, whereas the fauna at sites of active seepage is not. Densities are highest on active rocks from tubeworm bushes and mussel beds, particularly at the Mound 12 location (1000 m). Species diversity is higher on rocks exposed to active seepage, with multiple species of gastropods and polychaetes dominant, while crustaceans, cnidarians, and ophiuroids were better represented on rocks at inactive sites. Macro-infauna (larger than 0.3 mm) from tube cores taken in nearby seep sediments at comparable depths exhibited densities similar to those on carbonate rocks, but had lower diversity and different taxonomic composition. Seep sediments had higher densities of ampharetid, dorvilleid, hesionid, cirratulid and lacydoniid polychaetes, whereas carbonates had more gastropods, as well as syllid, chrysopetalid and polynoid polychaetes. Stable isotope signatures and metrics: The stable isotope signatures of carbonates were heterogeneous, as were the food sources and nutrition used by the animals. Carbonate δ13Cinorg values (mean = -26.98‰) ranged from -53.3‰ to +10.0‰, and were significantly heavier than carbonate δ13Corg (mean = -33.83‰), which ranged from -74.4‰ to -20.6‰. Invertebrates on carbonates had average δ13C (per rock) = -31.0‰ (range -18.5‰ to -46.5‰) and δ15N = 5.7‰ (range -4.5‰ to +13.4‰). Average δ13C values did not differ between active and inactive sites; carbonate fauna from both settings depend on chemosynthesis-based nutrition. Community metrics reflecting trophic diversity (SEAc, total Hull Area, ranges of δ13C and δ15N) and species packing (mean distance to centroid, nearest neighbor distance) also did not vary as a function of seepage activity or site. However, distinct isotopic signatures were observed among related, co-occurring species of gastropods and polychaetes, reflecting intense microbial resource partitioning. Overall, the substrate and nutritional heterogeneity introduced by authigenic seep carbonates act to promote diverse, uniquely adapted assemblages, even after seepage ceases. The macrofauna in these ecosystems remain largely overlooked in most surveys, but are major contributors to biodiversity of chemosynthetic ecosystems and the deep sea in general."

However, infrared light interacts poorly with nanometric-size molecules. We exploit the unique electro-optical properties of graphene to demonstrate a high-sensitivity tunable plasmonic biosensor for chemically specific label-free detection of protein monolayers. The plasmon resonance of nanostructured graphene is dynamically tuned to selectively probe the protein at different frequencies and extract its complex refractive index. Additionally, the extreme spatial light confinement in graphene—up to two orders of magnitude higher than in metals—produces an unprecedentedly high overlap with nanometric biomolecules, enabling superior sensitivity in the detection of their refractive index and vibrational fingerprints. The combination of tunable spectral selectivity and enhanced sensitivity of graphene opens exciting prospects for biosensing."

We demonstrate a single reprogrammable optical circuit that is sufficient to implement all possible linear optical protocols up to the size of that circuit. Our six-mode universal system consists of a cascade of 15 Mach-Zehnder interferometers with 30 thermo-optic phase shifters integrated into a single photonic chip that is electrically and optically interfaced for arbitrary setting of all phase shifters, input of up to six photons, and their measurement with a 12-single-photon detector system. We programmed this system to implement heralded quantum logic and entangling gates, boson sampling with verification tests, and six-dimensional complex Hadamards. We implemented 100 Haar random unitaries with an average fidelity of 0.999 ± 0.001. Our system can be rapidly reprogrammed to implement these and any other linear optical protocol, pointing the way to applications across fundamental science and quantum technologies."

However, key challenges in the design and manufacture of soft robots include the complex fabrication processes and the interfacing of soft and rigid components. We used multimaterial three-dimensional (3D) printing to manufacture a combustion-powered robot whose body transitions from a rigid core to a soft exterior. This stiffness gradient, spanning three orders of magnitude in modulus, enables reliable interfacing between rigid driving components (controller, battery, etc.) and the primarily soft body, and also enhances performance. Powered by the combustion of butane and oxygen, this robot is able to perform untethered jumping."

For instance, Clostridium species of bacteria induce a type of T cell that promotes tolerance between the host and its microbial contents. Ohnmacht et al. and Sefik et al. characterized a population of gut regulatory T cells in mice, which required gut microbiota to survive. Multiple bacterial species of the microbiota could induce transcription factor–expressing regulatory T cells that helped maintain immune homeostasis. Mice engineered to lack these transcription factors exhibited enhanced susceptibility to colonic inflammation and had elevated amounts of proinflammatory molecules associated with allergies (see the Perspective by Hegazy and Powrie).

https://openalex.org/W2119831027,"For many species, geographical ranges are expanding toward the poles in response to climate change, while remaining stable along range edges nearest the equator. Using long-term observations across Europe and North America over 110 years, we tested for climate change-related range shifts in bumblebee species across the full extents of their latitudinal and thermal limits and movements along elevation gradients. We found cross-continentally consistent trends in failures to track warming through time at species' northern range limits, range losses from southern range limits, and shifts to higher elevations among southern species. These effects are independent of changing land uses or pesticide applications and underscore the need to test for climate impacts at both leading and trailing latitudinal and thermal limits for species."
https://openalex.org/W1520835611,"Rigidity of an ordered phase in condensed matter results in collective excitation modes spatially extending to macroscopic dimensions. A magnon is a quantum of such collective excitation modes in ordered spin systems. Here, we demonstrate the coherent coupling between a single-magnon excitation in a millimeter-sized ferromagnetic sphere and a superconducting qubit, with the interaction mediated by the virtual photon excitation in a microwave cavity. We obtain the coupling strength far exceeding the damping rates, thus bringing the hybrid system into the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, we use a parametric drive to realize a tunable magnon-qubit coupling scheme. Our approach provides a versatile tool for quantum control and measurement of the magnon excitations and may lead to advances in quantum information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2098787944,"Continental precipitation not routed to the oceans as runoff returns to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration. Partitioning this evapotranspiration flux into interception, transpiration, soil evaporation, and surface water evaporation is difficult using traditional hydrological methods, yet critical for understanding the water cycle and linked ecological processes. We combined two large-scale flux-partitioning approaches to quantify evapotranspiration subcomponents and the hydrologic connectivity of bound, plant-available soil waters with more mobile surface waters. Globally, transpiration is 64 ± 13% (mean ± 1 standard deviation) of evapotranspiration, and 65 ± 26% of evaporation originates from soils and not surface waters. We estimate that 38 ± 28% of surface water is derived from the plant-accessed soil water pool. This limited connectivity between soil and surface waters fundamentally structures the physical and biogeochemical interactions of water transiting through catchments."
https://openalex.org/W1748436622,"Human inborn errors of immunity mediated by the cytokines interleukin-17A and interleukin-17F (IL-17A/F) underlie mucocutaneous candidiasis, whereas inborn errors of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) immunity underlie mycobacterial disease. We report the discovery of bi-allelic RORC loss-of-function mutations in seven individuals from three kindreds of different ethnic origins with both candidiasis and mycobacteriosis. The lack of functional RORγ and RORγT isoforms resulted in the absence of IL-17A/F-producing T cells in these individuals, probably accounting for their chronic candidiasis. Unexpectedly, leukocytes from RORγ- and RORγT-deficient individuals also displayed an impaired IFN-γ response to Mycobacterium. This principally reflected profoundly defective IFN-γ production by circulating γδ T cells and CD4(+)CCR6(+)CXCR3(+) αβ T cells. In humans, both mucocutaneous immunity to Candida and systemic immunity to Mycobacterium require RORγ, RORγT, or both."
https://openalex.org/W2164011442,"Neurons in the macaque lateral intraparietal (LIP) area exhibit firing rates that appear to ramp upward or downward during decision-making. These ramps are commonly assumed to reflect the gradual accumulation of evidence toward a decision threshold. However, the ramping in trial-averaged responses could instead arise from instantaneous jumps at different times on different trials. We examined single-trial responses in LIP using statistical methods for fitting and comparing latent dynamical spike-train models. We compared models with latent spike rates governed by either continuous diffusion-to-bound dynamics or discrete ""stepping"" dynamics. Roughly three-quarters of the choice-selective neurons we recorded were better described by the stepping model. Moreover, the inferred steps carried more information about the animal's choice than spike counts."

We developed graphical approaches to construct an extensible immune reference map from mass cytometry data of cells from different organs, incorporating landmark cell populations as flags on the map to compare cells from distinct samples. The maps recapitulated canonical cellular phenotypes and revealed reproducible, tissue-specific deviations. The approach revealed influences of genetic variation and circadian rhythms on immune system structure, enabled direct comparisons of murine and human blood cell phenotypes, and even enabled archival fluorescence-based flow cytometry data to be mapped onto the reference framework. This foundational reference map provides a working definition of systemic immune organization to which new data can be integrated to reveal deviations driven by genetics, environment, or pathology."

https://openalex.org/W1589010633,"Neuronal circuits produce self-sustaining sequences of activity patterns, but the precise mechanisms remain unknown. Here we provide evidence for autoassociative dynamics in sequence generation. During sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events, hippocampal neurons express sequenced reactivations, which we show are composed of discrete attractors. Each attractor corresponds to a single location, the representation of which sharpens over the course of several milliseconds, as the reactivation focuses at that location. Subsequently, the reactivation transitions rapidly to a spatially discontiguous location. This alternation between sharpening and transition occurs repeatedly within individual SWRs and is locked to the slow-gamma (25 to 50 hertz) rhythm. These findings support theoretical notions of neural network function and reveal a fundamental discretization in the retrieval of memory in the hippocampus, together with a function for gamma oscillations in the control of attractor dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1843078453,Recent modeling studies have proposed different scenarios to explain the slowdown in surface temperature warming in the most recent decade. Some of these studies seem to support the idea of internal variability and/or rearrangement of heat between the surface and the ocean interior. Others suggest that radiative forcing might also play a role. Our examination of observational data over the past two decades shows some significant differences when compared to model results from reanalyses and provides the most definitive explanation of how the heat was redistributed. We find that cooling in the top 100-meter layer of the Pacific Ocean was mainly compensated for by warming in the 100- to 300-meter layer of the Indian and Pacific Oceans in the past decade since 2003.
https://openalex.org/W1904262466,"The carnivoran giant panda has a specialized bamboo diet, to which its alimentary tract is poorly adapted. Measurements of daily energy expenditure across five captive and three wild pandas averaged 5.2 megajoules (MJ)/day, only 37.7% of the predicted value (13.8 MJ/day). For the wild pandas, the mean was 6.2 MJ/day, or 45% of the mammalian expectation. Pandas achieve this exceptionally low expenditure in part by reduced sizes of several vital organs and low physical activity. In addition, circulating levels of thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) averaged 46.9 and 64%, respectively, of the levels expected for a eutherian mammal of comparable size. A giant panda-unique mutation in the DUOX2 gene, critical for thyroid hormone synthesis, might explain these low thyroid hormone levels. A combination of morphological, behavioral, physiological, and genetic adaptations, leading to low energy expenditure, likely enables giant pandas to survive on a bamboo diet."

They combined structural data with cross-linking mass spectrometry to generate a complete molecular model. The model suggests a mechanism of coat assembly in which coat proteins cluster via flexible interactions instead of forming a protein cage on the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W782214951,"Climate change is known to affect ecosystems globally, but our knowledge of its impact on large and widespread mammals, and possibly population-specific responses is still sparse. We investigated large-scale and long-term effects of climate change on local population dynamics using the wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) as a model species. Our results show that population increases across Europe are strongly associated with increasingly mild winters, yet with region-specific threshold temperatures for the onset of exponential growth. Additionally, we found that abundant availability of critical food resources, e.g. beech nuts, can outweigh the negative effects of cold winters on population growth of wild boar. Availability of beech nuts is highly variable and highest in years of beech mast which increased in frequency since 1980, according to our data. We conclude that climate change drives population growth of wild boar directly by relaxing the negative effect of cold winters on survival and reproduction, and indirectly by increasing food availability. However, region-specific responses need to be considered in order to fully understand a species’ demographic response to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W749670156,"Background The physical and mental health of college students tends to continuously decline around the world, therefore, it is important to improve their health during college period. Baduanjin, a traditional Chinese exercise which combines movements with breath and mind, may be one of the selectable effective exercises. However, the effect of Baduanjin exercise on college students has not been established. In this study, we systematically assessed the effectiveness and safety of Baduanjin exercise on physical and mental health of college students by a rigorous randomized, parallel-controlled design. Methods A total of 222 college students from Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were recruited and randomly allocated at an equal ratio into control or Baduanjin training. Participants in control group were informed to maintain their original activity habit, and those in Baduanjin exercise group received a 12-week Baduanjin exercise training with a frequency of 1 hour per day and 5 days per week on the basis of their original activity habit. The physical and psychological outcomes, including lumbar muscle strength, lower limb proprioception function, physical fitness, as well as self-reported symptom intensity, stress, self-esteem, mood, quality of life, quality of sleep, and adverse events, were evaluated at baseline, 13 weeks (at the end of 12-week intervention), and 25 weeks (after the 12-week follow-up period). Intention-to-treat analysis was performed for the above outcomes. Results Compared with controls, significant improvements in Baduanjin exercise group at the end of 12-week intervention period were found on lower limb proprioception function (the rate of average trace error on right lower limb (%): control 23.50±5.50, Baduanjin 21.92±6.54, P=0.004; the rate of average trace error on left lower limb (%): control 22.32±6.62, Baduanjin 20.63±4.62, P=0.046), cardiorespiratory endurance (step test index: control 47.66±5.94, Baduanjin 50.07±9.30, P=0.025), flexibility (control 14.35±7.26cm, Baduanjin 15.39±6.43cm, P=0.009) and explosive force of lower limb (standing long jump test (m): control 1.77±0.24, Baduanjin 1.79±0.22, P=0.005 for adjustment baseline) in physical outcomes, and attention (Schulte Grid test (second): control 210.4±51.15, Baduanjin 192.4±47.14, P=0.034) in mental outcome. Lumbar muscle strength in Baduanjin group had been moderately enhanced but no significant difference compared to controls. No significant changes in other physical and mental outcomes, including vital capacity, blood pressure, heart rate, hand grip force, self-symptom intensity, stress, self-efficacy, quality of life, and quality of sleep, were found between groups. No adverse event was reported during the study period. Conclusion Regular Baduanjin exercise had an advantage for college students on improvement of lower limb proprioception, enhance of cardiorespiratory endurance, flexibility, explosive force of lower limb and attention, compared with usual exercise.

The radiation emitted from the growing SMBH is expected to affect star formation throughout the host galaxy. The relevance of this scenario at early cosmic epochs is not yet established. We present spectroscopic observations of a galaxy at redshift z = 3.328, which hosts an actively accreting, extremely massive BH, in its final stages of growth. The SMBH mass is roughly one-tenth the mass of the entire host galaxy, suggesting that it has grown much more efficiently than the host, contrary to models of synchronized coevolution. The host galaxy is forming stars at an intense rate, despite the presence of a SMBH-driven gas outflow."

We raise the question of the elementary units for which Zipf's law should hold in the most natural way, studying its validity for plain word forms and for the corresponding lemma forms. We analyze several long literary texts comprising four languages, with different levels of morphological complexity. In all cases Zipf's law is fulfilled, in the sense that a power-law distribution of word or lemma frequencies is valid for several orders of magnitude. We investigate the extent to which the word-lemma transformation preserves two parameters of Zipf's law: the exponent and the low-frequency cut-off. We are not able to demonstrate a strict invariance of the tail, as for a few texts both exponents deviate significantly, but we conclude that the exponents are very similar, despite the remarkable transformation that going from words to lemmas represents, considerably affecting all ranges of frequencies. In contrast, the low-frequency cut-offs are less stable, tending to increase substantially after the transformation."

Despite the marked deformation, the release of strain appears delayed. The rock physics analysis of well cores highlights the presence of two horizons, above and below the seismogenic area, underlying a coupled process. The basement is a calc-silicate rock housing hydrothermal decarbonation reactions, which provide lime-rich fluids. The caprock above the seismogenic area has a pozzolanic composition and a fibril-rich matrix that results from lime-pozzolanic reactions. These findings provide evidence for a natural process reflecting that characterizing the cementitious pastes in modern and Roman concrete. The formation of fibrous minerals by intertwining filaments confers shear and tensile strength to the caprock, contributing to its ductility and increased resistance to fracture."

Lipid A interacts with a hydrophobic pocket formed by two anti-parallel β-sheets of MD-2 mediating the dimerization and activation of the TLR4·MD-2 complex (19Maeshima N. Fernandez R.C.

Chem. 2014; 14: 2672-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The MD-2 hydrophobic pocket can accommodate up to five acyl chains. For agonistic hexa-acylated E. coli lipid A, five acyl chains are buried within the pocket, whereas the sixth chain lies on a channel of the MD-2 surface, building a hydrophobic region and the dimerization interface required for interaction with the TLR4 partner (referred to here as TLR4*). This arrangement enables hydrophobic interactions bridging the TLR4·MD-2·LPS heterodimer and promoting the juxtaposition of the intracellular domains, leading to activation of signal transduction (18Park B.S. Song D.H. Kim H.M. Choi B.S. Lee H. Lee J.O.

By contrast, antagonist lipid IVA binds to human MD-2 with all four acyl chains completely buried in the hydrophobic pocket precluding dimerization and subsequent activation (23Ohto U. Fukase K.

Similarly, many penta-acylated lipid As act as an antagonist of human TLR4·MD-2 (24Ernst R.K. Yi E.C. Guo L. Lim K.B. Burns J.L. Hackett M. Miller S.I.

Endotoxin Res. 2007; 13: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, lipid IVA can activate the murine TLR4·MD-2 complex (26Saitoh S. Akashi S. Yamada T. Tanimura N. Kobayashi M. Konno K. Matsumoto F. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Nagai Y. Kusumoto Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. Lipid A antagonist, lipid IVA, is distinct from lipid A in interaction with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-MD-2 and ligand-induced TLR4 oligomerization.Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Bacteria regulate the degree of lipid A acylation in response to environmental conditions. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains possess penta-acylated lipid A but can produce hexa-acylated lipid A during infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (27Hajjar A.M. Ernst R.K. Tsai J.H. Wilson C.B. Miller S.I. Human Toll-like receptor 4 recognizes host-specific LPS modifications.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), gaining the ability to elicit stronger inflammation. Intriguingly, the non-CF pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis produces a high heterogeneous LPS lipid A whose penta-acylated isoform potently activates the NF-κB pathway in human gingival fibroblasts in a similar manner to the E. coli LPS (28Herath T.D. Darveau R.P. Seneviratne C.J. Wang C.Y. Wang Y. Jin L. Tetra- and Penta-acylated lipid A structures of Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS differentially activate TLR4-mediated NF-κB signal transduction cascade and immuno-inflammatory response in human gingival fibroblasts.PLoS One. 2013; 8e58496Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying TLR4 dimerization and activation cannot always be predicted based on the E. coli lipid A-TLR4·MD-2 paradigm. Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium causing serious infections in CF patients (29Speert D.P. Advances in Burkholderia cepacia complex.Paediatr. Respir. Rev. 2002; 3: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Understanding how B. cenocepacia infection elicits inflammation is crucial to finding new ways to improve treatment of infected CF patients. The structure of the B. cenocepacia LPS (LPSBC) was described previously (30Hamad M.A. Di Lorenzo F. Molinaro A. Valvano M.A. Aminoarabinose is essential for lipopolysaccharide export and intrinsic antimicrobial peptide resistance in Burkholderia cenocepacia.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 85: 962-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The lipid A moiety of LPSBC consists of a mixture of penta-acylated and tetra-acylated, bisphosphorylated diglucosamine backbone with two 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) residues linked by phosphodiester linkages (see Fig. 1) (30Hamad M.A. Di Lorenzo F. Molinaro A. Valvano M.A. Aminoarabinose is essential for lipopolysaccharide export and intrinsic antimicrobial peptide resistance in Burkholderia cenocepacia.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 85: 962-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The acyl chains are made of 3-(R)-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid C16:0 (3-OH), 3-(R)-hydroxytetradecanoic acid C14:0 (3-OH), and hydroxytetradecanoic acid C14:0 (see Fig. 1) (30Hamad M.A. Di Lorenzo F.

Microbiol. 2012; 85: 962-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The l-Ara4N decoration of lipid A is essential for B. cenocepacia viability (31Ortega X.P. Cardona S.T. Brown A.R. Loutet S.A.

The structural features of LPSBC suggest that the molecule would be a very poor TLR4·MD-2 complex agonist compared with the prototypic enterobacterial LPS. In contrast, several studies show that LPSBC as well as biological and synthetic lipid A analogues is highly proinflammatory (32Zughaier S.M. Ryley H.C. Jackson S.K. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Burkholderia cepacia is more active than LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in stimulating tumor necrosis factor alpha from human monocytes.Infect.

J. 2015; 21: 4102-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the current model for binding/activation of human TLR4·MD-2 complex cannot explain why LPSBC is proinflammatory. In this work, we investigated the molecular basis of the mechanism of LPSBC recognition and report for the first time that acyl chains longer than those in enterobacterial lipid A together with the l-Ara4N residues allow B. cenocepacia lipid A (LABC) to fit into the binding pocket of MD-2 in a manner that promotes TLR4 dimerization, leading to activation of inflammatory responses in cellular and animal models. LPS was prepared from B. cenocepacia strains MH71 and MH75 (30Hamad M.A. Di Lorenzo F. Molinaro A.

Microbiol. 2012; 85: 962-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both strains are isogenic derivatives of the K56-2 clinical isolate and contain a deletion of the wbiF gene that eliminates O-antigen production. MH75 also has a deletion removing genes involved in UDP-l-Ara4N synthesis and therefore cannot produce LPS with l-Ara4N residues (LPSBCΔAra). Both MH71 and MH75 also carry a suppressor mutation in the LPS transport gene lptG that allows for the transport of LPS devoid of l-Ara4N to the bacterial outer membrane (30Hamad M.A. Di Lorenzo F.

Strains were plated on trypticase soy agar plates and cultured in trypticase soy broth at 37 °C. For large scale LPS purification, bacteria were treated with hot phenol/water (39Westphal O.J. Jann K. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides: extraction with phenol-water and further applications of the procedure.Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar). After extensive dialysis against distilled water, the extracted phases were subjected to enzymatic digestions to remove nucleic acids and protein contaminants. Water and phenol fractions were analyzed by 13.5% SDS-PAGE and silver staining (40Kittelberger R. Hilbink F. Sensitive silver-staining detection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides in polyacrylamide gels.J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1993; 26: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The LPS fraction was exclusively found in the water phase. Lipid A was obtained by hydrolysis of the LPS with 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.4 (100 °C for 3 h). The solution was extracted three times with CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (100:100:30, v/v/v) and centrifuged (4 °C at 5000 × g for 15 min). The organic phase contained lipid A, and the water phase contained the core oligosaccharide. The former was further purified through several washes with distilled water and then lyophilized. The lipid A and core oligosaccharide structures of strains K56-2, MH71, and MH75 were characterized elsewhere (Fig. 1) (30Hamad M.A. Di Lorenzo F. Molinaro A.

Animal studies were conducted according to protocols approved by the San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan, Italy) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and adhered strictly to the Italian Ministry of Health guidelines for the use and care of experimental animals. Efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. C57BL/6 mice (20–22 g; male; Charles River) were challenged via intraperitoneal injection with 300 μg/mouse LPS from E. coli and P. aeruginosa RP73, LPSBC, and LPSBCΔAra. Control mice were challenged with sterile saline solution. Five hours after treatment, mice were sacrificed by CO2 administration, and blood was collected from heart puncture. The blood clot was left at room temperature for 15–30 min. The clot was removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Sera were collected and stored at −20 °C. TNF-α concentration in sera was determined by ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions using antibody pairs and recombinant standards from R&D Systems. Expression plasmids containing sequences of human TLR4 and MD-2 and the pELAM-1 firefly luciferase plasmid were a gift from Dr. C. Kirschning (Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany). Expression plasmid containing sequence of mouse TLR4 was purchased from InvivoGen. Expression plasmid for mouse MD-2 was a gift from Dr. Y. Nagai (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). The Renilla luciferase phRL-TK plasmid was purchased from Promega. Recombinant MD-2 genes were cloned into pEF-BOS with FLAG and His tags on the C terminus. Recombinant TLR4 genes were cloned into pUNO with a C-terminal HA tag. Transfection reagent JetPEI was purchased from Polyplus Transfection (France) and was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The HEK293 cells were provided by Dr. J. Chow (Eisai Research Institute, Andover, MA) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The MD-2 mutants were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the appropriate mutations. For the NF-κB-luciferase reporter assay, HEK293 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 3 × 104 cells/well and incubated overnight in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2) at 37 °C. The next day when cells were 60–80% confluent, they were co-transfected with the plasmids for MD-2 (10 ng), TLR4 (1 ng), NF-κB-dependent luciferase (50 ng), and constitutive Renilla luciferase (10 ng) using JetPEI transfection reagent (all amounts are in ng/well). Cells were stimulated 6 h after transfection with endotoxin preparations. Cells were lysed after 16 h of stimulation in 1× reporter assay lysis buffer (Promega) and analyzed for reporter gene activities using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. Relative luciferase units were calculated by normalizing the luciferase activity of each sample with the constitutive Renilla activity measured within the same sample. Results were expressed as mean ± S.D. from experiments done in triplicate. Statistical calculations and tests in vitro and in vivo were performed using Student's t test considering p ≤ 0.05 as the limit of statistical significance and a p value of 0.001 as extremely significant.

Conformational analysis on DS1, DS2, and DS3 disaccharides was performed with MacroModel (44Schrödinger Suite 2012: MacroModel. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2012Google Scholar). The parameters were as follows: MM3* force field and water solvent dielectric constant of 1.0. The charges from the force field were used with an extended cutoff. The best conformers were selected, and from them, molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) with implicit water and MM3* as the force field were performed using Schrödinger Maestro 9.3 and Impact 5.8 (42Schrödinger Suite 2012: Maestro. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2012Google Scholar, 45Schrödinger Suite 2012: Impact. Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY2012Google Scholar) (MM3* force field; dielectric constant, 80.0; number of MDS steps, 100; time step (ps), 0.001). The full three-dimensional structures of LABCΔAra, LABC, and LPSBC were built with Maestro using optimized disaccharide scaffolds obtained from the conformational analysis. Fatty acid chains, DS6, and aminoarabinoses were optimized separately using Gaussian 03 (B3LYP/6-31G*). The starting conformation for lipid A optimization was obtained from E. coli lipid A from Protein Data Bank code 3fxi. The full structure of LPSBC was built by putting together core region disaccharides and lipid A with five aliphatic chains. Final MDS of the geometry was performed with implicit water by means of Impact (MM3* force field; dielectric constant, 80.0; number of MDS steps, 100; time step (ps), 0.001).

https://openalex.org/W1823460074,"Genome-scale metabolic models have proven highly valuable in investigating cell physiology. Recent advances include the development of methods to extract context-specific models capable of describing metabolism under more specific scenarios (e.g., cell types). Yet, none of the existing computational approaches allows for a fully automated model extraction and determination of a flux distribution independent of user-defined parameters. Here we present RegrEx, a fully automated approach that relies solely on context-specific data and ℓ1-norm regularization to extract a context-specific model and to provide a flux distribution that maximizes its correlation to data. Moreover, the publically available implementation of RegrEx was used to extract 11 context-specific human models using publicly available RNAseq expression profiles, Recon1 and also Recon2, the most recent human metabolic model. The comparison of the performance of RegrEx and its contending alternatives demonstrates that the proposed method extracts models for which both the structure, i.e., reactions included, and the flux distributions are in concordance with the employed data. These findings are supported by validation and comparison of method performance on additional data not used in context-specific model extraction. Therefore, our study sets the ground for applications of other regularization techniques in large-scale metabolic modeling."
https://openalex.org/W1934579812,"Cell division in Escherichia coli involves a set of essential proteins that assembles at midcell to form the so-called divisome. The divisome regulates the invagination of the inner membrane, cell wall synthesis, and inward growth of the outer membrane. One of the divisome proteins, FtsQ, plays a central but enigmatic role in cell division. This protein associates with FtsB and FtsL, which, like FtsQ, are bitopic inner membrane proteins with a large periplasmic domain (denoted FtsQp, FtsBp, and FtsLp) that is indispensable for the function of each protein. Considering the vital nature and accessible location of the FtsQBL complex, it is an attractive target for protein-protein interaction inhibitors intended to block bacterial cell division. In this study, we expressed FtsQp, FtsBp, and FtsLp individually and in combination. Upon co-expression, FtsQp was co-purified with FtsBp and FtsLp from E. coli extracts as a stable trimeric complex. FtsBp was also shown to interact with FtsQp in the absence of FtsLp albeit with lower affinity. Interactions were mapped at the C terminus of the respective domains by site-specific cross-linking. The binding affinity and 1:1:1 stoichiometry of the FtsQpBpLp complex and the FtsQpBp subcomplex were determined in complementary surface plasmon resonance, analytical ultracentrifugation, and native mass spectrometry experiments."

The ATP synthase from Gram-positive and -negative model bacteria can be autoinhibited by the C-terminal domain of its ϵ subunit (ϵCTD), but the importance of ϵ inhibition in vivo is unclear. Functional rotation is thought to be blocked by insertion of the latter half of the ϵCTD into the central cavity of the catalytic complex (F1). In the inhibited state of the Escherichia coli enzyme, the final segment of ϵCTD is deeply buried but has few specific interactions with other subunits. This region of the ϵCTD is variable or absent in other bacteria that exhibit strong ϵ-inhibition in vitro. Here, genetically deleting the last five residues of the ϵCTD (ϵΔ5) caused a greater defect in respiratory growth than did the complete absence of the ϵCTD. Isolated membranes with ϵΔ5 generated proton-motive force by respiration as effectively as with wild-type ϵ but showed a nearly 3-fold decrease in ATP synthesis rate. In contrast, the ϵΔ5 truncation did not change the intrinsic rate of ATP hydrolysis with membranes. Further, the ϵΔ5 subunit retained high affinity for isolated F1 but reduced the maximal inhibition of F1-ATPase by ϵ from >90% to ∼20%.

Despite their physiological importance, the structural information on Insigs remains limited. Here we report the high-resolution structures of MvINS, an Insig homolog from Mycobacterium vanbaalenii. MvINS exists as a homotrimer. Each protomer comprises six transmembrane segments (TMs), with TM3 and TM4 contributing to homotrimerization. The six TMs enclose a V-shaped cavity that can accommodate a diacylglycerol molecule. A homology-based structural model of human Insig-2, together with biochemical characterizations, suggest that the central cavity of Insig-2 accommodates 25-hydroxycholesterol, whereas TM3 and TM4 engage in Scap binding.

https://openalex.org/W772945220,"Globally the majority of commercial fisheries have experienced dramatic declines in stock and catch. Likewise, projections for many subsistence fisheries in the tropics indicate a dramatic decline is looming in the coming decades. In the Pacific Islands coastal fisheries provide basic subsistence needs for millions of people. A decline in fish catch would therefore have profound impacts on the health and livelihoods of these coastal communities. Given the decrease in local catch rates reported for many coastal communities in the Pacific, it is important to understand if fishers have responded to ecological change (either by expanding their fishing range and/or increasing their fishing effort), and if so, to evaluate the costs or benefits of these responses. We compare data from fish catches in 1995 and 2011 from a rural coastal community in Solomon Islands to examine the potentially changing coastal reef fishery at these time points. In particular we found changes in preferred fishing locations, fishing methodology and catch composition between these data sets. The results indicate that despite changes in catch rates (catch per unit effort) between data collected in 2011 and 16 years previously, the study community was able to increase gross catches through visiting fishing sites further away, diversifying fishing methods and targeting pelagic species through trolling. Such insight into local-scale responses to changing resources and/or fisheries development will help scientists and policy makers throughout the Pacific region in managing the region’s fisheries in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1509740579,"Penile cancer (PeCa) is a relatively rare tumor entity but possesses higher morbidity and mortality rates especially in developing countries. To date, the concrete pathogenic signaling pathways and core machineries involved in tumorigenesis and progression of PeCa remain to be elucidated. Several studies suggested miRNAs, which modulate gene expression at posttranscriptional level, were frequently mis-regulated and aberrantly expressed in human cancers. However, the miRNA profile in human PeCa has not been reported before. In this present study, the miRNA profile was obtained from 10 fresh penile cancerous tissues and matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues via next-generation sequencing. As a result, a total of 751 and 806 annotated miRNAs were identified in normal and cancerous penile tissues, respectively. Among which, 56 miRNAs with significantly different expression levels between paired tissues were identified. Subsequently, several annotated miRNAs were selected randomly and validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Compared with the previous publications regarding to the altered miRNAs expression in various cancers and especially genitourinary (prostate, bladder, kidney, testis) cancers, the most majority of deregulated miRNAs showed the similar expression pattern in penile cancer. Moreover, the bioinformatics analyses suggested that the putative target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs between cancerous and matched normal penile tissues were tightly associated with cell junction, proliferation, growth as well as genomic instability and so on, by modulating Wnt, MAPK, p53, PI3K-Akt, Notch and TGF-β signaling pathways, which were all well-established to participate in cancer initiation and progression. Our work presents a global view of the differentially expressed miRNAs and potentially regulatory networks of their target genes for clarifying the pathogenic transformation of normal penis to PeCa, which research resource also provides new insights into future investigations aimed to explore the in-depth mechanisms of miRNAs and other small RNAs including piRNAs in penile carcinogenesis regulation and effective target-specific theragnosis."
https://openalex.org/W1491908242,"Glycoprotein C (gC) mediates the attachment of HSV-1 to susceptible host cells by interacting with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the cell surface. gC contains a mucin-like region located near the GAG-binding site, which may affect the binding activity. Here, we address this issue by studying a HSV-1 mutant lacking the mucin-like domain in gC and the corresponding purified mutant protein (gCΔmuc) in cell culture and GAG-binding assays, respectively. The mutant virus exhibited two functional alterations as compared with native HSV-1 (i.e. decreased sensitivity to GAG-based inhibitors of virus attachment to cells and reduced release of viral particles from the surface of infected cells). Kinetic and equilibrium binding characteristics of purified gC were assessed using surface plasmon resonance-based sensing together with a surface platform consisting of end-on immobilized GAGs. Both native gC and gCΔmuc bound via the expected binding region to chondroitin sulfate and sulfated hyaluronan but not to the non-sulfated hyaluronan, confirming binding specificity. In contrast to native gC, gCΔmuc exhibited a decreased affinity for GAGs and a slower dissociation, indicating that once formed, the gCΔmuc-GAG complex is more stable. It was also found that a larger number of gCΔmuc bound to a single GAG chain, compared with native gC. Taken together, our data suggest that the mucin-like region of HSV-1 gC is involved in the modulation of the GAG-binding activity, a feature of importance both for unrestricted virus entry into the cells and release of newly produced viral particles from infected cells."

We previously reported that the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 enhanced AR transcriptional activity and prostate cancer cell growth. Among the genes we found to be regulated by Siah2 was AKR1C3, which encodes a key androgen biosynthetic enzyme implicated in castration-resistant prostate cancer development. Here, we found that Siah2 inhibition in CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cells decreased AKR1C3 expression as well as intracellular androgen levels, concomitant with inhibition of cell growth in vitro and in orthotopic prostate tumors. Re-expression of either wild-type or catalytically inactive forms of AKR1C3 partially rescued AR activity and growth defects in Siah2 knockdown cells, suggesting a nonenzymatic role for AKR1C3 in these outcomes. Unexpectedly, AKR1C3 re-expression in Siah2 knockdown cells elevated Siah2 protein levels, whereas AKR1C3 knockdown had the opposite effect. We further found that AKR1C3 can bind Siah2 and inhibit its self-ubiquitination and degradation, thereby increasing Siah2 protein levels. We observed parallel expression of Siah2 and AKR1C3 in human prostate cancer tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2097682417,"Antibodies to the autoantigen transglutaminase 2 (TG2) are a hallmark of celiac disease. We have studied the interaction between TG2 and an anti-TG2 antibody (679-14-E06) derived from a single gut IgA plasma cell of a celiac disease patient. The antibody recognizes one of four identified epitopes targeted by antibodies of plasma cells of the disease lesion. The binding interface was identified by small angle x-ray scattering, ab initio and rigid body modeling using the known crystal structure of TG2 and the crystal structure of the antibody Fab fragment, which was solved at 2.4 Å resolution. The result was confirmed by testing binding of the antibody to TG2 mutants by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance. TG2 residues Arg-116 and His-134 were identified to be critical for binding of 679-14-E06 as well as other epitope 1 antibodies. In contrast, antibodies directed toward the two other main epitopes (epitopes 2 and 3) were not affected by these mutations. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest interactions of 679-14-E06 with the N-terminal domain of TG2 via the CDR2 and CDR3 loops of the heavy chain and the CDR2 loop of the light chain. In addition there were contacts of the framework 3 region of the heavy chain with the catalytic domain of TG2.

The enzyme also plays an important role in creating immunogenic, deamidated epitopes of gluten that are recognized by CD4 T cells in the context of celiac disease-associated HLA-DQ molecules (7Molberg O.

It is likely that the dual involvement of TG2 in celiac disease, as a generator of T-cell epitopes and as a target for autoantibodies, is causally linked, although the mechanism for this has not been settled (8Sollid L.M.

A major function of TG2 is to catalyze calcium-dependent transamidation and deamidation reactions. The enzyme targets polypeptide glutamine residues in a sequence-specific manner and either cross-links them to a primary amine, which can be a lysine residue of another polypeptide (transamidation), or converts them to glutamate through a reaction with water (deamidation). TG2 can also have other functions such as GTPase/G-protein, kinase, and disulfide isomerase (12Gundemir S. Colak G. Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. Transglutaminase 2: a molecular Swiss army knife.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 406-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The structure and function of TG2 are influenced not only by calcium but also by nucleotide phosphates (13Mariani P.

In the open conformation the four domains of TG2 are arranged in an extended configuration, whereas in the closed conformation the two C-terminal domains are folded in on the catalytic core domain. The N-terminal domain only shows minor structural changes between the two different conformations. There is limited knowledge about the interaction of TG2 autoantibodies with TG2. A recent study with polyclonal sera of celiac disease patients indicated that there is an important conformational epitope involving residues Arg-19, Glu-153, and Met-659 located in three different domains of TG2 (18Simon-Vecsei Z.

Med. 2012; 18: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) indicated the existence of four common epitopes (epitope 1–4) that are conformational and clustered in the N-terminal part of the TG2 molecule (19Iversen R.

Immunol. 2013; 190: 5981-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The epitopes were found to correlate with the VH usage of the antibodies; epitope 1 antibodies mainly used IGHV5 gene segments, epitope 2 antibodies used IGHV3 gene segments, and epitope 3 antibodies mainly used IGHV4 gene segments (19Iversen R. Di Niro R. Stamnaes J. Lundin K.E. Wilson P.C. Sollid L.M. Transglutaminase 2-specific autoantibodies in celiac disease target clustered, N-terminal epitopes not displayed on the surface of cells.J. Immunol. 2013; 190: 5981-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Epitope 1 is a major epitope as 30 of 57 monoclonal antibodies derived from single TG2-reactive plasma cells were found to be epitope 1-specific (19Iversen R. Di Niro R. Stamnaes J. Lundin K.E. Wilson P.C. Sollid L.M. Transglutaminase 2-specific autoantibodies in celiac disease target clustered, N-terminal epitopes not displayed on the surface of cells.J. Immunol. 2013; 190: 5981-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). By hydrogen/deuterium exchange and subsequent mutational analysis of TG2 it was recently demonstrated that residues Lys-30 and Glu-8 are part of epitope 1, whereas residue Arg-19 is part of epitope 2 (20Iversen R. Mysling S. Hnida K. Jørgensen T.J. Sollid L.M. Activity-regulating structural changes and autoantibody epitopes in transglutaminase 2 assessed by hydrogen/deuterium exchange.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 17146-17151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To further explore the structural basis for antigen recognition by anti-TG2 autoantibodies, we studied in detail the interaction of a prototype epitope 1 monoclonal antibody (679-14-E06) with TG2. Despite intensive effort, co-crystallization trials of the Fab fragment of 679-14-E06 with various forms of TG2 were unsuccessful. However, we succeeded in solving the structure of the antibody Fab fragment by x-ray crystallography, and we studied the interaction of the Fab fragment with TG2-GDP by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). The interaction site predicted by the SAXS analysis was validated through generation of single amino acid TG2 mutants that were then tested for interaction with 679-14-E06 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) as well as in ELISA using a panel of 38 other celiac disease TG2-specific monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the binding mechanism in greater detail. The results provide novel information about epitope 1 of TG2 and the key residues recognized by autoantibodies of celiac disease patients. Anti-TG2 autoantibodies were cloned and expressed as human IgG1 as previously described (3Di Niro R. Mesin L. Zheng N.Y. Stamnaes J. Morrissey M. Lee J.H. Huang M. Iversen R. du Pré M.F. Qiao S.W.

Med. 2012; 18: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Fab fragment of antibody 679-14-E06 was generated by adding a stop codon in the heavy chain gene after residue 231 (228PKSC231) by PCR using the forward primer 5′-TTTCTAGTAGCAACTGCAAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GAAAGTTGAGCCCAAATCTTGTTGAAGCTTGGAT-3′ followed by subcloning into the expression vector between the AgeI and HindIII restriction sites. Antibodies in which the heavy or light chain of 679-14-E06 was swapped with the heavy or light chain of the non-TG2 reactive antibody 679-14-A04 were also generated. 679-14-E06 carries IGHV5-51 and IGKV1-5, whereas 679-14-A04 carries IGHV3-49 and IGKV4-1. Plasmids encoding the heavy and light chains were co-transfected into HEK 293F cells by using 293fectin (Invitrogen) or polyethyleneimine (Polysciences Inc). HEK 293F cells were cultured at 37 °C with shaking for 6 days. Anti-TG2 autoantibodies were purified from culture supernatants by affinity chromatography using a protein G column (GE Healthcare), whereas the Fab fragment was purified using a protein L column (GE Healthcare). The purity of the proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The Fab fragment of 679-14-E06 was concentrated to 8.82 mg/ml, and crystallization screening was set up using a robot (Douglas instrument). Two kits, Crystal ScreenTM and Crystal Screen 2TM (Hampton Research), were used for screening. Clusters of crystals were obtained after 1 week with the condition 0.01 m nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 20% w/v polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000. Microseeding was applied to optimize the Fab fragment to form single crystals. A single crystal was transferred to cryosolution consisting of the crystallization buffer and 25% glycerol. The soaked crystal was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A complete data set was collected on the BM30 beam at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. Data were processed and scaled with MOSFLM (21Leslie A.G.W. Powell H.R. Processing diffraction data with Mosflm.Evol. Methods Macromol.

Initially, an immunoglobulin heavy chain (PDB code 4HPO) and a light chain (PDB code 1DFB) were used as search models without success. Then the variable and constant domains of the heavy and light chains of these structures were used as separate templates, and a solution could be obtained.

The electron density map for the Fab was generally of high quality except for parts of the C region domains where the electron density was missing for residues 142–149, 198–207, and 225–231 of the heavy chain and 172–175 and 228–234 of the light chain.

Mutations were introduced with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or by PCR amplification followed by subcloning into the pET-28a vector (Novagen) between the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites. Correct sequences of all mutants were verified by DNA sequencing and protein sequence verification by mass spectrometry. The proteins were purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. A fraction of each protein was buffer-exchanged into HBS-EP buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA 0.05% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) for SPR binding studies. The TG2 mutant K30E was not stable in this buffer and formed aggregates. Hence it was excluded from the SPR analysis. TG2 molecules used for complex formation with Fab fragment were further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare). Purified TG2 and the 679-14-E06 Fab fragment were mixed at a 1:2 molar ratio and incubated with 1 mm GDP for 2 h. The complex between TG2-GDP and the Fab fragment was purified by gel filtration on a Superdex200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA and eluted as a single symmetric peak. GDP was added to the sample to a final concentration of 1 mm before use. High purity of the complex was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE. Native PAGE analysis further revealed very little dissociation, suggesting that the complex was stable and homogenous. In comparison, the complex with the open conformation of TG2 was less stable and thus was excluded from further analysis. Additional testing of the complex stability was done by limited proteolysis. The purified complex of TG2-GDP/679-14-E06 Fab fragment (25 μg) was mixed with trypsin or chymotrypsin at a 1:500 (protease:complex) (w/w) ratio. The mixture was incubated on ice, and samples were taken out after 2, 15, 30, and 60 min. Proteolysis was stopped by incubation in SDS loading buffer at 96 °C for 10 min before the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Only a small degree of protein cleavage was observed, indicating that the complex had a compact and stable conformation, which allowed it to resist proteolysis. SAXS data for TG2-GDP and 679-14-E06 Fab fragment as well as the complex of the two were collected at the SAXS beamline P12 at the PETRA III storage ring (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, Hamburg) (29Blanchet C.E.

Using a PILATUS 2M pixel detector at a sample-detector distance of 3.1 m and at an energy of 10 keV (λ = 1.24 Å), the range of momentum transfer 0.01 < s < 0.45 Å−1 was covered (s = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). For each construct, several solute concentrations in the range of ∼1–10 mg/ml were measured. Sample purity was verified with dynamic light scattering (DynaPro Nanostar) before the SAXS experiment. An automated sample changer was employed to load the samples and pump the sample through the observation capillary during the exposure period to constantly remove irradiated sample. For radial averaging, the s axis was calibrated with silver. Primary data processing steps were performed using the automated data pipeline SASFLOW (30Petoukhov M.V. Franke D. Shkumatov A.V. Tria G. Kikhney A.G. Gajda M. Gorba C. Mertens H.D. Konarev P.V. Svergun D.I. New developments in the ATSAS program package for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2012; 45: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). SAXS analysis was performed using various programs of the ATSAS 2.6 package (30Petoukhov M.V. Franke D. Shkumatov A.V. Tria G. Kikhney A.G. Gajda M. Gorba C. Mertens H.D. Konarev P.V. Svergun D.I. New developments in the ATSAS program package for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2012; 45: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radius of gyration Rg were extracted from the Guinier approximation calculated with the AutoRG function within PRIMUS (31Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. PRIMUS: a Windows PC-based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). These parameters were also computed from the entire scattering patterns using the indirect transform package GNOM (32Svergun D.I. Determination of the regularization parameter in indirect-transform methods using perceptual criteria.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2948) Google Scholar), also providing the pair distribution function, P(r), of the particle and the maximum size Dmax. The molecular weight of the solute was evaluated by comparison of the forward scattering with that from a reference solution of bovine serum albumin (MWmonomer-dimer = 72; I(0)BSA = 1797.8). The molecular weight estimations were cross-validated using the particle excluded (Porod) volumes as previously described (30Petoukhov M.V. Franke D. Shkumatov A.V. Tria G. Kikhney A.G. Gajda M. Gorba C. Mertens H.D. Konarev P.V. Svergun D.I. New developments in the ATSAS program package for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2012; 45: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). SAXS data from dilute monodisperse solutions can be used to generate low resolution three-dimensional structures without any prior knowledge on the size and shape of the molecule. Such so-called ab initio reconstructions were generated with the program DAMMIF (34Franke D. Svergun D.I. DAMMIF, a program for rapid ab-initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2009; 42: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). However, as the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures from SAXS data is inherently ambiguous further post-processing is required to assess the uniqueness of the models and check the stability of the solution. For this purpose, 10 independent DAMMIF runs were superimposed onto each other by SUPCOMB (35Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. Automated matching of high- and low-resolution structural models.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The common structural features were determined using the program DAMAVER (36Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. Uniqueness of ab initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) to export a starting model for a final round of ab initio modeling by the program DAMMIN (37Svergun D.I. Restoring low resolution structure of biological macromolecules from solution scattering using simulated annealing.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). The theoretical scattering from the high resolution models of the Fab fragment of 679-14-E06 (PDB code 4ZD3) and TG2 with GTP (PDB code 4PYG) were calculated with the program CRYSOL (38Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. CRYSOL: a program to evaluate x-ray solution scattering of biological macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar) and compared with the respective scattering profiles. The x-ray structure of TG2 with GDP (PDB code 1KV3) misses electron density of some loops, which prevented further modeling. Therefore the x-ray structure of TG2 with GTP (PDB code 4PYG) was used. To improve the fit of the Fab fragment, missing portions were added with the program Coral (39Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. Global rigid body modeling of macromolecular complexes against small-angle scattering data.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1237-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The program Oligomer (31Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. PRIMUS: a Windows PC-based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar) was employed for a better description of the experimental scattering profile of TG2. As solution scattering is sensitive to changes in the quaternary structure of macromolecules, it is particularly useful for the analysis of complexes. For example, a hybrid approach as implemented in the program SASREF (39Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. Global rigid body modeling of macromolecular complexes against small-angle scattering data.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1237-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) allows for modeling of the complex using solely the known structures of the individual subunits (rigid body modeling). For this purpose the high resolution models of the Fab fragment (PDB code 4ZD3) and TG2-GTP (PDB code 4PYG) were used to perform rigid body modeling with SASREF (39Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I.

The genetic basis of this association is unclear. Our objective was to evaluate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with metabolic disorders are also associated with prostate volume (PV). Participants included 876 men referred for prostate biopsy and found to be prostate cancer free. PV was measured by transrectal ultrasound. Samples were genotyped using the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip platform. Multivariable adjusted linear regression models were used to evaluate SNPs (additive coding) in relation to natural-log transformed (log) PV. We compared SNP-PV results from biopsy-negative men to 442 men with low-grade prostate cancer with similar levels of obesity and PV. Beta-coefficients from the discovery and replication samples were then aggregated with fixed effects inverse variance weighted meta-analysis. SNP rs11736129 (near the pseudo-gene LOC100131429) was significantly associated with log-PV (beta: 0.16, p-value 1.16x10-8) after adjusting for multiple testing. Other noteworthy SNPs that were nominally associated (p-value < 1x10-4) with log-PV included rs9583484 (intronic SNP in COL4A2), rs10146527 (intronic SNP in NRXN3), rs9909466 (SNP near RPL32P31), and rs2241606 (synonymous SNP in SLC12A7).

PL2 is divided into two subfamilies that have been generally associated with secretion, Mg2+ dependence, and endolysis (subfamily 1) and with intracellular localization, Mn2+ dependence, and exolysis (subfamily 2). When present within a genome, PL2 genes are typically found as tandem copies, which suggests that they provide complementary activities at different stages along a catabolic cascade.

Ca2+ is an intracellular signaling molecule, and it is present at limiting levels in the cytoplasm of bacteria (0.1–2 μm) to prevent signaling interference and modification of subcellular structures (10Gangola P.

In contrast, the periplasm is believed to be a more heterogeneous metallo-environment because extracellular ions are free to passively diffuse across the outer membrane (12Ferguson A.D. Deisenhofer J. Metal import through microbial membranes.Cell. 2004; 116: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The β-helix PLs (PL1, PL3, and PL9), the largest group of PLs most commonly associated with phytopathogens and saprophytes, are secreted into the periplasm or extracellular environment. β-Helix PL families active on HG preferentially coordinate Ca2+ (13Garron M.L. Cygler M. Structural and mechanistic classification of uronic acid-containing polysaccharide lyases.Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 1547-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and appear to have evolved for colonization and modification of the plant cell wall. Ca2+ plays a crucial role in the maintenance of plant cell wall integrity, and its levels are high in this environment (10 μm to 10 mm) (14Hepler P.K. Winship L.J. Calcium at the cell wall-cytoplast interface.J. Integr. Plant Biol. 2010; 52: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Pectins are ubiquitous nutrients for environmental saprophytes, target substrates for macerating phytopathogens (e.g. soft rot), and components of dietary fibers that are digested by symbiotic microbes within the intestines of animals. Perhaps surprisingly, HG utilization and functional pectinases have also been reported for several human enteric pathogens, including Yersinia spp. (4Abbott D.W. Gilbert H.J. Boraston A.B.

Although the biological significance of pectinolysis within human pathogens is not clearly understood, several possible roles have been hypothesized, including environmental persistence, colonization of agricultural crops as vectors for transmission, and utilization of pectic nutrients within the intestine of an infected animal host (17Abbott D.W. Boraston A.B. Structural biology of pectin degradation by Enterobacteriaceae.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this light, the presence of a pectinolytic pathway, complete with transport machinery (KdgM-like porin and solute binding protein), polysaccharide lyases (PL2, PL9, and PL22), and a homologue of a unique HG-binding protein (CBM32) (18Abbott D.W. Hrynuik S. Boraston A.B. Identification and characterization of a novel periplasmic polygalacturonic acid binding protein from Yersinia enterolitica.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), has been identified within the genome of Vibrio vulnificus (Fig. 2A). V. vulnificus is a marine-borne bacterium most commonly associated with gastroenteritis caused by the consumption of contaminated seafood or septicemia resulting from wading in contaminated water with open wounds (19Oliver J.D. Vibrio vulnificus: death on the half shell: a personal journey with the pathogen and its ecology.Microb. Ecol. 2013; 65: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, pectin represents a nutrient niche that is not consistent with its lifestyle (20Rodionov D.A. Gelfand M.S. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Comparative genomics of the KdgR regulon in Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 and other γ-proteobacteria.Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3571-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This pathway is not strictly conserved within Vibrionaceae, and whether it represents a historical remnant of a pectinolytic ancestor of V. vulnificus or evolved by horizontal gene transfer in response to its coastal water-zoonotic infectious life cycle remains to be determined. Further insights into the evolutionary history of PL2s after the gene duplication event will help illuminate the adaptations required for metal-dependent activity and cellular specialization of pectin utilization, in addition to the biological significance of pectinolysis for various enteric pathogens. This study describes the structure and function of VvPL2, which is the first reported pectinase from V. vulnificus. Based upon its phylogenetic position within subfamily 2, VvPL2 represents a potential endolytic-exolytic transitional remnant. Additionally, we perform ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) of the PL2 family and resurrect progenitor PL2s to compare their activities with contemporary enzymes from subfamilies 1 and 2. We propose that ASR is an underexploited approach within the CAZyme field that will assist in streamlining the characterization of unknown enzyme activities and illuminating the evolutionary basis of substrate recognition and modification in other PL and CAZyme families. Synthesized codon-optimized VvPL2, DdPL2, and PaPL2B genes were subcloned in pET28 (BioBasic Inc., Mississauga, Canada), and YePL2A and YePL2B plasmids (3Abbott D.W. Boraston A.B.

Cells were grown at 37 °C with agitation at 180 rpm until cell density reached an A600 of ∼0.8. Cultures were cooled to 16 °C, agitation was reduced to 120 rpm, and genes were induced with a final concentration of 200 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Overnight cultures were centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 10 min. Cells were chemically lysed by resuspension in a solution of 8% (w/v) sucrose, 0.65% (v/v) deoxycholate, 0.65% (v/v) Triton X-100, 30 mm NaCl, 350 μg ml−1 lysozyme, 6 μg ml−1 DNase, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0. After lysis, lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 45 min. The clarified supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and applied to a gravity flow nickel affinity chromatography column and eluted with 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with a stepwise increase in imidazole concentration of 5, 10, 100, and 500 mm. Samples containing the protein of interest were concentrated with an Amicon ultrafiltration cell (EMD Millipore) and passed through a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR size exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Pure samples were pooled and concentrated. Two mutants were created by replacing residues 601–654 of YePL2A with 562–632 of YePL2B as described previously (48Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Engineering hybrid genes without the use of restriction enzymes: gene splicing by overlap extension.Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). Native YePL2A and YePL2B in pET28a were used as templates. 3′-Regions were grafted to 5′-regions in a secondary PCR, and full gene sequences were ligated into NheI and XhoI restriction enzyme cut sites in pET28a. Ligated transformants were sequenced. Enzymes were produced and purified as above. Optimal pH was determined by dialyzing samples of enzyme overnight into buffers: BisTris, pH 6.6–7.2; Tris, pH 7.1–9.0; CAPSO, pH 8.9–10.3; CAPS, pH 9.7–11.1; and CABS, pH 10.0–11.0. After equilibration, enzyme was incubated at 37 °C in 1 mg ml−1 HG, 50 mm buffer, and the reaction was monitored at 232 nm. Optimal temperature was determined by incubating samples of enzyme in water baths at temperatures ranging from 5 to 60 °C for 15 min. Enzyme was then added to 1 mg ml−1 HG, 20 mm CAPSO, pH 9.0, pre-equilibrated to temperature. Reactions were run for 3 min and monitored at 232 nm. Divalent metal cation preference was determined by dialyzing samples of enzyme into 2 mm EDTA in 20 mm CAPSO, pH 9.0, to remove divalent metal cations from solution. Fractions were then dialyzed into deionized water and incubated with 1 mg ml−1 HG, 50 mm CAPSO, pH 9.0, at 37 °C to ensure that activity had been ablated. Fractions were further dialyzed into solutions containing 1 mm CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2, NiCl2, or CuCl2, CAPSO, pH 9.0. After equilibration, samples were incubated in 1 mg ml−1 HG, 50 mm CAPSO, pH 9.0, and monitored at 232 nm. Time course experiments were performed to determine product profiles. Enzymes were incubated in 1 mg ml−1 HG, 50 mm CAPSO, pH 9.0, 1 mm MnCl2 at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by heating the samples to 95 °C for 10 min followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then resolved by thin layer chromatography with 1-butanol/distilled water/acetic acid (5:3:2, v/v/v) running buffer and visualized with 1% orcinol in a solution of ethanol sulfuric acid (70:3, v/v), followed by heating at 110 °C for 10 min. Samples were compared with samples of GalA (Sigma, catalog no. 48280), GalA2 (Sigma, catalog no. D4288), and GalA3 (Sigma, catalog no. T7407). PLs (100 nm to 1 μm) were incubated in increasing concentrations of HG and GalA3 with 50 mm CAPSO, pH 9.0, 1 mm MnCl2. Samples were monitored in real time at 232 nm, and product formation was determined using the extinction coefficient 5,200 m−1 cm−1. Data were analyzed, and kinetic values were determined using GraphPad Prism version 6. Crystals of VvPL2 were developed via the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at a protein concentration of 15 mg ml−1 by mixing 1.0 μl of the protein solution with an equal volume of mother liquor consisting of 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.14 m Na/K tartrate, and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0) at 19 °C. Crystals were cryoprotected by brief crystal immersion into reservoir solution supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol and subsequently frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream prior to diffraction experiments. VvPL2 crystallized in space group P65 with one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data for VvPL2 in complex with two molecules of tartrate were collected at the beamline SSRL 12-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. The data set was processed with XDS and scaled with Scala (21Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11288) Google Scholar).

In order to improve accuracy and confidence in targeting tumors, many centers rely on fiducial implantation. We evaluated the migration of a novel fiducial marker specifically designed for lung tissue implanted via electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB).We retrospectively quantified the individual and group migrations of SuperLock nitinol coil fiducials for 15 patients receiving lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), in order to evaluate the reliability of using these fiducials as a target surrogate for cases where tumors cannot be clearly delineated on cone beam CTs (CBCTs). For each fraction, we compared the individual and group migrations of the fiducials between the planning CT and the acquired CBCT. The group migration was defined as the distance between the centroids of the fiducial group and GTV.A total of 16 lung targets were included in our study for these 15 patients (one patient with two targets). Of 55 fiducials placed, we observed a 100% retention rate. The mean individual migration was 1.87 mm (range, 0.63-5.25 mm) with a standard deviation of 1.26 mm. The mean group migration was 1.94 mm (range, 0.03-6.19 mm) with a standard deviation of 1.45 mm. Overall, there was minimal change in the relative locations of the markers with respect to each other, as well as to the target.We found that the SuperLock nitinol coil fiducial marker positions are stable throughout the radiation treatment, and can be used as a reliable surrogate to target, and to avoid geometric misses during gated treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1556123286,"Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is a structure-specific nuclease responsible for removing 5′-flaps formed during Okazaki fragment maturation and long patch base excision repair. In this work, we use rapid quench flow techniques to examine the rates of 5′-flap removal on DNA substrates of varying length and sequence. Of particular interest are flaps containing trinucleotide repeats (TNR), which have been proposed to affect FEN1 activity and cause genetic instability. We report that FEN1 processes substrates containing flaps of 30 nucleotides or fewer at comparable single-turnover rates. However, for flaps longer than 30 nucleotides, FEN1 kinetically discriminates substrates based on flap length and flap sequence. In particular, FEN1 removes flaps containing TNR sequences at a rate slower than mixed sequence flaps of the same length. Furthermore, multiple-turnover kinetic analysis reveals that the rate-determining step of FEN1 switches as a function of flap length from product release to chemistry (or a step prior to chemistry). These results provide a kinetic perspective on the role of FEN1 in DNA replication and repair and contribute to our understanding of FEN1 in mediating genetic instability of TNR sequences."

In its C terminus, a tandem BRCA1 C-terminal domain binds phosphorylated histone H2AX, and in its N terminus, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain mediates a phosphorylation-enhanced homodimerization. The FHA domain of the Drosophila homolog of MDC1, MU2, also forms a homodimer but utilizes a different dimer interface. The functional importance of the dimerization of MDC1 family proteins is uncertain. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a protein sharing homology with MDC1 in the tandem BRCA1 C-terminal domain, Mdb1, regulates DNA damage response and mitotic spindle functions. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal 91 amino acids of Mdb1. Despite a lack of obvious sequence conservation to the FHA domain of MDC1, this region of Mdb1 adopts an FHA-like fold and is therefore termed Mdb1-FHA. Unlike canonical FHA domains, Mdb1-FHA lacks all the conserved phospho-binding residues. It forms a stable homodimer through an interface distinct from those of MDC1 and MU2. Mdb1-FHA is important for the localization of Mdb1 to DNA damage sites and the spindle midzone, contributes to the roles of Mdb1 in cellular responses to genotoxins and an antimicrotubule drug, and promotes in vitro binding of Mdb1 to a phospho-H2A peptide. The defects caused by the loss of Mdb1-FHA can be rescued by fusion with either of two heterologous dimerization domains, suggesting that the main function of Mdb1-FHA is mediating dimerization.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we report the identification of IL-13Rα1, a component of the IL-13 receptor (IL-13R), as a novel ligand of integrin Mac-1, using a co-evolution-based algorithm. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that recombinant IL-13Rα1 binds Mac-1 in a purified system and supports Mac-1-mediated cell adhesion. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that endogenous Mac-1 forms a complex with IL-13Rα1 in solution, and confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that these two receptors co-localize with each other on the surface of macrophages. Moreover, we found that genetic inactivation of Mac-1 promotes IL-13-induced JAK/STAT activation in macrophages, resulting in enhanced polarization along the alternative activation pathway. Importantly, we observed that Mac-1−/− macrophages exhibit increased expression of foam cell differentiation markers including 15-lipoxygenase and lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor-1 both in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, we found that Mac-1−/−LDLR−/− mice develop significantly more foam cells than control LDLR−/− mice, using an in vivo model of foam cell formation. Together, our data establish for the first time a molecular mechanism by which Mac-1 regulates the signaling activity of IL-13 in macrophages.

Macrophages can polarize along two distinct pathways: stimulation with IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharide generates the classically activated macrophages (also known as M1) that exhibit proinflammatory activities, whereas stimulation with IL-4 or IL-13 generates the alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs or M2) that possess anti-inflammatory properties (8Gordon S.

However, the molecular mechanism by which Mac-1 inhibits IL-13-induced JAK/STAT activation in macrophages is unknown. In this work, we identified IL-13Rα1, a subunit of the heterodimeric IL-13R, as a novel biological partner of Mac-1, using an unbiased co-evolution-based algorithm. Subsequently, we confirmed direct binding between these two receptors using purified full-length Mac-1 and recombinant IL-13Rα1. We also showed by co-immunoprecipitation that endogenous Mac-1 and IL-13Rα1 form a complex in solution and showed by confocal fluorescence microscopy that they reside in proximity on the cell surface. Biologically, we found that genetic inactivation of Mac-1 enhances IL-13-induced JAK/STAT activation in macrophages and promotes their polarization. Furthermore, we found that the absence of Mac-1 on macrophages increases their expression of foam cell differentiation markers. Using an LDLR−/− mouse model of foam cell formation, our data revealed that Mac-1−/− mice develop significantly more foam cells in vivo. Together, our study established for the first time a molecular mechanism by which Mac-1 suppresses IL-13-induced macrophage activation and foam cell transformation. Thus, this newly identified IL-13Rα1/Mac-1 interaction could represent a potential target for therapeutical intervention that will not interfere with IL-13R-medaited immunity or Mac-1-dependent host defense functions. WT, Mac-1−/−, LDLR−/−, and Mac-1−/−LDLR−/− mice were all in the C57BL/6J background and used at 8–13 weeks of age (20–22 g). WT and LDLR−/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mac-1−/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. Christie M. Ballantyne, Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX) and have been backcrossed to the C57BL/6J background for more than 10 generations. All mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility, and all procedures were performed in accordance with University of Maryland Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval. mAb M1/70 for Mac-1 was from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Function-blocking mAb 38 for LFA-1 was from Fisher Scientific. Rabbit anti-IL-13R1α and rabbit anti-β-actin were from Sigma. Rabbit anti-15-LO and rabbit anti-STAT6 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas). Rabbit anti-LOX-1 was from GeneTex (Irvine, CA). Rabbit anti-CD18 cytoplasmic domain ARC22 was prepared as described (15Xiong Y.M. Chen J. Zhang L. Modulation of CD11b/CD18 adhesive activity by its extracellular, membrane-proximal regions.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-phosphorylated STAT6 (Tyr-641) antibody was from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). All protein sequences for the complete genomes of 184 species were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez database (16Maglott D. Ostell J. Pruitt K.D. Tatusova T. Entrez Gene: gene-centered information at NCBI.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D52-D57Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The set of species contained 130 eukaryotes, 47 prokaryotes, and seven archaea. All sequences for the 184 species were updated on June 2011. Orthologous proteins were identified for each protein in each of the genomes by performing reciprocal BLAST searches (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59740) Google Scholar) against all genomes. For each species, the protein with the smallest average E-value (average of the forward and reciprocal E-values), with E-value <1 × 10−40 and the largest sequence overlap with at least 80% alignment overlap, was selected as the ortholog of protein P for that species. Multiple sequence alignments for each protein within the pairs of interacting and non-interacting proteins and their corresponding orthologs were obtained using MUSCLE version 3.52 (18Edgar R.C. MUSCLE: a multiple sequence alignment method with reduced time and space complexity.BMC. Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (5909) Google Scholar). From these multiple sequence alignments, the distance matrices for each protein set were estimated using the ClustalW suite with default parameters (19Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. CLUSTAL W: improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55621) Google Scholar). For each protein pair from the interacting and non-interacting sets, the correspondence between their evolutionary histories was measured by computing the correlation between the distance matrices of each protein (the Mirrortree approach) (20Pazos F. Valencia A. Similarity of phylogenetic trees as indicator of protein-protein interaction.Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). For two proteins A and B with n species in common (where n ≥9), let us denote Ai,j as the distance between species i and j for protein A; and Bi,j for protein B. The linear correlation coefficient (corr. coef. or CCAB) between their distance vectors was calculated using the standard Pearson's corr. coef.CCAB=∑i=1n=1(Ai,j−A¯)×(Bi,j−B¯)∑i=1n=1∑j=i+1n(Ai,j−A¯)2×∑i=1n=1∑j=i+1n(Bi,j−B¯)2(Eq. 1) where Ā and B̄ are the means of Ai,j and Bi,j respectively. As shown by Pazos et al. (21Pazos F. Ranea J.A. Juan D. Sternberg M.J. Assessing protein co-evolution in the context of the tree of life assists in the prediction of the interactome.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1002-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Sato et al. (22Sato T. Yamanishi Y. Kanehisa M. Toh H. The inference of protein-protein interactions by co-evolutionary analysis is improved by excluding the information about the phylogenetic relationships.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), prediction of protein interactions using co-evolutionary analysis is greatly improved by excluding the background co-evolutionary signal from phylogenetic relationships (signal from speciation). The signal from speciation for species i and j, represented by matrix Si,j, was computed by averaging the evolutionary distance matrices of all proteins in species i with their orthologs in species j. To estimate the corr. coef. with this correction, the distance matrices Ai,j and Bi,j in Eq. 1 were replaced by A′i,j and B′i,j where A′i,j = Ai,j − Si,j and B′i,j = Bi,j − Si,j. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4% thioglycollate. Four days later, peritoneal macrophages were collected by lavages with PBS. After lysis of red blood cells with ammonium chloride (8.3 g/liter in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), peritoneal cells were plated on 10-cm tissue culture Petri dishes in 10% FBS in DMEM and incubated in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 2–4 h. Adherent macrophages were collected, and their purity was verified by flow cytometry based on positive staining for F4/80 and M1/70 and by morphological examination of Hema 3 (Fisher Scientific)-stained smears prepared with a Cytospin (Shandon). Peritoneal macrophages were treated with or without 4 nm IL-13 for various times, ranging from 5 min to 3 days. STAT6 activation was assessed by Western blot using phospho-STAT6-specific antibody. Total STAT6 protein and β-actin were used as loading controls. Macrophage polarization along the alternative activation pathway was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) based on expression of specific markers, including Arginase-1, FIZZ1, YM1, and YM2. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from peritoneal macrophages using the Absolutely RNA miniprep kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript II and random hexamers (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7500 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems), using specific primer pairs (Table 1). The PCR reaction was done in a 25-μl solution containing 12.5 μl of SYBR® Green PCR master mix, 10 ng of cDNA, and 400 nm of each primer, with the following settings: activation of the AmpliTaq Gold® polymerase at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The melting curve was analyzed using the ABI software, and quantification of gene expression was done based on the 2−ΔΔCt method (RQ Manager 1.4). Each experiment was run in duplicates. All data were normalized to β-actin expression in the same cDNA set.TABLE 1Primers used for qRT-PCRβ-ActinNM_007393Forward (5′ to 3′)AGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGTReverse (5′ to 3′)TGCTAGGAGCCAGAGCAGTAYM-1NM_009892Forward (5′ to 3′)TCTATGCCTTTGCTGGAATGReverse (5′ to 3′)CAGGTCCAAACTTCCATCCTYM-2NM_145126Forward (5′ to 3′)CCTTTGCTGGGATGAAGAATReverse (5′ to 3′)CCAAACTTCCATCCTCCAATFIZZ1NM_020509Forward (5′ to 3′)AGGAACTTCTTGCCAATCCAReverse (5′ to 3′)ACAAGCACACCCAGTAGCAGArginase-1NM_007482Forward (5′ to 3′)ACAACCAGCTCTGGGAATCTReverse (5′ to 3′)TGTACACGATGTCTTTGGCALox-1NM_138648Forward (5′ to 3′)TGACTCTGGTCATCCTCTGCReverse (5′ to 3′)TGCTGAGTAAGGTTCGCTTG15-LONM_009660Forward (5′ to 3′)TGGTTCTGCAACTGGATTTCReverse (5′ to 3′)GGCCTTGAGAGTCTTCAACCIL-6NM_031168Forward (5′ to 3′)CTCTGGGAAATCGTGGAAATReverse (5′ to 3′)CCAGTTTGGTAGCATCCATC Open table in a new tab Binding of recombinant IL-13Rα1 to purified full-length Mac-1 was carried out in 96-well microtiter plates.

The purity of Mac-1 was verified by SDS-PAGE and by its ability to bind conformation-dependent mAbs (data not shown). Fifty microliters of 10 μg/ml purified Mac-1 in 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, were used to coat the wells of 96-well microplates at 4 °C overnight. The plate was washed and blocked with 1% BSA. Recombinant mouse IL-13Rα1, which contains a histidine tag at its C terminus (Leinco Technologies Inc.), was added at different concentrations (0–2 μm) in the above buffer plus 0.1% BSA. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the plate was washed, and bound IL-13Rα1 was detected using HisProbe-HRP (Thermo Scientific) with its substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, measuring absorbance at 450 nm. The binding curve was fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation based on a single binding site model using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). Cell adhesion was conducted based on our published methods (23Zhang L. Plow E.F.

After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, non-adherent cells were removed by three washes with Dulbecco's PBS and adherent cells were stained with Crystal Violet. Cell adhesion was quantified based on absorption at 595 nm. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted based on our published methods (26Cao C. Lawrence D.A. Li Y. von Arnim C.A. Herz J.

WT peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with IL-13, washed, and then lysed. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using a rabbit anti-IL-13Rα1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with anti-CD18 antibody ARC22 (15Xiong Y.M.

Peritoneal macrophages were seeded on multi-coverslips overnight. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 30 min, these cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml rabbit anti-IL-13Rα1 antibody and 20 μg/ml rat anti-Mac-1 mAb (M1/70) in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 60 min. After washing, these different coverslips were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes). Non-immune rabbit and rat IgGs were used as specificity controls. The stained macrophages were analyzed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope system equipped with a Nikon Eclipse E800 upright light microscope. The images were collected using 100× oil objectives with a slice thickness of 2.6 μm. The formation of foam cells in vivo was investigated based on published methods (27Li A.C. Binder C.J.

Briefly, Mac-1−/−LDLR−/− mice and their LDLR−/− littermates were fed a high fat “Western” diet (21% fat and 0.2% cholesterol) for 5 weeks. Peritoneal macrophages were prepared from these mice by intraperitoneal injection of 4% thioglycollate, followed by peritoneal lavage 4 days later. Foam cells within the collected peritoneal cells were identified by staining the fat droplets within the cytosol with Oil Red O following centrifuging in the Cytospin. To quantify the amount of cholesterol accumulated within these foam cells, peritoneal cells were pelleted at 1000 rpm for 7 min, extracted in 500 μl of isopropanol by sonication (2 × 10 s), and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was used to determine the amount of total protein by Bio-Rad protein assay. The supernatant was assayed for cholesterol using Amplex Red kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Free cholesterol was determined by omitting the cholesterol esterase. Total cholesterol was determined in the presence of the cholesterol esterase. Cholesterol esters were calculated from the difference in total and free cholesterol. Data are plotted as mg of cholesterol per mg of protein. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Student's t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

To identify potential biological partners that confer the inhibitory activity of Mac-1 toward IL-13-induced macrophage activation, we used an unbiased informatics-based method, termed Mirrortree (28Pazos F.

https://openalex.org/W775331447,"Spatial navigation and planning is assumed to involve a cognitive map for evaluating trajectories towards a goal. How such a map is realized in neuronal terms, however, remains elusive. Here we describe a simple and noise-robust neuronal implementation of a path finding algorithm in complex environments. We consider a neuronal map of the environment that supports a traveling wave spreading out from the goal location opposite to direction of the physical movement. At each position of the map, the smallest firing phase between adjacent neurons indicate the shortest direction towards the goal. In contrast to diffusion or single-wave-fronts, local phase differences build up in time at arbitrary distances from the goal, providing a minimal and robust directional information throughout the map. The time needed to reach the steady state represents an estimate of an agent's waiting time before it heads off to the goal. Given typical waiting times we estimate the minimal number of neurons involved in the cognitive map. In the context of the planning model, forward and backward spread of neuronal activity, oscillatory waves, and phase precession get a functional interpretation, allowing for speculations about the biological counterpart."
https://openalex.org/W1586444285,"Complex decision making tasks of different natures, e.g. economics, safety engineering, ecology and biology, are based on vague, sparse, partially inconsistent and subjective knowledge. Moreover, decision making economists / engineers are usually not willing to invest too much time into study of complex formal theories. They require such decisions which can be (re)checked by human like common sense reasoning. One important problem related to realistic decision making tasks are incomplete data sets required by the chosen decision making algorithm. This paper presents a relatively simple algorithm how some missing III (input information items) can be generated using mainly decision tree topologies and integrated into incomplete data sets. The algorithm is based on an easy to understand heuristics, e.g. a longer decision tree sub-path is less probable. This heuristic can solve decision problems under total ignorance, i.e. the decision tree topology is the only information available. But in a practice, isolated information items e.g. some vaguely known probabilities (e.g. fuzzy probabilities) are usually available. It means that a realistic problem is analysed under partial ignorance. The proposed algorithm reconciles topology related heuristics and additional fuzzy sets using fuzzy linear programming. The case study, represented by a tree with six lotteries and one fuzzy probability, is presented in details."
https://openalex.org/W1922540675,"For many decades, economists dismissed culture as irrelevant to most questions in economic growth. However, in the past decade they have rediscovered its importance in the emergence of the Great Enrichment (the rapid and unprecedented process of economic growth since 1850) (1–3). In retrospect, this development seems inevitable. Once it was accepted that institutions are a powerful factor in explaining differences in national per-capita income today (4), culture—in the sense of the beliefs and values on which institutions were founded—could not be far behind. In a recent paper, Squicciarini and Voigtländer (5) provide further support for this idea by showing how culture affected the rise of the modern economy."
https://openalex.org/W798944014,"There is great need to express the impacts of chemicals found in the environment in terms of effects from alternative chemicals of interest. Methods currently employed in fields such as life-cycle assessment, risk assessment, mixtures toxicology, and pharmacology rely mostly on heuristic arguments to justify the use of linear relationships in the construction of ""equivalency factors,"" which aim to model these concentration-concentration correlations. However, the use of linear models, even at low concentrations, oversimplifies the nonlinear nature of the concentration-response curve, therefore introducing error into calculations involving these factors. We address this problem by reporting a method to determine a concentration-concentration relationship between two chemicals based on the full extent of experimentally derived concentration-response curves. Although this method can be easily generalized, we develop and illustrate it from the perspective of toxicology, in which we provide equations relating the sigmoid and non-monotone, or ""biphasic,"" responses typical of the field. The resulting concentration-concentration relationships are manifestly nonlinear for nearly any chemical level, even at the very low concentrations common to environmental measurements. We demonstrate the method using real-world examples of toxicological data which may exhibit sigmoid and biphasic mortality curves. Finally, we use our models to calculate equivalency factors, and show that traditional results are recovered only when the concentration-response curves are ""parallel,"" which has been noted before, but we make formal here by providing mathematical conditions on the validity of this approach."
https://openalex.org/W761681208,"Technology advances have immensely accelerated large-scale mapping of biological networks, which necessitates the development of accurate and powerful network-based algorithms to make functional inferences. A prevailing approach is to leverage functions of neighboring nodes to predict unknown molecular function. However, existing neighbor-based algorithms have ignored the scale-free property hidden in many biological networks. By assuming that neighbor sharing is constrained by the preferential attachment property, we developed a Preferential Attachment based common Neighbor Distribution (PAND) to calculate the probability of the neighbor-sharing event between any two nodes in scale-free networks, which nearly perfectly matched the observed probability in simulations. By applying PAND to a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we showed that smaller probabilities represented closer functional linkages between proteins. With the PAND-derive linkages, we were able to build new networks where the links are more functionally reliable than those of the human PPI network. We then applied simple annotation schemes to a PAND-derived network to make reliable functional predictions for proteins. We also developed an R package called PANDA (PAND-derived functional Associations) to implement the methods proposed in this study. In conclusion, PAND is a useful distribution to calculate the probability of the neighbor-sharing events in scale-free networks. With PAND, we are able to extract reliable functional linkages from real biological networks and builds new networks that are better bases for further functional inference."
