https://openalex.org/W2043101617,"I propose the theory that agriculture originated independently in three different areas and that, in each case, there was a system composed of a center of origin and a noncenter, in which activities of domestication were dispersed over a span of 5,000 to 10,000 kilometers. One system includes a definable Near East center and a noncenter in Africa; another system includes a North Chinese center and a noncenter in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific; the third system includes a Mesoamerican center and a South American noncenter. There are suggestions that, in each case, the center and noncenter interact with each other. Crops did not necessarily originate in centers (in any conventional concept of the term), nor did agriculture necessarily develop in a geographical ""center."""
https://openalex.org/W2073767043,"The existence of synthetic macrocyclic molecules with hydrophilic cavities containing multiple binding atoms and with hydrophobic exteriors gives rise to extraordinary possibilities with respect to the design and synthesis of molecules with specific cation and anion binding properties. The preparation of many new macrocyclic compounds has recently been reported, but few practical applications for them have been suggested. From the information available, it is becoming clear that it should be possible to synthesize macrocycles that will have specified, or selected, ion binding properties. Cavity size can be varied to accommodate only those cations or anions within a specified narrow band of sizes. Numbers and types of coordinating atoms can be chosen to give essentially electrostatic or covalent bonding or a combination of the two in a metalmacrocycle complex. The metal ligand bond appears to be predominantly ionic in the case of the cyclic polyethers but the covalent character increases on substitution of sulfur or nitrogen for oxygen donor atoms. The essential hydrophobic exteriors of the macrocycles can be modified by the addition of side chains and groups to facilitate the solution of anions and cations in organic solvents. The structures of many macrocycles can be made to approximate naturally occurring molecules, that is, cyclic polyethers similar to macrocyclic antibiotics of the valinomycin and nonactin types and cyclic polyamines similar to porphyrins. Macrocycles are also useful as model compounds for the study of metal interactions with biological systems. The synthetic macrocycles thus represent an intriguing new area of coordination chemistry, the systematic study of which should lead to many interesting and useful chemical applications in the field of metal complexation in solution."

The equation of proportionality is 1/eta = B[(V - V(0))/V(0)] where eta is the viscosity and V is the molal volume. Values of B are the same for normal paraffins from C(3)H(8) to C(7)H(16) and then decrease progressively as the paraffin lengths increase. Values for other liquids, C(6)H(6), CCl(4), P(4), CS(2), CHCl(3), and Hg, appear to vary with repulsive forces. liquids can be moderately fluid when expanded by less than 10 percent; this shows the unreality of some theoretical treatments of the liquid state. Diffusivity begins from the temperature at which V equals V(0) and can be correlated for temperature dependence, and for solute-solvent interrelations."

Results from that survey show a north-south ridgelike feature and favor the theory that Madagascar fitted against Somalia rather than against Mozambique to the west.

https://openalex.org/W2083420266,"One of the important technological concepts that was developed in the Hawaiian Islands is that of the fishpond. From the 14th to the 19th centuries, these sites served as aquariums for the raising of selected fish. From its inception until the 1900's, the fishpond progressed little in design and function. Its rudimentary nature was a function of both technology and religion. Because of the open ditches, sluice grates, and permeable walls, neither the types nor the quantity of juvenile fish entering or leaving could be controlled. In addition, religious beliefs prevented experimenting with fertilization to increase yield. Although seemingly inefficient, the native aquacultural system was not intended to produce a great amount of fish but rather to yield selected fish on call. Fishponds became symbols of the chiefly right to conspicuous consumption and to ownership of the land and its resources. They were manifestations of the chief's political power and his ability to control and tap his resources. As soon as the native aristocracy changed to a Western-style kingdom, the fishpond's function changed, until, by the 1930's, the majority were simply archeological remainsâ€”mounds and walls of rock along a river or shore."

https://openalex.org/W2050693246,"A high-efficiency power cycle is proposed in which molecular hydrogen gas is used as a working fluid in a regenerative closed Brayton cycle. The hydrogen gas is compressed by an absorption-desorption cycle on metal hydride (FeTiH(x)) beds. Low-temperature solar or geothermal heat (temperature about 100 degrees C) is used for the compression process, and high-temperature fossil fuel or nuclear heat (temperature about 700 degrees C) supplies the expansion work in the turbine. Typically, about 90 percent of the high-temperature heat input is converted to electricity, while about 3 kilowatts of low-temperature heat is required per kilowatt of electrical output."

https://openalex.org/W2110930088,"In the field of nuclear dynamics a central theme has been the struggle to find the proper place for the complementary concepts referring to the independent motion of the individual nucleons and the collective behaviour of the nuccleus as a whole. This development has been a continuing process involving the interplay of ideas and discoveries relating to all different aspects of nuclear phenomena. The multi-dimensionality of this development makes it tempting to go directly to a description of our present understanding and to the problems and perspectives as they appear today. However, an attempt to follow the evolution of some of the principal ideas may be instructive in illustrating the struggle for understanding of many-body systems, which have continued to inspire the development of fundamental new concepts, even in cases where the basic equations of motion are well established. Concepts appropriate for describing the wealth of nuclear phenomena have been derived from a combination of many different approaches, including the exploration of general relations following from considerations of symmetry, the study of model systems, sometimes of a grossly oversimplified nature, and, of course, the clues provided by the experimental discoveries which have again and again given the development entirely new directions."

https://openalex.org/W4236993467,"A major turnabout in the attitude of the Atomic Energy Commission toward the nuclear power industry was signaled last week by the ntew AEC chairman James R. Schlesinger. With patrician froideur, Schlesinger informed a mass gathering of the nuclear power industry at Bal Harbour, Florida, that from henceforth the AEC woLuld act as the referee of nuclear power, not its promoter. Saying he would dispense with the ""anecdotes and clumsy jests"" customary on such occasions, Schlesinger served notice on the nuclear banqueters that their cozy relationship with the AEC was at an end. The industry should not expect the AEC to fight its battles: it should take its own case to the public-as the Sierra Club does. Nor did the AEC intend to bend the rules in industry's favor. ""We have had a fair amount of advice on how to evade the clear mandate of the federal courts. It is advice we did not think proper to accept,"" Schlesinger said. Even on matters of engineering quality, the diners were told they knew full well they had ""reason to blush."" Roused out of any postprandial euphoria by this glacial disdain, the industry representatives heard the new chairman announce the following radical upheavals in official AEC philosophy."

Jaeger (9 July, p. 94, column 3, paragraph 3, line 9), the airborne Kepone concentration in the Life Science Products plant measured by state of Virginia officials in July 1975 was erroneously given as 3 mg/cm(3). The correct concentration was 3 mg/m(3). A portion of a sentence in the preceding paragraph was also erroneously omitted (line 14).
