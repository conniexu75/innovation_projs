https://openalex.org/W1755902553,"Staurosporine is the most potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) described in the literature with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10 nM. Nevertheless, this natural product is poorly selective when assayed against other protein kinases. In order to obtain specific PKC inhibitors, a series of bisindolylmaleimides has been synthesized. Structure-activity relationship studies allowed the determination of the substructure responsible for conferring high potency and lack of selectivity in the staurosporine molecule. Several aminoalkyl bisindolylmaleimides were found to be potent and selective PKC inhibitors (IC50 values from 5 to 70 nM). Among these compounds GF 109203X has been chosen for further studies aiming at the characterization of this chemical family. GF 109203X was a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP (Ki = 14 +/- 3 NM) and displayed high selectivity for PKC as compared to five different protein kinases. We further determined the potency and specificity of GF 109203X in two cellular models: human platelets and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. GF 109203X efficiently prevented PKC-mediated phosphorylations of an Mr = 47,000 protein in platelets and of an Mr = 80,000 protein in Swiss 3T3 cells. In contrast, in the same models, the PKC inhibitor failed to prevent PKC-independent phosphorylations. GF 109203X inhibited collagen- and alpha-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation as well as collagen-triggered ATP secretion. However, ADP-dependent reversible aggregation was not modified. In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, GF 109203X reversed the inhibition of epidermal growth factor binding induced by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate and prevented [3H] thymidine incorporation into DNA, only when this was elicited by growth promoting agents which activate PKC. Our results illustrate the potential of GF 109203X as a tool for studying the involvement of PKC in signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2020716464,"The high-resolution three-dimensional structure of a single immunoglobulin binding domain (B1, which comprises 56 residues including the NH2-terminal Met) of protein G from group G Streptococcus has been determined in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on the basis of 1058 experimental restraints. The average atomic root-mean-square distribution about the mean coordinate positions is 0.27 angstrom (A) for the backbone atoms, 0.65 A for all atoms, and 0.39 A for atoms excluding disordered surface side chains. The structure has no disulfide bridges and is composed of a four-stranded beta sheet, on top of which lies a long helix. The central two strands (beta 1 and beta 4), comprising the NH2- and COOH-termini, are parallel, and the outer two strands (beta 2 and beta 3) are connected by the helix in a +3x crossover. This novel topology (-1, +3x, -1), coupled with an extensive hydrogen-bonding network and a tightly packed and buried hydrophobic core, is probably responsible for the extreme thermal stability of this small domain (reversible melting at 87 degrees C)."
https://openalex.org/W2143546229,"We have purified and characterized the growth inhibitory factor (GIF) that is abundant in the normal human brain, but greatly reduced in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. GIF inhibited survival and neurite formation of cortical neurons in vitro. Purified GIF is a 68 amino acid small protein, and its amino acid sequence is 70% identical to that of human metallothionein II with a 1 amino acid insert and a unique 6 amino acid insert in the NH2-terminal and the COOH-terminal portions, respectively. The antibodies to the unique sequence of GIF revealed a distinct subset of astrocytes in the gray matter that appears to be closely associated with neuronal perikarya and dendrites. In the AD cortex, the number of GIF-positive astrocytes was drastically reduced, suggesting that GIF is down-regulated in the subset of astrocytes during AD."
https://openalex.org/W1481629090,"By using antibodies raised against a portion of N terminus of 40-kDa kinase (Kobayashi, T., Nakamura, S., Taniguchi, T., and Yamamura, H. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 188, 535-540), not only 40-kDa protein but also 72-kDa protein were detected on immunoblot analysis of porcine spleen homogenate. In splenocytes preparation, the antibodies could immunoprecipitate protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the 72-kDa protein but not detect the 40-kDa protein even on immunoblot. After incubation of crude spleen homogenate at 37 degrees C with or without various protease inhibitors, immunoblot analysis revealed proteolytic breakdown of the 72-kDa protein to 40-kDa fragment. Next, using oligonucleotides designed according to partially sequenced information of the 40-kDa kinase as a probe, we have isolated a clone containing entire coding sequence for the 40-kDa kinase from a porcine spleen cDNA library. This clone had a 1884-base-pair-long open reading frame encoding 628-amino-acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 71,618. The deduced amino acid sequence did not contain a ligand binding or membrane spanning region but did a well-conserved protein-tyrosine kinase domain and two src homology region 2 domains. The sequences of these domains showed 30-40% identity to those of other protein-tyrosine kinases, but those of remaining parts were quite unique. From these results, we concluded that the 40-kDa kinase was generated by proteolysis from the 72-kDa holoprotein which was a new member of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase so far reported. We therefore designated this gene as syk after spleen tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1542114385,"Data generated in the new National Cancer Institute drug evaluation program, which is based on inhibition of cell growth in 60 human tumor cell lines, were used to compare new compounds with agents of known mechanism of action in terms of their differential cytotoxicity. Two marine natural products, halichondrin B and homohalichondrin B, appeared repeatedly when the data base was probed with known antimitotic agents. We confirmed that both compounds were highly cytotoxic (IC50 values for L1210 murine leukemia cells of 0.3 and 1 nM, respectively), with accumulation of cells arrested in mitosis at toxic concentrations, that both inhibited the polymerization of purified tubulin, and that both inhibited microtubule assembly dependent on microtubule-associated proteins. Limited amounts of homohalichondrin B, the less active agent, were available, so only halichondrin B was studied in detail. Halichondrin B did not interfere with colchicine binding to tubulin, but it was a noncompetitive inhibitor of the binding of vinblastine to tubulin (apparent Ki, 5.0 microM). Halichondrin B was therefore compared with other agents which interfere with the binding of vinca alkaloids to tubulin (vinblastine, maytansine, dolastatin 10, phomopsin A, rhizoxin) in terms of its effects on tubulin polymerization, inhibition of GTP hydrolysis, inhibition of nucleotide exchange, and stabilization of tubulin, as well as the quantitative assessment of its effects on vinca alkaloid binding and inhibition of cell growth. Since halichondrin B was originally isolated from the same organism as the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, and since it is about 50-fold more effective than okadaic acid as an inhibitor of L1210 cell growth, perturbations of cellular microtubules observed following treatment with okadaic acid should be interpreted cautiously."
https://openalex.org/W2047371948,"mRNA coding for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been detected in cultured L929 fibroblasts, rat dermal fibroblasts, and sciatic nerve Schwann cells, as well as in rat skin. Medium conditioned by cultured fibroblasts and Schwann cells also stimulates neurite growth from retinal explants and promotes the survival in culture of BDNF-responsive sensory neurons; biological activity is abolished by antibodies raised against NGF. These results suggest that molecules with BDNF-like activity may be produced by cells in the peripheral nervous system and that the BDNF-like activity in fibroblasts and Schwann cells is derived from molecules immunologically related to NGF. In support of this concept, antibodies against NGF have been found to reduce the biological activity of recombinant BDNF in culture and to cross-react with BDNF on Western blots."
https://openalex.org/W1559922603,"The oligomeric state of human Band 3 (Mr = 95,000), the erythrocyte membrane anion exchanger, was examined by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography in solutions containing the nonionic detergent C12E8 (octaethylene glycol n-dodecyl monoether). Band 3 was heterogeneous with respect to oligomeric composition, the predominant (70%) species being a dimer that bound 0.57 mg of C12E8/mg of protein (Stokes radius = 78 A, s20,w = 6.9 S). Variable amounts of larger oligomers were also present; however, no evidence for equilibration between oligomeric species was observed in detergent solution. Analytical and large zone size exclusion chromatography showed that Band 3 could not be dissociated to monomers, other than by protein denaturation. The membrane domain of Band 3 (Mr = 52,000) was also dimeric, but without evidence for higher oligomeric forms, which implies that the interactions responsible for higher associations involve the cytoplasmic domain. Prelabeling of Band 3 with the anion exchange inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate had no effect upon the oligomeric state of either intact Band 3 or its 52-kDa membrane domain. Band 3 oligomeric state could be reversibly changed in the membrane by altering the pH of the solution. The fraction of Band 3 not associated with the cytoskeleton was almost entirely dimeric. Band 3 purified from erythrocytes separated by density gradient centrifugation revealed that older red cells contained a larger proportion of higher oligomers than did younger cells. We conclude that Band 3, in the membrane and in C12E8 solution, exists as a mixture of dimers and larger oligomers. The higher oligomers interact with the cytoskeleton, increase in amount with cell age, and are held together by interactions of the cytoplasmic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1521696202,"Erythropoietin gene expression is greatly stimulated under conditions of hypoxia. The activation of the erythropoietin gene appears regulated primarily at the level of gene transcription. To study cis-acting elements involved in the response to hypoxia a mini-gene was constructed by an internal deletion from exon II to V of the human erythropoietin gene and used in transient transfection assays in the erythropoietin producing Hep 3B cell line. It was initially found that hypoxia responsiveness was present in an erythropoietin fragment containing 400 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking and 600 bp of 3'-flanking regions. Deletion analysis showed no significant effect on the response to hypoxia when highly conserved regions of 5'-flanking sequence, exon and intron I, and exon V were removed from the mini-gene construct. However, removal of a fragment containing the 3' end of the gene and 3'-flanking sequences completely eliminated hypoxia responsiveness. Reinsertion of the above fragment upstream of the 5' end of the mini-gene restored the response to hypoxia. Further analysis using hybrid erythropoietin-chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase constructs allowed the localization of enhancer-like element(s) in the 3'-flanking region, approximately 120 bp downstream of the polyadenylation site of the human erythropoietin gene. Activation by these sequences were position- and orientation-independent and stimulated 15-fold transcription of the erythropoietin gene in response to hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W1970445733,"We have identified a 95 kd cell surface protein, DM-GRASP, that is expressed on a restricted population of axons. Its expression begins early in chick embryogenesis, and within the spinal cord it is localized to axons in the dorsal funiculus, midline floorplate cells, and motoneurons. Antibodies to DM-GRASP impair neurite extension on axons, and purified DM-GRASP supports neurite extension from chick sensory neurons. We have cloned and sequenced the cDNA corresponding to this protein and find that it is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of adhesion molecules. Consequently we have named this protein DM-GRASP, since it is an immunoglobulin-like restricted axonal surface protein that is expressed in the dorsal funiculus and ventral midline of the chick spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2025093063,"The neurological mutant mouse strain E1 is a model for complex partial seizures in humans. The inheritance of epileptic seizures with seven conventional chromosomal markers and over 60 endogenous proviral markers was studied by means of back-crosses of E1 with two seizure-resistant strains, DBA/2J and ABP/LeJ. The major gene responsible for this epileptic phenotype (El-1) was localized to a region distal with respect to the centromere on chromosome 9. At least one other gene, El-2, linked to proviral markers on chromosome 2, also influences the seizure phenotype. In addition, a potential modifier of seizures was detected in the DBA/2J background. The location of El-1 on distal chromosome 9 may allow identification of an epilepsy candidate gene in humans on the basis of conserved synteny with human chromosome 3."
https://openalex.org/W2050561071,"We examined the possibility that Ca2+ released from intracellular stores could activate K+ currents underlying the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in neurons. In neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the current underlying the AHP had two components: a rapidly decaying component that was maximal following the action potential (GkCa,1) and a slower component that had a distinct rising phase (GkCa,2). Both components required influx of extracellular Ca2+ for their activation, and neither was blocked by extracellular TEA (10 mM). Gkca,1 was selectively blocked by apamin, whereas GkCa,2 was selectively reduced by noradrenaline. The time course of GkCa,2 was markedly temperature sensitive. GkCa,2 was selectively blocked by application of ryanodine or sodium dantrolene, or by loading cells with ruthenium red. These results suggest that influx of Ca2+ directly gates one class of K+ channels and leads to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, which activates a different class of K+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W1580675778,"Previous studies of adhesion mediated by the central cell-binding domain of fibronectin suggest that additional polypeptide information besides the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence is required for full activity. We analyzed this putative second, synergistic region of fibronectin more extensively by deletion analysis and oligonucleotide-based site-directed mutagenesis. Resulting mutated fusion proteins expressed using lambda gt11 were assayed for baby hamster kidney fibroblast cell spreading activity. Deletion mutants truncating from the amino terminus showed a decrease of activity in two apparently discrete steps. Complementary studies using a series of overlapped internal deletions designed to retain the repetitive fibronectin structure also indicated that two distinct peptide regions besides the RGD sequence were necessary for full activity. Removal of the carboxyl-terminal region resulted in the greatest loss of activity (greater than or equal to 20- versus 3-5-fold). Very similar results were obtained with HT-1080 cells dependent on the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin receptor for adhesion to fibronectin. An anti-fibronectin monoclonal antibody that inhibits cell adhesion was found to bind to the carboxyl-terminal functional region, and a point mutation caused specific loss of its epitope. These studies reveal unexpected complexity in the organization of these functional regions, which contrasts with adhesion models based only on simple, short peptide recognition sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1557478309,"The protein farnesyltransferase from rat brain was previously shown to be inhibited competitively by tetrapeptides that conform to the consensus Cys-A1-A2-X, where A1 and A2 are aliphatic amino acids and X is methionine, serine, or phenylalanine. In the current studies we use a thin layer chromatography assay to show that most of these tetrapeptides are themselves farnesylated by the purified enzyme. Two classes of tetrapeptides are not farnesylated and therefore act as true inhibitors: 1) those that contain an aromatic residue at the A2 position and 2) those that contain penicillamine (beta,beta-dimethylcysteine) in place of cysteine. The most potent of these pure inhibitors was Cys-Val-Phe-Met, which inhibited farnesyltransferase activity by 50% at less than 0.1 microM. These data indicate that the inclusion of bulky aromatic or methyl residues in a tetrapeptide can abolish prenyl group transfer without blocking binding to the enzyme. This information should be useful in the design of peptides or peptidomimetics that inhibit farnesylation and thus block the action of p21ras proteins in animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1486701492,"Normal and pathological turnover of proteoglycans in articular cartilage involves its cleavage close to the N-terminal G1 domain responsible for aggregation. A fragment containing G1 and G2 N-terminal domains of pig cartilage proteoglycans was therefore used as a substrate to investigate its degradation by the metalloproteinase stromelysin and related recombinant stromelysin enzymes. The stromelysins produced an apparent single cleavage yielding a G1 fragment of 56 kDa and a G2 fragment of 110 kDa. Rabbit bone stromelysin was much more active against the G1-G2 fragment and against proteoglycan aggregates than recombinant human stromelysin-1 and stromelysin-2. All metalloproteinase preparations were active against proteoglycan and the G1-G2 fragment at acid (pH 5.5) and neutral pH (7.4). N-terminal sequencing of the G2 fragment derived from the action of recombinant human stromelysin-1 revealed that cleavage between G1 and G2 occurred at the N-terminal end of the interglobular domain, close to the last cysteine in G1. The specific cleavage site was between an asparagine and a pair of phenylalanine residues, where the asparagine corresponds to residue 341 in human and rat mature core protein sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2037203090,"Voltage-activated Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels contain a common motif, the S4 sequence, characterized by a basic residue at every third position interspersed mainly with hydrophobic residues. The S4 sequence is proposed to function as the voltage sensor and to move in response to membrane depolarization, triggering conformational changes that open the channel. This hypothesis has been tested in previous studies which revealed that mutations of the S4 basic residues often shift the curve of voltage dependence of activation along the voltage axis. We find that comparable or larger shifts are caused by conservative substitutions of hydrophobic residues in the S4 sequence of the Shaker K+ channel. We suggest that the S4 structure plays an essential role in determining the relative stabilities of the closed and open states of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1512060784,"Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease is an aspartyl protease composed of two identical protomers linked by a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet consisting of the NH2- and COOH-terminal segments (Weber, I.T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10492-10496). Kinetic analysis of the HIV-1 protease-catalyzed hydrolysis of a fluorogenic substrate demonstrates that the enzyme is an obligatory dimer. At pH = 5.0, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA buffer, 37 degrees C, the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = 3.6 +/- 1.9 nM. We found that the tetrapeptide Ac-Thr-Leu-Asn-Phe-COOH, corresponding to the COOH-terminal segment of the enzyme, is an excellent inhibitor of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis shows that the inhibitor binds to the inactive protomers and prevents their association into the active dimer (dissociative inhibition). The dissociative nature of this inhibition is consistent with the results obtained from sedimentation equilibrium experiments in which the apparent molecular weight of the enzyme was observed to be 20,800 +/- 1,500 and 12,100 +/- 300, in the absence and presence of the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide, respectively. The dissociation constant of the protomer-inhibitor complex is Ki = 45.1 +/- 1.8 microM. This is the first kinetic analysis and direct experimental demonstration of noncovalent dissociative inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1504016118,"A 871-base pair cDNA encoding the human N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG) was cloned from a HeLa S3 cDNA expression library in a pUC vector by phenotypic screening of MPG-negative (tag- alkA-) Escherichia coli cells exposed to methylmethane sulfonate. The active MPG is expressed as a 31-kDa fusion protein. The human cDNA-encoded MPG releases 3-methyladenine, 7-methylguanine, and 3-methylguanine from DNA and thus has a substrate range similar to that of the indigenous enzyme and the E. coli AlkA protein. The cDNA hybridizes with distinct restriction fragments of mammalian DNAs but not with E. coli or yeast DNA. A search in the GenBank data bank failed to show any other cloned DNA with a similar sequence. Although the human protein has 62% sequence homology with the corresponding rat enzyme, only a few amino acid residues are conserved between the human protein and the E. coli and yeast MPGs. However, a conserved glutamine residue in all MPGs that release 3-alkyladenine and an arginine residue in eukaryotic MPGs and E. coli AlkA that act additionally on N-alkylguanines suggest that these residues are involved in recognition of adenine and guanine adducts in DNA, respectively. Although the 1.1-kilobase mRNAs of MPG from human and rodents are similar in size, liver and cultured cells of rat have much lower levels of MPG mRNA than do human and mouse cells. A hamster cell line variant isolated as being resistant to methylmethane sulfonate does not have a higher level of MPG mRNA than the parent cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1516587897,"Enamelins are a major group of 28-70-kDa acidic proteins rich in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, and glycine found in developing and mature extracellular enamel; a unique and highly mineralized ectodermal tissue covering vertebrate teeth. They have been associated with the mineralization and structural organization of this tissue. In an attempt to elucidate the primary structure of enamelin, a 2674-base pair cDNA isolated from a bovine ameloblast-enriched, lambda Zap 2 expression library, was sequenced. The identity and localization of the deduced protein was confirmed by amino acid composition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, indirect immunohistochemistry, and high resolution protein-A gold immunocytochemistry. The immunological techniques were employed using antibodies directed against synthetic peptides corresponding to the protein sequence deduced from the cloned cDNA sequence. The results reveal the deduced protein to be a novel acidic enamel protein. It contains 389 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 43,814. Its amino acid composition is similar to that of tuft proteins (enamel matrix protein fragments remaining in the mature tissue). It contains one potential N-glycosylation site and 5 cysteine residues. Southern hybridization of the cloned cDNA with genomic bovine DNA indicated the existence of a single gene with one or more introns."
https://openalex.org/W1536956900,"Recent studies suggest the existence of a signal transduction pathway involving sphingomyelin and derivatives (Kolesnick, R. N. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7617-7623). The present studies compare effects of ceramide, sphingosine, and N,N-dimethylsphingosine on epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor phosphorylation in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. To increase ceramide solubility, a ceramide containing octanoic acid at the second position (C8-cer) was synthesized. C8-cer induced time- and concentration-dependent EGF receptor phosphorylation. This event was detectable by 2 min and maximal by 10 min. As little as 0.1 microM C8-cer was effective, and 3 microM C8-cer induced maximal phosphorylation to 1.9-fold of control. EGF (20 nM) increased phosphorylation to 2.1-fold of control. Sphingosine stimulated receptor phosphorylation over the same concentration range (0.03-3 microM) and to the same extent (1.8-fold of control) as ceramide. The effects of C8-cer and sphingosine were similar by three separate criteria, phosphoamino acid analysis, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoblotting, and phosphopeptide mapping by high performance liquid chromatography. Phosphorylation occurred specifically on threonine residues. N,N-Dimethylsphingosine, a potential derivative of sphingosine, was less effective. Since sphingosine and ceramide are interconvertible, the level of each compound was measured under conditions sufficient for EGF receptor phosphorylation. C8-cer (0.1-1 microM) induced dose-responsive elevation of cellular ceramide from 132 to 232 pmol.10(6) cells-1. In contrast, cellular sphingosine levels did not rise. This suggests that C8-cer acts without conversion to sphingosine. Exogenous sphingosine (0.1-1 microM) also increased cellular ceramide levels to 227 pmol.10(6) cells-1, but did not increase its own cellular level of 12 pmol.10(6) cells-1. Higher sphingosine concentrations that induced no further increase in EGF receptor phosphorylation produced very large elevations in cellular sphingosine. Hence, at effective concentrations, both compounds elevated cellular ceramide but not sphingosine levels. Additional studies performed with [3H]sphingosine demonstrated that cells contain substantially less N,N-dimethylsphingosine than free sphingosine and, during short term incubation, convert less than 5% of added sphingosine to N,N-dimethylsphingosine. These studies provide evidence that ceramide may have bioeffector properties and suggest sphingosine may act in part by conversion to ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1531441886,"Abstract Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) that bind to beta-glycosyl Yariv antigens have been purified from the culture medium and plasma membrane of Paul's Scarlet rose cells. Starting from culture medium or from plasma membrane vesicles prepared by aqueous two-phase partitioning, the purification procedure involved Yariv antigen-induced precipitation and subsequent chromatographic steps. Two fractions, AGP-(a) and AGP-(b), were obtained from the culture medium, and one AGP fraction was obtained from the plasma membrane. The glycosyl compositions of all three fractions were dominated by arabinosyl and galactosyl residues and included glucuronosyl and other minor residues. Methylation analysis showed that AGP-(a) and AGP-(b) were both highly branched 3,6-galactans with terminal arabinofuranosyl substituents. The amino acid compositions of all three AGPs were high in alanine, hydroxyproline, and serine and/or threonine. The amino-terminal sequence of AGP-(b) contained an alanine-hydroxyproline repeat. While sharing general structural similarity, the AGPs from the plasma membrane and the culture medium were distinguishable by composition and by size and charge, with the plasma membrane AGPs being larger and more negatively charged than the culture medium AGPs."

Anti-TSP antibodies or a synthetic peptide (GRGDS) containing an RGD cell-binding region was also added to cells plated on TSP. TSP and its 140 kd fragment were more efficient than laminin controls in supporting adhesion. Neurites formed on laminin, on varying concentrations of TSP, and particularly the 140 kd fragment. The amino-terminal heparin-binding domain supported little adhesion and outgrowth. Both adhesion and process outgrowth on TSP were inhibited by addition of anti-TSP antibodies, but not GRGDS."
https://openalex.org/W1569301169,"Protein-phospholipid as well as protein-protein interactions may be critical for tight binding of the serine protease factor VIIa (VIIa) to its receptor cofactor tissue factor (TF). To elucidate the role of protein-protein interactions, we analyzed the interaction of VII/VIIa with TF in the absence of phospholipid. Binding of VII occurred with similar affinity to solubilized and phospholipid-reconstituted TF. Lack of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-domain (des-(1-38)-VIIa) resulted in a 10- to 30-fold increase of the Kd for the interaction, as did blocking the Gla-domain by Fab fragments of a specific monoclonal antibody. These results suggest that the VII Gla-domain can participate in protein-protein interaction with the TF molecule per se rather than only in interactions with the charged phospholipid surface. Gla-domain-independent, low affinity binding of VII to TF required micromolar Ca2+, indicating involvement of high affinity calcium ion binding sites suggested to be localized in VII rather than TF. Interference with Gla-domain-dependent interactions with TF did not alter the TF. VIIa-dependent cleavage of a small peptidyl substrate, whereas the proteolytic activation of the protein substrate factor X was markedly decreased, suggesting that the VIIa Gla-domain not only participates in the formation of a more stable TF. VIIa complex but contributes to extended substrate recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1513971282,"Thioredoxin, reduced either enzymatically with NADPH and NADP-thioredoxin reductase or chemically with dithiothreitol, reduced alpha-amylase and trypsin inhibitor proteins from several sources. Included were cystine-rich seed representatives from wheat (alpha-amylase inhibitors), soybean (Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitor), and corn (kernel trypsin inhibitor). This system also reduced other trypsin inhibitors: the soybean Kunitz inhibitor, bovine lung aprotinin, and egg white ovoinhibitor and ovomucoid proteins. The ability of these proteins to undergo reduction by thioredoxin was determined by 1) a coupled enzyme activation assay with chloroplast NADP-malate dehydrogenase or fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, 2) a dye reduction assay with 5‘,5‘-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 3) a direct reduction method based on the fluorescent probe, monobromobimane, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Reduction experiments with the seed proteins were carried out with thioredoxin from wheat germ (h-type) or Escherichia coli; the corresponding experiments with the animal trypsin inhibitors were carried out with thioredoxin from calf thymus or E. coli. In all cases, thioredoxin appeared to act catalytically; the reduced form of glutathione was without effect. When considered in conjunction with earlier results on purothionin (confirmed and extended in the current study), the new findings suggest that the NADP/thioredoxin system functions in the reduction of protein inhibitors of seeds and animal tissues. These results also raise the question of the occurrence of glutaredoxin in plants, as E. coli glutaredoxin was found to promote the reduction of some but not all of the proteins tested."
https://openalex.org/W1489056473,"Hevein is a chitin-binding protein of 43 amino acids found in the lutoid body-enriched fraction of rubber tree latex. A hevein cDNA clone (HEV1) (Broekaert, W., Lee, H.-i., Kush, A., Nam, C.-H., and Raikhel, N. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 7633-7637) encodes a putative signal sequence of 17 amino acids followed by a polypeptide of 187 amino acids. Interestingly, this polypeptide has two distinct domains: an amino-terminal domain of 43 amino acids, corresponding to mature hevein, and a carboxyl-terminal domain of 144 amino acids. To investigate the mechanisms involved in processing of the protein encoded by HEV1, three domain-specific antisera were raised against fusion proteins harboring the amino-terminal domain (N domain), carboxyl-terminal domain (C domain), and both domains (NC domain). Translocation experiments using an in vitro translation system show that the first 17-amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA functions as a signal peptide. Immunoblot analysis of proteins extracted from lutoid bodies demonstrates that a 5-kDa protein comigrated with purified mature hevein and cross-reacted with N domain- and NC domain-specific antibodies. A 14-kDa protein was recognized by C domain- and NC domain-specific antibodies. A 20-kDa protein was cross-reactive with all three antibodies. Microsequencing data further suggest that the 5-kDa (amino-terminal domain) and 14-kDa (carboxyl-terminal domain) proteins are post-translational cleavage products of the 20-kDa polypeptide (both domains) which corresponds to the proprotein encoded by HEV1. In addition, it was found that the amino-terminal domain could provide chitin-binding properties to a fusion protein bearing it either amino terminally or carboxyl terminally."

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to purify GpH from an insoluble fraction obtained following extraction of chromaffin granule membranes with lithium diiodosalicylate. The GpH material was recovered from two-dimensional gel spots by concentration and recovery on a one-dimensional gel followed by electro-blotting to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. This material was subjected to in situ tryptic digestion. The released peptides were purified by microbore high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced. The peptide sequences revealed extensive similarity to the mammalian kex2/subtilisin-related proteases (PC2 and PC3) which have been characterized recently by molecular cloning and sequence analysis (Smeekens, S. P., and Steiner, D. F. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2997-3000; Smeekens, S. P., Avruch, A. S., LaMendola, J., Chan, S. J., and Steiner, D. F. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 340-344). The sequence similarity included regions that contain residues equivalent to the aspartic acid and histidine residues which are involved in the active site of the subtilisin family of serine proteases. The sequence data revealed the presence of tryptic peptides derived from both PC2 and PC3. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of GpH gave two sequences which were aligned with residues 110-121 of PC2 and PC3. It is likely that these sequences represent the mature form of PC2 and PC3 in chromaffin granules. These forms would be generated by cleavage at a site which is conserved in mammalian kex2-related enzymes and which would result in the release of approximately 80-residue propeptides. It was concluded that the spot identified as GpH by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis contains the bovine counterparts of both PC2 and PC3. The direct identification of these components in chromaffin granules supports their role in the processing of protein precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1504633391,"An enzymatic activity has been found in cytosolic preparations from mouse epidermis which catalyzes the formation of 8-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid/8-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (8-HPETE/8-HETE) from arachidonate. In contrast to 12-lipoxygenase this enzyme activity was not detectable in normal (untreated) mouse skin but only after in vivo treatment with the phorbol ester tumor promoter TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate). The induction showed a maximum at 24 h after TPA treatment strictly depended on the age of the mice and the TPA dose and was prevented by cycloheximide. The primary product formed from arachidonic acid was 8-HPETE, and the enzyme seems not to possess a significant peroxidase activity. This result as well as studies with specific inhibitors and its cytosolic localization indicates this enzyme to be a member of the lipoxygenase family. Most of the 8-lipoxygenase activity is located in cells of the suprabasal compartment of the epidermis. In spite of being a cytosolic enzyme 8-lipoxygenase appeared to be lipophilic to some extent and was activated by lecithin. The enzyme did not require calcium ions or ATP and showed a pH optimum at 7.5-8.0. 8-HPETE/8-HETE levels in mouse epidermis in vivo were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and found to be strongly increased after phorbol ester treatment, in agreement with the induction of 8-lipoxygenase observed."
https://openalex.org/W1488610719,"Expression of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid upper pathway operon requires a promoter that belongs to the -12/-24 class. Stimulation of transcription from this promoter is positively controlled by the effector-activated XylR protein and requires a form of RNA-polymerase holoenzyme containing the RpoN-encoded sigma factor, sigma 54. XylR-dependent stimulation of transcription from the Pseudomonas TOL upper pathway promoter was examined using deletions, insertions, and in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting. Two upstream activator sequences were identified in the -160 (UAS1) and -130 (UAS2) regions. Deletion of these two regions abolished transcription activation, although conservation of the UAS2 element alone allowed limited transcription stimulation. Separation of UAS1 from UAS2 by half a turn or a full turn significantly reduced XylR stimulation of transcription from the upper pathway operon promoter. An inverted repeated ATTTGN2CAAAT (where N is any nucleoside), which most likely represented the XylR recognition sequence, was identified. Binding of XylR was observed in vivo in the absence of effector, but changes in the binding pattern were induced in the presence of m-methylbenzyl alcohol, a XylR effector. In vivo footprinting analysis revealed that changes in the methylation pattern of G and T also occurred in the -50 to -90 region, which is probably occupied by integration host factor (IHF) protein. IHF was required for maximal expression from the TOL upper pathway operon promoter in Escherichia coli. Separation of the IHF site from UAS2 by a full helix turn did not significantly affect stimulation of transcription, which is consistent with this region playing a conformational role, rather than a regulatory one, in promoter function."
https://openalex.org/W2040457857,"A function for transcription in the mechanism of a circadian oscillator was investigated with the reversible transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D- ribobenzimidazole (DRB). Two-hour treatments with DRB shifted the phase of the circadian rhythm of the isolated eye of Aplysia, and continuous treatments of DRB lengthened the free running period of this rhythm. Camptothecin, an inhibitor of transcription that is structurally unrelated to DRB, had similar effects on the circadian rhythm. These results suggest that transcription may be part of the circadian oscillating mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1588067406,"Fibronectin is a multifunctional protein that is synthesized in several different forms that result from alternative splicing of mRNA. Although expression of splicing variants appears to be both developmentally regulated and tissue-specific, the functional significance of these isoforms is largely unknown. We found that cultured airway epithelial cells vectorially secrete two distinct species of fibronectin, one which contains the alternatively spliced EIIIA region (EIIIA+) and one in which the EIIIA segment is spliced out (EIIIA-). Fibronectin containing the EIIIA region is preferentially secreted apically. Although both apical and basal stimulation with transforming growth factor beta 1 increased fibronectin synthesis, the secretory response differed depending on which surface was being stimulated. Apical secretion of fibronectin and expression of EIIIA+ fibronectin mRNA increased only after apical stimulation. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism for the polarized regulation of targeted secretion and alternative splicing of fibronectin and suggest that the EIIIA segment may act as a targeting signal for the vectorial secretion of fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1568247388,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) fragments generated by autoantibodies purified from the blood of two human beings were separated and sequenced. Based on the identity of these fragments, seven peptide bonds cleaved by the antibodies were identified. Six of the seven scissile bonds are clustered in the region of VIP spanning residues 14-22 and were cleaved by antibodies from both human subjects. The seventh scissile bond is located at residues 7-8 and was cleaved by antibodies from one of the subjects. The scissile bonds link amino acid residues with different size, charge, and hydrophobicity. The hydrolytic activity of the antibodies was selective in that they failed to hydrolyze polypeptides unrelated in sequence to VIP (insulin and atrial natriuretic peptide). These observations demonstrate substrate specific hydrolysis by naturally occurring antibodies and expand the range of peptide bonds hydrolyzed by these antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2045787310,"The early zebrafish brain contains a simple axon scaffold of longitudinal tracts connected by commissures. Neurons in the nucleus of the posterior commissure (nuc PC) project growth cones along a specific route in this axonal scaffold, raising the possibility that specific axons in the early scaffold guide nuc PC growth cones. We tested this possibility by analyzing the behavior of nuc PC growth cones in embryos in which a portion of the scaffold, normally traversed by nuc PC growth cones, was surgically prevented from forming. Under these conditions nuc PC growth cones extended along both normal and aberrant pathways. This suggests that specific axons do provide guidance cues, since their removal leads to errors However, these cues are not obligatory, since some growth cones still followed normal pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1522099221,"A glutathione monomer has been docked into the active site cleft of T4 glutaredoxin (previously called T4 thioredoxin) using molecular graphics. The central part of the cleft is formed by the side chain of Tyr-16 on one side and the residues Thr-64, Met-65, and Pro-66 on the other. The entire glutathione molecule fits well into the cleft. A cis-peptide bond between the residues Met-65 and Pro-66 allows glutathione to bind in an anti-parallel fashion to residues 64-66. Hydrogen bonds can be formed between Met-65 and the glutathione cysteine. This binding positions the glutathione sulfur atom ideally for reaction with the glutaredoxin disulfide. In the model, glutathione can form a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-16. Charged interactions at opposite ends of the binding cleft are provided by His-12 and Asp-80. The negatively charged alpha-carboxyl group of glutathione may interact with a positive helix dipole of the protein. Fifteen mutant T4 glutaredoxins have been produced and assayed for glutathione binding by determining thioltransferase activity. Mutant proteins with substitutions in the sides of the cleft (Tyr-16, Pro-66) exhibited the most marked decreases in thioltransferase activity. Mutation of His-12 to a serine decreases the catalytic efficiency whereas substitution of Asp-80 by serine increases the catalytic efficiency. A double mutant, D80S;H12S, has much less affinity for glutathione than either single mutant. Substitution of Cys-14 produces an inactive protein, whereas C17S retains some thioltransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1549093505,"We have sequenced rabbit cDNAs that encode one isoform of the alpha subunit and two isoforms of the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase, in addition to the single isoform from fast skeletal muscle that has been characterized to date for each subunit. All these isoforms are generated by alternative RNA splicing. The alpha subunit sequence obtained from slow skeletal muscle (soleus) is characterized by an internal deletion of 59 amino acids. This deletion is predominant in mRNA from slow muscle, heart, and uterus and accounts for the smaller alpha subunit variant (alpha') characteristic of phosphorylase kinase purified from slow muscle and heart. The beta subunit mRNA can be differentially spliced at two sites. In all tissues (except skeletal muscle) that were analyzed, an internal segment encoding 28 amino acids of the muscle sequence is replaced by a homologous sequence of identical length, presumably through the use of mutually exclusive exons. In brain and some other tissues, the deduced N-terminal sequence of the beta subunit is also changed. This is achieved by an insertion into the mRNA sequence that interrupts the initial reading frame after 25 codons and starts a new reading frame, encoding a different N terminus of 18 amino acids. This modification probably affects the major regulatory phosphorylation site of the beta subunit."

Here we show that turnip is dramatically reduced in protein kinase C (PKC) activity. In addition, turnip flies are deficient in phosphorylation of a 76-kDa head membrane protein (hereafter pp76) which is a major substrate for protein kinase C in homogenates of wild-type flies. Reduced PKC activity, defective pp76 phosphorylation, and most of turnip's learning deficiency co-map genetically to a region on the X-chromosome, 18A5-18D1-2, spanned by the deletion Df(1)JA27. Apparently turnip+ is not a structural gene for PKC because Drosophila PKC genes map elsewhere in the genome. Our results suggest that turnip gene product is required for activation of PKC and that PKC plays a role in associative learning in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1534435876,"The gene encoding rat kallikrein-binding protein (RKBP), a serine protease inhibitor, has been isolated and analyzed with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction. The gene is approximately 10 kilobases in length with four introns of approximately 2.2, 1.8, 0.9, and 0.84 kilobases. This gene is composed of five exons and encodes a polypeptide of 416 amino acid residues. The reactive center region of RKBP is encoded by the fifth exon with the putative P1-P1' residues being Lys-Ser. The organization of the RKBP gene is homologous to those of human alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in size and arrangement of exons and introns, suggesting that they belong to the same subgroup of serpins. In the 5'-flanking region of the RKBP gene, a variant TATA box sequence, ATAAATA, is found 20 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site. The 5'-flanking region of the RKBP gene was able to direct transcription of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase when transfected into a rat hepatoma cell line. An internal promoter-like region was found in the first intron of the RKBP gene, downstream from the transcription initiation site and upstream from the translation initiation codon, however, it was unable to direct expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in our experiments. The expression of RKBP in rat liver was induced by sex hormone treatment as indicated by dot-blot analysis. A genomic Southern blot using an RKBP cDNA probe revealed multiple bands suggesting that the RKBP gene belongs to a family of highly conserved genes."
https://openalex.org/W2132904747,"The proteolytic activities of the 20 S proteasome were found to change in their levels during the development of chick embryonic muscle. The peptide-cleaving activities against N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Arg-Arg-4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide gradually decreased with the time of development. On the other hand, the casein-degrading activity in the presence of poly-L-lysine markedly increased from embryonic day 11 and reached a maximal level by day 17. These changes appeared to be tissue-specific because little or no change in any of the proteolytic activities was observed with developing embryonic brain, while dramatic alterations occurred in the extents of the peptide hydrolyses in liver. Furthermore, a number, but not all, of the proteasome subunits in embryonic muscle were changed in their amounts during the development. These results suggest that the alterations in the proteasome activities and subunit pattern are developmentally regulated and may be correlated."

(June 15, 1988) European Patent Application 0 296 123 A2) and is closely related to cyclosporin A (CyA), has as the main structural difference D-2-hydroxyisovaleric acid in ester linkage at position 8 instead of D-alanine in the cyclosporins. This peptolide exerts similar biological activities to CyA. We were able to prepare an enzyme fraction of crude extracts of the mycelium, which is capable of synthesizing the peptolide with consumption of the constitutive amino acids, D-2-hydroxyisovaleric acid, ATP, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The in vitro product co-chromatographs with authentic peptolide on thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography and shows similar immunosuppressive activity in vitro. The enzyme does not synthesize CyA, whereas cyclosporin synthetase does not synthesize the peptolide. Peptolide synthetase has a high molecular weight (in the same range as cyclosporin synthetase) and also does not appear to be glycosylated. The enzyme cross-reacts with antibodies directed specifically against cyclosporin synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1556711944,"Myeloblast cell line K562, when stably transfected with the human genomic c-fes sequence encoding a proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase, acquires the characteristics of more mature granulocytic cells (WS-1 cells) and the ability to undergo differentiation (Yu, G., Smithgall, T. E., and Glazer, R. I. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10276-10281). To explore the role of transcription factors in the differentiation process, WS-1 cells were analyzed for the presence of DNA-binding proteins capable of interacting with the 5'-long terminal repeat (LTR) region of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, that contains the binding sequences for transcription factors Sp1 and NFKB. Southwestern blotting and mobility shift assays revealed the presence of Sp1 in K562 and WS-1 cells. The DNA-binding activity of Sp1 was significantly greater in WS-1 cells than in K562 cells, despite the detection by immuno-blotting of equivalent quantities and degrees of heterogeneity of Sp1 in both cell lines. DNA footprinting of the HIV-1 5'-LTR demonstrated that two of the three Sp1-binding sites and both NFKB binding sequences were protected by nuclear extracts from WS-1 cells, while no protection was afforded by nuclear extracts from K562 cells. Analysis of transcription in vitro by primer extension revealed enhanced initiation of transcription from the HIV-1 5'-LTR by nuclear extracts from WS-1 cells, but not from K562 cells. These data indicate that the response evoked by the c-fes tyrosine-protein kinase leads to enhanced DNA binding activity of Sp1 and NFKB, that results in the activation of transcription from the HIV-1 5'-LTR."
https://openalex.org/W1539809249,"The effects of carbobenzyloxy-leucine-tyrosine-chloromethylketone (zLYCK), an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteases, on signal transduction in human neutrophils triggered by the chemoattractant formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) were investigated. zLYCK (10 microM) inhibited the fMLP-induced respiratory burst in neutrophils treated with cytochalasin B. In the presence of zLYCK (10 microM), the activation of phospholipase D in response to fMLP addition was inhibited. zLYCK did not inhibit the binding of [3H] fMLP to its receptor or the enzymic activity of phospholipase D because the response to ionomycin was unaffected. The effect of zLYCK on phospholipase D correlated well with its effects on the accumulation of diglycerides, which was also inhibited in the presence of zLYCK. In electropermeabilized neutrophils, too, zLYCK caused an inhibition of the fMLP-induced respiratory burst and the fMLP-induced activation of phospholipase D. Interestingly, this inhibition could be bypassed by guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate). We conclude that the inhibition of the respiratory burst in human neutrophils by zLYCK is caused by the selective inhibition of signal transduction leading to activation of phospholipase D and that zLYCK might be a useful probe to study the role of phospholipase D in neutrophil activation."
https://openalex.org/W2115535135,"lac permease mutated at each of the 8 cysteinyl residues in the molecule was solubilized from the membrane, purified, and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. The transport activity of proteoliposomes reconstituted with each mutant permease relative to the wild-type is virtually identical with that reported for intact cells and/or right-side-out membrane vesicles. Moreover, a double mutant containing Ser in place of both Cys148 and Cys154 exhibits significant ability to catalyze active lactose transport. The results provide strong confirmation for the contention that cysteinyl residues in lac permease do not play an important role in the transport mechanism. The effect of sulfhydryl oxidant 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone on lactose transport in proteoliposomes reconstituted with wild-type or mutant permeases was also investigated, and the results indicate that inactivation is probably due to formation of a covalent adduct with Cys148 and/or Cys154 rather than disulfide formation. Thus, it seems unlikely that sulfhydryl-disulfide interconversion functions to regulate permease activity."
https://openalex.org/W1578674050,"Liver and muscle glycogen phosphorylases, which are products of distinct genes, are both activated by covalent phosphorylation, but in the unphosphorylated (b) state, only the muscle isozyme is efficiently activated by the allosteric activator AMP. The different responsiveness of the phosphorylase isozymes to allosteric ligands is important for the maintenance of tissue and whole body glucose homeostasis. In an attempt to understand the structural determinants of differential sensitivity of the muscle and liver isozymes to AMP, we have developed a bacterial expression system for the liver enzyme, allowing native and engineered proteins to be expressed and characterized. Engineering of the single amino acid substitutions Thr48Pro, Met197Thr and the double mutant Thr48Pro, Met197Thr in liver phosphorylase, and Pro48Thr in muscle phosphorylase, did not qualitatively change the response of the two isozymes to AMP. These sites had previously been implicated in the configuration of the AMP binding site. However, when nine amino acids among the first 48 in liver phosphorylase were replaced with the corresponding muscle phosphorylase residues (L1M2-48L49-846), the engineered liver enzyme was activated by AMP to a higher maximal activity than native liver phosphorylase. Interestingly, the homotropic cooperativity of AMP binding was unchanged in the engineered phosphorylase b protein, and heterotropic cooperativity between the glucose-1-phosphate and AMP sites was only slightly enhanced. The native liver, native muscle and L1M2-48L49-846 phosphorylases were converted to the a form by treatment with purified phosphorylase kinase; the maximal activity of the chimeric a enzyme was greater than the native liver a enzyme and approached that of muscle phosphorylase a. From these results we suggest that tissue-specific phosphorylase isozymes have evolved a complex mechanism in which the N-terminal 48 amino acids modulate intrinsic activity (Vmax), probably by affecting subunit interactions, and other, as yet undefined regions specify the allosteric interactions with ligands and substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1507643894,"The conformational flexibility and long-range interactions in rabbit muscle aldolase induced by active-site ligand binding, cross-linking of the enzyme between Cys72 and Cys338, and removal of the C-terminal tyrosine residue were studied by following the changes in the microenvironments of Cys239 and Cys289 located outside the active site. It was found that substrates induced a conformational change in aldolase, which propagates from the active site to Cys239, which is located close to intersubunit contacts. The response of the enzyme is differential. Ligands having both C-1 and C-6 phosphates or C-1 phosphate only induce the enhancement of Cys239 reactivity, whereas those with C-6 phosphates only decrease Cys239 reactivity. This correlates well with a dramatic difference in kinetic parameters for a cleavage of fructose-1,6-P2 and fructose-1-P. Therefore, these changes can be interpreted as syncatalytic. Cross-linking of the aldolase subunit by an -S-S-bridge between Cys72 and Cys338 inactivates the enzyme, abolishes binding of active-site ligands, and induces a conformational change in the enzyme that can be detected far away (at Cys239 and Cys289) from the site of perturbation. Cys72 and Cys338 are not in the active site. This shows that the region of the active site and the environment of Cys72 and Cys338 are tightly coupled and that residues far away from the active site, through such coupling, can possess properties of active-site residues. Similar, although less dramatic changes are observed upon removal of the C-terminal tyrosine residue. In view of the results obtained in this paper, aldolase seems to be quite a flexible molecule, whose conformation is sensitive to the nature of a substrate bound to the enzyme and is able to transmit the information about a local perturbation over long distances within a molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1640264607,"L-Canavanine is incorporated into the lysozyme synthesized, in response to administration of bacterial cell wall materials, by canavanine-treated larvae of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta (Sphingidae). Maximum canavanine incorporation into M. sexta lysozyme occurs when the larvae are provided 1 mg of canavanine g-1 fresh body weight. Analysis of canavanine-containing lysozyme purified from these insects reveals that 21% of the arginine residues are replaced by canavanine; this residue substitution results in a loss of 49.5% of the catalytic activity. When the larvae are provided 0.5 mg of canavanine g-1, 16.5% of the arginine residues are substituted by canavanine and 39.5% of the catalytic activity is lost. Canavanine is also incorporated into the lysozyme induced by canavanine-treated pupae of the giant silk moth Hyalophora cecropia (Saturnidae). In contrast, replacement of 17% of the arginine in H. cecropia lysozyme by canavanine fails to affect the catalytic activity. We have determined the primary structure of M. sexta lysozyme and compared it with the primary structure of H. cecropia lysozyme which has been described elsewhere. M. sexta lysozyme has an arginine at positions 23, 42, and 107. H. cecropia contains serine, lysine, and lysine, respectively, at these locations. The ability of incorporated canavanine to inhibit M. sexta lysozyme activity selectively may result from the fact that replacement of any one of the 3 arginine residues at position 23, 42, or 107 by canavanine causes the loss of catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1544564931,"This report describes the use of an antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of the insulin receptor beta subunit to assess the fate of the insulin receptor protein over the time course of insulin-induced receptor down-regulation. The insulin receptor beta subunit is lost from the cellular membranes of insulin-treated 3T3-C2 fibroblasts with a time course superimposable with the insulin-induced loss of cellular insulin binding activity. Concomitant with the time-dependent loss of the intact beta subunit from the membranes, a 61,000-Da fragment of the insulin receptor beta subunit accumulates in the cytosol of the cells in a time-dependent manner. The insulin-induced loss of the intact beta subunit from the cellular membranes is inhibited by cycloheximide. Chloroquine and the thiol protease inhibitors leupeptin and E-64 inhibit the insulin-induced loss of the intact beta subunit from the membranes and induce an accumulation of the intact subunit in the membranes. However, in the presence of leupeptin, E-64, or chloroquine, the insulin-induced loss of insulin binding activity occurs normally. These data indicate that down-regulation results in the loss of the intact beta subunit from the cellular membranes with the production of a fragment of the beta subunit in the cytosol. The protease responsible for the generation of the fragment is a thiol protease which requires acidic conditions. Since the insulin-induced proteolysis of the beta subunit can be totally inhibited under conditions where the insulin-induced loss of insulin binding activity proceeds normally, the proteolysis of the beta subunit is a process which is separate and distinguishable from the insulin-induced loss of insulin binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1519479206,"The pronounced stimulation of protein synthesis in T lymphocytes in response to mitogens is partly due to increased cell size and hence ribosome number. There is also a large increase in translation rate per ribosome as a result of an increased rate of initiation. In response to mitogen, levels of both eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2 and guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GEF, increase in parallel with ribosomes which is consistent with a general increase in the translational machinery but cannot explain the increase in activity per ribosome. However, as total eIF-2 accumulates, the ratio of phosphorylated eIF-2 alpha (eIF-2(alpha P] to eIF-2 alpha decreases. Further, the levels of eIF-2(alpha P) and GEF in resting T lymphocytes are similar. As eIF-2(alpha P) inhibits GEF by effectively sequestering the exchange factor in an inactive 1:1 complex, the level of GEF available for protein synthesis initiation must be very low in resting cells. Hence, as GEF is synthesized and rises above the level of eIF-2(alpha P), there will be a disproportionate increase in GEF available for initiation compared with the increase in total GEF. This increase in available GEF is probably great enough to support the increase in translation rate per ribosome as well as the increase in ribosome number."
https://openalex.org/W1875633149,"Numatrin is a nuclear matrix phosphoprotein whose synthesis and abundance were shown to be regulated during the cell cycle in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes (Feuerstein, N., and Mond, J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11389-11397). We examined the effect of (a) CTD-kinase, which contains the cdc2 catalytic component (p34) in a complex with a p58 subunit (cdc2/p58) and (b) the M phase-specific histone H1 kinase, which contains the cdc2 kinase in association with a p62 subunit (cdc2/p62), on phosphorylation of numatrin. We show that both cdc2 kinase complexes can phosphorylate numatrin. However, cdc2/p58 at conditions that caused a similar effect to cdc2/p62 on phosphorylation of histone H1 (dpm/micrograms of substrate/micrograms of enzyme) was found to have a 5-25-fold higher catalytic activity in the phosphorylation of numatrin. Analysis of the tryptic phosphopeptide map of numatrin phosphorylated by these cdc2 kinase complexes showed that both kinase complexes phosphorylated two major identical peptides, but minor additional peptides were differentially phosphorylated by each of these kinases. This indicates that under certain experimental conditions cdc2/p58 and cdc2/p62 may express some differences in their catalytic activity. In vitro phosphorylation by CTD kinase of a whole nuclear protein extract from murine fibroblasts showed that numatrin is the most prominent substrate for CTD kinase in this nuclear extract. CTD kinase cdc2/p58 was found to induce significantly the phosphorylation of five other discrete nuclear substrates. Particularly, two nuclear proteins at 75 kDa/pI approximately 6.5 and 85 kDa/pI approximately 5.3, which were not Coomassie Blue stainable, were found to be markedly phosphorylated by CTD kinase. The results of this study call for further study of the role of CTD kinase cdc2/p58 in the phosphorylation of numatrin under physiological conditions and to further characterization of the other nuclear substrates for CTD kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1517216084,"The transcription of eucaryotic tRNA genes requires two factors IIIB and IIIC, in addition to RNA polymerase III, to reconstitute this process in vitro. We have examined the functional exchangeability of these components from Drosophila and human systems. The reconstitution of heterologous IIIB and IIIC components demonstrated that neither factor will functionally substitute for the homologous components to activate tRNA gene transcription. The addition of the heterologous Drosophila factors to HeLa transcription assays causes an inhibition of RNA synthesis that is dependent upon the order of addition of these proteins to the DNA template. Thus, it appears that tRNA gene transcription in these systems is species-specific. We have further analyzed the reason for the apparent incompatibilities of these components by the use of stable complex formation assays. We find that human HeLa IIIB and Drosophila IIIC are unable to form stably associated complexes with a tRNA gene template, whereas the Drosophila IIIB and HeLa IIIC do form stable but nonproductive complexes. These results demonstrate that specific IIIC-IIIB interactions are critical in the formation of productive transcription complexes and are responsible for the observed species specificity of Drosophila and human tRNA gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1598501489,"Two substitutions for glycine in the triple-helical domain were found in type I procollagen synthesized by skin fibroblasts from two probands with lethal osteogenesis imperfecta. One was a substitution of valine for glycine alpha 1-637, and the other was a substitution of arginine for glycine alpha 2-694. The effects of the mutations on the zipper-like folding of the collagen triple helix were similar, since there was post-translational overmodification of the collagenase A fragments (amino acids 1-775) but not of more COOH-terminal fragments of the protein. The mutations differed markedly, however, on their effects on thermal unfolding of the triple helix. The collagenase A fragment from the collagen containing the arginine alpha 2-694 substitution was cleaved at about amino acid 700 when incubated with trypsin at 30-35 degrees C. Therefore, there was micro-unfolding of the triple helix at a site close to the glycine substitution. Surprisingly, however, the collagenase A fragment with the valine alpha 1-637 substitution was also cleaved at about amino acid 700 under the same conditions. The results, therefore, demonstrated that although most glycine substitutions delay folding of the triple helix in regions that are NH2-terminal to the site of the substitution, the effects on unfolding can be transmitted to regions that are COOH-terminal to the site of the glycine substitution."

Here we have analyzed the synthesis and transcription of alpha and beta spectrin in Friend virus-infected murine erythroblasts (FVA cells) in vitro during the erythropoietin-dependent period of maturation. Erythropoietin (Epo) increases the synthesis of beta spectrin but not alpha spectrin, thereby altering the alpha/beta spectrin synthetic ratio. When immature FVA cells are exposed for 24 h to a standard dose of 0.2 unit/ml Epo for maximum effect, the mRNA content and the synthesis of beta spectrin are increased resulting in about 1.3-1.5-fold excess of beta spectrin over alpha spectrin in the cytosol. On the membrane, the incorporation of both alpha and beta spectrins is increased equally by about 30-35%. Furthermore, nuclear run-off transcription measurements indicate that the increased beta spectrin gene expression is regulated at the level of transcription. We conclude that in cells with strong Epo stimulus, the expression and synthesis of beta spectrin are increased resulting in an increase in the amount of alpha,beta spectrin heterodimers available for membrane assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1639221645,"We have purified DNA polymerase alpha from a temperature-sensitive mutant cell line of mouse FM3A cells, tsFT20, that shows temperature-sensitive activity of DNA polymerase alpha (Murakami, Y., Yasuda, H., Miyazawa, H., Hanaoka, F., and Yamada, M. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 1761-1765). The purified enzyme was composed of two polypeptides with the same apparent molecular weights as those of purified DNA polymerase alpha from the parental strain, FM3A (Mr 180,000 and 68,000). Heat inactivation experiments revealed that this purified DNA polymerase alpha from tsFT20 cells was more heat-labile than the wild-type enzyme. We have also purified primase from both ts-FT20 cells and wild-type cells. Both primase fractions consist of two polypeptides with molecular weights of 54,000 and 46,000. No difference was observed between the heat labilities of the primases from tsFT20 cells and wild-type cells. Comparisons of wild-type and mutant polymerase indicated that the temperature-sensitive mutation in DNA polymerase alpha from tsFT20 cells affect the dCTP-binding site of the enzyme. The mutation also changed the optimum pH and the optimum KCl concentration of the enzyme."
