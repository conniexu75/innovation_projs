https://openalex.org/W2156395131,"Introduction Despite the existence of institutions designed to promote peace, interactions between individuals and groups sometimes lead to conflict. Understanding the causes of such conflict is a major project in the social sciences, and researchers in anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology have long debated the extent to which climatic changes are responsible. Recent advances and interest have prompted an explosion of quantitative studies on this question. Methods We carried out a comprehensive synthesis of the rapidly growing literature on climate and human conflict. We examined many types of human conflict, ranging from interpersonal violence and crime to intergroup violence and political instability and further to institutional breakdown and the collapse of civilizations. We focused on quantitative studies that can reliably infer causal associations between climate variables and conflict outcomes. The studies we examined are experiments or “natural experiments”; the latter exploit variations in climate over time that are plausibly independent of other variables that also affect conflict. In many cases, we obtained original data from studies that did not meet this criterion and used a common statistical method to reanalyze these data. In total, we evaluated 60 primary studies that have examined 45 different conflict data sets. We collected findings across time periods spanning 10,000 BCE to the present and across all major world regions. Results Deviations from normal precipitation and mild temperatures systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially. This relationship is apparent across spatial scales ranging from a single building to the globe and at temporal scales ranging from an anomalous hour to an anomalous millennium. Our meta-analysis of studies that examine populations in the post-1950 era suggests that the magnitude of climate’s influence on modern conflict is both substantial and highly statistically significant ( P &lt; 0.001). Each 1-SD change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall increases the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14% (median estimates). Discussion We conclude that there is more agreement across studies regarding the influence of climate on human conflict than has been recognized previously. Given the large potential changes in precipitation and temperature regimes projected for the coming decades—with locations throughout the inhabited world expected to warm by 2 to 4 SDs by 2050—amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low- and high-income countries."

However, Kayagaki et al. (p 1246 , published online 25 July) and Hagar et al. (p. 1250 ) report that the hexa-acyl lipid A component of LPS from Gramnegative bacteria is able to access the cytoplasm and activate caspase-11 to signal immune responses independently of TLR4. Mice that lack caspase-11 are resistant to LPS-induced lethality, even in the presence of TLR4."
https://openalex.org/W2028787031,"Local Speeding Early responses of species to climate change seemed to predict a general poleward response (or upward in mountains and downward in the ocean). Pinsky et al. (p. 1239 ) test an alternative hypothesis that relates more to the nature of climate change than to changes in temperature. Using nearly 50 years of coastal survey data on &gt;350 marine taxa, they found that climate velocity was a much better predictor of patterns of change than individual species' characteristics or life histories. The findings suggest that responses to climate change largely track changes in local conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2099168883,"Social behaviours in species as diverse as honey bees and humans promote group survival but often come at some cost to the individual. Although reinforcement of adaptive social interactions is ostensibly required for the evolutionary persistence of these behaviours, the neural mechanisms by which social reward is encoded by the brain are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that in mice oxytocin acts as a social reinforcement signal within the nucleus accumbens core, where it elicits a presynaptically expressed long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in medium spiny neurons. Although the nucleus accumbens receives oxytocin-receptor-containing inputs from several brain regions, genetic deletion of these receptors specifically from dorsal raphe nucleus, which provides serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) innervation to the nucleus accumbens, abolishes the reinforcing properties of social interaction. Furthermore, oxytocin-induced synaptic plasticity requires activation of nucleus accumbens 5-HT1B receptors, the blockade of which prevents social reward. These results demonstrate that the rewarding properties of social interaction in mice require the coordinated activity of oxytocin and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens, a mechanistic insight with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism."
https://openalex.org/W2146933058,"CCR5-Maraviroc Structure The chemokine receptor CCR5, a G protein–coupled receptor best known as a co-receptor during HIV-1 infection, is important in a variety of physiological processes. Tan et al. (p. 1387 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Klasse ) now report the high-resolution crystal structure of CCR5 bound to the HIV-1 entry inhibitor, Maraviroc. The structure suggests that Maraviroc acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor by binding to a region of CCR5 that is distinct from the binding site of HIV-1 and chemokines. Comparison of the structure of CCR5 with the other HIV-1 co-receptor, the chemokine receptor CXCR4, provides insight into the co-receptor selectivity of the virus."

https://openalex.org/W2028518212,"Cellular immune responses in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) vaccinated with cytomegalovirus vectors expressing SIV proteins are able to stringently control highly pathogenic SIV infection, regardless of the route of challenge, after systemic spread; immunological and virological analyses of protected macaques followed for up to 3 years suggest that persistent immune surveillance by vaccine-elicited immune responses may have cleared the infection. Work on potential vaccines against human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and the simian equivalent (SIV) has so far proved largely fruitless. This study makes some progress by exploiting the recent observation that the pathogens appear vulnerable to immune control or pharmacological clearance in the first few hours to days of infection. Rhesus macaques vaccinated with SIV protein-expressing rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV/SIV) vectors developed durable resistance to the highly pathogenic SIVmac239 after challenge by vaginal and intravenous routes. Some of the vaccinated animals have controlled viral replication for 1 to 3 years with no demonstrable evidence for residual virus, raising the possibility that the vaccine- elicited immune responses may in fact have cleared the initial infection. Established infections with the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV, respectively) are thought to be permanent with even the most effective immune responses and antiretroviral therapies only able to control, but not clear, these infections1,2,3,4. Whether the residual virus that maintains these infections is vulnerable to clearance is a question of central importance to the future management of millions of HIV-infected individuals. We recently reported that approximately 50% of rhesus macaques (RM; Macaca mulatta) vaccinated with SIV protein-expressing rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV/SIV) vectors manifest durable, aviraemic control of infection with the highly pathogenic strain SIVmac239 (ref. 5). Here we show that regardless of the route of challenge, RhCMV/SIV vector-elicited immune responses control SIVmac239 after demonstrable lymphatic and haematogenous viral dissemination, and that replication-competent SIV persists in several sites for weeks to months. Over time, however, protected RM lost signs of SIV infection, showing a consistent lack of measurable plasma- or tissue-associated virus using ultrasensitive assays, and a loss of T-cell reactivity to SIV determinants not in the vaccine. Extensive ultrasensitive quantitative PCR and quantitative PCR with reverse transcription analyses of tissues from RhCMV/SIV vector-protected RM necropsied 69–172 weeks after challenge did not detect SIV RNA or DNA sequences above background levels, and replication-competent SIV was not detected in these RM by extensive co-culture analysis of tissues or by adoptive transfer of 60 million haematolymphoid cells to naive RM. These data provide compelling evidence for progressive clearance of a pathogenic lentiviral infection, and suggest that some lentiviral reservoirs may be susceptible to the continuous effector memory T-cell-mediated immune surveillance elicited and maintained by cytomegalovirus vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2051454588,"Reprogramming of adult cells to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) has opened new therapeutic opportunities; however, little is known about the possibility of in vivo reprogramming within tissues. Here we show that transitory induction of the four factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc in mice results in teratomas emerging from multiple organs, implying that full reprogramming can occur in vivo. Analyses of the stomach, intestine, pancreas and kidney reveal groups of dedifferentiated cells that express the pluripotency marker NANOG, indicative of in situ reprogramming. By bone marrow transplantation, we demonstrate that haematopoietic cells can also be reprogrammed in vivo. Notably, reprogrammable mice present circulating iPS cells in the blood and, at the transcriptome level, these in vivo generated iPS cells are closer to embryonic stem cells (ES cells) than standard in vitro generated iPS cells. Moreover, in vivo iPS cells efficiently contribute to the trophectoderm lineage, suggesting that they achieve a more plastic or primitive state than ES cells. Finally, intraperitoneal injection of in vivo iPS cells generates embryo-like structures that express embryonic and extraembryonic markers. We conclude that reprogramming in vivo is feasible and confers totipotency features absent in standard iPS or ES cells. These discoveries could be relevant for future applications of reprogramming in regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2105245948,"Sourcing Antibiotic Resistance It is widely assumed that antibiotic resistance in farm animals contributes in a major way to antibiotic resistance in humans. Mather et al. (p. 1514 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Woolhouse and Ward ) analyzed hundreds of genome sequences from Salmonella isolates collected from both livestock and patients in Scotland between 1990 and 2004. The relative contributions of animal-derived and human-derived sources of infection were quantified and the phylogenetic diversity of resistance profiles was matched with bacterial phylogenies. The results suggest that most human infections are caught from other humans rather than from livestock and that humans harbor a greater diversity of antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2077570881,"This paper demonstrates that the mechanism of break-induced replication (BIR) is significantly different from S-phase replication, as it proceeds via a migrating bubble driven by Pif1 helicase, results in conservative inheritance of newly synthesized DNA, and is inherently mutagenic. When DNA is repaired by homologous recombination, DNA synthesis is involved in the latter stages. Two papers published in this issue of Nature now define a role for the DNA helicase Pif1 in this reaction. They show that although the initial stages of break-induced replication (BIR) can occur normally in the absence of Pif1, synthesis from a migrating D-loop intermediate is compromised. The mechanism of replication during BIR involves a unique bubble-like replication fork that results in conservative inheritance of the new genetic material, in contrast to the S-phase replication that duplicates the genome before cell division, and is inherently mutagenic. The repair of chromosomal double strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. However, the repair of DSBs can also destabilize the genome by causing mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, the driving forces for carcinogenesis and hereditary diseases. Break-induced replication (BIR) is one of the DSB repair pathways that is highly prone to genetic instability1,2,3. BIR proceeds by invasion of one broken end into a homologous DNA sequence followed by replication that can copy hundreds of kilobases of DNA from a donor molecule all the way through its telomere4,5. The resulting repaired chromosome comes at a great cost to the cell, as BIR promotes mutagenesis, loss of heterozygosity, translocations, and copy number variations, all hallmarks of carcinogenesis4,5,6,7,8,9. BIR uses most known replication proteins to copy large portions of DNA, similar to S-phase replication10,11. It has therefore been suggested that BIR proceeds by semiconservative replication; however, the model of a bona fide, stable replication fork contradicts the known instabilities associated with BIR such as a 1,000-fold increase in mutation rate compared to normal replication9. Here we demonstrate that in budding yeast the mechanism of replication during BIR is significantly different from S-phase replication, as it proceeds via an unusual bubble-like replication fork that results in conservative inheritance of the new genetic material. We provide evidence that this atypical mode of DNA replication, dependent on Pif1 helicase, is responsible for the marked increase in BIR-associated mutations. We propose that the BIR mode of synthesis presents a powerful mechanism that can initiate bursts of genetic instability in eukaryotes, including humans."

Gurnett et al. (p. 1489 , published online 12 September) present results from the Plasma Wave instrument on Voyager 1 that provide evidence that the spacecraft was in the interstellar plasma during two periods, October to November 2012 and April to May 2013, and very likely in the interstellar plasma continuously since the series of boundary crossings that occurred in July to August 2012."
https://openalex.org/W1968493165,"This paper demonstrates that Pif1 helicase works with polymerase d to promote DNA synthesis through a migrating D-loop, a mechanism used to copy tens of kilobases during repair of chromosome breaks by break-induced replication (BIR). When DNA is repaired by homologous recombination, DNA synthesis is involved in the latter stages. Two papers published in this issue of Nature now define a role for the DNA helicase Pif1 in this reaction. They show that although the initial stages of break-induced replication (BIR) can occur normally in the absence of Pif1, synthesis from a migrating D-loop intermediate is compromised. The mechanism of replication during BIR involves a unique bubble-like replication fork that results in conservative inheritance of the new genetic material, in contrast to the S-phase replication that duplicates the genome before cell division, and is inherently mutagenic. During DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR), DNA synthesis copies information from a template DNA molecule. Multiple DNA polymerases have been implicated in repair-specific DNA synthesis1,2,3, but it has remained unclear whether a DNA helicase is involved in this reaction. A good candidate DNA helicase is Pif1, an evolutionarily conserved helicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae important for break-induced replication (BIR)4 as well as HR-dependent telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase5 found in 10–15% of all cancers6. Pif1 has a role in DNA synthesis across hard-to-replicate sites7,8 and in lagging-strand synthesis with polymerase δ (Polδ)9,10,11. Here we provide evidence that Pif1 stimulates DNA synthesis during BIR and crossover recombination. The initial steps of BIR occur normally in Pif1-deficient cells, but Polδ recruitment and DNA synthesis are decreased, resulting in premature resolution of DNA intermediates into half-crossovers. Purified Pif1 protein strongly stimulates Polδ-mediated DNA synthesis from a D-loop made by the Rad51 recombinase. Notably, Pif1 liberates the newly synthesized strand to prevent the accumulation of topological constraint and to facilitate extensive DNA synthesis via the establishment of a migrating D-loop structure. Our results uncover a novel function of Pif1 and provide insights into the mechanism of HR."
https://openalex.org/W2044035188,"Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- β , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the β form at lower temperatures. SVP and FLM-β form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-β tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed."

In laboratory column experiments using several soil types, Oswald et al. (p. 1233 ) showed that soils from arid regions and farmlands can produce substantial quantities of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO). Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are the primary source of HONO at comparable levels to NO, thus serving as an important source of reactive nitrogen to the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1994098589,"Colonizing enteric bacteria are shown to inhibit the antimicrobial process of host cell apoptosis through the action of NleB1, a type III secretion system effector with N-acetylglucosamine transferase activity, which can bind and modify eukaryotic death-domain-containing proteins. Previous studies identified a group of effectors from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli that can inhibit host nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling, yet only one of them, known as NleB, is required for bacterial virulence in vivo. Two papers published in this issue demonstrate the unique mechanism of action of NleB. It directly targets death receptor signalling complexes, binding to the death domains (DDs) of multiple DD-containing proteins including the TNF receptor, FAS, RIPK1, TRADD and FADD. NleB is shown to function as an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase that modifies a conserved DD arginine, blocking the receptor-adapter interaction. These findings suggest that GlcNAc modification is essential for bacterial virulence and can regulate death receptor signalling. Successful infection by enteric bacterial pathogens depends on the ability of the bacteria to colonize the gut, replicate in host tissues and disseminate to other hosts. Pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella and enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic (EPEC and EHEC, respectively) Escherichia coli use a type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver virulence effector proteins into host cells during infection that promote colonization and interfere with antimicrobial host responses1,2,3. Here we report that the T3SS effector NleB1 from EPEC binds to host cell death-domain-containing proteins and thereby inhibits death receptor signalling. Protein interaction studies identified FADD, TRADD and RIPK1 as binding partners of NleB1. NleB1 expressed ectopically or injected by the bacterial T3SS prevented Fas ligand or TNF-induced formation of the canonical death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) and proteolytic activation of caspase-8, an essential step in death-receptor-induced apoptosis. This inhibition depended on the N-acetylglucosamine transferase activity of NleB1, which specifically modified Arg 117 in the death domain of FADD. The importance of the death receptor apoptotic pathway to host defence was demonstrated using mice deficient in the FAS signalling pathway, which showed delayed clearance of the EPEC-like mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium and reversion to virulence of an nleB mutant. The activity of NleB suggests that EPEC and other attaching and effacing pathogens antagonize death-receptor-induced apoptosis of infected cells, thereby blocking a major antimicrobial host response."

https://openalex.org/W1988796527,"Immunological memory is the residuum of a successful immune response that in the B cell lineage comprises long-lived plasma cells and long-lived memory B cells. It is apparent that distinct classes of memory B cells exist, distinguishable by, among other things, immunoglobulin isotype, location, and passage through the germinal center. Some of this variation is due to the nature of the antigen, and some appears to be inherent to the process of forming memory. Here, we consider the heterogeneity in development and phenotype of memory B cells and whether particular functions are partitioned into distinct subsets. We consider also how understanding the details of generating memory may provide opportunities to develop better, functionally targeted vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W2164331787,"Holocene aquifers are the source of much arsenic poisoning in south and southeast Asia, whereas Pleistocene aquifers are mostly safe; here the delayed arsenic contamination of a Pleistocene aquifer is described and modelled. Millions of people across southeast Asia are exposed to arsenic-contaminated drinking water drawn from Holocene aquifers, layers of sand deposited less than 5,000 years ago. By contrast, Pleistocene aquifers, deposited about 12,000 years ago, have lower levels of contamination and are increasingly being exploited as safe sources of drinking water. This study reports the gradual penetration of arsenic into a low-arsenic Pleistocene aquifer south of Hanoi, Vietnam. Changes in groundwater flow and the redox state of the aquifer sands induced by pumping are introducing contamination from the high-arsenic Holocene aquifer. Contamination so far is limited owing to the absorption of arsenic onto aquifer sands, which delays arsenic movement by decades. Groundwater drawn daily from shallow alluvial sands by millions of wells over large areas of south and southeast Asia exposes an estimated population of over a hundred million people to toxic levels of arsenic1. Holocene aquifers are the source of widespread arsenic poisoning across the region2,3. In contrast, Pleistocene sands deposited in this region more than 12,000 years ago mostly do not host groundwater with high levels of arsenic. Pleistocene aquifers are increasingly used as a safe source of drinking water4 and it is therefore important to understand under what conditions low levels of arsenic can be maintained. Here we reconstruct the initial phase of contamination of a Pleistocene aquifer near Hanoi, Vietnam. We demonstrate that changes in groundwater flow conditions and the redox state of the aquifer sands induced by groundwater pumping caused the lateral intrusion of arsenic contamination more than 120 metres from a Holocene aquifer into a previously uncontaminated Pleistocene aquifer. We also find that arsenic adsorbs onto the aquifer sands and that there is a 16–20-fold retardation in the extent of the contamination relative to the reconstructed lateral movement of groundwater over the same period. Our findings suggest that arsenic contamination of Pleistocene aquifers in south and southeast Asia as a consequence of increasing levels of groundwater pumping may have been delayed by the retardation of arsenic transport."

https://openalex.org/W2071794910,"Patients with obstructive lung diseases display abnormal circadian rhythms in lung function. We determined the mechanism whereby environmental tobacco/cigarette smoke (CS) modulates expression of the core clock gene BMAL1, through Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) deacetylase during lung inflammatory and injurious responses. Adult C57BL6/J and various mice mutant for SIRT1 and BMAL1 were exposed to both chronic (6 mo) and acute (3 and 10 d) CS, and we measured the rhythmic expression of clock genes, circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, lung function, and inflammatory and emphysematous responses in the lungs. CS exposure (100-300 mg/m(3) particulates) altered clock gene expression and reduced locomotor activity by disrupting the central and peripheral clocks and increased lung inflammation, causing emphysema in mice. BMAL1 was acetylated and degraded in the lungs of mice exposed to CS and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), compared with lungs of the nonsmoking controls, linking it mechanistically to CS-induced reduction of SIRT1. Targeted deletion of Bmal1 in lung epithelium augmented inflammation in response to CS, which was not attenuated by the selective SIRT1 activator SRT1720 (EC50=0.16 μM) in these mice. Thus, the circadian clock, specifically the enhancer BMAL1 in epithelium, plays a pivotal role, mediated by SIRT1-dependent BMAL1, in the regulation of CS-induced lung inflammatory and injurious responses."

https://openalex.org/W2091267003,"Down's syndrome results from full or partial trisomy of chromosome 21. However, the consequences of the underlying gene-dosage imbalance on adult tissues remain poorly understood. Here we show that in Ts65Dn mice, which are trisomic for 132 genes homologous to genes on human chromosome 21, triplication of Usp16 reduces the self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells and the expansion of mammary epithelial cells, neural progenitors and fibroblasts. In addition, Usp16 is associated with decreased ubiquitination of Cdkn2a and accelerated senescence in Ts65Dn fibroblasts. Usp16 can remove ubiquitin from histone H2A on lysine 119, a critical mark for the maintenance of multiple somatic tissues. Downregulation of Usp16, either by mutation of a single normal Usp16 allele or by short interfering RNAs, largely rescues all of these defects. Furthermore, in human tissues overexpression of USP16 reduces the expansion of normal fibroblasts and postnatal neural progenitors, whereas downregulation of USP16 partially rescues the proliferation defects of Down's syndrome fibroblasts. Taken together, these results suggest that USP16 has an important role in antagonizing the self-renewal and/or senescence pathways in Down's syndrome and could serve as an attractive target to ameliorate some of the associated pathologies."

https://openalex.org/W2011579843,"The dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 5 (NS5) comprises an N-terminal methyltransferase and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. Both enzymatic activities form attractive targets for antiviral development. Available crystal structures of NS5 fragments indicate that residues 263-271 (using the DENV serotype 3 numbering) located between the two globular domains of NS5 could be flexible. We observed that the addition of linker residues to the N-terminal end of the DENV RdRp core domain stabilizes DENV1-4 proteins and improves their de novo polymerase initiation activities by enhancing the turnover of the RNA and NTP substrates. Mutation studies of linker residues also indicate their importance for viral replication. We report the structure at 2.6-Å resolution of an RdRp fragment from DENV3 spanning residues 265-900 that has enhanced catalytic properties compared with the RdRp fragment (residues 272-900) reported previously. This new orthorhombic crystal form (space group P21212) comprises two polymerases molecules arranged as a dimer around a non-crystallographic dyad. The enzyme adopts a closed ""preinitiation"" conformation similar to the one that was captured previously in space group C2221 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that residues 269-271 interact with the RdRp domain and suggests that residues 263-268 of the NS5 protein from DENV3 are the major contributors to the flexibility between its methyltransferase and RdRp domains. Together, these results should inform the screening and development of antiviral inhibitors directed against the DENV RdRp."
https://openalex.org/W2014646261,"TEN1 is a component of the mammalian CTC1-STN1-TEN1 complex. CTC1 and/or STN1 functions in telomere duplex replication, C-strand fill-in, and genome-wide restart of replication following fork stalling. Here we examine the role of human TEN1 and ask whether it also functions as a specialized replication factor. TEN1 depletion causes an increase in multitelomere fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) signals similar to that observed after CTC1 or STN1 depletion. However, TEN1 depletion also results in increased telomere loss. This loss is not accompanied by increased telomere deprotection, recombination, or T-circle release. Thus, it appears that both the multiple telomere signals and telomere loss stem from problems in telomere duplex replication. TEN1 depletion can also affect telomere length, but whether telomeres lengthen or shorten is cell line-dependent. Like CTC1 and STN1, TEN1 is needed for G-overhang processing. Depletion of TEN1 does not effect overhang elongation in mid-S phase, but it delays overhang shortening in late S/G2. These results indicate a role for TEN1 in C-strand fill-in but do not support a direct role in telomerase regulation. Finally, TEN1 depletion causes a decrease in genome-wide replication restart following fork stalling similar to that observed after STN1 depletion. However, anaphase bridge formation is more severe than with CTC1 or STN1 depletion. Our findings indicate that TEN1 likely functions in conjunction with CTC1 and STN1 at the telomere and elsewhere in the genome. They also raise the possibility that TEN1 has additional roles and indicate that TEN1/CTC1-STN1-TEN1 helps solve a wide range of challenges to the replication machinery."

A rigorous assessment of the most readily accessed conformations in solution is required to explain the onset of substrate recognition and collagenolysis. The present study utilized paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to calculate the maximum occurrence (MO) of MMP-1 conformations. The MMP-1 conformations with large MO values (up to 47%) are restricted into a relatively small conformational region. All conformations with high MO values differ largely from the closed MMP-1 structures obtained by x-ray crystallography. The MO of the latter is ∼20%, which represents the upper limit for the presence of this conformation in the ensemble sampled by the protein in solution.

Results: In all high maximum occurrence conformations, the MMP-1 hemopexin-like domain residues reported responsible for binding to the collagen triple-helix are solvent exposed. Conclusion: MMP-1 in solution is poised to interact with collagen and proceed along the steps of collagenolysis. Significance: The maximum occurrence approach can evaluate the predominant domain conformations for numerous multidomain enzymes."

To evolve, however, they must surmount a persistent challenge: ensuring that their constituent cells cooperate with one another rather than “cheat” or compete with each other for resources. Dejosez et al. (p. 1511 , published online 12 September) performed a genome-wide screen in induced pluripotent stem cells to search for genes that promote cell cooperation. A number of genes were identified of which knockdown allowed competitive behavior to dominate. These genes formed a network centered on p53, topoisomerase 1, and olfactory receptors. Thus, a genetic mechanism may promote cooperation in the developing embryo."

In the conventional view of mammalian metabolism, acetyl-CoA is primarily derived by the oxidation of glucose-derived pyruvate in mitochondria. Recent studies have employed isotope tracers to show that in cancer cells grown in hypoxia or with defective mitochondria, a major fraction of acetyl-CoA is produced via another route, reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate (catalyzed by reverse flux through isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH). Here, we employ a quantitative flux model to show that in hypoxia and in cells with defective mitochondria, oxidative IDH flux persists and may exceed the reductive flux. Therefore, IDH flux may not be a net contributor to acetyl-CoA production, although we cannot rule out net reductive IDH flux in some compartments. Instead of producing large amounts of net acetyl-CoA reductively, the cells adapt by reducing their demand for acetyl-CoA by importing rather than synthesizing fatty acids. Thus, fatty acid labeling from glutamine in hypoxia can be explained by spreading of label without net reductive IDH flux.Background: Cancer cells in hypoxia were claimed to rely on reductive isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) for lipogenesis based on increased isotopic labeling of fatty acids from glutamine.Results: Oxidative IDH flux persists in hypoxia, whereas acetyl-CoA demand drops.Conclusion: Reductive IDH flux may not be a net contributor to acetyl-CoA production.Significance: Isotopic label incorporation is indicative of flux, although not necessarily of net flux.

Ferritin is a virtually ubiquitous intracellular iron storage protein. The ferritin archetype consists of a multisubunit protein complex composed of 24 polypeptides, which self-assemble into a hollow cage structure having octahedral (4-3-2) symmetry, with external and internal diameters of ∼12 and 8 nm, respectively (1.Theil E.C.

Excess iron in the blood is stored in ferritin as an insoluble ferric compound that is released in soluble ferrous form during iron starvation to maintain iron homeostasis. Conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in the ferritin protein complex is catalyzed by a ferroxidase center located within the hydrophilic interior of individual subunits. A mineral ferrihydrite, [FeO(OH)]8[FeO(H2PO4)] core is subsequently formed by accumulation of insoluble ferric iron at a nucleation site located within the ferritin cage (3.Takahashi T. Kuyucak S.

Schröder I. Crystal structures of a tetrahedral open pore ferritin from the hyperthermophilic Archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus.Structure. 2005; 13: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the tetrahedral assembly of the molecule, four large triangular pores (∼45 Å diameter) are formed, and the 4-fold symmetric channels typical of octahedral ferritins are absent. The triangular pores of AfFtn provide a potential pathway for the movement of ions and relatively larger molecules to and from the internal cavity and nucleation site. These large pores are dominated by positive electrostatic surface potential at the apices, which extends onto the interior surface of the AfFtn shell and appears to be suitable for interaction with negatively charged species. Despite 70% sequence similarity and extremely high tertiary structure similarity (subunit RMSD = 0.422 Å), the crystal structure of the ferritin from another hypertheromphilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus (PfFtn; Protein Data Bank code 2JD6), reveals that the PfFtn subunits assemble as a closed octahedral shell that is characteristic of ferritins (9.Tatur J. Hagen W.R. Matias P.M. Crystal structure of the ferritin from the hyperthermophilic archaeal anaerobe Pyrococcus furiosus.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 12: 615-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison and structural analysis of AfFtn suggest that two nonconserved amino acid residues (Lys-150 and Arg-151) are likely to play critical roles in the molecule's unique open pore assembly (10.Johnson E. Cascio D. Sawaya M.R. Gingery M. Schröder I. Crystal structures of a tetrahedral open pore ferritin from the hyperthermophilic Archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus.Structure. 2005; 13: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The present study investigates the roles of these two amino acid residues on the unique structural conformation and biophysical characteristics of the AfFtn. A rationally designed AfFtn mutant has been constructed by substitution of the Lys-150 and Arg-151 residues with alanine (K150A/R151A, hereafter referred to as AfFtn-AA). The mutant is designed to test the suggestion that mutation of these key residues will act as a “symmetry switch” and induce the formation of a closed 24-mer structure with typical octahedral symmetry. Altered iron binding and release kinetics should also be observed where the presence or absence of large pores plays a role in the respective molecular mechanism. Here, we report the x-ray crystal structure of AfFtn-AA and examine the self-assembly pattern, iron loading and release relative to those of AfFtn and PfFtn. The AfFtn gene (AF0834) was cloned into NdeI and BamHI sites of a pET-11a expression vector (Novagen). K150A/R151A mutation was constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using duplex primers and the AF0834 gene as the template. The mutations were inserted within primer sequences. The PfFtn gene was cloned into NdeI and SalI restriction sites of the vector pET24a(+) (11.Matias P.M. Tatur J. Carrondo M.A. Hagen W.R. Crystallization and preliminary X-ray characterization of a ferritin from the hyperthermophilic archaeon and anaerobe Pyrococcus furiosus.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmids were stored in Escherichia coli DH5α. For overexpression, E. coli expression strain (BL21(DE3)CodonPlus-RIL) was transformed with the constructs, and protein production was done in LB medium inoculated with an overnight culture. The genes were induced for 4 h by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when A600 was between 0.6 and 0.8. AfFtn and AfFtn-AA were purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography after thermal purification of the cell lysate at 85 °C for 10 min following previously described method (10.Johnson E. Cascio D. Sawaya M.R. Gingery M. Schröder I. Crystal structures of a tetrahedral open pore ferritin from the hyperthermophilic Archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus.Structure. 2005; 13: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Chromatography was performed on an ÄKTA-Explorer FPLC system (GE Healthcare) using HiPrep 16/10 Phenyl FF (high sub) column equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and 500 mm (NH4)2SO4, pH 7.5. The eluted fractions containing the purified protein without (NH4)2SO4 were pooled. PfFtn was produced and purified following previously published method (9.Tatur J. Hagen W.R. Matias P.M. Crystal structure of the ferritin from the hyperthermophilic archaeal anaerobe Pyrococcus furiosus.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 12: 615-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All proteins were stored at 4 °C until use. Protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid method following the manufacturer's protocol using bovine serum albumin as the standard (BCA protein assay kit; Thermo Scientific). Iron was determined spectrophotometrically by adding 20 mm dithionite to convert total iron into the ferrous form in the presence of bathophenanthroline sulfonic acid to form an iron complex following a method described by Bonomi and Pagani (12.Bonomi F. Pagani S. Removal of ferritin-bound iron by DL-dihydrolipoate and DL-dihydrolipoamide.Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, the ferritin samples were denatured by treating with 50 mm HNO3 and mixed with 10 mm bathophenanthroline sulfonic acid, 20 mm dithionite, and 250 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The mixture was incubated overnight, and iron concentration was measured from the absorbance of the complex at 538 nm (ϵ538 = 22.1 mm−1 cm−1). Salt-mediated self-assembly was studied with apoferritin aliquots incubated overnight with different NaCl concentrations (in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5). Molecular sizes of different AfFtn oligomers were determined by size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing NaCl at the same concentration in which the protein was preincubated, and the same buffer was used as mobile phase. Molecular masses of each oligomeric species were determined by comparing their elution volumes with the elution volumes of standard proteins in the same salt concentration. The self-assembly was confirmed from the change of hydrodynamic diameter at different salt concentrations as detected by dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano ZS; Malvern Instruments) technique. For salt-mediated self-assembly, the AfFtn and AfFtn-AA preparations were preincubated overnight in the presence or absence of 600 mm NaCl. The samples were equilibrated for 5 min at 25 °C prior to each measurement. Experimental procedures for AfFtn crystal structure determination and analysis were previously reported (10.Johnson E. Cascio D. Sawaya M.R. Gingery M. Schröder I. Crystal structures of a tetrahedral open pore ferritin from the hyperthermophilic Archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus.Structure. 2005; 13: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, AfFtn crystallization conditions were 27.4% PEG 400, 0.15 m MgCl2, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and a final protein concentration of 13.1 mg/ml. Crystals grew at 25 °C. Crystals of AfFtn-AA grew at 25 °C in 41.6 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 1.04 m 1,6-hexanediol, 31.25% glycerol, 166.7 mm sodium l-tartrate by hanging drop vapor diffusion. The crystals were mounted and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen without any additional cryoprotection. Data were collected at the NE-CAT 24-ID-C Beamline at Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (13.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38555) Google Scholar).

SAXS data were collected on a Rigaku BioSAXS-1000 system configured with a Rigaku FR-E+ Superbright rotating anode generator operating at 2.475 kW. The BioSAXS-1000 system is a two-dimensional Kratky SAXS camera that utilizes a point focus source, a Kratky block for beam collimation, and a Dectris Pilatus 100K detector. The Pilatus 100K is a hybrid pixel array detector that provides high sensitivity and low readout noise, both of which are ideal for measuring the very low SAXS signal provided by most macromolecules in solution. The sample to camera distance is ∼500 mm, and the q range is 0.008–0.65 Å−1. The BioSAXS-1000 beam path was evacuated to reduce absorption of the scattered x-rays by air.

Prior to SAXS measurements, each sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 10,000 rpm. Then ∼20 μl of sample was pipetted into 1.0-mm quartz capillary cells that were sealed at each end with screw caps and O-rings for measurement under vacuum. Both buffer and sample solutions were measured in the same capillary cell for proper buffer subtraction. For each sample and buffer measurement, two scans of 30 min were collected. All data were collected at 4 °C. Following direct beam and sample to detector distance calibration with a silver behenate standard, the SAXS images from the x-ray detector were azimuthally averaged to obtain one-dimensional scattering profiles using SAXSLAb. Duplicate scattering profiles were averaged together, and the averaged buffer profiles were subtracted from the average sample profiles using PRIMUS (23.Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V.

Forkhead transcription factor box A2 (FOXA2) is uniquely expressed in the glandular epithelial (GE) cells of the uterus, and conditional deletion of Foxa2 after birth impedes uterine gland development. An integrative approach was used here to define the FOXA2 cistrome in the murine uterus. Genome-wide mapping of FOXA2 binding sites was combined with transcriptomic analyses of isolated GE and Foxa2-deleted uteri. ChIP-Seq analyses found the number of FOXA2 target genes was substantially greater in the adult (8893) than neonatal uterus (1101). In the neonatal uterus, FOXA2-bound and GE-expressed genes (469) were enriched for developmentally related processes, including cell cycle, cell junction, focal adhesion, and WNT signaling. In the adult uterus, FOXA2-bound and GE-expressed genes (3730) were enriched for functional processes, including metabolic pathways, focal adhesion, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, and WNT signaling. Analysis of the uterine FOXA2 cistrome provides novel insights into mechanisms governing endometrial gland development and function, which are important to understand fundamental aspects of uterine differentiation, regeneration and disease."

In this investigation, we conducted a parallel study of microscopic and macroscopic properties of different-aged collagens from newborn to 2-yr-old rats, to examine the effect of aging on fibrillogenesis, mechanical and contractile properties of reconstituted hydrogels from these collagens seeded with or without fibroblasts. In addition to fibrillogenesis of collagen under the conventional conditions, some fibrillogenesis was conducted alongside a 12-T magnetic field, and gelation rate and AGE content were measured. A nondestructive indentation technique and optical coherence tomography were used to determine the elastic modulus and dimensional changes, respectively. It was revealed that in comparison to younger specimens, older collagens exhibited higher viscosity, faster gelation rates, and a higher AGE-specific fluorescence. Exceptionally, only young collagens formed highly aligned fibrils under magnetic fields. The youngest collagen demonstrated a higher elastic modulus and contraction in comparison to the older collagen. We conclude that aging changes collagen monomer structure, which considerably affects the fibrillogenesis process, the architecture of the resulting collagen fibers and the global network, and the macroscopic properties of the formed constructs."

Until now, the available efficient therapy is liver transplantation, when performed in an early phase of the onset of the disease symptoms. However, transplanted FAP patients have a significantly higher incidence of early hepatic artery thrombosis compared with non-FAP transplanted patients. Because FAP was described as an independent risk factor for early hepatic artery thrombosis, more studies to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in this outcome are of the utmost importance. Knowing that the liver is the major site for TTR production, we investigated the biological effects of TTR proteins in the vasculature and on angiogenesis. In this study, we identified genes differentially expressed in endothelial cells exposed to the WT or V30M tetramer. We found that endothelial cells may acquire different molecular identities when exposed to these proteins, and consequently TTR could regulate angiogenesis. Moreover, we show that V30M decreases endothelial survival by inducing apoptosis, and it inhibits migration.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the muramidase effector Tse3 (Type VI secretion exported 3) can be injected into the periplasm of neighboring bacterial competitors by a Type VI secretion apparatus, eventually leading to cell lysis and death. However, P. aeruginosa protects itself from lysis by expressing immune protein Tsi3 (Type six secretion immunity 3). Here, we report the crystal structure of the Tse3-Tsi3 complex at 1.8 Å resolution, revealing that Tse3 possesses one open accessible, goose-type lysozyme-like domain with peptidoglycan hydrolysis activity. Calcium ions bind specifically in the Tse3 active site and are identified to be crucial for its bacteriolytic activity. In combination with biochemical studies, the structural basis of self-protection mechanism of Tsi3 is also elucidated, thus providing an understanding and new insights into the effectors of Type VI secretion system."
https://openalex.org/W2051321155,"The circadian clock enables organisms to adjust to daily environmental changes and synchronize multiple molecular, biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes accordingly. In mammalian clock work, Bmal1 is the most important core clock gene, which works with another core clock gene Clock to drive the expression of other clock genes and clock-controlled genes. However, the regulation of Bmal1 has not been fully understood. This work was aimed at identifying the positive regulator(s) of Bmal1 transcription. A series of 5' deletion reporter constructs was generated, and binding site mutations of mouse Bmal1 promoter fragments were cloned into pGL3-basic and pGL3(R2.1)-basic plasmids and transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Luciferase activity was either measured 48 h after transfection or recorded for 4 days after serum shock. DNA affinity precipitation assay was used to detect the transcription factors binding to Bmal1 promoter. Small interfering RNA against nuclear factor Y, subunit A (NF-YA) and dominant negative NF-YA were employed to study the role of NF-Y in Bmal1 transcription regulation. Deletion and mutation analyses identified two clusters of CCAAT/GC-boxes at the proximal region of Bmal1 promoter as the activating cis-elements. Bmal1 promoter activity was up-regulated by NF-Y and/or Sp1 and repressed by dominant negative NF-YA or siRNA against NF-YA. The activation of Bmal1 promoter activity by NF-Y and Sp1 was inhibited by Rev-Erbα. DNA affinity precipitation assay showed that NF-Y and Sp1 bound to the two CCAAT/GC clusters of Bmal1 promoter. These results indicate that NF-Y is a functional activator of Bmal1 transcription and it cooperates with Sp1 and Rev-Erbα to generate the daily cycle of Bmal1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2136808059,"Hypoxia has been widely implicated in many pathological conditions, including those associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis. A number of recent studies have implicated hypoxia in the control of vasculogenesis and permeability, the basis for which is not fully understood. Here we examine the transcriptional regulation of angiogenesis and permeability by hypoxia in endothelial cells. Guided by a global profiling approach in cultured endothelial cells, these studies revealed the selective induction of human gravin (protein kinase A anchoring protein 12) by hypoxia. Analysis of the cloned gravin promoter identified a functional hypoxia-responsive region including 2 binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Site-directed mutagenesis identified the most distal HIF-binding site as essential for the induction of gravin by hypoxia. Further studies examining gravin gain and loss of function confirmed strong dependence of gravin in control of microvascular endothelial tube formation, wherein gravin functions as a ""braking"" system for angiogenesis. Additional studies in confluent endothelia revealed that gravin functionally couples to control endothelial barrier function in response to protein kinase A (PKA) agonists. Taken together, these results demonstrate transcriptional coordination of gravin by HIF-1α and amplified PKA-dependent endothelial responses. These findings provide an important link between hypoxia and metabolic conditions associated with inflammation and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2047755916,"The Na(+)-pumping NADH:quinone complex is found in Vibrio cholerae and other marine and pathogenic bacteria. NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase oxidizes NADH and reduces ubiquinone, using the free energy released by this reaction to pump sodium ions across the cell membrane. In a previous report, a conserved aspartic acid residue in the NqrB subunit at position 397, located in the cytosolic face of this protein, was proposed to be involved in the capture of sodium. Here, we studied the role of this residue through the characterization of mutant enzymes in which this aspartic acid was substituted by other residues that change charge and size, such as arginine, serine, lysine, glutamic acid, and cysteine. Our results indicate that NqrB-Asp-397 forms part of one of the at least two sodium-binding sites and that both size and charge at this position are critical for the function of the enzyme. Moreover, we demonstrate that this residue is involved in cation selectivity, has a critical role in the communication between sodium-binding sites, by promoting cooperativity, and controls the electron transfer step involved in sodium uptake (2Fe-2S → FMNC)."

Consistent with these models, two arginine residues (Arg(436) and Arg(440)) within the MA helix of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A (5-HT3A) receptors act singularly as rate-limiting determinants of single-channel conductance (γ). However, there is little conservation in primary amino acid sequences across the cytoplasmic loops of Cys-loop receptors, limiting confidence in the fidelity of this particular aspect of the 5-HT3A receptor model. We probed the majority of residues within the MA helix of the human 5-HT3A subunit using alanine- and arginine-scanning mutagenesis and the substituted cysteine accessibility method to determine their relative influences upon γ. Numerous residues, prominently those at the 435, 436, 439, and 440 positions, were found to markedly influence γ. This approach yielded a functional map of the 5-HT3A receptor portals, which agrees well with the homology model."
https://openalex.org/W1991681466,"The yeast protein Zim17 belongs to a unique class of co-chaperones that maintain the solubility of Hsp70 proteins in mitochondria and plastids of eukaryotic cells. However, little is known about the functional cooperation between Zim17 and mitochondrial Hsp70 proteins in vivo. To analyze the effects of a loss of Zim17 function in the authentic environment, we introduced novel conditional mutations within the ZIM17 gene of the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed a recovery of temperature-sensitive but respiratory competent zim17 mutant cells. On fermentable growth medium, the mutant cells were prone to acquire respiratory deficits and showed a strong aggregation of the mitochondrial Hsp70 Ssq1 together with a concomitant defect in Fe/S protein biogenesis. In contrast, under respiring conditions, the mitochondrial Hsp70s Ssc1 and Ssq1 exhibited only a partial aggregation. We show that the induction of the zim17 mutant phenotype leads to strong import defects for Ssc1-dependent matrix-targeted precursor proteins that correlate with a significantly reduced binding of newly imported substrate proteins to Ssc1. We conclude that Zim17 is not only required for the maintenance of mtHsp70 solubility but also directly assists the functional interaction of mtHsp70 with substrate proteins in a J-type co-chaperone-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2129270891,"Factor VIII (FVIII) consists of a heavy chain (A1(a1)A2(a2)B domains) and light chain ((a3)A3C1C2 domains). To gain insights into a role of the FVIII C domains, we eliminated the C1 domain by replacing it with the homologous C2 domain. FVIII stability of the mutant (FVIIIC2C2) as measured by thermal decay at 55 °C of FVIII activity was markedly reduced (~11-fold), whereas the decay rate of FVIIIa due to A2 subunit dissociation was similar to WT FVIIIa. The binding affinity of FVIIIC2C2 for phospholipid membranes as measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer was modestly lower (~2.8-fold) than that for WT FVIII. Among several anti-FVIII antibodies tested (anti-C1 (GMA8011), anti-C2 (ESH4 and ESH8), and anti-A3 (2D2) antibody), only ESH4 inhibited membrane binding of both WT FVIII and FVIIIC2C2. FVIIIa cofactor activity measured in the presence of each of the above antibodies was examined by FXa generation assays. The activity of WT FVIIIa was inhibited by both GMA8011 and ESH4, whereas the activity of FVIIIC2C2 was inhibited by both the anti-C2 antibodies, ESH4 and ESH8. Interestingly, factor IXa (FIXa) binding affinity for WT FVIIIa was significantly reduced in the presence of GMA8011 (~10-fold), whereas the anti-C2 antibodies reduced FIXa binding affinity of FVIIIC2C2 variant (~4-fold). Together, the reduced stability plus impaired FIXa interaction of FVIIIC2C2 suggest that the C1 domain resides in close proximity to FIXa in the FXase complex and contributes a critical role to FVIII structure and function."

Here we show that Not1 is a WC-interacting protein and is important for maintaining WC levels. The not1 transcript displays a circadian oscillation with a similar phase as frq. Down-regulation of not1 leads to low levels of WC-1 and WC-2 and a delayed circadian phase as a result of increased protein degradation and increased WC activity. Protein purification of Not1 shows that it is part of the Neurospora Ccr4-Not complex. ccr4 is a clock-controlled gene and is regulated directly by the WC complex. Down-regulation of ccr4 results in a phase delay and period lengthening of the clock. Together, our findings suggest that the Ccr4-Not complex participates in the Neurospora clock function by interacting with and regulating the WC complex."
