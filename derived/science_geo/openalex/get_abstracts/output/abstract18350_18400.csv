https://openalex.org/W2044069347,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a multifunctional growth factor that has profound regulatory effects on many developmental and physiological processes. Disruption of the TGF-β1 gene by homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem cells enables mice to be generated that carry the disrupted allele. Animals homozygous for the mutated TGF-β1 allele show no gross developmental abnormalities, but about 20 days after birth they succumb to a wasting syndrome accompanied by a multifocal, mixed inflammatory cell response and tissue necrosis, leading to organ failure and death. TGF-β1-deficient mice may be valuable models for human immune and inflammatory disorders, including autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection and graft versus host reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1523839707,"Fluorescent microscopic examination of fibroblasts cultured with low density lipoprotein (LDL) and progesterone (10 micrograms/ml) for 24 h revealed extensive filipin-cholesterol staining of perinuclear lysosomes. Levels of unesterified cholesterol were 2-fold greater than in fibroblasts cultured with LDL alone. Progesterone strongly blocked cholesteryl ester synthesis. When cellular uptake of LDL was monitored in the presence of 58035, a specific inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, excess unesterified cholesterol was not stored in lysosomes. Discontinuation of LDL uptake in conjunction with progesterone washout markedly reversed the filipin-cholesterol staining of lysosomes. Reversal of the lysosomal cholesterol lipidosis was associated with a rapid burst of cholesteryl ester synthesis and a normalization of the cellular levels of free and esterified cholesterol. In contrast to normal cells, progesterone removal from Niemann-Pick C fibroblasts did not reverse the lysosomal cholesterol accumulation of these mutant cultures. The metabolic precursor of progesterone, pregnenolone, also induced extensive accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes. Other steroids induced less vacuolar cholesterol accumulation in the following decreasing order: corticosterone and testosterone, promegestone, RU 486. The relative inhibition of cellular cholesterol esterification by the steroids paralleled their respective abilities to sequester cholesterol in lysosomes rather than their inhibition of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity in cell-free extracts. The progesterone-related inhibition and restoration of lysosomal cholesterol trafficking is a useful experimental means of studying intracellular cholesterol transport. A particularly important feature of its utility is the facile reversibility of the steroid-induced block. The lysosomal cholesterol lipidosis established with a hydrophobic amine, U18666A, was not as readily reversed."
https://openalex.org/W1484205564,"This study investigates the relationship between human erythrocyte glucose transport protein (GLUT1) oligomeric structure and glucose transporter function. Oligomeric structure was analyzed by hydrodynamic studies of cholate-solubilized GLUT1, by chemical cross-linking studies of membrane-resident GLUT1 and by using conformation-specific antibodies. Transporter function (substrate binding) was analyzed by equilibrium cytochalasin B and D-glucose binding measurements. Erythrocyte-resident glucose transporter is a GLUT1 homotetramer, binds 1 mol of cytochalasin B/2 mol of GLUT1, and presents at least two binding sites to D-glucose. Native structure and function appear to be stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds and are preserved during GLUT1 purification by the omission of reductant. Native structure is independent of in vitro and in vivo membrane GLUT1 density but is transformed to dimeric GLUT1 by alkaline reduction. Dimeric GLUT1 binds 1 mol of cytochalasin B/mol of GLUT1, presents a single population of binding sites to D-glucose, and is obtained upon GLUT1 purification in the presence of reductant. Native structure and function are restored by treatment of dimeric GLUT1 with glutathione-disulfide (K0.5 glutathione disulfide = 29 microM). We propose that native structure is established prior to transporter translocation to the plasma membrane and that intrasubunit disulfide bonds promote cooperative subunit interactions that stabilize transporter structure and function."

https://openalex.org/W1670681606,"Membrane organella are transported bidirectionally in cells, and the axonal transport system has provided an ideal model system for studying this bidirectional transport. Kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein were identified as candidates for the motor molecules of fast axonal transport, which transport organella along microtubules anterogradely and retrogradely. However, the mechanism that controls this bidirectional transport is unknown. Our previous work revealed that kinesin in axons was associated abundantly with anterogradely transported membranous organella, most of which are believed to be precursors of synaptic vesicles and axonal plasma membranes, while the fractions bound to retrogradely transported ones were very small (Hirokawa, N., Sato-Yoshitake, R., Kobayashi, N., Pfister, K. K., Bloom, G. S., and Brady, S. T. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 114, 295-302). Here we demonstrated in vitro that the binding of kinesin to synaptic vesicles was concentration-dependent and saturable and could be released by high salt concentration. When kinesin was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, its binding to symaptic vesicles was significantly reduced. By motility assay and by statistical analysis using electron microscopy, we further revealed that synaptic vesicles preincubated with phosphorylated kinesin associated less frequently with microtubules than synaptic vesicles preincubated with unphosphorylated kinesin. The phosphorylation of kinesin should therefore play an essential role in regulating the direction of fast axonal transport by inhibiting its binding to membrane organella, thus releasing it from membrane organella at nerve terminals."

https://openalex.org/W1493512966,"In the present paper we demonstrate that retinol-retinol-binding protein and chylomicron remnant retinyl esters in concentrations normally found in human plasma inhibit growth of normal human B lymphocytes. Physiological concentrations of retinoic acid (about 30 nM) were less active than physiological concentrations of retinol (about 3 microM). Pharmacological concentrations of retinol and retinoic acid were more active than the concentrations normally found in plasma. Retinol (3 microM) inhibited anti-IgM-mediated DNA synthesis as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake at 72 h by 78%. Furthermore, we found that the cells were blocked in the mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, neither MYC up-regulation measured at 3 h nor the expression of the early activation antigen 4F2 was reduced by retinol, whereas the late activation markers (transferrin receptor expression and actinomycin D staining at 48 h of stimulation) were markedly inhibited. Retinol reduced the interleukin 6 production induced by anti-IgM and interleukin 4 after 48 h, whereas the induction of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor by O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and ionomycin was less affected. We also noted that the retinoids reduced the formation of plaque-forming cells (i.e. Ig synthesis). These data imply that vitamin A present in human plasma is a normal modulator of B cell function."

https://openalex.org/W1593968937,"A mismatch-binding protein has been purified an estimated 4500-fold from HeLa nuclear extracts using four different chromatographic steps. Two polypeptides of apparent molecular weight of 160,000 and 100,000 were present in the final affinity-purified fraction as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Partial proteolytic clipping of the protein-DNA complexes visualized after UV treatment indicated that the 100-kDa polypeptide is most likely a degradation product of the 160-kDa polypeptide. UV cross-linking experiments have shown that both these polypeptides bind specifically to oligonucleotide duplexes containing G/T mismatches. Direct DNA binding studies and band-shift competition assays showed that although the mismatch-binding protein binds with highest affinity to oligonucleotides containing G/T mismatches, it is also capable of binding to oligonucleotides containing other mispairs. The purified protein has an associated Mg(2+)-dependent ATPase activity, which is markedly enhanced in the presence of single-stranded DNA. A helicase capable of unwinding a 34-mer oligonucleotide, annealed to a complementary sequence in single-stranded M13, also copurified with the mismatch-binding protein. This reaction occurs in an ATP- and magnesium-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W1573205528,"The mechanism of proteolytic breakdown of the beta A4-amyloid protein precursor (APP) has attracted much attention because of its relevance for Alzheimer's disease. Apart from the pathological role of APP in the amyloidogenesis, many efforts have been made to identify the functional significance of this widely expressed protein in various biological processes. Employing biochemical techniques, we demonstrate that APP is involved in the initiation of the immune response. Upon stimulation, it is expressed by the major functional types of T-lymphocytes, i.e. CD4+ and CD8+ cells. As was demonstrated for the CD4+ lymphoid cell line H9, APP is predominantly secreted. The remaining COOH-terminal fragments generated upon secretion were highly unstable. Of the APP produced by immunocompetent cells, considerable amounts were shown to be leukocyte-derived APP (L-APP). In addition, we were able to identify the KPI-containing L-APP isoform, L-APP733, as the major expressed L-APP isoform in immunocompetent cells, including rat microglial cells and astrocytes. The L-APP expression pattern of these cells showed high similarity. These findings seem to be indicative of an important function of APP within the immune system. Therefore, APP may be involved in various immunopathogenic conditions of the periphery and in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1544955002,"A large proteoglycan (365 kDa), identified with monoclonal antibodies raised against chondroitin sulfate, was isolated from human brain. The isolation required anion-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration through a Sephacryl S-500 column. The proteoglycan bound specifically to [3H]hyaluronate (HA). The binding was not reduced by high salt concentrations (up to 4 M) and was inhibited at low pH (< 4.0). The binding was inhibited by the octamer and decamer (but not the hexamer) oligosaccharides of HA. Limited proteolysis of the proteoglycan gave rise to a relatively stable polypeptide (80 kDa). The amino-terminal sequence of the 80-kDa polypeptide was identical to the cDNA-derived amino-terminal sequence of versican, a large human fibroblast proteoglycan. A monoclonal antibody raised against bovine proteoglycans and recognizing the versican core protein reacted by immunoblotting with the proteoglycan isolated from human brain. The antibody was used to localize the proteoglycan in acetone-fixed cryostat sections of bovine spinal cord. The localization of the proteoglycan in the central nervous system was identical to that previously reported for glial hyaluronate-binding protein (GHAP), a 60-kDa glycoprotein of the brain extracellular matrix (ECM). However, a major difference was observed with respect to the sensitivity of the two antigens to hyaluronidase. As previously reported, GHAP was released from the tissue by hyaluronidase digestion, whereas the proteoglycan persisted under these conditions. We conclude that the protein-hyaluronate aggregates in brain ECM contain both GHAP and versican, that GHAP is only retained in the ECM by its interaction with hyaluronate, and that the proteoglycan is anchored in some other manner and probably connects cell surfaces with the ECM since it was not released by hyaluronidase digestion."

https://openalex.org/W1503574439,"Cytoplasmic Ca2+ is a major regulator of exocytosis in secretory cells; however, the Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms that trigger secretion have not been elucidated. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been proposed to be an important Ca(2+)-dependent component of this regulation; however, the effects of this enzyme on the exocytotic apparatus have not been identified. We developed a PKC-deficient, semi-intact PC12 cell system in which direct stimulatory effects of purified PKC on Ca(2+)-dependent norepinephrine secretion were studied. The reconstitution of optimal Ca(2+)-activated norepinephrine secretion by semi-intact PC12 cells required the addition of MgATP and cytosolic proteins. PKC-deficient cytosol exhibited reduced reconstituting activity that was fully restored by the addition of purified PKC. The restoration of Ca(2+)-dependent norepinephrine secretion by PKC required the presence of other proteins in the cytosol, in particular, a high molecular weight protein. The high molecular weight protein was identified as p145, a recently characterized 145-kDa brain protein. The addition of PKC enhanced phosphorylation of p145 under conditions of fully reconstituted Ca(2+)-activated norepinephrine secretion. The results indicate that 1) PKC is neither necessary nor sufficient for Ca(2+)-activated secretion, whereas other cytosolic proteins are required; and 2) the stimulation of Ca(2+)-activated secretion by PKC is dependent upon cytosolic proteins such as p145 and may be largely mediated through the phosphorylation of p145."

https://openalex.org/W1581552787,"Two biochemically distinct systems, the high affinity folate receptor and the lower affinity reduced-folate carrier, have each been implicated in mediating the transport of folates and antifolates into cells. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that methotrexate accumulation into wild type (WT) ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells involves a system with characteristics of the reduced-folate carrier, that this system is deficient in methotrexate resistant (MTXR) ZR-75-1 cells in which methotrexate transport is undetectable and that neither breast cancer cell line expresses folate receptors. In this report we examined the possible interaction of the reduced-folate carrier with folate receptors by stably transfecting both WT ZR-75-1 and MTXR ZR-75-1 cells with an expression vector containing a folate receptor cDNA. Clones of stably transfected MTXR ZR-75-1 and WT ZR-75-1 cells expressing comparable levels of folate receptors were studied and compared to the nontransfected cell lines. Although nontransfected WT and MTXR ZR-75-1 cell lines require concentrations > or = 100 nM folic acid for growth, the expression of folate receptors in transfected WT and MTXR ZR-75-1 cells permitted the growth of both cell lines in low concentrations (1 nM) of folic acid. While the defect in the reduced-folate carrier system in MTXR ZR-75-1 cells inhibits their growth in medium containing low concentrations of folinic acid (< or = 1 microM), MTXR ZR-75-1 cells expressing folate receptors display uninhibited growth in 1 nM folinic acid. The accumulation of folic acid, folinic acid, and methotrexate is enhanced in folate receptor-transfected WT ZR-75-1 cells and MTXR ZR-75-1 cells. Furthermore, the accumulation of folates and antifolate was similar in both transfected WT and MTXR ZR-75-1 cell lines that expressed folate receptors. This suggests that alterations in the reduced-folate carrier do not affect folate receptor function. We also examined the effect of folate receptor expression on the sensitivity of WT and MTXR ZR-75-1 cells to methotrexate and to the lipophillic antifolate trimetrexate. Increased folate receptor expression decreased the sensitivity of WT ZR-75-1 cells toward the antifolate trimetrexate, presumably through increased uptake of reduced folates. Although the expression of the folate receptor enhanced the growth of both cell lines in low folate concentrations, it did not affect the sensitivity of either WT or MTXR ZR-75-1 cells to methotrexate."
https://openalex.org/W2148576564,"It is postulated that basic residues in the regulatory region of myosin light chain kinase are important for conferring autoinhibition by binding to the catalytic core. To investigate this proposal, 10 basic amino acids within the regulatory region of rabbit smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (Lys961-Lys979) were replaced either singularly or in combination with acidic or nonpolar residues by site-directed mutagenesis. All active mutant kinases were dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin for catalytic activity. None of the mutants was active in the absence of Ca2+/calmodulin, suggesting that the autoinhibitory region has not been defined completely. Charge reversal mutants at Arg974, Arg975, and Lys976 resulted in loss of high affinity binding of calmodulin and increased the concentration of calmodulin required for half-maximal activation (KCaM). The charge reversal mutant at Lys979 also increased KCaM but to a lesser extent. Charge reversal mutants at Lys965 and Arg967 resulted in an inactive myosin light chain kinase that could not be proteolytically activated. When these residues were mutated to Ala, the expressed kinase was dependent upon Ca2+/calmodulin for activity and exhibited a decrease in KCaM. Charge reversal mutants in Lys961 and Lys962 also had decreased KCaM values. These basic residues amino-terminal of the calmodulin binding domain may play an important role in the activation of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1605553518,"Tubulins are abundant structural proteins in the Leishmania parasite, and tubulin genes are examples of highly expressed genes, which are present in multiple copies arranged in tandem repeats. Functional analysis of such multicopy genes using genetic manipulation has not yet been possible. Here we describe a method for creating deletions of alpha-tubulin gene clusters by targeted gene replacement and report the isolation of null/+ mutants deleted for either of the two allelic tubulin clusters. We also report null/null mutants in which both clusters have been deleted from their chromosomal loci and in which alpha-tubulin genes are present as episomal elements. Characterization of tubulin mRNA expression in these mutants indicated a posttranscriptional up-regulation of alpha-tubulin mRNA stability in null/+ mutants which contained only one-third the normal number of alpha-tubulin genes. A parallel increase in beta-tubulin mRNA levels indicated coordinate regulation of tubulin mRNA in Leishmania."
https://openalex.org/W1580579112,"The binding of natural killer (NK) cells to either susceptible tumor cells or antibody-coated targets results in rapid activation of phospholipase C (PLC) in NK cells. PLC activation generates inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol as second messengers, which, in turn, increase intracellular free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and protein kinase C (PKC) activity, respectively. These proximal signals initiate a cascade of as yet undefined biochemical events, leading eventually to the exocytosis of preformed cytotoxic granules. To investigate the signal transduction pathways involved in granule exocytosis, we utilized streptolysin-O-permeabilized human NK cells as our experimental model. Our initial studies indicated that the separate activation of either PKC (using the phorbol ester, PMA) or G protein-dependent pathways (using guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S)) stimulated granule exocytosis in a time-, concentration-, and Ca(2+)-dependent manner. PMA-stimulated exocytosis was inhibited by staurosporine or a PKC pseudosubstrate antagonist peptide, but was not affected by GDP. In contrast, GTP gamma S-stimulated exocytosis was effectively inhibited by GDP, but not by staurosporine or the PKC pseudosubstrate antagonist. These observations suggest that NK cell exocytosis can be stimulated by at least two separate pathways; one involving PKC and the other involving a G protein. However, co-stimulation with PMA and GTP gamma S synergistically enhanced exocytosis, suggesting that even though the two exocytotic pathways were biochemically distinct, cross-talk between the two pathways may potently influence the exocytotic process. These results define a regulatory role for PKC- and G protein-dependent pathways during granule exocytosis from NK cells."
https://openalex.org/W1506330385,"Galactosylceramide sulfotransferase (EC 2.8.2.11) catalyzes the biosynthesis of sulfatide from galactocerebroside and adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS). This enzyme is developmentally controlled, reaching a maximum activity in the brains of mice corresponding to that of maximum myelination. The product, sulfatide, is an important component of myelin. This transferase from mouse brain has been purified 2600-fold using a combination of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate- and ATP-ligated columns. The purified enzyme yielded a single band following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent M(r) of 31,000. The entire purification procedure can be completed in 1 day. The pH optimum for the enzyme is 7.0. The Km for PAPS is 1.2 x 10(-6) M, and the Km for cerebroside is 2.6 x 10(-5) M. Cerebroside concentrations > 80 pmol/ml are inhibitory.

https://openalex.org/W1537987417,"Abstract The electrophoretic properties of the molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein component of nitrogenase and an iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco)-reactivatable apoMoFe protein from Klebsiella pneumoniae were examined under anaerobic ([O2] < 5 ppm), nondenaturing conditions. In wild type K. pneumoniae extracts, two immunoreactive species migrating more slowly than purified MoFe protein were detected using anti-MoFe protein antibodies. The uppermost species comigrates with the apoMoFe protein produced by a K. pneumoniae mutant unable to synthesize FeMoco (UN106) and by Escherichia coli harboring the plasmids pVL222+pVL15 (nifHDKTYUSWZM+A). In vitro FeMoco titration of the UN106 and pVL222+pVL15 extracts increases the electrophoretic mobility of the apoMoFe protein to that of purified MoFe protein in a two-step process giving rise to a species of intermediate mobility between the apo- and holoMoFe proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that a 20-kDa peptide is associated with the apoMoFe protein and with the intermediate species, but not with the holoMoFe protein. N-terminal sequencing identified this associated peptide as the nifY gene product, which we propose is acting as a temporary enforcer of the apoMoFe protein structure required for cofactor binding that is released upon FeMoco activation. This FeMoco-induced mobility shift was used to characterize the mutant apoMoFe proteins produced in E. coli as a result of deleting the various nitrogen fixation (nif) genes from the plasmid pVL222. E. coli extracts bearing plasmids deleted in nifH, nifS, nifTYUM, or nifWZM exhibit less than 10% of the apoMoFe protein activity of derepressed UN106 and contain an immunoreactive species whose electrophoretic mobility is increased upon addition of FeMoco from that of apoMoFe protein to that of holoMoFe protein in a single step. Anaerobic nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of 55Fe-labeled E. coli extracts followed by autoradiography showed that these inactive apoMoFe species do not contain iron, indicating that the P-clusters are absent. We therefore propose that NifH, S, U, W, Z, and M are all involved, to varying degrees, in P-cluster assembly. In addition, the presence of the P-clusters does appear to be necessary for the two-step FeMoco activation of the apoMoFe protein to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1507867989,"Previous studies have located transcriptional enhancer elements within both the intron and 3'-region of the mouse kappa immunoglobulin gene. Here we address the role of these two enhancers in specifying gene activity and specific chromatin structures. MOPC41 kappa gene constructs, either intact or containing deletions of one or both enhancers, were introduced into S194 mouse plasmacytoma cells for transient and stable expression studies. Transient expression assays revealed that the basal level expression exhibited by enhancerless constructs was activated 100-200-fold by the two enhancers together in a synergistic fashion. A similar trend was observed when both enhancers were present in stably integrated constructs, although the synergy was less pronounced. Analysis of DNase I hypersensitive sites in the chromatin revealed that stably integrated constructs established hypersensitive sites about the enhancer sequences. These sites demonstrated the same nuclease susceptibility as those associated with the endogenous gene(s), and their establishment was independent of the presence of the other enhancer. Thus, although both enhancers are required for maximal gene expression, the elements act independently in determining specific chromatin structures."
https://openalex.org/W1528386493,"Abstract We have determined the structural organization of the dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) gene of the human branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. The single copy E2 gene spans approximately 68 kilobases of genomic DNA. The complete coding region consisting of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions, the mitochondrial targeting sequence (61 amino acids), and the mature E2 sequence (421 amino acids) are encoded by 11 exons ranging from 62 to 2239 base pairs. All the donor and acceptor splice sites conform to the gt-ag rule. Sequence analysis of the promoter-regulatory region showed the presence of a CAAT box-like sequence 537 bases upstream of the transcription initiation site. The TATA box-like sequence is absent. Also located in this region are sequences resembling glucocorticoid-responsive and cAMP-responsive elements, fat-specific elements, and Sp1- and AP-2-binding sites. Several sets of direct and inverted repeats are also present. Promoter assays using human hepatoma cells (Hep-G2) and Swiss mouse preadipocytes (3T3-L1) showed that a 4.1-kilobase PstI fragment upstream of the transcription start site confers high expression of the luciferase reporter gene. Moreover, an intronless E2 pseudogene was isolated. It corresponds to the complete mitochondrial presequence and the lipoyl-bearing domain that are encoded by exons I through IV of the functional E2 gene. However, the E2 pseudogene contains multiple base changes, deletions, and insertions, and is flanked by short direct repeats. The data indicate that the E2 pseudogene is a retroposon."

https://openalex.org/W1607464154,"We have photolyzed cell-free translation systems synthesizing beta-lactamase with 254-nm ultraviolet light. In the presence of canine rough microsomes (RM), incomplete chains of beta-lactamase became enriched relative to the full-length molecule in pellet fractions obtained following photolysis and alkaline carbonate extraction. In addition, high molecular weight aggregates were present on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and occurred only when translocation-competent microsomal membranes were used in translation mixtures. The incomplete chains and high molecular weight aggregates were not obtained when RM were inactivated by reaction with N-ethylmaleimide. The incomplete chains did not bind to concanavalin A-Sepharose, indicating that they had not sedimented as a result of being covalently cross-linked to membrane glycoproteins. Both photolysis and alkaline carbonate extraction were required to produce the results. Nascent peptides that were not exposed to alkaline carbonate following photolysis did not appear as high molecular weight bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The high molecular weight aggregates therefore represent denatured protein complexes that contain nascent peptides and microsomal translocon proteins. The results suggest that the translocon is a large proteinaceous complex and that at least a portion of it, when denatured, migrates at a molecular mass of approximately 205 kDa."
